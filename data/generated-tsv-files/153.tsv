O	Of
O	Merlin
O	and
O	how
O	he
O	served
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	something
O	has
O	been
O	already
O	shown
O	.
O	Loyal
O	he
O	was
O	ever
O	to
O	Uther
O	Pendragon
O	and
O	to
O	his
O	son
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	the
O	latter
O	especially
O	he
O	wrought
O	great
O	marvels
O	.
O	He
O	brought
O	the
O	king
O	to
O	his
O	rights
O	;
O	he
O	made
O	him
O	his
O	ships
O	;
O	and
O	some
O	say
O	that
O	Camelot
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	splendid
O	halls
O	,
O	where
O	Arthur
O	would
O	gather
O	his
O	knights
O	around
O	him
O	at
O	the
O	great
O	festivals
O	of
O	the
O	year
O	,
O	at
O	Christmas
O	,
O	at
O	Easter
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	Pentecost
O	,
O	was
O	raised
O	by
O	his
O	magic
O	,
O	without
O	human
O	toil
O	.
O	Bleise
O	,
O	the
O	aged
O	magician
O	who
O	dwelt
O	in
O	Northumberland
O	and
O	recorded
O	the
O	great
O	deeds
O	of
O	Arthur
O	and
O	his
O	knights
O	,
O	had
O	been
O	Merlin
O	'
O	s
O	master
O	in
O	magic
O	;
O	but
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	in
O	time
O	that
O	Merlin
O	far
O	excelled
O	him
O	in
O	skill
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	his
O	enemies
O	declared
O	no
O	mortal
O	was
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	him
O	devil
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	on
O	a
O	certain
O	time
O	,
O	Merlin
O	said
O	to
O	Arthur
O	:
O	``
O	The
O	time
O	draws
O	near
O	when
O	ye
O	shall
O	miss
O	me
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	shall
O	go
O	down
O	alive
O	into
O	the
O	earth
O	;
O	and
O	it
O	shall
O	be
O	that
O	gladly
O	would
O	ye
O	give
O	your
O	lands
O	to
O	have
O	me
O	again
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	Arthur
O	was
O	grieved
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Since
O	ye
O	know
O	your
O	danger
O	,
O	use
O	your
O	craft
O	to
O	avoid
O	it
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	Merlin
O	answered
O	:
O	``
O	That
O	may
O	not
O	be
O	.
O	``
O	Now
O	there
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	court
O	,
O	a
O	damsel
O	of
O	the
O	Lady
O	of
O	the
O	Lake
O	--
O	her
O	whose
O	skill
O	in
O	magic
O	,
O	some
O	say
O	,
O	was
O	greater
O	than
O	Merlin
O	'
O	s
O	own
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	damsel
O	'
O	s
O	name
O	was
O	Vivien
O	.
O	She
O	set
O	herself
O	to
O	learn
O	the
O	secrets
O	of
O	Merlin
O	'
O	s
O	art
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	ever
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	tending
O	upon
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	gentleness
O	and
O	tender
O	service
O	,
O	winning
O	her
O	way
O	to
O	his
O	heart
O	;
O	but
O	all
O	was
O	a
O	pretence
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	weary
O	of
O	him
O	and
O	sought
O	only
O	his
O	ruin
O	,
O	thinking
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	fame
O	for
O	her
O	,
O	by
O	any
O	means
O	whatsoever
O	,
O	to
O	enslave
O	the
O	greatest
O	wizard
O	of
O	his
O	age
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	she
O	persuaded
O	him
O	to
O	pass
O	with
O	her
O	over
O	seas
O	into
O	King
O	Ban
O	'
O	s
O	land
O	of
O	Benwick
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	he
O	showed
O	her
O	a
O	wondrous
O	rock
O	formed
O	by
O	magic
O	art
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	begged
O	him
O	to
O	enter
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	the
O	better
O	to
O	declare
O	to
O	her
O	its
O	wonders
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	once
O	he
O	was
O	within
O	,
O	by
O	a
O	charm
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	learned
O	from
O	Merlin
O	'
O	s
O	self
O	,
O	she
O	caused
O	the
O	rock
O	to
O	shut
O	down
O	that
O	never
O	again
O	might
O	he
O	come
O	forth
O	.
O	Thus
O	was
O	Merlin
O	'
O	s
O	prophecy
O	fulfilled
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	go
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	earth
O	alive
O	.
O	Much
O	they
O	marvelled
O	in
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	court
O	what
O	had
O	become
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	magician
O	,
O	till
O	on
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	there
O	rode
O	past
O	the
O	stone
O	a
O	certain
O	Knight
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	and
O	heard
O	Merlin
O	lamenting
O	his
O	sad
O	fate
O	.
O	The
O	knight
O	would
O	have
O	striven
O	to
O	raise
O	the
O	mighty
O	stone
O	,
O	but
O	Merlin
O	bade
O	him
O	not
O	waste
O	his
O	labor
O	,
O	since
O	none
O	might
O	release
O	him
O	save
O	her
O	who
O	had
O	imprisoned
O	him
O	there
O	.
O	Thus
O	Merlin
O	passed
O	from
O	the
O	world
O	through
O	the
O	treachery
O	of
O	a
O	damsel
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	Arthur
O	was
O	without
O	aid
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	when
O	his
O	doom
O	came
O	upon
O	him
O	.
