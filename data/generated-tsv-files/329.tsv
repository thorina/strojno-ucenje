O	on
O	the

O	of

O	.
O	His

O	came
O	every

O	to
O	the

O	the

O	the

O	a
O	woman

O	,
O	but

O	,
O	whose
O	understanding
O	appeared
O	at
O	most
O	times
O	to

O	asleep
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	stony
O	terror
O	of
O	whose
O	countenance
O	often
O	frightened
O	the
O	bairns
O	more
O	than
O	their
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	shrill
O	tongue
O	and

O	.
O	Elspeth
O	seldom
O	spoke
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	done
O	little
O	for
O	many
O	years
O	except
O	twirl
O	the

O	in

O	Few

O	to

O	``
O	far
O	from

O	,
O	``
O	and
O	certainly
O	she
O	knew
O	more

O	of
O	Glenallan
O	than
O	it

O	when

O	among

O	Such
O	had
O	been
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	family
O	from
O	ancient
O	times
O	--
O	indeed
O	,

O	since
O	the

O	For
O	the

O	were
O	Catholics
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	had
O	long
O	been
O	laws
O	in

O	against
O	the
O	holding
O	of
O	popish
O	ceremonials
O	even
O	on
O	an

O	so

O	of
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	her
O	ancient
O	mistress
O	,
O	coming
O	at
O	last
O	to
O	the
O	ears
O	of
O	old
O	Elspeth
O	,
O	took
O	such
O	hold
O	upon
O	her
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	rest
O	till
O	she

O	off

O	to
O	the

O	,
O	at
O	Glenallan
O	House
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	ring
O	for
O	a
O	token
O	and
O	the
O	message
O	that
O	Elspeth
O	of
O	the
O	Craigburnfoot
O	must
O	see
O	him
O	before
O	she
O	died
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	,
O	Edie
O	was
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	a
O	secret
O	on
O	her
O	soul
O	,
O	without

O	which
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	hope

O	in
O	peace
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	Edie
O	set
O	off
O	for
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	Glenallan
O	,
O	taking
O	the
O	ring
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	very
O	little
O	hope
O	of
O	finding
O	his
O	way
O	into
O	the
O	Earl
O	'
O	s
O	presence
O	;
O	for
O	Lord
O	Glenallan
O	had
O	been
O	long
O	completely
O	withdrawn
O	from
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	His
O	mother
O	was
O	Countess
O	in
O	her
O	own
O	right
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	long
O	as
O	she
O	lived
O	,
O	her
O	son
O	had
O	been
O	wholly

O	In

O	some

O	,
O	pressed
O	sore
O	upon
O	his
O	mind
O	,
O	and
O	being
O	a
O	strict
O	Catholic
O	he
O	passed
O	his
O	time
O	in
O	penance
O	and
O	prayer
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	soldier
O	,
O	one
O	Francie
O	Macraw
O	,

O	been
O	his

O	at

O	win
O	a
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	Earl
O	'
O	s
O	presence
O	--
O	though
O	the
O	priests
O	who
O	were
O	about
O	his
O	person
O	evidently
O	tried
O	to
O	keep
O	everything
O	connected
O	with
O	the
O	outer
O	world
O	from
O	his
O	knowledge
O	.
O	The
O	Earl
O	,
O	a
O	tall
O	,
O	haggard
O	,
O	gloomy
O	man
O	,
O	whose
O	age
O	seemed
O	twice
O	what
O	it
O	really
O	was
O	,
O	stood
O	holding
O	the
O	token
O	ring
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	he
O	took
O	Edie
O	for
O	a
O	father
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	church
O	,
O	and
O	demanded
O	if
O	any
O	further
O	penance
O	were
O	necessary
O	to
O	atone
O	for
O	his
O	sin
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	Edie
O	declared
O	his
O	message
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	very
O	first
O	mention
O	of
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Elspeth
O	of
O	the
O	Craigburnfoot
O	,
O	the
O	Earl
O	'
O	s
O	cheek
O	became
O	even
O	more
O	deathlike
O	than
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	at
O	Edie
O	'
O	s
O	entrance
O	.
O	``
O	Ah
O	,

O	he
O	said

O	The
O	day
O	of
O	Lord
O	Glenallan
O	'

O	the
O	cottage

O	dwelt
O	old
O	Elspeth
O	of
O	the
O	Craigburnfoot
O	seemed
O	at
O	first
O	ill
O	timed
O	.
O	That
O	very
O	day
O	Steenie
O	Mucklebackit
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	,
O	the
O	gallant
O	,
O	the
O	handsome
O	eldest
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	had
O	been
O	carried
O	to

O	.
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	drowned
O	while
O	at
O	the
O	fishing
O	,
O	though
O	his
O	father
O	had
O	risked
O	his
O	life
O	in
O	vain
O	to
O	save
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	family
O	had
O	now
O	returned
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	sitting
O	alone
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	benumbing
O	shock
O	of
O	their
O	grief
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	some
O	time
O	before
O	the
O	Earl
O	could
O	make
O	good
O	his
O	entrance
O	into
O	the
O	cottage
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	still
O	longer

O	Elspeth

O	veil
O	which
O	had
O	fallen

O	seemed
O	for
O	a
O	while
O	to
O	be
O	drawn
O	aside
O	.
O	She
O	spoke
O	like

O	of
O	an

O	far
O	superior

O	her
O	position
O	,

O	Her

O	the
O	Earl

O	the

O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	stigma
O	which
O	rested
O	upon

O	,
O	it
O	was
O	little

O	should
O	wish
O	to
O	have
O	no
O	dealings
O	with

O	.
O	But
O	the
O	Earl

O	For
O	the

O	,
O	also
O	,
O	he
O	knew
O	that

O	He
O	desired
O	above

O	a
O	true

O	.
O	In

O	The

O	,
O	caught

O	The

O	was
O	soon
O	awake
O	and
O	alive
O	with
O	the
O	tidings
O	of
O	invasion
O	.
O	From
O	far
O	and
O	near
O	the
O	Lowland
O	burghers
O	,
O	the
O	country
O	lairds
O	,
O	the
O	Highland
O	chiefs
O	and
O	clans
O	responded
O	to
O	the
O	summons
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	been
O	drilling
O	for
O	long
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	in
O	the
O	dead
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	they
O	marched
O	with
O	speed

O	,
O	eager
O	to

O	Last
O	of

O	the

O	Presently
O	also
O	Captain
O	Wardour
O	arrived
O	in
O	a
O	carriage
O	drawn

O	at

O	clansmen
O	--
O	all
O	were
O	there
O	awaiting
O	the
O	great
O	man
O	.
O	What
O	was
O	the
O	astonishment
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	Fairport
O	,
O	and
O	especially
O	of
O	the
O	Antiquary
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	descend
O	from
O	the
O	open
O	door
O	of
O	the

O	,
O	--
O	who
O	but
O	the
O	quiet
O	Mr
O	.
O	Lovel
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	brought
O	with
O	him
O	the
O	news
O	that
O	the
O	alarm
O	of
O	invasion
O	was
O	false
O	.
O	The
O	beacon
O	which
O	Caxon
O	had
O	seen
O	was
O	only
O	the
O	burning
O	of
O	the
O	mining
O	machinery
O	in
O	Glen
O	Withershins
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	ordered
O	by
O	Oldbuck
O	and
O	Sir
O	Arthur
O	to
O	make
O	a

O	end
O	of

O	plots
O	and
O	deceits
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	yet
O	further
O	and
O	more
O	interesting
O	private
O	news
O	.
O	The
O	proofs
O	that
O	Lovel
O	was
O	indeed
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	Earl
O	of
O	Glenallan
O	were
O	found
O	to
O	be
O	overwhelming
O	.
O	His
O	heirship
O	to
O	the
O	title
O	had
O	been
O	fully
O	made
O	out
O	.
O	The
O	chaplain
O	who
O	had
O	performed
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	wedding
O	had
O	returned
O	from
O	abroad
O	,
O	exiled
O	by
O	the
O	French
O	Revolution
O	.
O	The
O	witnesses
O	also
O	had
O	been
O	found
O	.
O	Most
O	decisive
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	among
O	the
O	papers
O	of
O	the
O	Earl
O	'
O	s
O	late
O	brother
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	discovered
O	a
O	duly
O	authenticated
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	carrying
O	off
O	the
O	child
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	how
O	he
O	had
O	had
O	him
O	educated
O	and
O	pushed
O	on
O	in
O	the
O	army
O	.
O	So
O	that
O	very
O	night
O	the
O	Antiquary
O	enjoyed
O	in
O	some
O	degree
O	the
O	crowning
O	pleasure
O	of
O	his
O	whole
O	life
O	,
O	in
O	bringing
O	together
O	father
O	and
O	son
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	.
O	That
O	is
O	,
O	if
O	the
O	marriage
O	which
O	took
O	place
O	soon
O	after
O	between
O	his
O	young
O	friend

O	(

O	Geraldin
O	)
O	and
O	Miss
O	Isabella
O	Wardour
O	of
O	Knockwinnock
O	Castle
O	did
O	not
O	turn
O	out
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	yet
O	greater
O	pleasure
O	.
O	Old
O	Edie
O	still
O	travels
O	from
O	farm
O	to
O	farm
O	,
O	but
O	mostly
O	now
O	confines
O	himself
O	to
O	the
O	short
O	round
O	between
O	Monkbarns
O	and
O	Knockwinnock
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	reported
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	means
O	soon
O	to
O	settle
O	with
O	old
O	Caxon
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	since
O	the
O	marriage
O	of
O	his
O	daughter
O	to
O	Lieutenant
O	Taffril

O	has
O	been
O	given

O	I
O	PERSEUS
O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	were
O	two
O	princes
O	who
O	were
O	twins
O	.
O	Their
O	names
O	were
O	Acrisius
O	and
O	Proetus
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	pleasant
O	vale
O	of
O	Argos
O	,
O	far
O	away
O	in
O	Hellas
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	fruitful
O	meadows
O	and
O	vineyards
O	,
O	sheep
O	and
O	oxen
O	,
O	great
O	herds
O	of
O	horses
O	feeding
O	down
O	in
O	Lerna
O	Fen
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	that
O	men
O	could
O	need
O	to
O	make
O	them
O	blest
O	:
O	and
O	yet
O	they
O	were
O	wretched
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	were
O	jealous
O	of
O	each
O	other
O	.
O	From
O	the
O	moment
O	they
O	were
O	born
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	quarrel
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	grew
O	up
O	each
O	tried
O	to
O	take
O	away
O	the
O	other
O	'
O	s
O	share
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	,
O	and
O	keep
O	all
O	for
O	himself
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	prophet
O	to
O	Acrisius
O	and
O	prophesied
O	against
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Because
O	you
O	have
O	risen
O	up
O	against
O	your
O	own
O	blood
O	,
O	your
O	own
O	blood
O	shall
O	rise
O	up
O	against
O	you
O	;
O	because
O	you
O	have
O	sinned
O	against
O	your
O	kindred
O	,
O	by
O	your
O	kindred
O	you
O	shall
O	be
O	punished
O	.
O	Your
O	daughter
O	Danae
O	shall
O	have
O	a
O	son
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	that
O	son
O	'
O	s
O	hands
O	you
O	shall
O	die
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	gods
O	have
O	ordained
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	will
O	surely
O	come
O	to
O	pass
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	at
O	that
O	Acrisius
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	afraid
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	mend
O	his
O	ways
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	cruel
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	family
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	repenting
O	and
O	being
O	kind
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	to
O	be
O	more
O	cruel
O	than
O	ever
O	:
O	for
O	he
O	shut
O	up
O	his
O	fair
O	daughter
O	Danae
O	in
O	a
O	cavern
O	underground
O	,
O	lined
O	with
O	brass
O	,
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	might
O	come
O	near
O	her
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	fancied
O	himself
O	more
O	cunning
O	than
O	the
O	gods
O	:
O	but
O	you
O	will
O	see
O	presently
O	whether
O	he
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	escape
O	them
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	in
O	time
O	a
O	son
O	came
O	to
O	Danae
O	:
O	so
O	beautiful
O	a
O	babe
O	that
O	any
O	but
O	King
O	Acrisius
O	would
O	have
O	had
O	pity
O	on
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	pity
O	;
O	for
O	he
O	took
O	Danae
O	and
O	her
O	babe
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	them
O	into
O	a
O	great
O	chest
O	and
O	thrust
O	them
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	winds
O	and
O	the
O	waves
O	to
O	carry
O	them
O	whithersoever
O	they
O	would
O	.
O	The
O	northwest
O	wind
O	blew
O	freshly
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	blue
O	mountains
O	,
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	pleasant
O	vale
O	of
O	Argos
O	,
O	and
O	away
O	and
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	.
O	And
O	away
O	and
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	before
O	it
O	floated
O	the
O	mother
O	and
O	her
O	babe
O	,
O	while
O	all
O	who
O	watched
O	them
O	wept
O	,
O	save
O	that
O	cruel
O	father
O	,
O	King
O	Acrisius
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	floated
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	chest
O	danced
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	billows
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	baby
O	slept
O	upon
O	its
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	breast
O	:
O	but
O	the
O	poor
O	mother
O	could
O	not
O	sleep
O	,
O	but
O	watched
O	and
O	wept
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	sang
O	to
O	her
O	baby
O	as
O	they
O	floated
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	song
O	which
O	she
O	sang
O	you
O	shall
O	learn
O	yourselves
O	some
O	day
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	they
O	are
O	past
O	the
O	last
O	blue
O	headland
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	open
O	sea
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	is
O	nothing
O	round
O	them
O	but
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wind
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	waves
O	are
O	gentle
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sky
O	is
O	clear
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	breeze
O	is
O	tender
O	and
O	low
O	.
O	So
O	a
O	night
O	passed
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	long
O	day
O	it
O	was
O	for
O	Danae
O	;
O	and
O	another
O	night
O	and
O	day
O	beside
O	,
O	till
O	Danae
O	was
O	faint
O	with
O	hunger
O	and
O	weeping
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	no
O	land
O	appeared
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	the
O	babe
O	slept
O	quietly
O	;
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	poor
O	Danae
O	drooped
O	her
O	head
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	likewise
O	with
O	her
O	cheek
O	against
O	the
O	babe
O	'
O	s
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	while
O	she
O	was
O	awakened
O	suddenly
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	chest
O	was
O	jarring
O	and
O	grinding
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	air
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	sound
O	.
O	She
O	looked
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	over
O	her
O	head
O	were
O	mighty
O	cliffs
O	,
O	all
O	red
O	in
O	the
O	setting
O	sun
O	,
O	and
O	around
O	her
O	rocks
O	and
O	breakers
O	,
O	and
O	flying
O	flakes
O	of
O	foam
O	.
O	She
O	clasped
O	her
O	hands
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	shrieked
O	aloud
O	for
O	help
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	she
O	cried
O	,
O	help
O	met
O	her
O	:
O	for
O	now
O	there
O	came
O	over
O	the
O	rocks
O	a
O	tall
O	and
O	stately
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	down
O	wonderingly
O	upon
O	poor
O	Danae
O	tossing
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	chest
O	among
O	the
O	waves
O	.
O	He
O	wore
O	a
O	rough
O	cloak
O	of
O	frieze
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	his
O	head
O	a
O	broad
O	hat
O	to
O	shade
O	his
O	face
O	;
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	he
O	carried
O	a
O	trident
O	for
O	spearing
O	fish
O	,
O	and
O	over
O	his
O	shoulder
O	was
O	a
O	casting-net
O	;
O	but
O	Danae
O	could
O	see
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	no
O	common
O	man
O	by
O	his
O	stature
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	walk
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	flowing
O	golden
O	hair
O	and
O	beard
O	;
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	two
O	servants
O	who
O	came
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	carrying
O	baskets
O	for
O	his
O	fish
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	had
O	hardly
O	time
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	him
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	laid
O	aside
O	his
O	trident
O	and
O	leapt
O	down
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	and
O	thrown
O	his
O	casting-net
O	so
O	surely
O	over
O	Danae
O	and
O	the
O	chest
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	drew
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	baby
O	,
O	safe
O	upon
O	a
O	ledge
O	of
O	rock
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	fisherman
O	took
O	Danae
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	lifted
O	her
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	chest
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	O
O	beautiful
O	damsel
O	,
O	what
O	strange
O	chance
O	has
O	brought
O	you

O	this

O	in
O	so
O	frail
O	a
O	ship
O	?
O	Who
O	are
O	you

O	and
O	whence
O	?
O	Surely
O	you
O	are
O	some
O	King

O	s
O	daughter
O	and
O	this
O	boy
O	has
O	somewhat
O	more
O	than
O	mortal
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	as
O	he
O	spoke
O	he
O	pointed
O	to
O	the
O	babe
O	;
O	for
O	its
O	face
O	shone
O	like
O	the
O	morning
O	star
O	.
O	But
O	Danae
O	only
O	held
O	down
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	sobbed
O	out
O	:
O	``
O	Tell

O	have
O	come

O	and
O	among
O	what

O	have
O	fallen

O	``
O	And
O	he
O	said

O	fell
O	down
O	at

O	``
O	So
O	Danae
O	was
O	comforted
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	home
O	with
O	Dictys
O	the
O	good
O	fisherman
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	a
O	daughter
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	to

O	.
O	Fifteen
O	years
O	were
O	passed
O	and
O	gone
O	and
O	the
O	babe
O	was
O	now
O	grown
O	to
O	a
O	tall
O	lad
O	and
O	a
O	sailor
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	many
O	voyages
O	after
O	merchandise
O	to
O	the
O	islands
O	round
O	.
O	His
O	mother
O	called
O	him
O	Perseus
O	;
O	but
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	in
O	Seriphos
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	the

O	mortal
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	called

O	Zeus
O	,
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	of
O	the
O	Immortals
O	.
O	For
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	but
O	fifteen
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	taller
O	by
O	a
O	head
O	than
O	any
O	man
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	skilful
O	of
O	all
O	in
O	running
O	and
O	wrestling
O	and
O	boxing
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	throwing
O	the
O	quoit
O	and
O	the
O	javelin
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	rowing
O	with
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	in

O	on
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	in
O	all
O	which
O	befits
O	a
O	man
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	was
O	brave

O	truthful
O	,
O	gentle
O	and
O	courteous
O	,
O	for
O	good
O	old
O	Dictys
O	had

O	and
O	well
O	it
O	was
O	for
O	Perseus
O	that
O	he

O	done
O	so

O	Now
O	one
O	day
O	at
O	Samos
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	lading
O	,
O	Perseus
O	wandered
O	into
O	a
O	pleasant
O	wood
O	to
O	get
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	turf
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	he
O	slept
O	a
O	strange
O	dream
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	--
O	the
O	strangest
O	dream
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	had
O	in
O	his
O	life
O	.
O	There
O	came
O	a
O	lady
O	to
O	him
O	through
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	taller
O	than
O	he
O	,
O	or
O	any
O	mortal
O	man
O	;
O	but
O	beautiful
O	exceedingly
O	,
O	with
O	grey
O	eyes
O	,
O	clear
O	and
O	piercing
O	,
O	but
O	strangely
O	soft
O	and
O	mild
O	.
O	On
O	her
O	head
O	was
O	a
O	helmet
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	a
O	spear
O	.
O	And
O	over
O	her
O	shoulder
O	,
O	above
O	her
O	long
O	blue
O	robes
O	,
O	hung
O	a
O	goat-skin
O	,
O	which
O	bore
O	up
O	a
O	mighty
O	shield
O	of
O	brass
O	,
O	polished
O	like
O	a
O	mirror
O	.
O	She
O	stood
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	her
O	clear
O	grey
O	eyes
O	;
O	and
O	Perseus
O	saw
O	that
O	her
O	eyelids
O	never
O	moved
O	,
O	nor
O	her
O	eyeballs
O	,
O	but
O	looked
O	straight
O	through
O	and
O	through
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	into
O	his
O	very
O	heart
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	could
O	see
O	all
O	the
O	secrets
O	of
O	his
O	soul
O	,

O	since
O	the

O	that
O	he
O	was
O	born
O	.
O	And
O	Perseus
O	dropped
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	trembling
O	and
O	blushing
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	wonderful
O	lady
O	spoke
O	.
O	``

O	,
O	till
O	in
O	her
O	pride
O	she
O	sinned
O	a
O	sin
O	at
O	which
O	the
O	sun
O	hid
O	his
O	face
O	;
O	and
O	from
O	that
O	day
O	her
O	hair
O	was
O	turned
O	to
O	vipers
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	hands
O	to
O	eagle
O	'
O	s
O	claws
O	;
O	and
O	her
O	heart
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	shame
O	and
O	rage
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	lips
O	with
O	bitter
O	venom
O	;
O	and
O	her
O	eyes
O	became
O	so
O	terrible
O	that
O	whosover
O	looks
O	on
O	them
O	is
O	turned
O	to
O	stone
O	;
O	and
O	her
O	children
O	are
O	the
O	winged
O	horse
O	and
O	the
O	giant
O	of
O	the
O	golden
O	sword
O	;
O	and
O	her
O	grandchildren
O	are
O	Echidna
O	the
O	witch-adder
O	,

O	Geryon
O	the

O	feeds
O	his
O	herds
O	beside
O	the
O	herds
O	of
O	hell
O	.
O	So
O	she
O	became
O	the
O	sister
O	of
O	the
O	Gorgons
O	,
O	the
O	daughters
O	of
O	the
O	Queen
O	of
O	the

O	.
O	Touch
O	them
O	not

O	``

O	Perseus
O	;
O	``

O	Then

O	looked

O	;
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	ashamed
O	to
O	show
O	his
O	dread
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	Medusa
O	and

O	renown
O	before
O	him
O	,

O	he
O	leapt

O	.
O	And
O	behold
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	falling
O	he
O	floated
O	,

O	stood
O	,

O	ran
O	along
O	the

O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	back
O	,
O	but
O	Athene
O	had
O	vanished
O	,

O	Hermes
O	;
O	and
O	the

O	So
O	Perseus
O	started
O	on
O	his
O	journey
O	,
O	going
O	dry-shod
O	over
O	land

O	joyful
O	,
O	for

O	came
O	to
O	the

O	they
O	chanted

O	together
O	,
O	``
O	Why

O	claws
O	.
O	The
O	surge
O	broke
O	up
O	in

O	it
O	fell
O	again
O	in
O	flakes
O	of
O	snow
O	;
O	and
O	it
O	frosted
O	the
O	hair
O	of
O	the
O	three

O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bones
O	in
O	the
O	ice
O	cliff
O	above
O	their
O	heads
O	.
O	They
O	passed
O	the
O	eye
O	from
O	one
O	to
O	the

O	for
O	all
O	that

O	pitied

O	Then
O	he
O	stepped
O	close

O	you
O	must
O	ask
O	his
O	daughters
O	,
O	the
O	Hesperides
O	,
O	who
O	are
O	young
O	and
O	foolish
O	like
O	yourself
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	give
O	us
O	back
O	our
O	eye
O	,
O	for
O	we
O	have
O	forgotten
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	Perseus
O	gave
O	them
O	back
O	their
O	eye
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	leaped
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	southward
O	,
O	leaving
O	the
O	snow
O	and
O	the
O	ice
O	behind
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	terns
O	and
O	the
O	sea
O	gulls
O	swept
O	laughing
O	round
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	stop
O	and
O	play
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dolphins
O	gambolled
O	up
O	as
O	he
O	passed
O	,
O	and
O	offered
O	to
O	carry
O	him
O	on
O	their
O	back
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	night
O	long
O	the
O	sea
O	nymphs
O	sang
O	sweetly
O	.
O	Day
O	by
O	day
O	the
O	sun
O	rose
O	higher
O	and
O	leaped
O	more
O	swiftly
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	swiftly
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	at
O	dawn
O	;
O	while
O	Perseus
O	skimmed
O	over
O	the
O	billows
O	like
O	a
O	sea
O	gull
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	feet
O	were
O	never
O	wetted
O	;
O	and
O	leapt
O	on
O	from
O	wave
O	to
O	wave
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	limbs
O	were
O	never
O	weary
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	saw
O	far
O	away
O	a
O	mighty
O	mountain
O	,
O	all
O	rose-red
O	in
O	the
O	setting
O	sun
O	.
O	Perseus
O	knew
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	Atlas
O	,
O	who
O	holds
O	the
O	heavens
O	and
O	the
O	earth
O	apart
O	.
O	He
O	leapt
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	wandered
O	upward
O	,
O	among
O	pleasant
O	valleys
O	and
O	waterfalls
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	heard
O	sweet
O	voices
O	singing
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	guessed
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	garden
O	of
O	the
O	Nymphs
O	,
O	the
O	daughters
O	of
O	the
O	Evening
O	Star
O	.
O	They
O	sang
O	like
O	nightingales
O	among
O	the
O	thickets
O	,
O	and
O	Perseus
O	stopped
O	to
O	hear
O	their
O	song
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	words
O	which
O	they
O	spoke
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	understand
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	stepped
O	forward
O	and
O	saw
O	them
O	dancing
O	,
O	hand
O	in
O	hand
O	around
O	the
O	charmed
O	tree
O	,
O	which
O	bent
O	under
O	its
O	golden
O	fruit
O	;
O	and
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	foot
O	was
O	coiled
O	the
O	dragon
O	,
O	old
O	Ladon
O	the
O	sleepless
O	snake
O	,
O	who
O	lies
O	there
O	for
O	ever
O	,
O	listening
O	to
O	the
O	song
O	of
O	the
O	maidens
O	,
O	blinking
O	and
O	watching
O	with
O	dry
O	bright
O	eyes
O	.
O	Then
O	Perseus
O	stopped
O	,
O	not
O	because
O	he
O	feared
O	the
O	dragon
O	,
O	but
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	bashful
O	before
O	those
O	fair
O	maids
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	him
O	,
O	they
O	too
O	stopped
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	to
O	him
O	with
O	trembling
O	voices
O	:
O	``
O	Who
O	are
O	you
O	,
O	fair
O	boy
O	?
O	Come
O	dance
O	with
O	us
O	around
O	the
O	tree
O	in
O	the
O	garden
O	which
O	knows
O	no
O	winter
O	,
O	the
O	home
O	of
O	the
O	south
O	wind
O	and
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	Come
O	hither
O	and
O	play
O	with
O	us
O	awhile
O	;
O	we
O	have
O	danced
O	alone
O	here
O	for
O	a
O	thousand
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	our
O	hearts
O	are
O	weary
O	with
O	longing
O	for
O	a
O	playfellow
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	I
O	can
O	not
O	dance
O	with
O	you
O	,
O	fair

O	for
O	I
O	must
O	do
O	the
O	errand
O	of
O	the
O	Immortals
O	.
O	So
O	tell
O	me
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	Gorgon
O	,
O	lest
O	I
O	wander
O	and
O	perish
O	in
O	the
O	waves
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	they
O	sighed
O	and
O	wept
O	;
O	and
O	answered
O	:
O	``
O	The
O	Gorgon
O	!
O	she
O	will
O	freeze
O	you
O	into
O	stone
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	It
O	is
O	better
O	to
O	die
O	like
O	a
O	hero
O	than
O	to
O	live
O	like
O	an
O	ox
O	in
O	a
O	stall
O	.
O	The
O	Immortals
O	have
O	lent
O	me
O	weapons
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	will
O	give
O	me
O	wit
O	to
O	use
O	them
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	they
O	sighed
O	again
O	and
O	answered
O	:
O	``
O	Fair
O	boy
O	,
O	if
O	you

O	bent
O	on
O	your

O	,
O	be

O	We
O	know
O	not
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	Gorgon
O	;
O	but
O	we
O	will
O	ask
O	the
O	giant
O	Atlas
O	above
O	upon
O	the
O	mountain
O	peak
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	they
O	went
O	up
O	the
O	mountain
O	to
O	Atlas
O	their
O	uncle
O	,
O	and
O	Perseus
O	went
O	up
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	giant
O	kneeling
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	held
O	the
O	heavens
O	and
O	the
O	earth
O	apart
O	.
O	They
O	asked
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	answered
O	mildly
O	,
O	pointing
O	to
O	the
O	sea
O	board
O	with
O	his
O	mighty
O	hand
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	can
O	see
O	the
O	Gorgons
O	lying
O	on
O	an
O	island
O	far
O	away
O	,
O	but
O	this
O	youth
O	can
O	never
O	come
O	near
O	them
O	,
O	unless
O	he
O	has
O	the
O	hat
O	of
O	darkness
O	,
O	which
O	whosoever
O	wears
O	can
O	not
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	cried
O	Perseus
O	,
O	``
O	Where
O	is

O	``
O	But
O	the
O	giant
O	smiled
O	.
O	``
O	No
O	living
O	mortal
O	can
O	find
O	that

O	,
O	for
O	it

O	in
O	the
O	depths
O	of
O	Hades
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	regions
O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	.
O	But
O	my
O	nieces
O	are
O	immortal
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	shall
O	fetch
O	it
O	for
O	you
O	,
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	promise
O	me
O	one
O	thing
O	and
O	keep
O	your
O	faith
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	Perseus
O	promised
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	giant
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	When
O	you
O	come

O	shall
O	show
O	me
O	the
O	beautiful
O	horror
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	may
O	lose
O	my
O	feeling
O	and
O	my
O	breathing
O	,
O	and
O	become
O	a

O	``
O	Then
O	Perseus
O	promised
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	eldest
O	of
O	the
O	Nymphs
O	went
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	into
O	a
O	dark
O	cavern
O	among
O	the
O	cliffs
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	which
O	came
O	smoke
O	and
O	thunder
O	,
O	for

O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	mouths
O	of
O	hell
O	.
O	And
O	Perseus
O	and
O	the
O	Nymphs
O	sat
O	down
O	seven
O	days
O	and
O	waited
O	trembling
O	,
O	till
O	the
O	Nymph
O	came
O	up
O	again
O	;
O	and
O	her
O	face
O	was
O	pale
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	eyes
O	dazzled
O	with
O	the
O	light
O	for
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	long
O	in
O	the
O	dreary
O	darkness
O	;
O	but
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	was
O	the
O	magic
O	hat
O	.
O	Then
O	all
O	the
O	Nymphs
O	kissed
O	Perseus
O	,
O	and
O	wept
O	over
O	him
O	a
O	long
O	while
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	only
O	impatient
O	to
O	be
O	gone
O	.
O	And
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	put
O	the
O	hat
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	vanished
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	sight
O	.
O	But
O	Perseus
O	went
O	on
O	boldly
O	,
O	past
O	many
O	an
O	ugly
O	sight
O	,
O	far
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	Unshapen
O	Land
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	rustle
O	of
O	the
O	Gorgons
O	'
O	wings
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	glitter
O	of
O	their
O	brazen
O	talons
O	;
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	time
O	to
O	halt
O	,
O	lest
O	Medusa
O	should
O	freeze
O	him
O	into
O	stone
O	.
O	He
O	thought
O	awhile
O	with
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	remembered
O	Athene

O	s
O	words
O	.
O	He
O	arose
O	aloft
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	,

O	held
O	the
O	mirror

O	looked
O	up
O	into

O	that

O	might
O	see
O	all
O	that
O	was
O	below
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	three
O	Gorgons
O	sleeping
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	him
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	hat
O	of
O	darkness
O	hid
O	him
O	;
O	and
O	yet
O	he
O	trembled
O	as
O	he
O	sank
O	down
O	near
O	them
O	,
O	so
O	terrible
O	were
O	those
O	brazen
O	claws
O	.
O	Two
O	of
O	the
O	Gorgons
O	were
O	foul
O	as
O	swine
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	sleeping
O	heavily
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	mighty
O	wings
O	outspread
O	;
O	but
O	Medusa
O	tossed
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	restlessly
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	tossed
O	Perseus
O	pitied
O	her
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	he
O	looked
O	,
O	from
O	among
O	her
O	tresses
O	the
O	vipers
O	'
O	heads
O	awoke
O	,
O	and
O	peeped
O	up
O	with
O	their
O	bright
O	dry
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	their
O	fangs
O	,
O	and
O	hissed
O	;
O	and
O	Medusa
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	tossed
O	,
O	threw
O	back
O	her
O	wings
O	and
O	showed
O	her
O	brazen

O	Then
O	Perseus
O	came
O	down

O	boldly
O	,

O	looked
O	steadfastly
O	on
O	his
O	mirror
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	with
O	Herpe
O	stoutly
O	once
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	need
O	to
O	strike
O	again
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	wrapped
O	the
O	head
O	in
O	the
O	goat-skin
O	,
O	turning
O	away
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	sprang
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	aloft
O	,
O	faster
O	than
O	he
O	ever
O	sprang
O	before
O	.
O	For
O	Medusa
O	'
O	s
O	wings
O	and
O	talons
O	rattled
O	as
O	she
O	sank
O	dead
O	upon
O	the
O	rocks
O	;
O	and
O	her
O	two
O	foul
O	sisters
O	woke
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	her
O	lying
O	dead
O	.
O	Into
O	the
O	air
O	they
O	sprang
O	yelling
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	for
O	him
O	who
O	had
O	done
O	the
O	deed
O	.
O	They
O	rushed
O	,
O	sweeping
O	and
O	flapping
O	,
O	like
O	eagles
O	after
O	a
O	hare
O	;
O	and
O	Perseus
O	'
O	s
O	blood
O	ran
O	cold
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	them
O	come
O	howling
O	on
O	his
O	track
O	;
O	and

O	cried
O	,
O	``

O	followed
O	the
O	hounds
O	of
O	Death
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	sandals
O	were
O	too
O	swift
O	,
O	even
O	for
O	Gorgons
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	nightfall
O	they
O	were
O	far
O	behind
O	,
O	two
O	black
O	specks
O	in
O	the
O	southern
O	sky
O	,
O	till
O	the
O	sun
O	sank
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	them
O	no
O	more
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	came
O	again
O	to
O	Atlas
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	garden
O	of
O	the
O	Nymphs
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	giant
O	heard
O	him
O	coming
O	he
O	groaned
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Fulfil
O	thy
O	promise
O	to
O	me
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	Perseus
O	held
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	Gorgon
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	rest
O	from
O	all
O	his
O	toil
O	;
O	for
O	he
O	became
O	a
O	crag
O	of
O	stone
O	,
O	which
O	sleeps
O	forever
O	far
O	above
O	the
O	clouds
O	.
O	Perseus
O	thanked
O	the
O	Nymphs
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	them
O	,
O	``
O	By
O	what
O	road
O	shall
O	I
O	go
O	homeward
O	again
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	have
O	wandered
O	far
O	in
O	coming
O	hither
O	?
O	``
O	And
O	they
O	wept
O	and
O	cried
O	,
O	``
O	Go
O	home
O	no
O	more
O	,
O	but
O	stay
O	and
O	play
O	with
O	us
O	,
O	the
O	lonely
O	maidens
O	,
O	who
O	dwell
O	for
O	ever
O	far
O	away
O	from
O	gods
O	and
O	men
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	he
O	refused
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	told
O	him
O	his
O	road
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	leapt
O	down
O	the
O	mountain
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	,
O	lessening
O	and
O	lessening
O	like
O	a
O	sea
O	gull
O	,
O	away
O	and
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	.
O	So
O	Perseus
O	flitted
O	onward
O	to
O	the
O	northeast
O	,
O	over
O	many
O	a
O	league
O	of
O	sea
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	rolling
O	sand
O	hills
O	and
O	the
O	dreary
O	Lybian
O	shore
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	flitted
O	on
O	across
O	the
O	desert
O	:
O	over
O	rock
O	ledges
O	,
O	and
O	banks
O	of
O	shingle
O	,
O	and
O	level
O	wastes
O	of
O	sand
O	,
O	and
O	shell
O	drifts
O	bleaching
O	in
O	the
O	sunshine
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	skeletons
O	of
O	great
O	sea
O	monsters
O	,
O	and
O	dead
O	bones
O	of
O	ancient
O	giants
O	,
O	strewn
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	old
O	sea
O	floor
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	the
O	blood
O	drops
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	from
O	the
O	Gorgon
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	became
O	poisonous
O	asps
O	and
O	adders
O	,
O	which
O	breed
O	in
O	the
O	desert
O	to
O	this
O	day
O	.
O	Over
O	the
O	sands
O	he
O	went
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	Dwarfs
O	who
O	fought
O	with
O	cranes
O	.
O	Their
O	spears
O	were
O	of
O	reeds
O	and
O	rushes
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	houses
O	of
O	the
O	eggshells
O	of
O	the
O	cranes
O	;
O	and
O	Perseus
O	laughed
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	northeast
O	,
O	hoping
O	all
O	day
O	long
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	blue
O	Mediterranean
O	sparkling
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	fly
O	across
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	home
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	came
O	down
O	a
O	mighty
O	wind
O	,
O	and
O	swept
O	him
O	back
O	southward
O	toward
O	the
O	desert
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	long
O	he
O	strove
O	against
O	it
O	;
O	but
O	even
O	the
O	winged
O	sandals
O	could
O	not
O	prevail
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	float
O	down
O	the
O	wind
O	all
O	night
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	morning
O	dawned
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	blinding
O	sun
O	in
O	the
O	blinding
O	blue
O	;
O	and
O	round
O	him
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	blinding
O	sand
O	.
O	And
O	Perseus
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Surely
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	here
O	without
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	the
O	Immortals
O	,
O	for
O	Athene
O	will
O	not
O	lie
O	.
O	Were
O	not
O	these
O	sandals
O	to
O	lead
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	right
O	road
O	?
O	Then
O	the
O	road
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	have
O	tried
O	to
O	go
O	must
O	be
O	a
O	wrong
O	road
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	suddenly
O	his
O	ears
O	were
O	opened
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	running
O	water
O	.
O	And
O	at
O	that
O	his
O	heart
O	was
O	lifted
O	up
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	scarcely
O	dare
O	believe
O	his
O	ears
O	;
O	and
O	within
O	a
O	bowshot
O	of
O	him
O	was
O	a
O	glen
O	in
O	the
O	sand
O	,
O	and
O	marble
O	rocks
O	,
O	and
O	date
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	lawn
O	of
O	gay
O	green
O	grass
O	.
O	And
O	through
O	the
O	lawn
O	a
O	streamlet
O	sparkled
O	and
O	wandered
O	out
O	beyond
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	vanished
O	in
O	the
O	sand
O	.
O	And
O	Perseus
O	laughed
O	for
O	joy
O	,
O	and
O	leapt
O	down
O	the
O	cliff
O	and
O	drank
O	of
O	the
O	cool
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	ate
O	of
O	the
O	dates
O	,
O	and
O	slept
O	upon
O	the
O	turf
O	,
O	and
O	leapt
O	up
O	and
O	went
O	forward
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	towered
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	like
O	an
O	eagle
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	limbs
O	were
O	strong
O	again
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	flew
O	all
O	night
O	across
O	the
O	mountain
O	till
O	the
O	day
O	began
O	to
O	dawn
O	,
O	and
O	rosy-fingered
O	Eos
O	came
O	blushing
O	up
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	,
O	behold
O	,
O	beneath
O	him
O	was
O	the
O	long
O	green
O	garden
O	of
O	Egypt
O	and
O	the
O	shining
O	stream
O	of
O	Nile
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	saw
O	cities
O	walled
O	up
O	to
O	heaven
O	,
O	and
O	temples
O	,
O	and
O	obelisks
O	,
O	and
O	pyramids
O	,
O	and
O	giant
O	gods
O	of
O	stone
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	came
O	down
O	amid
O	fields
O	of
O	barley
O	and
O	flax
O	,
O	and
O	millet
O	,
O	and
O	clambering
O	gourds
O	;
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	people
O	coming
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	city
O	,
O	and
O	setting
O	to
O	work
O	,
O	each
O	in
O	his
O	place
O	,
O	among
O	the
O	water
O	courses
O	,
O	parting
O	the
O	streams
O	among
O	the
O	plants
O	cunningly
O	with
O	their
O	feet
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	wisdom
O	of
O	the
O	Egyptians
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	him
O	they
O	all
O	stopped
O	their
O	work
O	,
O	and
O	gathered
O	round
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	:
O	``
O	Who

O	beneath
O	they
O	goat
O	--
O	skin
O	there
O	?
O	Surely
O	thou
O	art
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	Immortals
O	;
O	for
O	thy
O	skin
O	is
O	white
O	like
O	ivory
O	,
O	and
O	ours
O	is
O	red
O	like
O	clay
O	.
O	Thy
O	hair
O	is
O	like
O	threads
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	and
O	ours
O	is
O	black
O	and
O	curled
O	.
O	Surely
O	thou
O	art
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	Immortals

O	;
O	and
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	worshipped
O	him
O	then
O	and
O	there
O	;
O	but
O	Perseus
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	I

O	.
O	And
O	I
O	have

O	flew
O	upward

O	while
O	Andromeda
O	crouched

O	On
O	came
O	the

O	At

O	he
O	saw
O	Andromeda
O	,
O	and
O	shot
O	forward
O	to

O	Then
O	down
O	from
O	the

O	'
O	s
O	fate
O	.
O	And
O	already
O	a
O	messenger
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	Cepheus
O	and
O	Cassiopoeia
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	sat
O	in
O	sackcloth
O	and
O	ashes
O	on

O	,
O	awaiting
O	their

O	s
O	end

O	And
O	they
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	all

O	city
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	wonder
O	,
O	with
O	songs
O	and
O	with
O	dances
O	,
O	with
O	cymbals
O	and
O	harps
O	,
O	and
O	received
O	their
O	daughter
O	back
O	again
O	,
O	as
O	one
O	alive
O	from
O	the
O	dead
O	.
O	Then
O	Cepheus
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Hero

O	``
O	I

O	stopped
O	short

O	bade
O	the

O	bring
O	levers

O	roll
O	them
O	out
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	made
O	a

O	from
O	Tyre
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	down
O	cedars
O	,
O	and
O	built
O	himself
O	a
O	a

O	But
O	the

O	were
O	past
O	.
O	So
O	Perseus
O	and
O	the
O	Phoenicians
O	rowed
O	to
O	the
O	westward
O	,
O	across
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	pleasant
O	Isles
O	of
O	Hellas
O	,
O	and
O	Seriphos
O	,
O	his
O	ancient
O	home
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	left
O	his
O	galley
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	up
O	as
O	of
O	old
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	embraced
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	and
O	Dictys
O	his
O	good
O	foster-father
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	wept
O	over
O	each
O	other
O	a
O	long
O	while
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	seven
O	years
O	and
O	more
O	since
O	they
O	had
O	met
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	went
O	home
O	to
O	Argos
O	,
O	and
O	reigned
O	there
O	well
O	with
O	fair
O	Andromeda
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	the
O	gods
O	was
O	accomplished
O	towards
O	Acrisius
O	,
O	his
O	grandfather
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	died
O	from
O	the
O	falling
O	of
O	a
O	quoit
O	which
O	Perseus
O	had
O	thrown
O	in
O	a
O	game
O	.
O	Perseus
O	and
O	Andromeda
O	had
O	four
O	sons
O	and
O	three
O	daughters
O	,
O	and
O	died
O	in
O	a
O	good
O	old
O	age
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	died
O	,
O	the
O	ancients
O	say
O	,
O	Athene
O	took
O	them
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	with
O	Cepheus
O	and
O	Cassiopoeia
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	on
O	starlight
O	nights
O	you
O	may
O	see
O	them
O	shining
O	still
O	;
O	Cepheus
O	with
O	his
O	kingly
O	crown
O	,
O	and
O	Cassiopoeia
O	in
O	her
O	ivory
O	chair
O	,
O	plaiting
O	her
O	star-
O	spangled
O	tresses
O	,
O	and
O	Perseus
O	with
O	the
O	Gorgon
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	fair
O	Andromeda
O	beside
O	him
O	,
O	spreading
O	her
O	long
O	white
O	arms
O	across
O	the
O	heavens
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	stood
O	when
O	chained
O	to
O	the
O	stone
O	for
O	the
O	monster
O	.
O	All
O	night
O	long
O	they
O	shine
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	beacon
O	to
O	wandering
O	sailors
O	;
O	but
O	all
O	day
O	they
O	feast
O	with
O	the
O	gods
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	still
O	blue
O	peaks
O	of
O	Olympus
O	.
