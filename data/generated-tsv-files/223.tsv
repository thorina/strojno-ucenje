O	Don
O	Quixote
O	,
O	left
O	to

O	,
O	climbed
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	high
O	mountain
O	,
O	and
O	spent
O	his
O	days
O	making
O	poems
O	about
O	the
O	beautiful
O	Dulcinea
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	recited
O	to
O	the
O	rocks
O	and
O	trees
O	around
O	him
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	calling
O	upon
O	the
O	nymphs
O	of
O	the
O	streams
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	satyrs
O	of
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	to
O	hear
O	his
O	cries
O	,
O	did
O	he
O	pass
O	his
O	time
O	while
O	Sancho
O	was
O	away
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	his
O	squire
O	,
O	turning
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	highway
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	road
O	which
O	led
O	to
O	Toboso
O	,
O	and
O	arrived
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	at
O	the
O	inn
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	tossed
O	in
O	a
O	blanket
O	.
O	He
O	no
O	sooner
O	saw
O	it
O	than
O	he
O	imagined
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	once
O	again
O	flying
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	half
O	made
O	up
O	his
O	mind
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	enter
O	the
O	inn
O	,
O	although
O	it
O	was
O	now
O	dinner-hour
O	and
O	he
O	felt
O	a
O	marvellous
O	longing
O	to
O	taste
O	some
O	cooked
O	meat
O	again
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	eaten
O	nothing
O	but
O	cold
O	fare
O	for
O	a
O	good
O	many
O	days
O	.
O	This
O	longing
O	made
O	him
O	draw
O	near
O	to
O	the
O	inn
O	,
O	remaining
O	still
O	in
O	some
O	doubt
O	as
O	to
O	whether
O	he
O	should
O	enter
O	it
O	or
O	not
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	stood
O	musing
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	inn
O	two
O	persons
O	who
O	recognised
O	him
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	one
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	:
O	``

O	up

O	``
O	Then
O	Sancho
O	told
O	them
O	from

O	to
O	end
O	how
O	his

O	was
O	carrying
O	out
O	his

O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	mad
O	pranks
O	he
O	intended
O	to
O	perform
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	he
O	,
O	Sancho
O	,
O	was
O	bearing
O	a
O	letter
O	to
O	the
O	Lady
O	Dulcinea
O	of
O	Toboso
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	none
O	other
O	than
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	Lorenzo
O	Corchuelo
O	,
O	with
O	whom
O	the
O	knight
O	was
O	head
O	and
O	ears
O	in
O	love
O	.
O	Both
O	of
O	them
O	were
O	amazed
O	at
O	what
O	they
O	heard
O	,
O	although
O	they
O	knew
O	something
O	of
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	'
O	s
O	madness
O	already
O	.
O	They
O	asked
O	Sancho
O	to
O	show
O	,
O	them
O	the
O	letter
O	he
O	was
O	carrying
O	to
O	the
O	Lady
O	Dulcinea
O	.
O	Sancho
O	told
O	them
O	it
O	was
O	written
O	in
O	the
O	pocket-book
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	ordered
O	to
O	get
O	it
O	copied
O	out
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	village
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	.
O	The
O	curate
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	show
O	it
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	make
O	a
O	fair
O	copy
O	of
O	it
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	Sancho
O	thrust
O	his
O	hand
O	into
O	his
O	bosom
O	to
O	search
O	for
O	the
O	little
O	book
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	it
O	,
O	nor
O	would
O	he
O	have
O	found
O	it
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	hunted
O	until
O	Doomsday
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	it
O	with
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	quite
O	forgotten
O	to
O	give
O	it
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	nor
O	had
O	he
O	remembered
O	to
O	ask
O	for
O	it
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	away
O	.
O	When
O	Sancho
O	discovered
O	that
O	the
O	book
O	was
O	lost
O	,
O	his
O	face
O	grew
O	as
O	pale
O	as
O	death
O	,
O	and
O	feeling
O	all
O	over
O	his
O	body
O	he
O	saw
O	clearly
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	.
O	Without
O	more
O	ado
O	he
O	laid
O	hold
O	of
O	his
O	beard
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	both
O	his
O	fists
O	plucked
O	out
O	half
O	his
O	hair
O	and
O	gave
O	himself
O	half
O	a
O	dozen
O	blows
O	about
O	his
O	face
O	and
O	nose
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	soon
O	bathed
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	blood
O	.
O	Seeing
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	curate
O	and
O	the
O	barber
O	asked
O	him
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	treat
O	himself
O	so
O	ill
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	is
O	the
O	matter
O	?
O	``
O	cried
O	poor
O	Sancho
O	.
O	``
O	Why
O	,
O	I
O	have
O	let

O	``
O	``
O	How
O	so
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	the

O	.
O	``
O	Why

O	replied
O	Sancho
O	,
O	``

O	``
O	So
O	saying
O	,
O	he
O	told
O	them
O	the

O	his
O	lost
O	Dapple
O	.
O	The
O	curate
O	comforted
O	him
O	by
O	telling
O	him
O	that

O	paper
O	again
O	in
O	proper
O	form
O	.
O	With
O	this
O	Sancho
O	took
O	courage
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	if
O	that
O	could
O	be
O	done
O	all
O	would
O	be
O	right
O	,
O	for

O	cared
O	not
O	much
O	for
O	the
O	loss
O	of

O	s
O	letter

O	``

O	Then
O	Sancho
O	stood
O	still

O	began
O	to
O	scratch
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	try
O	to
O	call
O	the
O	letter
O	to
O	memory
O	.
O	He
O	stood
O	first
O	on
O	one
O	leg
O	and
O	then
O	on

O	then
O	to

O	gnawed
O	off

O	nails
O	,

O	at

O	plan
O	which
O	fitted
O	in
O	well
O	with
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	'
O	s
O	humour
O	,
O	and
O	seemed
O	likely
O	to
O	be
O	successful
O	.
O	This
O	plan
O	was
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	told
O	the
O	barber
O	,
O	to
O	dress
O	himself
O	like
O	a
O	wandering
O	damsel
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	barber
O	took
O	the
O	part
O	of
O	her
O	squire
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	this
O	disguise
O	they
O	were
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	where
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	was
O	undergoing
O	his
O	penance
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	curate
O	,
O	pretending
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	an
O	afflicted
O	and
O	sorely
O	distressed
O	damsel
O	,
O	was
O	to
O	demand
O	of
O	him
O	a
O	boon
O	,
O	which
O	as
O	a
O	valiant
O	knight
O	errant
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	refuse
O	.
O	The
O	service
O	which
O	the
O	damsel
O	was
O	to
O	ask
O	was
O	that
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	would
O	follow
O	her
O	where
O	she
O	should
O	lead
O	him
O	,
O	to
O	right
O	a
O	wrong
O	which
O	some
O	wicked
O	knight
O	had
O	done
O	her
O	.
O	Besides
O	this
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	to
O	pray
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	command
O	her
O	to
O	unveil
O	herself
O	or
O	inquire
O	as
O	to
O	her
O	condition
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	her
O	right
O	against
O	the
O	wicked
O	knight
O	.
O	And
O	thus
O	they
O	hoped
O	to
O	lead
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	village
O	,
O	and
O	afterwards
O	to
O	cure
O	him
O	of
O	his
O	mad
O	ideas
O	.
O	The
O	curate
O	'
O	s
O	notion
O	pleased
O	the
O	barber
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	resolved
O	to
O	carry
O	it
O	out
O	.
O	They
O	borrowed
O	of
O	the
O	innkeeper
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	a
O	gown
O	and
O	a
O	head-dress
O	,
O	leaving
O	with
O	her
O	in
O	exchange
O	the
O	curate
O	'
O	s
O	new
O	cassock
O	.
O	The
O	barber
O	made
O	for
O	himself
O	a
O	great
O	beard
O	of
O	a
O	red
O	ox
O	'
O	s
O	tail
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	innkeeper
O	used
O	to
O	hang
O	his
O	horse-comb
O	.
O	The
O	innkeeper
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	asked
O	them
O	what
O	they
O	wanted
O	these
O	things
O	for
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	curate
O	told
O	her
O	shortly
O	all
O	about
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	'
O	s
O	madness
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	this
O	disguise
O	was
O	necessary
O	to
O	bring
O	him
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	mountains
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	up
O	his
O	abode
O	.
O	The
O	innkeeper
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	then
O	remembered
O	all
O	about
O	their
O	strange
O	guest
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	the
O	barber
O	and
O	the
O	curate
O	all
O	about
O	him
O	and
O	his
O	balsam
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	Sancho
O	had
O	fared
O	with
O	the
O	blanket
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	innkeeper
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	dressed
O	up
O	the
O	curate
O	so
O	cleverly
O	that
O	it
O	could
O	not
O	have
O	been
O	better
O	done
O	.
O	She
O	attired
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	stuff
O	gown
O	with
O	bands
O	of
O	black
O	velvet
O	several
O	inches
O	broad
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	bodice
O	and
O	sleeves
O	of
O	green
O	velvet
O	trimmed
O	with
O	white
O	satin
O	,
O	both
O	of
O	which
O	might
O	have
O	been
O	made
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	the
O	Flood
O	.
O	The
O	curate
O	would
O	not
O	consent
O	to
O	wear
O	a
O	headdress
O	like
O	a
O	woman
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	but
O	put
O	on
O	a
O	white
O	quilted
O	linen
O	nightcap
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	carried
O	to
O	sleep
O	in
O	.
O	Then
O	with
O	two
O	strips
O	of
O	black
O	stuff
O	he
O	made
O	himself
O	a
O	mask
O	and
O	fixed
O	it
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	covered
O	his
O	face
O	and
O	beard
O	very
O	neatly
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	large
O	hat
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	wrapping
O	himself
O	in
O	his
O	cloak
O	,
O	seated
O	himself
O	like
O	a
O	woman
O	sideways
O	on
O	his
O	mule
O	,
O	whilst
O	the
O	barber
O	mounted
O	his
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	beard
O	reaching
O	down
O	to
O	his
O	girdle
O	,
O	made
O	,
O	as
O	was
O	said
O	,
O	from
O	a
O	red
O	ox
O	'
O	s
O	tail
O	.
O	They
O	now
O	took
O	their
O	leave
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	at
O	the
O	inn
O	wished
O	them
O	a
O	good
O	success
O	;
O	but
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	gone
O	very
O	far
O	when
O	the
O	curate
O	began
O	to
O	dread
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	doing
O	right
O	in
O	dressing
O	up
O	as
O	a
O	woman
O	and
O	gadding
O	about
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	costume
O	,
O	even
O	on
O	so
O	good
O	an
O	errand
O	.
O	He
O	therefore
O	proposed
O	to
O	the
O	barber
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	the
O	distressed
O	damsel
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	,
O	the
O	curate
O	,
O	would
O	take
O	the
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	squire
O	and
O	teach
O	him
O	what
O	to
O	say
O	and
O	how
O	to
O	behave
O	.
O	Sancho
O	now
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	seeing
O	them
O	in
O	their
O	strange
O	dresses
O	,
O	could
O	not
O	contain
O	his
O	laughter
O	.
O	The
O	curate
O	soon
O	threw
O	off
O	his
O	disguise
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	barber
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	,
O	and
O	both
O	resolved
O	not
O	to
O	dress
O	up
O	any
O	more
O	until
O	they
O	should
O	come
O	nearer
O	to
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	barber
O	should
O	be
O	the
O	distressed
O	damsel
O	and
O	the
O	curate
O	should
O	be
O	the
O	squire
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	pursued
O	their
O	journey
O	towards
O	the
O	Brown
O	Mountains
O	,
O	guided
O	by
O	Sancho
O	,
O	to
O	whom
O	they
O	explained
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	necessary
O	that
O	his
O	master
O	should
O	be
O	led
O	away
O	from
O	his
O	penance
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	was
O	ever
O	to
O	become
O	an
O	emperor
O	and
O	be
O	in
O	a
O	position
O	to
O	give
O	Sancho
O	his
O	desired
O	island
O	.
