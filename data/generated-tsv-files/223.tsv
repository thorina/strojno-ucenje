O	Becoming
O	weary
O	of
O	a
O	quiet
O	life
O	in
O	Balsora
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	bought
O	trading
O	goods
O	,
O	I
O	again
O	went
O	to
O	sea
O	with
O	some
O	merchants
O	.
O	After
O	touching
O	at
O	several
O	places
O	,
O	we
O	landed
O	at
O	an
O	uninhabited
O	island
O	.
O	We
O	amused
O	ourselves
O	in
O	different
O	ways
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	,
O	having
O	taken
O	my
O	wine
O	and
O	provisions
O	,
O	sat
O	down
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	awoke
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	my
O	companions
O	were
O	gone
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	ship
O	had
O	sailed
O	.
O	I
O	climbed
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	very
O	high
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	perceived
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	an
O	object
O	that
O	was
O	very
O	large
O	and
O	white
O	.
O	I
O	descended
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	toward
O	this
O	strange-looking
O	object
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	approached
O	it
O	I
O	found
O	it
O	was
O	about
O	fifty
O	paces
O	in
O	circumference
O	,
O	quite
O	round
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	smooth
O	as
O	ivory
O	,
O	but
O	had
O	no
O	sort
O	of
O	opening
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	now
O	almost
O	sunset
O	,
O	and
O	suddenly
O	the
O	sky
O	became
O	darkened
O	.
O	I
O	looked
O	up
O	and
O	beheld
O	a
O	bird
O	of
O	enormous
O	size
O	,
O	moving
O	like
O	a
O	prodigious
O	cloud
O	toward
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	recollected
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	heard
O	of
O	a
O	bird
O	called
O	the
O	roc
O	,
O	so
O	large
O	that
O	it
O	could
O	carry
O	away
O	young
O	elephants
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	therefore
O	conjectured
O	that
O	the
O	large
O	object
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	looking
O	at
O	was
O	the
O	egg
O	of
O	this
O	bird
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	bird
O	approached
O	I
O	crept
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	egg
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	legs
O	of
O	this
O	winged
O	animal
O	before
O	me
O	when
O	it
O	alighted
O	.
O	This
O	limb
O	being
O	as
O	large
O	as
O	the
O	trunk
O	of
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	I
O	tied
O	myself
O	firmly
O	to
O	it
O	with
O	my
O	turban
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	the
O	bird
O	flew
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	me
O	from
O	this
O	desert
O	island
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	borne
O	so
O	high
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	carried
O	downward
O	so
O	swiftly
O	that
O	I
O	lost
O	my
O	senses
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	recovered
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	I
O	quickly
O	untied
O	the
O	cloth
O	that
O	bound
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	scarcely
O	was
O	I
O	free
O	when
O	the
O	bird
O	,
O	having
O	taken
O	up
O	a
O	large
O	serpent
O	,
O	again
O	flew
O	away
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	in
O	a
O	deep
O	valley
O	,
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	which
O	were
O	too
O	steep
O	to
O	be
O	climbed
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	walked
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	in
O	despair
O	I
O	noticed
O	that
O	the
O	valley
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	diamonds
O	of
O	enormous
O	size
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	soon
O	saw
O	other
O	objects
O	of
O	much
O	less
O	agreeable
O	appearance
O	.
O	Immense
O	serpents
O	were
O	peeping
O	out
O	of
O	holes
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	.
O	When
O	night
O	came
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	shelter
O	in
O	a
O	cave
O	,
O	the
O	entrance
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	guarded
O	with
O	the
O	largest
O	stones
O	I
O	could
O	find
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	hissing
O	of
O	the
O	serpents
O	entirely
O	deprived
O	me
O	of
O	sleep
O	.
O	When
O	day
O	returned
O	,
O	the
O	serpents
O	retired
O	to
O	their
O	holes;
O	and
O	I
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	cave
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	extreme
O	fear
O	.
O	I
O	walked
O	heedless
O	of
O	the
O	serpents
O	until
O	I
O	became
O	weary
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	sat
O	down
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	awakened
O	by
O	something
O	which
O	fell
O	near
O	me
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	large
O	piece
O	of
O	fresh
O	meat
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	I
O	saw
O	several
O	other
O	pieces
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	now
O	convinced
O	that
O	I
O	must
O	be
O	in
O	the
O	famous
O	valley
O	of
O	diamonds
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	pieces
O	of
O	meat
O	were
O	thrown
O	in
O	by
O	merchants
O	,
O	who
O	expected
O	eagles
O	to
O	pounce
O	upon
O	the
O	flesh
O	,
O	to
O	which
O	diamonds
O	were
O	almost
O	sure
O	to
O	adhere
O	.
O	I
O	hastened
O	to
O	pick
O	up
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	largest
O	diamonds
O	I
O	could
O	find
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	put
O	into
O	a
O	little
O	bag
O	,
O	and
O	fastened
O	it
O	to
O	my
O	girdle
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	selected
O	the
O	largest
O	piece
O	of
O	flesh
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	tied
O	to
O	my
O	waist
O	with
O	the
O	cloth
O	of
O	my
O	turban
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	lay
O	down
O	upon
O	my
O	face
O	to
O	wait
O	for
O	the
O	eagles
O	.
O	Very
O	soon
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	strongest
O	pounced
O	upon
O	the
O	meat
O	on
O	my
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	flew
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	its
O	nest
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	.
O	The
O	merchants
O	began
O	shouting
O	to
O	frighten
O	the
O	eagles
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	forced
O	the
O	birds
O	to
O	quit
O	their
O	prey
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	nest
O	where
O	I
O	was
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	the
O	man
O	was
O	frightened
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	me
O	there
O	,
O	but
O	after
O	recovering
O	himself
O	,
O	asked
O	me
O	how
O	I
O	got
O	there
O	.
O	I
O	told
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	merchants
O	my
O	story
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	opened
O	my
O	bag
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	declared
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	diamonds
O	of
O	equal
O	luster
O	and
O	size
O	with
O	mine
O	.
O	The
O	merchants
O	having
O	gathered
O	their
O	diamonds
O	together
O	,
O	we
O	left
O	the
O	place
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	crossed
O	the
O	mountains
O	until
O	we
O	reached
O	a
O	port
O	.
O	We
O	there
O	took
O	ship
O	and
O	proceeded
O	to
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	Roha
O	.
O	At
O	that
O	place
O	I
O	exchanged
O	some
O	of
O	my
O	diamonds
O	for
O	other
O	merchandise
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	went
O	on
O	to
O	Balsora
O	.
O	From
O	Balsora
O	I
O	reached
O	my
O	native
O	city
O	,
O	Bagdad
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	lived
O	easily
O	upon
O	the
O	vast
O	riches
O	I
O	had
O	won
O	.
O	THE
O	THIRD
O	VOYAGE
O	I
O	soon
O	resolved
O	upon
O	a
O	third
O	voyage
O	,
O	and
O	once
O	more
O	took
O	ship
O	at
O	Balsora
O	.
O	After
O	we
O	had
O	been
O	at
O	sea
O	a
O	few
O	weeks
O	,
O	we
O	were
O	overtaken
O	by
O	a
O	dreadful
O	storm
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	obliged
O	to
O	cast
O	anchor
O	near
O	an
O	island
O	which
O	the
O	captain
O	had
O	endeavored
O	to
O	avoid;
O	for
O	he
O	assured
O	us
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	inhabited
O	by
O	pigmy
O	savages
O	,
O	covered
O	with
O	hair
O	,
O	who
O	would
O	speedily
O	attack
O	us
O	in
O	great
O	numbers
O	.
O	Soon
O	an
O	innumerable
O	multitude
O	of
O	frightful
O	savages
O	,
O	about
O	two
O	feet
O	high
O	,
O	boarded
O	the
O	ship
O	.
O	Resistance
O	was
O	useless
O	.
O	They
O	took
O	down
O	our
O	sails
O	,
O	cut
O	our
O	cable
O	,
O	towed
O	the
O	ship
O	to
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	us
O	all
O	go
O	on
O	shore
O	.
O	We
O	went
O	towards
O	the
O	interior
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	and
O	discovered
O	a
O	large
O	building
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	lofty
O	palace
O	,
O	having
O	a
O	gate
O	of
O	ebony
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	pushed
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	discovered
O	a
O	room
O	in
O	which
O	were
O	human
O	bones
O	and
O	roasting
O	spits
O	.
O	Presently
O	there
O	appeared
O	a
O	hideous
O	black
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	as
O	tall
O	as
O	a
O	palm
O	tree
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	but
O	one
O	eye
O	,
O	his
O	teeth
O	were
O	long
O	and
O	sharp
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	nails
O	like
O	the
O	talons
O	of
O	a
O	bird
O	.
O	He
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	as
O	I
O	would
O	a
O	kitten
O	,
O	but
O	finding
O	I
O	was
O	little
O	better
O	than
O	skin
O	and
O	bone
O	,
O	put
O	me
O	down
O	with
O	contempt
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	,
O	being
O	the
O	fattest
O	of
O	the
O	party
O	,
O	was
O	sacrificed
O	to
O	his
O	appetite
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	monster
O	had
O	finished
O	his
O	meal
O	he
O	stretched
O	himself
O	upon
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	bench
O	in
O	the
O	portico
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	,
O	snoring
O	louder
O	than
O	thunder
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	manner
O	he
O	slept
O	till
O	morning
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	he
O	went
O	out
O	.
O	I
O	said
O	to
O	my
O	companions
O	:
O	""""
O	Do
O	not
O	waste
O	time
O	in
O	useless
O	sorrow;
O	let
O	us
O	hurry
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	timber
O	to
O	make
O	rafts
O	.
O	""""
O	We
O	found
O	some
O	timber
O	on
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	and
O	labored
O	hard;
O	but
O	having
O	no
O	tools
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	evening
O	before
O	we
O	had
O	finished;
O	and
O	while
O	we
O	were
O	on
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	pushing
O	the
O	raft
O	off
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	our
O	hideous
O	tyrant
O	returned
O	and
O	drove
O	us
O	to
O	his
O	palace
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	we
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	flock
O	of
O	sheep
O	.
O	We
O	saw
O	another
O	of
O	our
O	companions
O	sacrificed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	giant
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	sleep
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	Our
O	desperate
O	condition
O	gave
O	us
O	courage;
O	nine
O	of
O	us
O	got
O	up
O	very
O	softly
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	the
O	points
O	of
O	the
O	roasting
O	spits
O	in
O	the
O	fire
O	until
O	we
O	made
O	them
O	red-hot;
O	we
O	then
O	thrust
O	them
O	at
O	once
O	into
O	the
O	monster
O	'
O	s
O	eye
O	.
O	He
O	uttered
O	a
O	frightful
O	scream
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	tried
O	in
O	vain
O	to
O	find
O	us
O	,
O	opened
O	the
O	ebony
O	gate
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	We
O	did
O	not
O	stay
O	long
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	ran
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	got
O	our
O	rafts
O	ready
O	,
O	and
O	waited
O	for
O	daylight
O	to
O	embark
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	dawn
O	we
O	beheld
O	our
O	monstrous
O	enemy
O	,
O	led
O	by
O	two
O	giants
O	of
O	equal
O	size
O	,
O	and
O	followed
O	by
O	many
O	others
O	.
O	We
O	jumped
O	upon
O	our
O	rafts
O	,
O	and
O	pushed
O	them
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	the
O	tide
O	helping
O	us
O	.
O	The
O	giants
O	seeing
O	us
O	likely
O	to
O	escape
O	,
O	tore
O	great
O	pieces
O	of
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	wading
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	up
O	to
O	their
O	waists
O	,
O	hurled
O	them
O	at
O	us
O	with
O	all
O	their
O	might
O	.
O	They
O	sank
O	every
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	rafts
O	but
O	that
O	on
O	which
O	I
O	was;
O	thus
O	all
O	my
O	companions
O	,
O	except
O	two
O	,
O	were
O	drowned
O	.
O	We
O	rowed
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	we
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	reach
O	of
O	these
O	monsters
O	.
O	We
O	were
O	at
O	sea
O	two
O	days
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	found
O	a
O	pleasant
O	island
O	.
O	After
O	eating
O	some
O	fruit
O	,
O	we
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	sleep
O	,
O	but
O	were
O	soon
O	awakened
O	by
O	the
O	hissing
O	of
O	an
O	enormous
O	serpent
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	my
O	comrades
O	was
O	instantly
O	devoured
O	by
O	this
O	terrific
O	creature
O	.
O	I
O	climbed
O	up
O	a
O	tree
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	reached
O	the
O	topmost
O	branches;
O	my
O	remaining
O	companion
O	was
O	following
O	me
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	dreadful
O	reptile
O	entwined
O	itself
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	caught
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	serpent
O	then
O	went
O	down
O	and
O	glided
O	away
O	.
O	I
O	waited
O	until
O	late
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	before
O	I
O	ventured
O	to
O	descend
O	.
O	Evening
O	again
O	approached
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	gathered
O	together
O	a
O	great
O	quantity
O	of
O	small
O	wood
O	,
O	brambles
O	,
O	and
O	thorns
O	.
O	Having
O	made
O	them
O	into
O	fagots
O	,
O	I
O	formed
O	a
O	circle
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	fastened
O	the
O	uppermost
O	to
O	the
O	branches
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	climbed
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	highest
O	branches
O	.
O	At
O	night
O	the
O	serpent
O	came
O	again
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	reach
O	the
O	tree;
O	and
O	crawling
O	vainly
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	my
O	little
O	fortification
O	until
O	daylight
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	away
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	I
O	spied
O	a
O	ship
O	in
O	full
O	sail
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	off
O	.
O	With
O	the
O	linen
O	of
O	my
O	turban
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	signal
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	perceived
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	taken
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	ship
O	and
O	there
O	told
O	my
O	adventures
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	was
O	very
O	kind
O	to
O	me
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	some
O	bales
O	of
O	goods
O	which
O	had
O	belonged
O	to
O	a
O	merchant
O	who
O	had
O	unintentionally
O	left
O	him
O	some
O	time
O	ago
O	on
O	an
O	uninhabited
O	island
O	.
O	As
O	this
O	man
O	was
O	undoubtedly
O	dead
O	,
O	he
O	intended
O	to
O	sell
O	the
O	goods
O	for
O	the
O	benefit
O	of
O	his
O	relatives
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	the
O	profit
O	of
O	selling
O	them
O	.
O	I
O	now
O	recollected
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	captain
O	with
O	whom
O	I
O	sailed
O	on
O	my
O	second
O	voyage
O	.
O	I
O	soon
O	convinced
O	him
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	really
O	Sindbad
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	supposed
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	lost
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	delighted
O	at
O	the
O	discovery
O	,
O	and
O	eagerly
O	acknowledged
O	that
O	the
O	property
O	was
O	mine
O	.
O	I
O	continued
O	my
O	voyage
O	,
O	sold
O	my
O	goods
O	to
O	great
O	advantage
O	,
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	Bagdad
O	.
