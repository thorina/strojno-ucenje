O	one
O	whose

O	had
O	become
O	stout
O	enough
O	to
O	enable
O	him
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	nest

O	took
O	his

O	at

O	he
O	got

O	expert
O	on
O	the

O	to
O	set
O	out
O	on

O	Finding

O	,
O	venting
O	an
O	abundance

O	White

O	much

O	good
O	advice

O	telling
O	him
O	what
O	kind

O	cure
O	his
O	wounds
O	,
O	Gray

O	dismissed
O	White
O	Owl
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	four
O	brothers
O	and
O	sisters
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	supper
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	betimes
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	before
O	the
O	household
O	had
O	fairly
O	rubbed
O	the
O	cobwebs
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	corners
O	of
O	their
O	eyes
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	knock
O	at
O	the
O	front
O	door
O	--
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	dry
O	branch
O	that
O	lay
O	down
O	before
O	the
O	hollow
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	in
O	which
O	they
O	lodged
O	--
O	and
O	being
O	called
O	to
O	come
O	in
O	,
O	who
O	should
O	make
O	their
O	appearance
O	but
O	the
O	two
O	nest-mates
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	just
O	returned
O	from
O	the
O	South
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	wintering
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	great
O	rejoicing
O	over
O	their
O	return
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	happily
O	re-united
O	,
O	each
O	one
O	soon
O	chose
O	a
O	mate
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	keep
O	house
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	for
O	himself
O	.
O	Spring
O	had
O	now
O	revisited
O	the
O	North
O	.
O	The
O	cold
O	winds
O	had
O	all
O	blown
O	themselves
O	away
O	,
O	the
O	ice
O	had
O	melted
O	,
O	the
O	streams
O	were
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	smiled
O	as
O	they
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	blue
O	sky
O	once
O	more
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	forests
O	,
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	,
O	in
O	their
O	green
O	mantle
O	,
O	echoed
O	every
O	cheerful
O	sound
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	is
O	in
O	vain
O	that
O	spring
O	returns
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	Nature
O	is
O	opened
O	in
O	bounty
O	,
O	if
O	we
O	are
O	not
O	thankful
O	to
O	the
O	Master
O	of
O	Life
O	,
O	who
O	has
O	preserved
O	us
O	through
O	the
O	winter
O	.
O	Nor
O	does
O	that
O	man
O	answer
O	the
O	end
O	for
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	made
O	who
O	does
O	not
O	show
O	a
O	kind
O	and
O	charitable
O	feeling
O	to
O	all
O	who
O	are
O	in
O	want
O	or
O	sickness
O	,
O	especially
O	to
O	his
O	blood

O	.
O	The
O	love
O	and
O	harmony
O	of
O	Gray
O	Eagle
O	and
O	his
O	brothers
O	continued
O	.
O	They
O	never

O	Every

O	(

O	the
O	time
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	found
O	their
O	wounded
O	elder

O	)
O	,

O	a
O	meeting
O	in
O	the
O	hollow

O	sycamore-tree
O	,
O	when

O	,
O	about
