O	The
O	Caliph
O	Haroun
O	Alrashid
O	one
O	day
O	sent
O	for
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	me
O	I
O	must
O	bear
O	a
O	present
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Serindib
O	.
O	I
O	ventured
O	to
O	protest
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	my
O	age
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	persuade
O	him
O	to
O	give
O	up
O	his
O	plan
O	.
O	I
O	arrived
O	at
O	Serindib
O	,
O	and
O	prayed
O	an
O	audience
O	with
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	conducted
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	with
O	great
O	respect
O	,
O	and
O	delivered
O	to
O	the
O	monarch
O	the
O	Caliph
O	'
O	s
O	letter
O	and
O	present
O	.
O	The
O	present
O	consisted
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	ingenious
O	and
O	valuable
O	works
O	of
O	art
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	the
O	King
O	was
O	exceedingly
O	delighted
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	also
O	pleased
O	to
O	acknowledge
O	how
O	much
O	he
O	esteemed
O	my
O	services
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	departed
O	,
O	the
O	monarch
O	bestowed
O	on
O	me
O	some
O	rich
O	gifts;
O	but
O	the
O	ship
O	had
O	not
O	long
O	been
O	at
O	sea
O	,
O	before
O	it
O	was
O	attacked
O	by
O	pirates
O	,
O	who
O	seized
O	the
O	vessel
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	us
O	away
O	as
O	slaves
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	sold
O	to
O	a
O	merchant
O	.
O	When
O	my
O	master
O	found
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	use
O	the
O	bow
O	and
O	arrow
O	with
O	skill
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	me
O	upon
O	an
O	elephant
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	me
O	to
O	a
O	vast
O	forest
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	My
O	master
O	ordered
O	me
O	to
O	climb
O	a
O	high
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	wait
O	there
O	until
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	troop
O	of
O	elephants
O	pass
O	by
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	then
O	to
O	shoot
O	at
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	fell
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	and
O	give
O	the
O	merchant
O	notice
O	.
O	Having
O	given
O	me
O	these
O	directions
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	bag
O	of
O	provisions
O	,
O	he
O	left
O	me
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morning
O	of
O	the
O	second
O	day
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	elephants
O	.
O	I
O	succeeded
O	in
O	shooting
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	the
O	others
O	went
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	and
O	told
O	my
O	employer
O	,
O	who
O	praised
O	my
O	work
O	.
O	We
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	dug
O	a
O	hole
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	elephant
O	was
O	to
O	remain
O	until
O	it
O	decayed
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	teeth
O	free
O	.
O	I
O	continued
O	this
O	trade
O	nearly
O	two
O	months
O	,
O	and
O	killed
O	an
O	elephant
O	almost
O	every
O	day
O	.
O	One
O	morning
O	all
O	the
O	elephants
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	tree
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	and
O	trumpeted
O	dreadfully
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	fastened
O	his
O	trunk
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	tore
O	it
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	roots
O	.
O	I
O	fell
O	with
O	the
O	tree;
O	the
O	animal
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	with
O	his
O	trunk
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	me
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	his
O	troop
O	,
O	he
O	brought
O	me
O	to
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	he
O	gently
O	laid
O	me
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	all
O	went
O	away
O	.
O	I
O	discovered
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	upon
O	a
O	large
O	broad
O	hill
O	,
O	covered
O	all
O	over
O	with
O	the
O	bones
O	and
O	teeth
O	of
O	elephants
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	soon
O	convinced
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	their
O	burying-place
O	.
O	I
O	reached
O	the
O	city
O	once
O	more;
O	my
O	master
O	thought
O	I
O	was
O	lost
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	torn
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	my
O	bow
O	and
O	arrows
O	.
O	I
O	told
O	him
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	hill
O	.
O	We
O	loaded
O	the
O	elephant
O	on
O	which
O	we
O	had
O	come
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	collected
O	more
O	teeth
O	than
O	a
O	man
O	could
O	have
O	obtained
O	in
O	his
O	whole
O	life
O	.
O	The
O	merchant
O	told
O	me
O	that
O	not
O	only
O	he
O	himself
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	whole
O	city
O	,
O	was
O	indebted
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	return
O	to
O	my
O	own
O	country
O	with
O	sufficient
O	wealth
O	to
O	make
O	me
O	happy
O	.
O	My
O	patron
O	loaded
O	a
O	ship
O	with
O	ivory
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	merchants
O	made
O	me
O	valuable
O	presents
O	.
O	I
O	reached
O	Balsora
O	and
O	landed
O	my
O	ivory
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	to
O	be
O	more
O	valuable
O	than
O	I
O	had
O	expected
O	.
O	I
O	set
O	out
O	with
O	caravans
O	to
O	travel
O	overland
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	reached
O	Bagdad
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	presented
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	Caliph
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	my
O	embassy
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	astonished
O	at
O	my
O	adventure
O	with
O	the
O	elephants
O	that
O	he
O	ordered
O	the
O	narrative
O	of
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	written
O	in
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	and
O	to
O	be
O	deposited
O	in
O	his
O	treasury
O	.
