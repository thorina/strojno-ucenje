O	When
O	we
O	consider
O	the
O	American
O	Revolution
O	,
O	we
O	are
O	apt
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	as
O	a
O	great
O	war
O	which
O	all
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	of
O	the
O	Colonies
O	rose
O	up
O	against
O	Great
O	Britain
O	,
O	determined
O	,
O	no
O	matter
O	what
O	might
O	be
O	the
O	hardships
O	and

O	,
O	no

O	the

O	,
O	to
O	achieve
O	their
O	independence
O	and
O	the

O	to
O	govern
O	themselves
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	was
O	not
O	the
O	case
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	majority
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	Colonies
O	were
O	ardently
O	in
O	favor
O	of
O	independence
O	;
O	but
O	there
O	were
O	also
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	people
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	have
O	no
O	right
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	were
O	not
O	very
O	good
O	people
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	as
O	well
O	satisfied
O	that
O	their
O	country
O	should
O	be
O	a
O	colony
O	of
O	Great
O	Britain
O	as
O	the
O	Canadians
O	are
O	now
O	satisfied
O	with
O	that
O	state
O	of
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	were
O	earnestly
O	and
O	honestly
O	opposed
O	to
O	any
O	separation
O	from
O	the
O	mother
O	country
O	.
O	This
O	difference
O	of
O	opinion
O	was
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	great
O	trouble
O	and
O	bloodshed
O	among
O	the
O	colonists
O	themselves
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	contests
O	between
O	the
O	Tories
O	and
O	the
O	Whigs
O	were
O	nowhere
O	more
O	bitter
O	than
O	in
O	New
O	Jersey
O	.
O	In
O	some
O	parts
O	of
O	the
O	Colony
O	,
O	families
O	were
O	divided
O	against
O	themselves
O	;
O	and
O	not
O	only
O	did
O	this
O	result
O	in
O	quarrels

O	but
O	fathers
O	and
O	sons
O	,
O	and
O	brothers
O	and
O	brothers
O	,
O	fought
O	against

O	other
O	.
O	At
O	one
O	time
O	the
O	Tories
O	,
O	or
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	be
O	called

O	were
O	in
O	such
O	numbers
O	that
O	they
O	took
O	possession
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	of
O	Freehold
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	it
O	for
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	week
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	town
O	was
O	retaken
O	by
O	the
O	patriotic
O	forces
O	,
O	most
O	of
O	them
O	being
O	neighbors
O	and
O	friends
O	of
O	the
O	refugees
O	,
O	several
O	prominent
O	Tories
O	were
O	hanged
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	others
O	sent
O	to
O	prison
O	.
O	The
O	feeling
O	between
O	the
O	Americans
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	different
O	parties
O	was
O	more
O	violent
O	than
O	that
O	between
O	the
O	patriots
O	and
O	the
O	British
O	troops
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	long
O	it
O	became
O	entirely
O	unsafe
O	for
O	any
O	Tory
O	to
O	remain
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	home
O	in
O	New
O	Jersey
O	.
O	Many
O	of
O	them
O	went
O	to
O	New
O	York
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	patriotic
O	feeling
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	strong
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	they
O	formed
O	themselves
O	into
O	a
O	regular
O	military
O	company
O	called
O	the
O	``
O	Associated
O	Loyalists
O	``
O	;
O	and
O	this
O	company
O	was
O	commanded

O	,
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	Benjamin

O	been
O	appointed
O	Governor
O	of
O	New
O	Jersey
O	by
O	the
O	British
O	Crown
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	now
O	regarded
O	with
O	great
O	hatred
O	by
O	the
O	patriots

O	,
O	because

O	This

O	of
O	opinion
O	between

O	was
O	a
O	refugee
O	,
O	to
O	whom
O	they
O	applied
O	some
O	very
O	strong
O	language
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	hiding
O	somewhere
O	about
O	here
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	seen
O	him
O	spying
O	at
O	them
O	with
O	a
O	glass
O	from
O	behind
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	afterwards
O	watched
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	entered
O	this
O	house
O	.
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Morris
O	declared
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	entirely
O	mistaken
O	;
O	that
O	the
O	person
O	they
O	had
O	seen
O	was
O	no
O	one
O	but
O	her
O	son
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	gone
O	out
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	them
O	as
O	any
O	boy
O	might
O	do
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	was
O	perfectly
O	innocent
O	of
O	any
O	designs
O	against
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	men
O	may
O	have
O	been
O	satisfied
O	with
O	this
O	explanation
O	with
O	regard
O	to
O	her
O	son
O	;
O	but
O	they
O	asserted
O	that
O	they
O	knew
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	refugee
O	concealed
O	somewhere
O	in
O	that
O	neighborhood
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	believed
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	an
O	empty
O	house
O	near
O	by
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	told
O	she
O	had
O	the
O	key
O	.
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Morris
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	given
O	a
O	signal
O	,
O	previously
O	agreed
O	upon
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	man
O	in
O	the
O	``
O	Auger
O	Hole
O	,
O	``
O	to
O	keep
O	very
O	quiet
O	,
O	wished
O	to
O	gain
O	as
O	much
O	time
O	as
O	possible
O	,
O	and
O	exclaimed
O	:
O	``
O	Bless
O	me
O	!
O	I
O	hope
O	you
O	are
O	not
O	Hessians
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Do
O	we
O	look
O	like
O	Hessians
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	rudely
O	.
O	``
O	Indeed
O	,
O	I
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	know
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Did
O	you
O	ever
O	see
O	a
O	Hessian
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	No
O	,
O	never
O	in
O	my
O	life
O	;
O	but
O	they
O	are
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	you
O	are
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	may
O	be
O	Hessians
O	,
O	for
O	anything
O	I
O	know
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	with
O	you
O	into
O	Colonel
O	Cox
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	,
O	though
O	indeed
O	it
O	was
O	my
O	son
O	at
O	the
O	mill
O	;
O	he
O	is
O	but
O	a
O	boy
O	,
O	and
O	meant
O	no
O	harm
O	;
O	he
O	wanted
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	troops
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	she
O	took
O	the
O	key
O	of
O	the
O	empty
O	house
O	referred
O	to
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	in
O	ahead
O	of
O	the
O	men
O	,
O	who
O	searched
O	the
O	place
O	thoroughly
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	finding
O	no
O	place
O	where
O	anybody
O	could
O	be
O	,
O	they
O	searched
O	one
O	or
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	houses
O	adjoining
O	;
O	but
O	for
O	some
O	reason
O	they
O	did
O	not

O	to
O	go
O	through
O	Mrs

O	Morris
O	'
O	s
O	own

O	.
O	Had
O	they
O	done
O	so
O	,
O	it
O	,
O	is
O	not
O	probable
O	that
O	the
O	good
O	lady
O	could
O	have
O	retained
O	her
O	composure
O	,

O	linen
O	closet

O	Further

O	friends
O	,
O	several
O	of
O	whom
O	were
O	living

O	with

O	executed
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	Mrs

O	Morris
O	found
O	an
O	opportunity
O	of
O	showing

O	that
O	,
O	although
O	in
O	principle
O	she

O	good
O	,
O	kind
O	Quaker
O	lady
O	ready
O	to
O	give

O	she
O	favored

O	to

O	Some
O	of

O	up
O	the

O	in
O	the
O	gunboats

O	and
O	in
O	many
O	cases
O	the
O	soldiers
O	brought
O	their
O	wives
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	probably
O	as
O	cooks
O	--
O	were
O	taken
O	sick
O	during
O	that
O	summer
O	;
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	these
O	invalids
O	stopped
O	at
O	Burlington
O	,
O	being
O	unable
O	to
O	proceed
O	farther
O	.
O	Here
O	,
O	to
O	their
O	surprise
O	,
O	they
O	found
O	no
O	doctors
O	;
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	patriots
O	of
O	that
O	profession
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	the
O	army
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Tory
O	physician
O	had
O	departed
O	to
O	the
O	British
O	lines
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	as
O	is
O	well
O	known
O	,
O	the
O	women
O	in
O	the
O	early
O	days
O	of
O	New
O	Jersey
O	were
O	often
O	obliged
O	to
O	be
O	physicians
O	;
O	and
O	among
O	the
O	good
O	housewives
O	of
O	Burlington
O	,
O	who
O	knew
O	all
O	about
O	herb
O	teas
O	,
O	homemade
O	plasters
O	,
O	and
O	potions
O	,
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Morris
O	held
O	a
O	high
O	position
O	.
O	The
O	sick
O	Continentals
O	were
O	told
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	just
O	as
O	good
O	as
O	a
O	doctor
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	besides
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	kind
O	woman
O	,
O	always
O	ready
O	to
O	help
O	the
O	sick
O	and
O	suffering
O	.
O	So
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	sick
O	soldiers
O	came
O	to
O	her
O	;
O	and
O	from
O	what
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Morris
O	wrote
O	,
O	one
O	or
O	two
O	of
O	them
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	the
O	same
O	men
O	who
O	had
O	previously
O	come
O	to
O	her
O	house
O	and
O	threatened
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	her
O	boy
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	looking
O	at
O	them
O	with
O	a
O	spyglass
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	they
O	very
O	meekly
O	and
O	humbly
O	asked
O	her
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	attend
O	their
O	poor
O	comrades
O	who
O	were
O	unable
O	to
O	move
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Morris
O	thought
O	this
O	was
O	some
O	sort
O	of
O	a
O	trick
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	wanted
O	to
O	get
O	her
O	on
O	board
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	gunboats
O	,
O	and
O	carry
O	her
O	away
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	she
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	sick
O	people
O	were
O	in
O	a
O	house
O	in
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	she
O	consented
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	do
O	what
O	she
O	could
O	.
O	So
O	she
O	took
O	her
O	bottles
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	boxes
O	and
O	her
O	herbs
O	,
O	and
O	visited
O	the
O	sick
O	people
O	,
O	several
O	of
O	whom
O	she
O	found
O	were
O	women
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	all
O	afflicted
O	with
O	some
O	sort
O	of
O	a
O	fever
O	,
O	probably
O	of
O	a
O	malarial
O	kind
O	,
O	contracted
O	from
O	living
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	on
O	board
O	of
O	boats
O	without
O	proper
O	protection
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	knowing
O	just
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	such
O	cases
O	,
O	she
O	,
O	to
O	use
O	her
O	own
O	expression
O	,
O	``
O	treated
O	them
O	according
O	to
O	art
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	they
O	all
O	recovered
O	.
O	What
O	happened
O	in
O	consequence
O	of
O	this
O	hospital
O	work
O	for
O	those
O	whom
O	she
O	considered
O	her
O	enemies
O	,
O	is
O	thus
O	related
O	by
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Morris
O	:
O	``
O	I

O	all
O	my
O	pay
O	when
O	they
O	thankfully
O	acknowledged
O	all
O	my
O	kindness
O	,
O	but
O	lo
O	!
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	afterwards
O	,
O	a
O	very
O	rough
O	,
O	ill-looking
O	man
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	asked
O	for
O	me
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	drew
O	me
O	aside
O	and
O	asked
O	me
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	any
O	friends
O	in
O	Philadelphia
O	.
O	The
O	question
O	alarmed
O	me
O	,
O	supposing
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	some
O	mischief
O	meditated
O	against
O	that
O	poor
O	city
O	;
O	however
O	,
O	I
O	calmly
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	I
O	have
O	an
O	ancient
O	father-in-law
O	,
O	some
O	sisters
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	near
O	friends
O	there
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Well
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	man
O	,
O	'
O	do
O	you
O	wish
O	to
O	hear
O	from
O	them
O	,
O	or
O	send
O	anything
O	by
O	way
O	of
O	refreshment
O	to
O	them
O	?
O	If
O	you
O	do
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	take
O	charge
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	bring
O	you
O	back
O	anything
O	you
O	may
O	send
O	for
O	.
O	'
O	I
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	surprised
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	he
O	only
O	wanted
O	to
O	get
O	provisions
O	to
O	take
O	to
O	the
O	gondolas
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	told
O	me
O	his
O	wife
O	was
O	one
O	I
O	had
O	given
O	medicine
O	to
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	thing
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	to
O	pay
O	me
O	for
O	my
O	kindness
O	.
O	My
O	heart
O	leaped
O	for
O	joy
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	set
O	about
O	preparing
O	something
O	for
O	my
O	dear
O	absent
O	friends
O	.
O	A
O	quarter
O	of
O	beef
O	,
O	some
O	veal
O	,
O	fowls
O	,
O	and
O	flour
O	,
O	were
O	soon
O	put
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	about
O	midnight
O	the
O	man
O	came
O	and
O	took
O	them
O	away
O	in
O	his
O	boat
O	.
O	``
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Morris
O	was
O	not
O	mistaken
O	in
O	trusting
O	to
O	the
O	good
O	intentions
O	of
O	this
O	grateful
O	Continental
O	soldier
O	,
O	for
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	says
O	,
O	two
O	nights
O	later
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	loud
O	knocking
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	:
O	``
O	Opening
O	the
O	chamber
O	window
O	,
O	we
O	heard
O	a
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	voice
O	saying
O	,
O	'
O	Come
O	down
O	softly
O	and
O	open
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	but
O	bring
O	no
O	light
O	.
O	'
O	There
O	was
O	something
O	mysterious
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	call
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	concluded
O	to
O	go
O	down
O	and
O	set
O	the
O	candle
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen
O	.
O	When
O	we
O	got
O	to
O	the
O	front
O	door
O	we
O	asked
O	,
O	'
O	Who
O	are
O	you
O	?
O	'
O	The
O	man
O	replied
O	,
O	'
O	A
O	friend
O	;
O	open
O	quickly
O	'
O	:
O	so
O	the
O	door
O	was
O	opened
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	should
O	it
O	be
O	but
O	our
O	honest
O	gondola
O	man
O	with
O	a
O	letter
O	,
O	a
O	bushel
O	of
O	salt
O	,
O	a
O	jug
O	of
O	molasses
O	,
O	a
O	bag
O	of
O	rice
O	,
O	some
O	tea
O	,
O	coffee
O	,
O	and
O	sugar
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	cloth
O	for
O	a
O	coat
O	for
O	my
O	poor
O	boys
O	--
O	all
O	sent
O	by
O	my
O	kind
O	sisters
O	.
O	How
O	did
O	our
O	hearts
O	and
O	eyes
O	overflow
O	with
O	love
O	to
O	them
O	and
O	thanks
O	to
O	our
O	Heavenly
O	Father
O	for
O	such
O	seasonable
O	supplies
O	.
O	May
O	we
O	never
O	forget
O	it
O	.
O	Being
O	now
O	so
O	rich
O	,
O	we
O	thought
O	it
O	our
O	duty
O	to
O	hand
O	out
O	a
O	little
O	to
O	the
O	poor
O	around
O	us
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	mourning
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	salt
O	,
O	so
O	we
O	divided
O	the
O	bushel
O	and
O	gave
O	a
O	pint
O	to
O	every
O	poor
O	person
O	who
O	came
O	for
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	great
O	plenty
O	for
O	our
O	own
O	use
O	.
O	``
O	As
O	the
O	war
O	drew
O	to
O	its
O	close
O	and
O	it
O	became
O	plain
O	to
O	every
O	one
O	that
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	the
O	patriots
O	must
O	triumph
O	,
O	the
O	feeling
O	between
O	the
O	two
O	parties
O	of
O	Americans
O	became
O	less
O	bitter
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	Tories
O	,
O	in
O	many
O	cases
O	,
O	saw
O	that

O	would
O	be
O	wise
O	for
