O	Little

O	wonderful

O	Whatever

O	They

O	It

O	and
O	those
O	that
O	guard
O	the
O	dark
O	places
O	under
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	The
O	rock
O	Little
O	People
O	are
O	very
O	strong
O	.
O	They
O	can
O	uproot
O	large
O	trees
O	and
O	can
O	hurl

O	to

O	The

O	Children
O	fear
O	the
O	Stone
O	Throwers
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	call
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	love
O	the
O	little
O	folk
O	that
O	help
O	the
O	flowers
O	to
O	blossom
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fruit
O	and
O	grains
O	to
O	grow
O	and
O	ripen
O	.
O	They
O	remember
O	these
O	Little
O	People
O	in
O	their
O	Feasts
O	of
O	Thanksgiving
O	,
O	for
O	do
O	the
O	_Jo
O	gah
O	oh_
O	not
O	help
O	the
O	sweet
O	waters
O	of
O	the
O	maple
O	to
O	flow
O	?
O	Do
O	they
O	not
O	whisper
O	to
O	the
O	growing
O	seeds
O	and
O	show
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	light
O	?
O	Do
O	they
O	not
O	guide
O	the
O	runners
O	of
O	the
O	strawberries
O	,
O	turn
O	the
O	blossoms
O	to
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	and
O	paint
O	the
O	berries
O	red
O	?
O	They
O	also
O	tint
O	the
O	grains
O	,
O	and
O	give
O	to
O	the
O	corn
O	its
O	good
O	taste
O	.
O	A
O	third
O	tribe
O	of
O	Little
O	People
O	dwell
O	under
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	They
O	guard
O	the
O	sacred
O	white
O	buffaloes
O	,
O	and
O	keep
O	the
O	serpent
O	monsters
O	that
O	live
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
O	below
O	from
O	coming
O	to
O	the
O	surface
O	to
O	the
O	Red
O	Children
O	.
O	There
O	are
O	trails
O	that
O	lead
O	out
O	to
O	the
O	sunlight
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	guard
O	them
O	close
O	,
O	although
O	sometimes
O	a
O	great
O	serpent
O	will
O	find
O	the
O	trail
O	of
O	a
O	spring
O	,
O	and
O	will
O	follow
O	it
O	and
O	poison
O	the
O	waters
O	.
O	Often
O	,
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	these
O	elves
O	of
O	the
O	dark
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	upper
O	world
O	to
O	dance
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	Little
O	People
O	.
O	Wherever
O	you
O	find
O	a
O	tree
O	in
O	a
O	deep
O	,
O	dark
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	around
O	which
O	no
O	grass
O	will
O	grow
O	,
O	there
O	you
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	a
O	dance
O	ring
O	has
O	been
O	formed
O	.
O	There
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	have
O	danced
O	till
O	the
O	moon
O	dropped
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	sky
O	.
