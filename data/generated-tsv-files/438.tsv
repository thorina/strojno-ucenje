O	It
O	was
O	bluebird
O	time
O	,
O	many
O	moons
O	ago
O	.
O	Little
O	brooks
O	laughed
O	and
O	danced
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	forest
O	was
O	glad
O	.
O	An
O	Indian
O	boy
O	came
O	running
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	He
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	was
O	glad
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	spring
O	!
O	As
O	he
O	ran
O	down
O	the
O	trail
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	something
O	hanging
O	from
O	a
O	bush
O	.
O	The
O	bush
O	was
O	but
O	a
O	few
O	rabbit
O	jumps
O	from
O	the
O	trail
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	stopped
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	new
O	flower
O	the
O	spring
O	had
O	brought
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	the
O	new
O	flower
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	tiny
O	papoose
O	cradle
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	picked
O	the
O	cradle
O	from
O	the
O	bush
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	palm
O	of
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	looked
O	closer
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	tiny
O	papoose
O	in
O	the
O	little
O	cradle
O	.
O	The
O	wee
O	papoose
O	laughed
O	in
O	his
O	face
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	spoke
O	to
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	so
O	tiny
O	a
O	papoose
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	take
O	it
O	home
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	cunning
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	but
O	nine
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	sure
O	she
O	would
O	like
O	one
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	there
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	place
O	for
O	the
O	tiny
O	stranger
O	in
O	their
O	wigwam
O	.
O	He
O	started
O	to
O	run
O	on
O	down
O	the
O	trail
O	,
O	but
O	something
O	seemed
O	to
O	hold
O	him
O	fast
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	away
O	.
O	Three
O	times
O	he
O	tried
O	to
O	run
O	,
O	but
O	each
O	time
O	he
O	only
O	circled
O	round
O	that
O	bush
O	.
O	Something
O	held
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	spot
O	.
O	Just
O	then
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	sharp
O	cry
O	from
O	up
O	the
O	trail
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	thought
O	some
O	animal
O	must
O	be
O	hurt
O	or
O	in
O	pain
O	.
O	He
O	turned
O	to
O	look
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	little
O	woman
O	coming
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	less
O	than
O	a
O	foot
O	high
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	ran
O	like
O	a
O	deer
O	to
O	the
O	boy
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	and
O	begged
O	him
O	to
O	give
O	back
O	her
O	baby
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	boy
O	knew
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	love
O	of
O	that
O	little
O	mother
O	that
O	had
O	held
O	him
O	fast
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	break
O	the
O	love
O	cord
O	between
O	that
O	mother
O	and
O	her
O	baby
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	boy
O	had
O	a
O	heart
O	that
O	was
O	soft
O	and
O	kind
O	.
O	He
O	liked
O	to
O	see
O	everything
O	happy
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	little
O	mother
O	crying
O	and
O	begging
O	for
O	her
O	baby
O	,
O	he
O	felt
O	sorry
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	Many
O	times
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	his
O	mother
O	tell
O	how
O	every
O	mother
O	bird
O	loves
O	her
O	young
O	;
O	every
O	mother
O	bear
O	,
O	her
O	cub
O	;
O	every
O	mother
O	deer
O	,
O	her
O	fawn
O	;
O	every
O	Indian
O	mother
O	,
O	her
O	papoose
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	knew
O	this
O	little
O	fairy
O	mother
O	must
O	also
O	love
O	her
O	fairy
O	baby
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	put
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	little
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	she
O	should
O	have
O	her
O	papoose
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	mother
O	gave
O	a
O	glad
O	cry
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	felt
O	the
O	baby
O	on
O	her
O	back
O	once
O	more
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	drew
O	a
O	stone
O	from
O	a
O	bag
O	which
O	she
O	carried
O	,
O	and
O	slipped
O	it
O	on
O	a
O	string
O	of
O	beads
O	that
O	hung
O	from
O	the
O	boy
O	'
O	s
O	neck
O	.
O	The
O	stone
O	shone
O	on
O	his
O	breast
O	like
O	a
O	dewdrop
O	.
O	``
O	Because
O	you
O	are
O	good
O	,
O	and
O	kind
O	,
O	and
O	unselfish
O	,
O	and
O	because
O	you
O	make
O	everything
O	happy
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	you
O	shall
O	wear
O	this
O	good-luck
O	stone
O	.
O	It
O	will
O	bring
O	you
O	whatever
O	you
O	want
O	.
O	``
O	We
O	Little
O	People
O	give
O	this
O	stone
O	to
O	those
O	earth
O	children
O	only
O	,
O	who
O	are
O	strong
O	and
O	yet
O	protect
O	the
O	weak
O	.
O	Wear
O	it
O	always
O	on
O	your
O	breast
O	.
O	Never
O	take
O	it
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	you
O	will
O	become
O	a
O	mighty
O	chief
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	little
O	mother
O	gave
O	another
O	glad
O	cry
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	her
O	baby
O	on
O	her
O	back
O	she
O	disappeared
O	into
O	an
O	oak
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	ran
O	on
O	.
O	His
O	heart
O	grew
O	lighter
O	and
O	the
O	stone
O	brighter
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	ran
O	.
O	Before
O	he
O	reached
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	wigwam
O	,
O	his
O	arrows
O	had
O	brought
O	back
O	game
O	for
O	their
O	evening
O	meal
O	.
O	From
O	the
O	day
O	when
O	the
O	boy
O	met
O	the
O	little
O	_Jo
O	gah
O	oh_
O	mother
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	given
O	the
O	stone
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	good
O	luck
O	.
O	Whatever
O	he
O	did
O	,
O	all
O	went
O	well
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	If
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	the
O	chase
O	,
O	he
O	brought
O	back
O	deer
O	.
O	If
O	he
O	planted
O	corn
O	,
O	it
O	grew
O	tall
O	and
O	fine
O	.
O	No
O	boy
O	could
O	throw
O	a
O	ball
O	as
O	far
O	,
O	or
O	could
O	run
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	shoot
O	his
O	arrows
O	to
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	send
O	his
O	snow-snakes
O	skimming
O	far
O	beyond
O	the
O	rest
O	.
O	So
O	lucky
O	was
O	this
O	Indian
O	boy
O	,
O	that
O	his
O	tribe
O	called
O	him
O	``
O	Luck-in-all-moons
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	He
O	wears
O	the
O	good-luck
O	stone
O	,
O	``
O	the
O	old
O	people
O	said
O	as

O	sat
O	around
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	nodded
O	their
O	heads
O	knowingly
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	never
O	knew
O	how
O	he
O	came
O	by
O	it
O	,
O	or
O	why
O	he
O	won
O	the
O	stone
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	``
O	Luck-in-all-moons
O	``
O	grew
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	his
O	tribe
O	made
O	him
O	a
O	great

O	Just
O	as
O	the
O	little
O	_Jo

O	had
O	said
O	,

O	a
O	chief
O	,
O	though
O	not
O	in
O	the
O	chieftain
O	line
O	.
O	Because
O	he
O	stood
O	so
O	strong
O	and
O	straight
O	,
O	serving
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	protecting
O	the
O	weak
O	,
O	and
O	doing
O	great
O	deeds
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	called

O	and
O	his
