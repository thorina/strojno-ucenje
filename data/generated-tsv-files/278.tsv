O	There
O	were
O	once
O	a
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	who
O	had
O	twelve
O	children
O	--
O	all
O	boys
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	one
O	day
O	the
O	king
O	told
O	his
O	wife
O	that
O	if
O	a
O	daughter
O	should
O	be
O	born
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	sons
O	must
O	die
O	--
O	that
O	their
O	sister
O	alone
O	might
O	inherit
O	his
O	kingdom
O	and
O	riches
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	twelve
O	coffins
O	made
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	shavings
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	each
O	was
O	the
O	little
O	pillow
O	for
O	the
O	dead
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	them
O	locked
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	private
O	room
O	,
O	the
O	key
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	gave
O	to
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	praying
O	her
O	not
O	to
O	speak
O	of
O	it
O	to
O	anyone
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	poor
O	mother
O	was
O	so
O	unhappy
O	that
O	she
O	wept
O	for
O	a
O	whole
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	so
O	sad
O	that
O	her
O	youngest
O	son
O	noticed
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	the
O	Bible
O	name
O	of
O	Benjamin
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	always
O	with
O	his
O	mother
O	.
O	``
O	Dear
O	mother
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	why
O	are
O	you
O	so
O	sorrowful
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	My
O	child
O	,
O	I
O	may
O	not
O	tell
O	you
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	replied
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	boy
O	allowed
O	her
O	no
O	rest
O	till
O	she
O	unlocked
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	private
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	him
O	the
O	twelve
O	coffins
O	filled
O	with
O	shavings
O	.
O	``
O	Dearest
O	Benjamin
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	``

O	should
O	ever
O	have
O	a
O	little
O	sister
O	,
O	you
O	will
O	all
O	die
O	,
O	and
O	be
O	buried
O	in
O	them
O	.
O	``
O	She
O	wept
O	bitterly
O	as
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	her
O	son
O	comforted
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,

O	``
O	Then
O	she
O	took
O	courage
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``

O	a

O	,
O	from

O	``
O	Then
O	she
O	blessed

O	went
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	while
O	each
O	in
O	turn
O	mounted
O	a

O	daily
O	,
O	to
O	watch

O	.
O	Eleven
O	days

O	saw
O	the

O	was
O	red
O	--
O	the
O	signal
O	that
O	they
O	must
O	die
O	.
O	The
O	brothers
O	were
O	angry
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Shall

O	So

O	In

O	Their

O	She
O	had
O	a

O	One
O	day
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	about
O	ten
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	she

O	little
O	sister
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	pretty
O	garden
O	around
O	the
O	house
O	in
O	which
O	they
O	lived
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	at
O	home
O	dining
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	enjoying
O	themselves
O	,
O	the
O	maiden
O	went
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	garden
O	to
O	gather
O	them
O	some
O	flowers
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	tended
O	twelve
O	lilies
O	with
O	great
O	care
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	now
O	in
O	such
O	splendid
O	bloom
O	that
O	she
O	determined
O	to
O	pluck
O	them
O	for
O	her
O	brothers
O	,
O	to
O	please
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	moment
O	she
O	gathered
O	the
O	lilies
O	,
O	her
O	twelve
O	brothers
O	were
O	changed
O	into
O	twelve
O	ravens
O	,
O	and
O	flew
O	away
O	over
O	the
O	trees
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	charming
O	house
O	and
O	garden
O	vanished
O	from
O	her
O	sight
O	.
O	Now
O	was
O	the
O	poor
O	little
O	maiden
O	left
O	all
O	alone
O	in
O	the
O	wild
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	;
O	but
O	on
O	turning
O	round
O	she
O	saw
O	a
O	curious
O	old
O	woman
O	standing
O	near
O	,
O	who
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	``
O	My
O	child
O	,
O	what
O	hast
O	thou
O	done
O	?
O	Why
O	didst
O	thou
O	not
O	leave
O	those
O	white
O	flowers
O	to
O	grow
O	on
O	their
O	stems
O	?
O	They
O	were
O	thy
O	twelve
O	brothers
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	they
O	will
O	always
O	remain
O	ravens
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Is
O	there
O	no
O	way
O	to
O	set
O	them
O	free
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	the
O	maiden
O	,
O	weeping
O	.
O	``
O	No
O	way
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	replied
O	,
O	``
O	but
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	is
O	far
O	too
O	difficult
O	for
O	thee
O	to
O	perform
O	;
O	yet
O	it
O	would
O	break
O	the
O	spell
O	and
O	set
O	them
O	free
O	.
O	Hast
O	thou
O	firmness
O	enough
O	to
O	remain
O	dumb
O	seven
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	speak
O	to
O	anyone
O	,
O	or
O	even
O	laugh
O	?
O	for
O	if
O	ever
O	you
O	utter
O	a
O	single
O	word
O	,
O	or
O	fail
O	only
O	once
O	in
O	the
O	seven
O	years
O	,
O	all
O	you
O	have
O	done
O	before
O	will
O	be
O	vain
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	this
O	one
O	word
O	your
O	brothers
O	will
O	die
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Yes
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	maiden
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	can
O	do
O	this
O	to
O	set
O	my
O	brothers
O	free
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	maiden
O	climbed
O	into
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	seating
O	herself
O	in
O	the
O	branches
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	knit
O	.
O	She
O	remained
O	here
O	,
O	living
O	on
O	the
O	fruit
O	that
O	grew
O	on
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	without
O	laughing
O	or
O	uttering
O	a
O	word
O	.
O	As
O	she
O	sat
O	in
O	her
O	tree
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	hunting
O	,
O	had
O	a
O	favourite
O	hound
O	,
O	who
O	very
O	soon
O	discovered
O	her
O	,
O	ran
O	to
O	the
O	tree
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	maiden
O	sat
O	,
O	sprang
O	up
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	barked
O	at
O	her
O	violently
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	came
O	nearer
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	beautiful
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	with
O	the
O	golden
O	star
O	on
O	her
O	forehead
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	struck
O	with
O	her
O	beauty
O	that
O	he
O	begged
O	her
O	to
O	come
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	her
O	to
O	be
O	his
O	bride
O	.
O	She
O	did
O	not
O	speak
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	but
O	merely
O	nodded
O	her
O	head
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	king
O	himself
O	climbed
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	bringing
O	her
O	down
O	,
O	seated
O	her
O	on
O	his
O	own
O	horse
O	and
O	galloped
O	away
O	with
O	her
O	to
O	his
O	home
O	.
O	The
O	marriage
O	was
O	soon
O	after
O	celebrated
O	with
O	great
O	pomp
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	bride
O	neither
O	spoke
O	nor
O	laughed
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	lived
O	happily
O	together
O	for
O	some
O	years
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	mother
O	,
O	a
O	wicked
O	woman
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	raise
O	evil
O	reports
O	about
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	``
O	It
O	is
O	some
O	beggar
O	girl
O	you
O	have
O	picked
O	up
O	.
O	Who
O	can
O	tell
O	what
O	wicked
O	tricks
O	she
O	practises
O	.
O	She
O	can
O	'
O	t
O	help
O	being
O	dumb
O	,
O	but
O	why
O	does
O	she
O	never
O	laugh
O	?
O	unless
O	she
O	has
O	a
O	guilty
O	conscience
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	king
O	at
O	first
O	would
O	listen
O	to
O	none
O	of
O	these
O	suspicions
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	urged
O	him
O	so
O	long
O	,
O	and
O	accused
O	the
O	queen
O	of
O	such
O	wicked
O	conduct
O	,
O	that
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	condemned
O	her
O	to
O	be
O	burnt
O	to
O	death
O	.
O	Now
O	in
O	the
O	court-yard
O	a
O	great
O	fire
O	was
O	kindled
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	stood
O	weeping
O	at
O	a
O	window
O	overlooking
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	still
O	loved
O	her
O	dearly
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	her
O	brought
O	forth
O	and
O	tied
O	to
O	the
O	stake
O	;
O	the
O	fire
O	kindled
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	flames
O	with
O	their
O	forked
O	tongues
O	were
O	creeping
O	towards
O	her
O	,
O	when
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	moment
O	the
O	seven
O	years
O	were
O	past
O	,
O	and
O	suddenly
O	a
O	rustling
O	noise
O	of
O	wings
O	was
O	heard
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	;
O	twelve
O	black
O	ravens
O	alighted
O	on
O	the
O	earth
O	and
O	instantly
O	assumed
O	their
O	own
O	forms
O	--
O	they
O	were
O	the
O	brothers
O	of
O	the
O	queen
O	.
O	They
O	tore
O	down
O	the
O	pile
O	and
O	extinguished
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	set
O	their
O	sister
O	free
O	,
O	and
O	embraced
O	her
O	tenderly
O	.
O	The
O	queen
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	now
O	able
O	to
O	speak
O	,
O	told
O	the
O	king
O	why
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	dumb
O	and
O	had
O	never
O	laughed
O	.
O	The
O	delight
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	only
O	equalled
O	by
O	his
O	anger
O	against
O	the
O	wicked
O	witch
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	brought
O	to
O	justice
O	and
O	ordered
O	to
O	be
O	thrown
O	into
O	a
O	vat
O	of
O	oil
O	full
O	of
O	poisonous
O	snakes
O	,
O	where
O	she
O	died
O	a
O	dreadful
O	death
O	.
