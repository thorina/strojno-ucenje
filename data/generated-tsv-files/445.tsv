O	Earl

O	a

O	,
O	whom
O	Heraud
O	of
O	Ardenne
O	,
O	his
O	tutor
O	,
O	taught
O	betimes
O	to

O	with
O	hawk
O	and
O	hound
O	by
O	wood
O	and
O	river

O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	feast
O	of
O	Pentecost
O	,
O	when
O	by

O	every

O	Guy
O	,
O	clad

O	,
O	being
O	made
O	cup-bearer
O	at
O	the

O	to
O	wash
O	her
O	finger-tips
O	before

O	.
O	Thenceforward
O	he
O	became
O	so
O	love-stricken
O	with
O	her
O	beauty
O	that
O	he
O	heard
O	not
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	glee-men
O	,
O	saw
O	neither
O	games
O	nor

O	,
O	but
O	dured
O	in
O	a
O	dream
O	,
O	like
O	one
O	crazed
O	,
O	all
O	through
O	the
O	fourteen
O	days
O	festival
O	.
O	Knights
O	and
O	fair
O	dames
O	praised
O	his
O	handsome
O	figure
O	and
O	well
O	grown
O	sinewy
O	limbs
O	;
O	he
O	heeded
O	not
O	--
O	but
O	once
O	Felice
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	courteous
O	word
O	as
O	he
O	offered
O	her
O	the
O	wine-cup
O	;
O	he
O	blushed
O	and
O	stammered
O	and
O	spilled
O	the
O	wine
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	rebuked
O	for
O	awkwardness
O	.
O	The
O	feast
O	being
O	over
O	,
O	Guy
O	went
O	away
O	to
O	his
O	chamber
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	great
O	love-sickness
O	.
O	Hopeless
O	it
O	seemed
O	for
O	a
O	vassal
O	to
O	love
O	one
O	so
O	far
O	above
O	him
O	as
O	his
O	sovereign
O	'

O	daughter
O	;
O	so
O	he
O	gave
O	himself
O	up
O	to
O	despair
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	disease
O	grew
O	so
O	sore
O	that
O	the
O	most
O	skilful
O	leeches
O	of
O	Earl
O	Rohand
O	'
O	s
O	court
O	were
O	unable

O	.
O	In

O	they
O	let
O	him

O	Night
O	came

O	he
O	become

O	he
O	scarce
O	could
O	stand

O	Now

O	Sir
O	Guy
O	'
O	s
O	strong
O	arm
O	.
O	He
O	overthrew
O	Otho
O	Duke
O	of
O	Pavia
O	,
O	Sir
O	Garie
O	the
O	Emperor
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	Regnier
O	Duke
O	of
O	Sessoyne
O	,
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Lowayne
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	more
O	,
O	till
O	not
O	a
O	man
O	was
O	left
O	who
O	dared
O	encounter
O	him
O	;
O	and
O	being
O	master
O	of
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	adjudged
O	the
O	prize
O	.
O	The
O	horse
O	and
O	hounds
O	and
O	falcon
O	he
O	sent
O	by
O	two
O	messengers
O	to
O	Felice
O	in
O	England
O	as
O	trophies
O	of
O	his
O	valour
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	knelt
O	before
O	the
O	beautiful
O	Princess
O	Blancheflor
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Lady
O	,

O	his
O	constancy
O	,
O	loaded
O	him
O	with
O	rich
O	presents
O	and
O	allowed
O	him
O	to
O	depart
O	.
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	then
O	travelled
O	through
O	Spain
O	,
O	Lombardy
O	,
O	and
O	Almayne

O	lands

O	;
O	till
O	the
O	fame
O	of

O	spread
O	over

O	.
O	So
O	a
O	year
O	passed
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	England
O	unconquered
O	,
O	and
O	renowned
O	as
O	the
O	most
O	valiant
O	knight
O	of
O	his
O	time
O	.
O	A
O	while
O	he
O	sojourned
O	in
O	London
O	with
O	King
O	Athelstan
O	,
O	who
O	rejoiced
O	to

O	Then
O	Felice
O	kissed

O	Yet

O	Sir

O	be
O	turned

O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	,
O	Sir
O	Thorold
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Urry
O	,
O	for
O	Flanders
O	.
O	Thence
O	he
O	rode
O	through
O	Spain
O	,
O	Germany
O	,
O	and
O	Lombardy
O	,
O	and
O	bore
O	away
O	the
O	prize
O	at
O	every
O	tournament
O	.
O	But
O	coming
O	into
O	Italy
O	,
O	he
O	got
O	a
O	bad
O	wound
O	jousting
O	at
O	Beneventum
O	,
O	which
O	greatly
O	weakened
O	him
O	.
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	of
O	Pavia
O	,
O	whom
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	overthrew
O	in
O	his
O	first
O	tournament
O	at
O	Rouen
O	,
O	thought
O	now
O	to
O	be
O	avenged
O	on
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	set
O	a
O	chosen
O	knight
O	,
O	Earl
O	Lombard
O	,
O	with
O	fifteen
O	other
O	knights
O	to
O	lie
O	in
O	ambush
O	in
O	a
O	wood
O	and
O	slay
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	three
O	companions
O	,
O	came
O	ambling
O	slowly
O	through
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	he
O	smarting
O	and
O	well-nigh
O	faint
O	with
O	his
O	wound
O	,
O	the
O	men
O	in
O	ambush
O	broke
O	out
O	from
O	their
O	concealment
O	and
O	called
O	on
O	him
O	to
O	yield
O	.
O	The
O	danger
O	made
O	him
O	forget
O	his
O	pain
O	,
O	and
O	straightway
O	he
O	dressed
O	his
O	shield
O	and
O	spurred
O	among
O	them
O	.
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	,
O	Sir
O	Thorold
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Urry
O	killed
O	the
O	three
O	first
O	knights
O	they
O	rode
O	against
O	.
O	Then
O	Earl
O	Lombard
O	slew
O	Sir
O	Urry
O	;
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	Hugo
O	,
O	nephew
O	to
O	Duke
O	Otho

O	laid
O	Sir
O	Thorold
O	dead
O	at
O	his
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	feet
O	.
O	Then
O	only
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	and
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	being
O	left
O	to
O	fight
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	attacked
O	Earl
O	Lombard
O	and
O	smote
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	heart
O	,
O	whilst
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	chased
O	Hugo
O	,
O	fleeing
O	like
O	a
O	hound
O	,
O	and
O	drove
O	his
O	spear
O	throughout
O	his
O	body
O	.
O	Thus
O	were
O	Sir
O	Urry
O	and
O	Sir
O	Thorold
O	avenged
O	.
O	But
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	felon
O	knights
O	,
O	called
O	Sir
O	Gunter
O	,
O	smote
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	a
O	mighty
O	stroke
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	off
O	his
O	guard
O	,
O	and
O	hewed
O	his
O	shield
O	and
O	coat
O	of
O	mail
O	in
O	pieces
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	covered
O	with
O	blood
O	and
O	lay
O	as
O	dead
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	'
O	s
O	anger
O	waxed
O	furious
O	at
O	his
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	death
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	spurred
O	his
O	horse
O	so
O	that
O	fire
O	rose
O	from
O	under
O	its
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	one
O	blow
O	of
O	his
O	sword
O	cleft
O	Sir
O	Gunter
O	from
O	his
O	helmet
O	to
O	the
O	pummel
O	of
O	his
O	saddle
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	other
O	knights
O	he
O	slew
O	them
O	all
O	except
O	Sir
O	Guichard
O	,
O	who
O	fled
O	on
O	his
O	swift
O	steed
O	to
O	Pavia
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	back
O	to
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	.
O	Heavily
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	grieved
O	for
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	three
O	friends
O	,
O	but
O	most
O	of
O	all
O	for
O	his
O	dear
O	master
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	.
O	He
O	sought
O	about
O	the
O	wood
O	until
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	hermit
O	.
O	To
O	him
O	he
O	gave
O	a
O	good
O	steed
O	,
O	charging
O	him
O	to
O	bury
O	the
O	bodies
O	of
O	Sir
O	Urry
O	and
O	Sir
O	Thorold
O	.
O	From
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	'
O	s
O	body
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	part
O	.
O	Lifting
O	the
O	old
O	knight
O	to
O	his
O	arms
O	,
O	he
O	laid
O	him
O	across
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	the
O	steed
O	by
O	the
O	bridle-rein
O	till
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	an
O	abbey
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	left
O	the
O	body
O	with
O	the
O	abbot
O	,
O	promising
O	rich
O	presents
O	in
O	return
O	for
O	giving
O	it
O	sumptuous
O	burial
O	with
O	masses
O	and
O	chants
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	departed
O	and
O	hid
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	hermit
O	'
O	s
O	cave
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	malice
O	of
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	,
O	until
O	his
O	wound
O	should
O	be
O	healed
O	.
O	Now
O	there
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	abbey
O	whither
O	Heraud
O	'
O	s
O	body
O	was
O	taken
O	,
O	a
O	monk
O	well
O	skilled
O	in
O	leech-craft
O	,
O	who
O	knew
O	the
O	virtues
O	of
O	all
O	manner
O	of
O	grasses
O	and
O	herbs
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	monk
O	,
O	finding
O	by
O	his
O	craft
O	that
O	life
O	still
O	flickered
O	in
O	the
O	body
O	,
O	nursed
O	and
O	tended
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	long
O	while
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	was
O	well
O	enough
O	to
O	travel
O	.
O	Disguised
O	as
O	a
O	palmer
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	Burgundy
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	joy
O	,
O	found
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	come
O	thither
O	meaning
O	to
O	take
O	his
O	way
O	back
O	to
O	England
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	lingered
O	still
O	,
O	till
O	Heraud
O	should
O	grow
O	stronger
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	it
O	fell
O	out
O	that
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	St
O	.
O	Omers
O	.
O	There
O	they
O	heard
O	how
O	the
O	Emperor
O	Regnier
O	had
O	come
O	up
O	against
O	Segwin
O	,
O	Duke
O	of
O	Lavayne
O	,
O	laid
O	waste
O	his
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	besieged
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	strong
O	city
O	Seysone
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	had
O	slain
O	Sadoc
O	,
O	the
O	Emperor
O	'
O	s
O	cousin
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	tournament
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	learned
O	that
O	Sadoc
O	had
O	first
O	provoked
O	Duke
O	Segwin
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	his
O	death
O	upon
O	himself
O	,
O	he
O	determined
O	to
O	help
O	Segwin
O	against
O	his
O	sovereign
O	the
O	Emperor
O	Regnier
O	.
O	He
O	therefore
O	gathered
O	fifty
O	knights
O	together
O	with
O	Heraud
O	,
O	and
O	coming
O	secretly
O	at
O	night
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Seysone
O	,
O	was
O	let
O	in
O	at
O	a
O	postern
O	gate
O	without
O	the
O	enemy
O	being
O	aware
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	after
O	mass
O	they
O	made
O	a
O	sally
O	against
O	their
O	foes
O	,
O	which
O	numbered
O	thirty
O	thousand
O	strong
O	,
O	and
O	routed
O	them
O	,
O	taking
O	many
O	noble
O	prisoners
O	.
O	Three
O	times
O	the
O	Emperor
O	came
O	against
O	the
O	Greeks
O	,
O	each
O	time
O	with
O	a
O	new
O	army
O	larger
O	than
O	before
O	.
O	Twice
O	did
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	vanquish
O	the
O	host
O	,
O	and
O	drive
O	them
O	from
O	the
O	walls
O	.
O	The
O	third
O	time
O	he
O	took
O	Sir
O	Gaire
O	,
O	the
O	Emperor
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	prisoner
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Emperor
O	Regnier
O	determined
O	,
O	since
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	take
O	the
O	place
O	by
O	assault
O	,
O	to
O	beleaguer
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	starve
O	the
O	town
O	into
O	surrender
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	while
O	his
O	army
O	was
O	set
O	down
O	before
O	the
O	walls
O	,
O	the
O	Emperor
O	hunted
O	alone
O	in
O	a
O	wood
O	hard
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	,
O	meeting
O	him
O	there
O	,
O	gathered
O	a
O	branch
O	of
O	olive
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	bending
O	to
O	the
O	Emperor
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	God
O	save
O	you
O	,
O	gentle
O	sire
O	.
O	Duke
O	Segwin
O	sendeth
O	me
O	to
O	make
O	his
O	peace
O	with
O	you
O	.
O	He
O	will
O	yield
O	you
O	all
O	his
O	lands
O	and
O	castles
O	in
O	burg
O	and
O	city
O	,
O	and
O	hold
O	them
O	of
O	you
O	henceforth
O	in
O	vassalage
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	now
O	would
O	have
O	your
O	presence
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	to
O	a
O	feast
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	Emperor
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	go
O	with
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	city
O	as
O	a
O	prisoner
O	,
O	albeit
O	he
O	was
O	served
O	with
O	the
O	humility
O	due
O	to
O	a
O	sovereign
O	both
O	by
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	and
O	Duke
O	Segwin
O	'
O	s
O	knights
O	.
O	Sir
O	Gaire
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	captive
O	nobles
O	came
O	also
O	and
O	prayed
O	for
O	peace
O	with
O	Duke
O	Segwin
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	well
O	treated
O	that
O	they
O	felt
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	truest
O	friendship
O	for
O	their
O	captor
O	.
O	So
O	it
O	befell
O	when
O	the
O	Emperor
O	found
O	himself
O	feasting
O	in
O	the
O	enemy
O	'
O	s
O	castle
O	,
O	surrounded
O	by
O	the
O	flower
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	knights
O	and
O	nobles
O	,
O	and
O	Duke
O	Segwin
O	and
O	his
O	band
O	serving
O	them
O	humbly
O	at
O	table
O	as
O	though
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	servants
O	in
O	place
O	of
O	masters
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	touched
O	by
O	their
O	generosity
O	,
O	and
O	willingly
O	agreed
O	to
O	a
O	free
O	and
O	friendly
O	peace
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	was
O	celebrated
O	by
O	the
O	Emperor
O	giving
O	Duke
O	Segwin
O	his
O	niece
O	to
O	wife
O	,
O	whilst
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Saxony
O	wedded
O	Duke
O	Segwin
O	'
O	s
O	sister
O	amid
O	great
O	rejoicings
O	.
O	Now
O	after
O	this
O	,
O	learning
O	that
O	Ernis
O	,
O	Emperor
O	of
O	Greece
O	,
O	was
O	besieged
O	in
O	Constantinople
O	his
O	capital
O	by
O	the
O	Saracens
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	levied
O	an
O	army
O	of
O	a
O	thousand
O	knights
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	assistance
O	.
O	Well
O	pleased
O	was
O	Ernis
O	at
O	so
O	timely
O	a
O	succor
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	promised
O	to
O	reward
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	by
O	making
O	him
O	heir
O	to
O	the
O	throne
O	and
O	giving
O	him
O	the
O	hand
O	of
O	his
O	only
O	daughter
O	the
O	beautiful
O	Loret
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	led
O	the
O	army
O	forth
O	from
O	the
O	city
O	against
O	the
O	Soudan
O	and
O	his
O	host
O	,
O	and
O	defeated
O	them
O	so
O	badly
O	that
O	for
O	some
O	days
O	they
O	were
O	unable
O	to
O	rally
O	their
O	men
O	for
O	another
O	encounter
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	'
O	s
O	knights
O	named
O	Sir
O	Morgadour
O	fell
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	the
O	Princess
O	Loret
O	,
O	and
O	being
O	envious
O	of
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	'
O	s
O	achievements
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	jealous
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	rival
O	,
O	he
O	sought
O	how
O	to
O	embroil
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	Emperor
O	and
O	compass
O	his
O	disgrace
O	.
O	Wherefore
O	one
O	day
O	when
O	the
O	Emperor
O	Ernis
O	was
O	gone
O	a-rivering
O	with
O	his
O	hawks
O	,
O	Sir
O	Morgadour
O	challenged
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	to
O	play
O	a
O	game
O	of
O	chess
O	in
O	the
O	Princess
O	Loret
O	'
O	s
O	chamber
O	.
O	They
O	played
O	there
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	not
O	thinking
O	of
O	treachery
O	.
O	But
O	by-and-by
O	the
O	Princess
O	entered
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Morgadour
O	after
O	greeting
O	her
O	took
O	his
O	leave
O	quickly
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	Emperor
O	Ernis
O	,
O	telling
O	him
O	how
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	was
O	alone
O	in
O	the
O	chamber
O	with
O	his
O	daughter
O	.
O	Ernis
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	paid
O	little
O	heed
O	to
O	the
O	tale
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Well
O	,
O	and
O	what
O	of
O	it
O	?
O	Loret
O	is
O	his
O	promised
O	bride
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	is
O	a
O	good
O	true
O	knight
O	.
O	Away
O	with
O	your
O	tales
O	!
O	``
O	But
O	Sir
O	Morgadour
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	baffled
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Behold
O	how
O	little
O	trust
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	placed
O	in
O	a
O	king
O	!
O	Here
O	is
O	the
O	Emperor
O	Ernis
O	mad
O	wroth
O	to
O	hear
O	you
O	were
O	alone
O	with
O	the
O	Princess
O	Loret
O	,
O	and
O	swears
O	he
O	will
O	have
O	your
O	life
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	in
O	great
O	anger
O	summoned
O	his
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	over
O	to
O	the
O	Saracens
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	,
O	he
O	met
O	the
O	Emperor
O	,
O	who
O	told
O	him
O	of
O	the
O	malice
O	of
O	Sir
O	Morgadour
O	and
O	all
O	was
O	made
O	plain
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	the
O	Saracens
O	coming
O	anew
O	against
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	went
O	forth
O	to
O	meet
O	them
O	with
O	many
O	engines
O	upon
O	wheels
O	which
O	threw
O	great
O	stones
O	quarried
O	from
O	a
O	hill
O	.
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	and
O	his
O	army
O	again
O	defeated
O	the
O	Saracens
O	,
O	insomuch
O	that
O	a
O	space
O	of
O	fifteen
O	acres
O	was
O	covered
O	so
O	thick
O	with
O	dead
O	that
O	a
O	man
O	might
O	not
O	walk
O	between
O	,
O	whilst
O	the
O	pile
O	of
O	slain
O	around
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	reached
O	breast
O	high
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	Soudan
O	and
O	his
O	host
O	withdrew
O	to
O	their
O	camps
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Morgadour
O	bethought
O	him
O	of
O	another
O	wile
O	.
O	The
O	Soudan
O	had
O	sworn
O	to
O	kill
O	every
O	Christian
O	found
O	in
O	his
O	camp
O	,
O	without
O	regard
O	to
O	flag
O	of
O	truce
O	or
O	ambassage
O	.
O	So
O	Sir
O	Morgadour
O	persuaded
O	Ernis
O	to
O	send
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	to
O	the
O	Soudan
O	saying
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	since
O	the
O	war
O	seemed
O	likely
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	no
O	speedy
O	issue
O	,
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	settled
O	by
O	single
O	combat
O	between
O	two
O	champions
O	chosen
O	from
O	the
O	Christian
O	and
O	the
O	Saracen
O	hosts
O	.
O	The
O	counsel
O	seemed
O	good
O	to
O	Ernis
O	,
O	but
O	yet
O	he
O	liked
O	not
O	to
O	risk
O	his
O	son-in-law
O	'
O	s
O	life
O	;
O	wherefore
O	he
O	called
O	his
O	Parliament
O	together
O	and
O	asked
O	for
O	some
O	bold
O	knight
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	bear
O	this
O	message
O	.
O	When
O	all
O	the
O	others
O	held
O	their
O	peace
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	demanded
O	to
O	be
O	sent
O	upon
O	the
O	business
O	,
O	neither
O	could
O	the
O	prayers
O	and
O	entreaties
O	of
O	Ernis
O	cause
O	him
O	to
O	forego
O	the
O	enterprise
O	.
O	He
O	clad
O	himself
O	in
O	iron
O	hose
O	and
O	a
O	trusty
O	hauberk
O	,
O	set
O	a
O	helm
O	of
O	steel
O	,
O	gold-circled
O	,
O	on
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	girt
O	his
O	sword
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	leapt
O	on
O	his
O	steed
O	without
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	touching
O	stirrup
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	Soudan
O	'
O	s
O	pavilion
O	.
O	He
O	well
O	knew
O	it
O	from
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	since
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	thereof
O	flashed
O	a
O	great
O	carbuncle
O	stone
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	feasting
O	the
O	Soudan
O	,
O	ten
O	kings
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	barons
O	,
O	when
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	walked
O	into
O	the
O	pavilion
O	and
O	delivered
O	his
O	message
O	with
O	great
O	roughness
O	of
O	speech
O	.
O	``
O	Seize
O	him
O	and
O	slay
O	him
O	!
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	Soudan
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	cut
O	his
O	way
O	through
O	his
O	assailants
O	and
O	rushing
O	on
O	the
O	Soudan
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	head
O	;
O	and
O	while
O	he
O	stooped
O	to
O	pick
O	up
O	the
O	trophy
O	with
O	his
O	left
O	hand
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	right
O	he
O	slew
O	six
O	Saracens
O	,
O	then
O	fought
O	his
O	passage
O	past
O	them
O	all
O	to
O	the
O	tent
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	leapt
O	upon
O	his
O	horse
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	whole
O	Saracen
O	host
O	being
O	roused
O	he
O	never
O	would
O	have
O	got
O	back
O	for
O	all
O	his
O	bravery
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	Heraud
O	within
O	the
O	city
O	saw
O	in
O	a
O	dream
O	the
O	danger
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	assembling
O	the
O	Greek
O	army

O	'
O	s
O	knights
O	,
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	rescue
O	and
O	put
O	the
O	Saracens
O	to
O	flight
O	.
O	Then
O	after
O	the
O	battle
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	came
O	in
O	triumph
O	to
O	Constantinople
O	and
O	laid
O	the
O	Soudan
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	at
O	the
O	feet
O	of
O	the
O	Emperor
O	Ernis
O	.
O	Ernis
O	now
O	,
O	being
O	at
O	peace
O	from
O	his
O	enemies
O	,
O	would
O	take
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	through
O	his
O	realms
O	.
O	On
O	their
O	way
O	they
O	saw
O	a
O	dragon
O	fighting
O	a
O	lion
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	lion
O	having
O	much
O	the
O	worst
O	of
O	the
O	combat
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	must
O	needs
O	go
O	and
O	fight
O	the
O	dragon
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	hard
O	battle
O	he
O	laid
O	the
O	monster
O	dead
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	lion
O	came
O	and
O	licked
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	his
O	deliverer
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	in
O	no
O	wise
O	depart
O	from
O	his
O	side
O	.
O	Soon
O	afterward
O	the
O	Emperor
O	Ernis
O	gathered
O	a
O	great
O	company
O	of
O	princes
O	,
O	dukes
O	,
O	earls
O	,
O	barons
O	,
O	bishops
O	,
O	abbots
O	,
O	and
O	priors
O	to
O	the
O	wedding
O	feast
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	presence
O	of
O	them
O	all
O	he
O	gave
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	to
O	be
O	ruler
O	over
O	half
O	the
O	kingdom
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	forth
O	the
O	Princess
O	Loret
O	to
O	be
O	his
O	bride
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	saw
O	the
O	wedding-ring
O	,
O	his
O	old
O	love
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	mind
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	bethought
O	him
O	of
O	Felice
O	.
O	``
O	Alas
O	!
O	``
O	he
O	cried
O	,
O	``
O	Felice
O	the
O	bright
O	and
O	beautiful
O	,
O	my
O	heart
O	misgives
O	me
O	of
O	forgetting
O	thee
O	.
O	None
O	other
O	maid
O	shall
O	ever
O	have
O	my
O	love
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	he
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	swoon
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	himself
O	he
O	pleaded
O	sudden
O	sickness
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	marriage
O	was
O	put
O	off
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	distress
O	of
O	Ernis
O	and
O	his
O	daughter
O	Loret
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	gat
O	him
O	to
O	an
O	Inn
O	.
O	Heraud
O	tended
O	him
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	learned
O	how
O	it
O	was
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	Felice
O	that
O	Guy
O	renounced
O	so
O	fair
O	a
O	bride
O	,
O	dowered
O	with
O	so
O	rich
O	a
O	kingdom
O	.
O	But
O	after
O	a
O	fortnight
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	could
O	no
O	longer
O	feign
O	illness
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	watchfullness
O	of
O	the
O	Emperor
O	and
O	the
O	Princess
O	after
O	his
O	health
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	delay
O	his
O	marriage
O	from
O	day
O	to
O	day
O	by
O	one
O	excuse
O	and
O	another
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	length
O	fortune
O	delivered
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	strait
O	.
O	The
O	lion
O	which
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	had
O	tamed
O	was
O	used
O	to
O	roam
O	about
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	grew
O	so
O	gentle
O	that
O	none
O	feared
O	him
O	and
O	none
O	sought
O	him
O	harm
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Morgadour
O	,
O	being
O	sore
O	vexed
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	all
O	his
O	plans
O	against
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	had
O	failed
O	,
O	determined
O	to
O	wreak
O	his
O	spite
O	upon
O	the
O	lion
O	.
O	He
O	therefore
O	watched
O	until
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	lion
O	asleep
O	within
O	an
O	arbour
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	wounded
O	him
O	to
O	death
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	.
O	The
O	faithful
O	beast
O	dragged
O	himself
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	'
O	s
O	chamber
O	,
O	licked
O	his
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	dead
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	.
O	But
O	a
O	little
O	maid
O	which
O	had
O	espied
O	Sir
O	Morgadour
O	told
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	who
O	had
O	slain
O	his
O	lion
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	went
O	forth
O	in
O	quest
O	of
O	Sir
O	Morgadour
O	,
O	and
O	fought
O	with
O	him
O	and
O	slew
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	forgiven
O	the
O	wrongs
O	against
O	himself
O	,
O	since
O	he
O	outwitted
O	them
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	fain
O	to
O	avenge
O	his
O	faithful
O	favourite
O	.
O	Now
O	Sir
O	Morgadour
O	was
O	steward
O	to
O	the
O	German
O	Emperor
O	Regnier
O	.
O	So
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	showed
O	Ernis
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	remained
O	longer
O	at
O	his
O	court
O	,
O	Regnier
O	would
O	surely
O	make
O	war
O	on
O	Greece
O	to
O	avenge
O	his
O	steward
O	'
O	s
O	death
O	.
O	Wherefore
O	with
O	this
O	excuse
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	departure
O	and
O	set
O	sail
O	with
O	Heraud
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	ship
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	.
O	They
O	landed
O	in
O	Germany
O	,
O	and
O	visited
O	the
O	Emperor
O	Regnier
O	without
O	telling
O	anything
O	about
O	his
O	steward
O	'
O	s
O	death
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	Lorraine
O	.
O	As
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	took
O	his
O	way
O	alone
O	through
O	a
O	forest
O	,
O	having
O	sent
O	his
O	servants
O	on
O	to
O	prepare
O	a
O	place
O	for
O	him
O	at
O	an
O	inn
O	,
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	groaning
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	in
O	pain
O	,
O	and
O	turning
O	his
O	horse
O	that
O	way
O	,
O	found
O	a
O	knight
O	sore
O	wounded
O	,
O	and
O	like
O	to
O	die
O	.
O	This
O	knight
O	was
O	named
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	,
O	and
O	served
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Lorraine
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	how
O	he
O	was
O	riding
O	through
O	the
O	wood
O	with
O	his
O	lady
O	,
O	Osile
O	,
O	when
O	fifteen
O	armed
O	men
O	beset
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	forcibly
O	carried
O	off
O	the
O	lady
O	to
O	take
O	her
O	to
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	of
O	Pavia
O	,
O	his
O	rival
O	Then
O	said
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	also
O	have
O	a
O	score
O	to
O	settle
O	with
O	Otho
O	,
O	the
O	felon
O	duke
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	he
O	took
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	'
O	s
O	arms
O	and
O	armour
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	in
O	pursuit
O	of
O	the
O	ravishers
O	whom
O	he
O	soon
O	overtook
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	slain
O	every
O	one
O	,
O	he
O	set
O	the
O	lady
O	on
O	his
O	steed
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	the
O	wounded
O	knight
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	was
O	gone
O	;
O	for
O	four
O	knights
O	of
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	'
O	s
O	band
O	had
O	come
O	and
O	carried
O	him
O	off
O	.
O	So
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	set
O	down
O	the
O	lady
O	,
O	and
O	started
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	four
O	knights
O	.
O	Having
O	fought
O	and
O	vanquished
O	them
O	,
O	he
O	set
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	on
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	returned
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	Osile
O	was
O	gone
O	.
O	He
O	searched
O	for
O	many
O	hours
O	to
O	find
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	So
O	as
O	nightfall
O	drew
O	on
O	he
O	took
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	to
O	the
O	inn
O	.
O	There
O	by
O	good
O	fortune
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	lady
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	'
O	s
O	servants
O	having
O	met
O	her
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	brought
O	her
O	with
O	them
O	to
O	await
O	his
O	coming
O	.
O	A
O	leech
O	soon
O	came
O	and
O	dressed
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	'
O	s
O	wounds
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	careful
O	tending
O	of
O	Osile
O	and
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	,
O	he
O	got
O	well
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	and
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	swore
O	brotherhood
O	in
O	arms
O	.
O	Soon
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	messenger
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	,
O	hotly
O	wroth
O	at
O	losing
O	the
O	fair
O	Osile
O	,
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	lay
O	waste
O	the
O	lands
O	of
O	Aubry
O	,
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	'
O	s
O	father
O	;
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Lorraine
O	was
O	likewise
O	helping
O	him
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	equipped
O	five
O	hundred
O	knights
O	and
O	came
O	with
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Gurmoise
O	where
O	Aubry
O	dwelt
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	well
O	ramparted
O	city
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	being
O	beaten
O	in
O	two
O	battles
O	with
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	,
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	found
O	,
O	despite
O	the
O	larger
O	numbers
O	of
O	his
O	host
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	stand
O	against
O	the
O	courage
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	army
O	and
O	the
O	valour
O	of
O	its
O	leader
O	.
O	Thinking
O	therefore
O	to
O	gain
O	Osile
O	by
O	treachery
O	,
O	he
O	sent
O	an
O	archbishop
O	to
O	Aubry
O	,
O	offering
O	peace
O	and
O	pledging
O	himself
O	to
O	confirm
O	the
O	marriage
O	of
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	and
O	Osile
O	,
O	provided
O	only
O	that
O	the
O	lovers
O	would
O	go
O	and
O	kneel
O	in
O	homage
O	to
O	their
O	sovereign
O	Duke
O	of
O	Lorraine
O	.
O	Thereon
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	and
O	his
O	bride
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	and
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	,
O	set
O	out
O	unarmed
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	wending
O	a
O	day
O	'
O	s
O	journey
O	out
O	of
O	Gurmoise
O	,
O	they
O	met
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Lorraine
O	,
O	who
O	embraced
O	and
O	kissed
O	them
O	in
O	token
O	of
O	peace
O	.
O	But
O	Otho
O	coming
O	forward
O	as
O	if
O	to
O	do
O	the
O	like
O	,
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	to
O	a
O	band
O	of
O	men
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	in
O	waiting
O	to
O	seize
O	them
O	.
O	These
O	quickly
O	surrounded
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	and
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	and
O	carried
O	them
O	off
O	;
O	but
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	with
O	only
O	his
O	fists
O	slew
O	many
O	of
O	his
O	assailants
O	,
O	and
O	broke
O	away
O	to
O	where
O	a
O	countryman
O	stood
O	with
O	a
O	staff
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	Snatching
O	this
O	for
O	a
O	weapon
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	beat
O	down
O	the
O	quickest
O	of
O	his
O	pursuers
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	his
O	escape
O	.
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	cast
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	into
O	a
O	deep
O	dungeon
O	in
O	Pavia
O	,
O	and
O	meanwhile
O	gave
O	Osile
O	a
O	respite
O	of
O	forty
O	days
O	wherein
O	to
O	consent
O	to
O	be
O	his
O	bride
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Lorraine
O	carried
O	off
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	.
O	Weary
O	and
O	hungered
O	,
O	and
O	vexed
O	at
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	friends
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	castle
O	where
O	he
O	sought
O	harbour
O	for
O	the
O	night
O	.
O	Sir
O	Amys
O	of
O	the
O	Mountain
O	,
O	who
O	dwelt
O	there
O	,
O	welcomed
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	good
O	will
O	,
O	and
O	hearing
O	his
O	adventures
O	,
O	offered
O	to
O	raise
O	an
O	army
O	of
O	fifteen
O	hundred
O	men
O	to
O	help
O	him
O	against
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	.
O	But
O	to
O	this
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	said
O	nay
O	,
O	because
O	it
O	would
O	take
O	too
O	long
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	day
O	or
O	two
O	,
O	having
O	hit
O	upon
O	a
O	plan
O	,
O	he
O	disguised
O	,
O	himself
O	by
O	staining
O	his
O	face
O	and
O	darkening
O	his
O	hair
O	and
O	beard
O	and
O	eyebrows
O	;
O	and
O	setting
O	out
O	alone
O	,
O	came
O	to
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	with
O	a
O	present
O	of
O	a
O	war-horse
O	of
O	great
O	price
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	You
O	have
O	in
O	your
O	keeping
O	a
O	dastard
O	knight
O	by
O	name
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	,
O	who
O	has
O	done
O	me
O	much
O	despite
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	would
O	fain
O	be
O	avenged
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	,
O	falling
O	into
O	the
O	trap
O	,
O	appointed
O	him
O	jailor
O	of
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	.
O	The
O	dungeon
O	wherein
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	was
O	prisoned
O	was
O	a
O	pit
O	of
O	forty
O	fathoms
O	deep
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	soon
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	spake
O	from
O	the
O	pit
O	'
O	s
O	mouth
O	bidding
O	him
O	be
O	of
O	good
O	cheer
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	would
O	certainly
O	deliver
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	a
O	false
O	Lombard
O	overheard
O	these
O	words
O	,
O	and
O	thereby
O	knowing
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	,
O	ran
O	off
O	straightway
O	to
O	tell
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	.
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	followed
O	quickly
O	and
O	sought
O	to
O	bribe
O	the
O	man
O	with
O	money
O	to
O	hold
O	his
O	peace
O	,
O	but
O	without
O	avail
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	would
O	go
O	into
O	the
O	palace
O	where
O	the
O	Duke
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	opened
O	his
O	mouth
O	to
O	tell
O	the
O	tale
O	.
O	Then
O	with
O	one
O	blow
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	slew
O	him
O	at
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	'
O	s
O	feet
O	.
O	But
O	Otho
O	,
O	very
O	wroth
O	,
O	would
O	have
O	killed
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	then
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	only
O	that
O	he
O	averred
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	a
O	certain
O	traitor
O	whom
O	he
O	found
O	carrying
O	food
O	to
O	the
O	prisoner
O	.
O	Thus
O	having
O	appeased
O	the
O	Duke
O	'
O	s
O	anger
O	,
O	he
O	gat
O	away
O	secretly
O	to
O	Osile
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	her
O	change
O	her
O	manner
O	to
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	,
O	and
O	make
O	as
O	though
O	she
O	was
O	willing
O	to
O	have
O	his
O	love
O	.
O	The
O	night
O	before
O	the
O	day
O	fixed
O	for
O	the
O	wedding
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	let
O	down
O	a
O	rope
O	to
O	Thierry
O	in
O	his
O	pit
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	drawn
O	him
O	up
O	,
O	the
O	two
O	made
O	all
O	speed
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	Sir
O	Amys
O	.
O	There
O	,
O	getting
O	equipped
O	with
O	arms
O	and
O	armour
O	,
O	they
O	leaped
O	to
O	horse
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	,
O	and
O	riding
O	back
O	to
O	Pavia
O	,
O	met
O	the
O	wedding
O	procession
O	.
O	Rushing
O	into
O	the
O	midst
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	slew
O	Otho
O	and
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	carried
O	off
O	Osile
O	,
O	whereupon
O	they
O	returned
O	to
O	Sir
O	Amys
O	with
O	light
O	hearts
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Lorraine
O	had
O	tidings
O	of
O	what
O	had
O	befallen
O	Otho
O	he
O	had
O	great
O	fear
O	of
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	back
O	with
O	costly
O	gifts
O	to
O	make
O	his
O	peace
O	.
O	So
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	and
O	Osile
O	were
O	wed
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	sumptuous
O	banquet
O	was
O	held
O	in
O	their
O	honour
O	,
O	with
O	game
O	,
O	and
O	hunting
O	,
O	and
O	hawking
O	,
O	and
O	justing
O	,
O	and
O	singing
O	of
O	glee-men
O	,
O	more
O	than
O	can
O	be
O	told
O	.
O	Now
O	as
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	went
O	a-hunting
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	he
O	rode
O	away
O	from
O	his
O	party
O	to
O	pursue
O	a
O	boar
O	of
O	great
O	size
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	boar
O	,
O	being
O	very
O	nimble
O	and
O	fleet
O	of
O	foot
O	,
O	led
O	him
O	a
O	long
O	chase
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	Flanders
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	killed
O	the
O	boar
O	he
O	blew
O	upon
O	his
O	horn
O	the
O	prize
O	.
O	Florentine
O	,
O	King
O	of
O	Flanders
O	,
O	hearing
O	it
O	in
O	his
O	palace
O	,
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Who
O	is
O	this
O	that
O	slays
O	the
O	tall
O	game
O	on
O	my
O	lands
O	?
O	``
O	And
O	he
O	bade
O	his
O	son
O	go
O	forth
O	and
O	bring
O	him
O	in
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	prince
O	coming
O	with
O	a
O	haughty
O	message
O	to
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	,
O	the
O	knight
O	struck
O	him
O	with
O	his
O	hunting-horn
O	,
O	meaning
O	no
O	more
O	than
O	chastisement
O	for
O	his
O	discourtesy
O	.
O	But
O	by
O	misadventure
O	the
O	prince
O	fell
O	dead
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	.
O	Thinking
O	no
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	mishap
O	,
O	and
O	knowing
O	not
O	who
O	it
O	was
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	slain
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	rode
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	received
O	with
O	good
O	cheer
O	at
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	table
O	.
O	But
O	presently
O	the
O	prince
O	'
O	s
O	body
O	being
O	brought
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	Guy
O	owning
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	this
O	deed
O	,
O	King
O	Florentine
O	took
O	up
O	an
O	axe
O	,
O	and
O	aimed
O	a
O	mighty
O	blow
O	at
O	the
O	slayer
O	of
O	his
O	son
O	.
O	This
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	quickly
O	avoided
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	all
O	arose
O	to
O	seize
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	smote
O	them
O	down
O	on
O	either
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	fought
O	his
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	hall
O	till
O	he
O	reached
O	his
O	steed
O	,
O	whereon
O	lightly
O	leaping
O	he
O	hasted
O	back
O	to
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	.
O	Then
O	after
O	a
O	short
O	while
O	he
O	took
O	leave
O	of
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	with
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	to
O	England
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	King
O	Athelstan
O	at
O	York
O	.
O	Scarce
O	had
O	he
O	arrived
O	there
O	when
O	tidings
O	came
O	that
O	a
O	great
O	black
O	and
O	winged
O	dragon
O	was
O	ravaging
O	Northumberland
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	destroyed
O	whole
O	troops
O	of
O	men
O	which
O	went
O	against
O	him
O	.
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	at
O	once
O	armed
O	himself
O	in
O	his
O	best
O	proven
O	armour
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	off
O	in
O	quest
O	of
O	the
O	monster
O	.
O	He
O	battled
O	with
O	the
O	dragon
O	from
O	prime
O	till
O	undern
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	from
O	undern
O	until
O	evensong
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	dragon
O	was
O	so
O	strong
O	and
O	his
O	hide
O	so
O	flinty
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	overcame
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	thrust
O	his
O	sword
O	down
O	the
O	dragon
O	'
O	s
O	throat
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	head
O	brought
O	it
O	to
O	King
O	Athelstan
O	.
O	Then
O	while
O	all
O	England
O	rang
O	with
O	this
O	great
O	exploit
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	journey
O	to
O	Wallingford
O	to
O	see
O	his
O	parents
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	were
O	dead
O	;
O	so
O	after
O	grieving
O	many
O	days
O	for
O	them
O	he
O	gave
O	his
O	inheritance
O	to
O	Sir
O	Heraud
O	,
O	and
O	hasted
O	to
O	Felice
O	at
O	Warwick
O	.
O	Proudly
O	she
O	welcomed
O	her
O	true
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	his
O	deeds
O	.
O	Then
O	laughingly
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	asked
O	,
O	should
O	he
O	go
O	another
O	quest
O	before
O	they
O	two
O	were
O	wed
O	?
O	``
O	Nay
O	,
O	dear
O	one

O	said
O	Felice
O	,
O	``
O	my

O	``
O	Then
O	he
O	kissed

O	upon
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	he
O	set
O	out
O	without
O	any
O	companion
O	for
O	the
O	Holy
O	Land
O	.
O	But
O	Felice
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	great
O	wan-hope
O	at
O	his
O	departure
O	,
O	and
O	grieved
O	continually
O	,
O	neither
O	would
O	be
O	comforted
O	;
O	for
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	have
O	brought
O	this
O	on

O	him
O	such

O	journeys
O	heretofore
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	I

O	``
O	But
O	that
O	she

O	his

O	she
O	would
O	have
O	taken
O	her
O	own
O	life
O	for
O	very
O	trouble
O	of
O	heart
O	;
O	only
O	for
O	that
O	child
O	'
O	s
O	sake
O	she
O	was
O	fain
O	to
O	live
O	and
O	mature
O	it
O	when
O	it
O	should

O	born
O	.
O	Now
O	after
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	had
O	made
O	his
O	toilsome
O	pilgrimage
O	to
O	Jerusalem
O	,
O	and
O	shrived
O	him
O	of
O	his
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	done
O	his
O	prayers
O	and
O	penances
O	about
O	the
O	holy
O	places
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	Antioch
O	.
O	Beside
O	a
O	well
O	he
O	met
O	a
O	certain
O	Earl
O	Jonas
O	,
O	whose
O	fifteen
O	sons
O	were
O	held
O	in
O	prison
O	till
O	he
O	should
O	find
O	a
O	champion
O	to
O	deliver
O	the
O	Saracen
O	Sir
O	Triamour
O	from
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	a
O	fierce
O	and
O	terrible
O	Ethiopian
O	giant
O	named
O	Amiraunt
O	.
O	So
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	took
O	arms
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	into
O	the
O	lists
O	,
O	and
O	fought
O	with
O	Amiraunt
O	and
O	slew
O	him
O	;
O	thus
O	both
O	Sir
O	Triamour
O	was
O	delivered
O	from
O	his
O	enemy
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sons
O	of
O	Earl
O	Jonas
O	were
O	restored
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	travelled
O	many
O	years
O	as
O	a
O	pilgrim
O	of
O	the
O	Cross
O	,
O	till
O	in
O	his
O	wanderings
O	,
O	chancing
O	to
O	come
O	into
O	Almayne
O	,
O	he
O	there
O	fell
O	in
O	with
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	dressed
O	in
O	palmer
O	'
O	s
O	weeds
O	,
O	made
O	sorry
O	complaint
O	.
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	told
O	how
O	a
O	knight
O	named
O	Barnard
O	inherited
O	Pavia
O	in
O	the
O	room
O	of
O	his
O	cousin
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	;
O	and
O	how
O	Barnard
O	,
O	being
O	at
O	enmity
O	with
O	him
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	slaying
O	of
O	Duke
O	Otho
O	,
O	had
O	never
O	rested
O	from
O	doing
O	him
O	mischief
O	with
O	his
O	sovereign
O	,
O	until
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Lorraine
O	dispossessed
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	lands
O	and
O	brought
O	him
O	into
O	poverty
O	.
O	Howbeit
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	would
O	not
O	reveal
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	being
O	faint
O	and
O	weary
O	,
O	laid
O	his
O	head
O	upon
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	'
O	s
O	knees
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	heaviness
O	came
O	over
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	slept
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	,
O	watching
O	him
O	,
O	saw
O	a
O	small
O	white
O	weasel
O	creep
O	out
O	from
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	sleeping
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	run
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	rivulet
O	that
O	was
O	hard
O	by
O	,
O	going
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	beside
O	the
O	bank
O	,
O	not
O	seeming
O	wistful
O	how
O	to
O	get
O	across
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	rose
O	gently
O	and
O	laid
O	his
O	sword
O	athwart
O	the
O	stream
O	from
O	bank
O	to
O	bank
O	;
O	so
O	the
O	weasel
O	passed
O	over
O	the
O	sword
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	bridge
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	a
O	hole
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	hill
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	,
O	went
O	in
O	thereat
O	.
O	But
O	presently
O	the
O	weasel
O	came
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	crossing
O	the
O	stream
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	as
O	before
O	jumped
O	into
O	the
O	sleeper
O	'
O	s
O	mouth
O	again
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	woke
O	and
O	told
O	his
O	dream
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	dreamed
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	that
O	I
O	came
O	beside
O	a
O	mighty
O	torrent
O	which
O	I
O	knew
O	not
O	how
O	to
O	pass
O	,
O	until
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	bridge
O	of
O	shining
O	steel
O	,
O	over
O	which
O	I
O	went
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	into
O	a
O	cavern
O	underground
O	,
O	and
O	therein
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	palace
O	full
O	of
O	gold
O	and
O	jewels
O	.
O	I
O	pray
O	thee
O	,
O	brother
O	palmer
O	,
O	read
O	to
O	me
O	this
O	dream
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	said
O	that
O	without
O	doubt
O	it
O	betokened
O	a
O	fair
O	treasure
O	hid
O	by
O	a
O	waterside
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	that
O	showed
O	him
O	the
O	hole
O	under
O	the
O	hill
O	whereat
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	weasel
O	go
O	in
O	.
O	There
O	they
O	digged
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	treasure
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	very
O	great
O	;
O	yet
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	would
O	have
O	no
O	share
O	therein
O	,
O	but
O	took
O	leave
O	of
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	without
O	ever
O	making
O	himself
O	known
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	Lorraine
O	the
O	duke
O	that
O	was
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	'
O	s
O	sovereign
O	.
O	Seeing
O	a
O	palmer
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Lorraine
O	asked
O	tidings
O	of
O	his
O	travels
O	.
O	``
O	Sir
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	palmer
O	,
O	``
O	men
O	in
O	all
O	lands
O	speak
O	of

O	and
O	much
O	do
O	blame
O	you
O	for
O	taking
O	away
O	his
O	heritage
O	at
O	the
O	bidding
O	of
O	so
O	false
O	a
O	knight
O	as
O	Sir
O	Barnard
O	.
O	And
O	palmer
O	though
O	I
O	be
O	,
O	I
O	yet
O	will
O	prove
O	Sir
O	Barnard
O	recreant
O	and
O	traitor
O	upon
O	his
O	body
O	,
O	and
O	thereto
O	I
O	cast
O	down
O	my
O	glove
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Barnard
O	took
O	up
O	the
O	glove
O	,
O	and
O	Sir

O	being
O	furnished
O	with
O	armour
O	and
O	a
O	sword
O	and
O	shield
O	and
O	spear
O	,
O	they
O	did
O	battle
O	together
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	the
O	end
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	overcame
O	and
O	slew
O	Sir
O	Barnard
O	,
O	and
O	demanded
O	of
O	the
O	duke
O	to
O	restore
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	to
O	his
O	possessions
O	,
O	which
O	being
O	granted
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	the
O	banished
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	found
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	church
O	making
O	his
O	prayer
O	,
O	brought
O	him
O	straightway
O	to
O	the
O	duke
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	they
O	were
O	made
O	friends
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Sir
O	Thierry
O	found
O	who
O	his
O	deliverer
O	was
O	he
O	was
O	exceeding
O	glad
O	and
O	would
O	willingly
O	have
O	divided
O	all
O	his
O	inheritance
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	would
O	receive
O	neither
O	fee
O	nor
O	reward
O	,
O	and
O	after

O	had
O	abode
O	some
O	time
O	with
O	him
O	at
O	the
O	court
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	England
O	.
O	Now
O	Athelstan
O	was
O	besieged
O	in
O	Winchester
O	by
O	Anlaf
O	King
O	of
O	Denmark
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	come
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	for
O	the
O	great
O	host
O	that
O	was
O	arrayed
O	against
O	him
O	,
O	whilst
O	all
O	the
O	folk
O	within
O	the

O	were
O	famishing
O	for
O	want

O	.
O	Moreover
O	King
O	Anlaf
O	had
O	proclaimed
O	a

O	should
O	fight
O	against
O	the
O	great

O	terrible
O	Danish
O	giant
O	Colbrand
O	;
O	and
O	every

O	for
O	seven
O	days
O	'
O	the
O	giant
O	came
O	before
O	the

O	and
O	cried
O	for
O	a
O	man
O	to
O	fight
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	found
O	no
O	man
O	so
O	hardy
O	to
O	do
O	battle
O	with
O	Colbrand
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Athelstan
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	walked
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	in
O	his
O	city
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	distress
O	of
O	his
O	people
O	,
O	was
O	suddenly
O	aware
O	of
O	a
O	light
O	that
O	shone
O	about
O	him
O	very
O	brightly
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	voice

O	charged
O	him
O	to

O	his
O	cause
O	to
O	the
O	first
O	poor
O	palmer
O	he
O	should
O	meet
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	he
O	met
O	a
O	palmer
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	and
O	weening
O	not
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	,
O	kneeled
O	humbly
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	in
O	sure
O	faith
O	in
O	the
O	heavenly
O	voice
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	his
O	help
O	.
O	``

O	They

O	divers

O	to
O	make
O	Anlaf
O	King
O	of
O	England
O	,
O	and
O	henceforth
O	to
O	be
O	his
O	vassal
O	and
O	pay
O	tribute
O	both
O	of
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	money
O	.
O	Then
O	Colbrand
O	stode
O	forth
O	to
O	the
O	battle
O	.
O	So
O	great
O	was
O	he
O	of
O	stature
O	that
O	no
O	horse
O	could
O	bear
O	him
O	,
O	nor
O	indeed
O	could
O	any
O	man
O	make
O	a
O	cart
O	wherein
O	to
O	carry
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	armed
O	with
O	black
O	armour
O	of
O	so
O	great
O	weight
O	that
O	a
O	score
O	of
O	men
O	could
O	scarce
O	bear
O	up
O	his
O	hauberk
O	only
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	took
O	three
O	to
O	carry
O	his
O	helmet
O	.
O	He
O	bare
O	a
O	great
O	dart
O	within
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	slung
O	around
O	his
O	body
O	were
O	swords
O	and
O	battle-axes
O	more
O	than
O	two
O	hundred
O	in
O	number
O	.
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	rode
O	boldly
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	spear
O	shivered
O	into
O	pieces
O	against
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	armour
O	.
O	Then
O	Colbrand
O	threw
O	three
O	darts
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	two
O	passed
O	wide
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	third
O	crashed
O	through
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	'
O	s
O	shield
O	,
O	and
O	glided
O	betwixt
O	his
O	arm
O	and
O	side
O	,
O	nor
O	fell
O	to
O	ground
O	till
O	it
O	had
O	sped
O	over
O	a
O	good
O	acre
O	of
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	Then
O	a
O	blow
O	from
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	sword
O	just
O	missed
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	but
O	lighting
O	on
O	his
O	saddle
O	at
O	the
O	back
O	of
O	him
O	hewed
O	horse
O	and
O	saddle
O	clean
O	in
O	two
O	;
O	so
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	was
O	brought
O	to
O	ground
O	.
O	Yet
O	lightly
O	sprang
O	he
O	to
O	his
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	seemingly
O	but
O	a
O	child
O	beside
O	the
O	monster
O	man
O	,
O	he
O	laid
O	on
O	hotly
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	upon
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	armour
O	,
O	until
O	the
O	sword
O	brake
O	in
O	his
O	hands
O	.
O	Then
O	Colbrand
O	called
O	on
O	him
O	to
O	yield
O	,
O	since
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	longer
O	a
O	weapon
O	wherewith
O	to
O	fight
O	.
O	``
O	Nay
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	,
O	``
O	but
O	I
O	will
O	have
O	one
O	are
O	of
O	thine
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	with
O	that
O	ran
O	deftly
O	to
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	side
O	and
O	wrenched
O	away
O	a
O	battle-axe
O	wherewith
O	he
O	maintained
O	the
O	combat
O	.
O	Right
O	well
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	endured
O	while
O	Colbrand
O	'
O	s
O	mighty
O	strokes
O	shattered
O	his
O	armour
O	all
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	until
O	his
O	shield
O	being
O	broke
O	in
O	pieces
O	it
O	seemed
O	he
O	could
O	no
O	longer
O	make
O	defence
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Danes
O	raised
O	a
O	great
O	shout
O	at
O	their
O	champion
O	'
O	s
O	triumph
O	.
O	Then
O	Colbrand
O	aimed
O	a
O	last
O	stroke
O	at
O	the
O	knight
O	to
O	lay
O	him
O	low
O	,
O	but
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	lightly
O	avoiding
O	it
O	,
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	sword
O	smote
O	into
O	the
O	earth
O	a
O	foot
O	or
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	he
O	could
O	withdraw
O	it
O	or
O	free
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	hewed
O	off
O	the
O	arm
O	with
O	his
O	battle-axe
O	;
O	and
O	since
O	Colbrand
O	'
O	s
O	weight
O	leaned
O	on
O	that
O	arm
O	,
O	he
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	So
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	triumphed
O	over
O	the
O	giant
O	Colbrand
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Danes
O	withdrew
O	to
O	their
O	own
O	country
O	.
O	Then
O	without
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	telling
O	who
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	doffed
O	his
O	armour
O	and
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	palmer
O	'
O	s
O	weeds
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	secretly
O	withdrawing
O	himself
O	from
O	all
O	the
O	feasts
O	and
O	games
O	they
O	held
O	in
O	honour
O	of
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Winchester
O	,
O	passed
O	out
O	alone
O	and
O	took
O	his
O	journey
O	toward
O	Warwick
O	on
O	foot
O	.
O	Many
O	a
O	year
O	had
O	gone
O	since
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	home
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	whom
O	Felice
O	had
O	borne
O	him
O	,
O	named
O	Raynburn
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	;
O	nor
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	befell
O	,
O	did
O	he
O	ever
O	see
O	his
O	son
O	.
O	For
O	Raynburn
O	in
O	his
O	childhood
O	had
O	been
O	stolen
O	away
O	by
O	Saracens
O	and
O	carried
O	to
O	a
O	far
O	heathen
O	country
O	,
O	where
O	King
O	Aragus
O	brought
O	him
O	up
O	and
O	made
O	him
O	first
O	his
O	page
O	,
O	then
O	chamberlain
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	grew
O	to
O	manhood
O	,
O	knighted
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	he
O	fought
O	the
O	battles
O	of
O	King
O	Aragus
O	with
O	a
O	strong
O	arm
O	like
O	his
O	father
O	Guy
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	neither
O	could
O	any
O	endure
O	against
O	his
O	spear
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	these
O	years
O	Felice
O	had
O	passed
O	in
O	prayer
O	and
O	charity
O	,
O	entertaining
O	pilgrims
O	and
O	tired
O	wayfarers
O	,
O	and
O	comforting
O	the
O	sick
O	and
O	the
O	distressed
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	that
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	,
O	all
O	travel-worn
O	and
O	with
O	his
O	pilgrim
O	'
O	s
O	staff
O	in
O	hand
O	,
O	came
O	to
O	her
O	house
O	and
O	craved
O	an
O	alms
O	.
O	She
O	took
O	him
O	in
O	and
O	washed
O	his
O	feet
O	and
O	ministered
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	asking
O	oftentimes
O	if
O	in
O	his
O	travels
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	her
O	lord
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	he
O	watched
O	her
O	gentleness
O	to
O	the
O	poor
O	and
O	to
O	the
O	children
O	at
O	her
O	gate
O	,
O	he
O	feared
O	to
O	break
O	in
O	upon
O	her
O	holy
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	refrained
O	himself
O	before
O	her
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	reveal
O	himself
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	a
O	heavy
O	heart
O	came
O	out
O	from
O	the
O	lady
O	'
O	s
O	door
O	and
O	gat
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	hermit
O	'
O	s
O	cell
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	abode
O	in
O	fasting
O	and
O	in
O	penitence
O	many
O	weeks
O	,
O	till
O	feeling
O	his
O	end
O	draw
O	near
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	ring
O	from
O	his
O	finger
O	and
O	sent
O	it
O	by
O	a
O	herdsman
O	to
O	Felice
O	.
O	``
O	Where
O	got
O	you
O	this
O	token
O	?
O	``
O	cried
O	Felice
O	,
O	all
O	trembling
O	with
O	her
O	wonderment
O	and
O	fear
O	.
O	``
O	From
O	a
O	poor
O	beggar-man
O	that
O	lives
O	in
O	yonder
O	cell
O	,
O	``
O	the
O	herdsman
O	answered
O	.
O	``
O	From
O	a
O	beggar
O	?
O	Nay
O	,
O	but
O	from
O	a
O	kingly
O	man
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Felice
O	,
O	``
O	for
O	he
O	is
O	my
O	husband
O	,
O	Guy
O	of
O	Warwick
O	!
O	``
O	and
O	gave
O	the
O	herdsman
O	a
O	hundred
O	marks
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	hasted
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	in
O	his
O	hermit
O	'
O	s
O	cell
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	space
O	they
O	wept
O	in
O	each
O	other
O	'
O	s
O	arms
O	and
O	neither
O	spake
O	a
O	word
O	.
O	Weaker
O	and
O	fainter
O	waxed
O	Sir
O	Guy
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	he
O	died
O	,
O	and
O	Felice
O	closed
O	his
O	tired
O	eyes
O	.
O	Fifteen
O	weary
O	days
O	she
O	lingered
O	sore
O	in
O	grief
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	God
O	'
O	s
O	angel
O	came
O	and
O	closed
O	her
O	own
O	.
