O	An
O	old
O	man

O	come
O	to
O	that

O	thought
O	to

O	most

O	make
O	the
O	long
O	and
O	final
O	fast

O	is
O	to
O	secure
O	through
O	life
O	a
O	guardian
O	genius
O	or
O	spirit
O	.
O	The
O	father
O	was
O	ambitious
O	that
O	his
O	son
O	should
O	surpass
O	all
O	others
O	in
O	whatever
O	was
O	deemed
O	wisest
O	and
O	greatest
O	among
O	his
O	people
O	.
O	To
O	accomplish
O	his
O	wish
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	necessary
O	that
O	the
O	young
O	Iadilla
O	should
O	fast

O	for

O	or

O	coveted

O	He
O	therefore
O	directed

O	for
O	communion
O	with
O	his
O	good

O	,

O	ordered

O	to

O	down
O	upon
O	a
O	clean
O	mat
O	in
O	a
O	little

O	expressly
O	provided
O	for

O	.
O	He
O	enjoined

O	same
O	time
O	to
O	endure
O	his
O	fast
O	like
O	a

O	,
O	and
O	promised
O	that
O	at
O	the

O	he
O	should

O	carefully

O	lay
O	with

O	face

O	,
O	calmly
O	awaiting
O	the
O	approach
O	of
O	the

O	for
O	all
