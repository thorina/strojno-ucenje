O	I

O	on
O	a
O	certain
O	place
O	where
O	was
O	a
O	Den
O	,

O	I
O	laid

O	down
O	in
O	that
O	place
O	to
O	sleep;
O	and
O	as
O	I
O	slept
O	,
O	I
O	dreamed
O	a
O	Dream
O	.
O	I
O	dreamed
O	,
O	and
O	behold
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	Man
O	cloathed
O	with
O	Rags
O	,
O	standing
O	in
O	a
O	certain
O	place
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	face
O	from
O	his
O	own
O	house
O	,
O	a
O	Book
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	Burden
O	upon
O	his
O	back
O	.
O	I
O	looked
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	him
O	open
O	the
O	Book
O	,
O	and
O	read
O	therein;
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	read
O	,
O	he
O	wept
O	and
O	trembled;
O	and
O	not
O	being
O	able
O	longer
O	to
O	contain
O	,
O	he
O	brake
O	out
O	with
O	a
O	lamentable
O	cry
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	What
O	shall
O	I
O	do
O	?
O	I
O	saw
O	also
O	that
O	he
O	looked
O	this
O	way
O	and
O	that
O	way
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	run;
O	yet
O	he
O	stood
O	still
O	,
O	because
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	perceived
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	which
O	way
O	to
O	go
O	.
O	I
O	looked
O	then
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	man
O	named
O	Evangelist
O	,
O	coming
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	,
O	Wherefore
O	dost
O	thou
O	cry
O	?
O	He
O	answered
O	,
O	Sir
O	,
O	I
O	perceive
O	by
O	the
O	Book
O	in
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	condemned
O	to
O	die
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	that
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	Judgment
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	find
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	willing
O	to
O	do
O	the
O	first
O	,
O	nor
O	able
O	to
O	do
O	the
O	second
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	Evangelist
O	,
O	If
O	this
O	be
O	thy
O	condition
O	,
O	why
O	standest
O	thou
O	still
O	?
O	He
O	answered
O	,
O	Because
O	I
O	know
O	not
O	whither
O	to
O	go
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	_Parchment-roll_
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	written
O	within
O	,
O	_Fly
O	from
O	the
O	wrath
O	to
O	come_
O	.
O	The
O	Man
O	therefore
O	read
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	upon
O	_Evangelist_
O	very
O	carefully
O	,
O	said
O	,
O	Whither
O	must
O	I
O	fly
O	?
O	Then
O	said
O	_Evangelist_
O	,
O	pointing
O	with
O	his
O	finger
O	over
O	a
O	very
O	wide
O	field
O	,
O	Do
O	you
O	see
O	yonder
O	_Wicket-gate
O	?
O	The
O	Man
O	said
O	,
O	No
O	.
O	Then
O	sad
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	Do
O	you
O	see
O	yonder
O	shining
O	Light
O	?
O	He
O	said
O	,
O	I
O	think
O	I
O	do
O	.
O	then
O	said
O	_Evangelist_
O	,
O	Keep
O	that
O	Light
O	in
O	your
O	eye
O	,
O	and
O	go
O	up
O	directly
O	thereto
O	:
O	so
O	shalt
O	thou
O	see
O	the
O	Gate;
O	at
O	which
O	,
O	when
O	thou
O	knockest
O	,
O	it
O	shall
O	be
O	told
O	thee
O	what
O	thou
O	shalt
O	do
O	.
O	So
O	I
O	saw
O	in
O	my
O	Dream
O	that
O	the
O	Man
O	began
O	to
O	run
O	.
O	Now
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	run
O	far
O	from
O	his
O	own
O	door
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	Wife
O	and
O	Children
O	,
O	perceiving
O	it
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	cry
O	after
O	him
O	to
O	return;
O	but
O	the
O	Man
O	put
O	his
O	fingers
O	in
O	his
O	ears
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	on
O	,
O	crying
O	,
O	_Life
O	!
O	Life
O	!
O	Eternal
O	Life

O	So
O	he
O	looked
O	not
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	fled
O	towards
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	Plain
O	.
O	The
O	Neighbors

O	came
O	out
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	run;
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	ran
O	,
O	some
O	mocked
O	,
O	others
O	threatened
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	cried
O	after
O	him
O	to
O	return;
O	and
O	among
O	those
O	that
O	did
O	so
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	two
O	that
O	resolved
O	to

O	Now
O	by

O	time
O	the

O	got
O	a
O	good
O	distance
O	from

O	were
O	resolved

O	did

O	in
O	a
O	little

O	Sir

O	So
O	he
O	called
O	for

O	of
O	the

O	who
O	after
O	a
O	little

O	Sir

O	said

O	I
O	am

O	am
O	going
O	to

O	Mount
O	_Zion_;

O	I
O	was
O	told
O	by
O	the
O	Man
O	that
O	stands
O	at
O	the
O	Gate
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	this
O	way

O	that
O	if
O	I
O	called
O	here

O	you
O	would
O	shew
O	me
O	excellent

O	help

O	INTER

O	Then
O	said
O	the
O	Interpreter
O	,
O	Come
O	in

O	I
O	will
O	shew
O	thee
O	that
O	which
O	will
O	be
O	profitable
O	to
O	thee

O	I
O	saw
O	moreover
O	in
O	my
O	Dream
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	_Interpreter_
O	took
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	little
O	room
O	,
O	where
O	sat
O	two
O	little
O	Children
O	,
O	each
O	one
O	in
O	his
O	chair
O	.
O	The
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	eldest
O	was
O	_Passion_
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	_Patience_
O	.
O	_Passion_
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	much
O	discontent;
O	but
O	_Patience_
O	was
O	very
O	quiet
O	.
O	Then
O	_Christian_
O	asked
O	,
O	What
O	is
O	the
O	reason
O	of
O	the
O	discontent
O	of
O	_Passion_
O	?
O	The
O	_Interpreter_
O	answered
O	,
O	The
O	Governor
O	of
O	them
O	would
O	have
O	him
O	stay
O	for
O	his
O	best
O	things
O	till
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	the
O	next
O	year;
O	but
O	he
O	will
O	have
O	all
O	now;
O	but
O	_Patience_
O	is
O	willing
O	to
O	wait
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	saw
O	that
O	one
O	came
O	to
O	_Passion_
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	him
O	a
O	bag
O	of
O	treasure
O	,
O	and
O	poured
O	it
O	down
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	,
O	the
O	which
O	he
O	took
O	up
O	and
O	rejoiced
O	therein;
O	and
O	withal
O	,
O	laughed
O	_Patience_
O	to
O	scorn
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	beheld
O	but
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	lavished
O	all
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	nothing
O	left
O	but
O	Rags

O	CHR

O	Then
O	said
O	_Christian_
O	to

O	_Interpreter_
O	,
O	Expound
O	this
O	matter
O	more
O	fully
O	to

O	That
O	proverb

O	_A

O	of

O	good
O	of
O	the

O	to

O	But
O	as
O	thou
O	sawest
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	quickly
O	lavished
O	all
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	presently
O	left
O	him
O	nothing
O	but
O	Rags;
O	so
O	will
O	it
O	be
O	with

O	such

O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of

O	Then
O	said
O	_Christian_
O	,
O	Now
O	I
O	see
O	that
O	_Patience_
O	has
O	the
O	best
O	wisdom

O	that
O	upon
O	many

O	also
O	because

O	will
O	have
O	the
O	Glory

O	the

O	_these_

O	suddenly

O	had
O	not
O	so
O	much
O	reason
O	to

O	But
O	though
O	this
O	be
O	so
O	,
O	yet
O	since
O	things
O	present
O	and
O	our
O	fleshly
O	appetite
O	are
O	such
O	near
O	neighbors
O	one
O	to
O	another;
O	and
O	,
O	again
O	,
O	because
O	things
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	carnal
O	sense
O	are
O	such
O	strangers
O	one
O	to
O	another;
O	therefore
O	it
O	is
O	that
O	the
O	first
O	of
O	these
O	so
O	suddenly
O	fell
O	into
O	_amity_
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	_distance_
O	is
O	so
O	continued
O	between
O	the
O	second

O	Then
O	I
O	saw
O	in
O	my
O	Dream
O	that
O	the
O	_Interpreter_
O	took
O	_Christian_
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	was
O	a
O	Fire
O	burning
O	against
O	a
O	wall
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	standing
O	by
O	it
O	,
O	always
O	casting
O	much
O	Water
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	to
O	quench
O	it;
O	yet
O	did
O	the
O	Fire
O	burn
O	higher
O	and
O	hotter
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	_Christian
O	,
O	_
O	What
O	means
O	this
O	?
O	The
O	_Interpreter
O	answered
O	,
O	_
O	This
O	Fire
O	is
O	the
O	work
O	of
O	Grace
O	that
O	is
O	wrought
O	in
O	the
O	heart;
O	he
O	that
O	casts
O	Water
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	to
O	extinguish
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	out
O	,
O	is
O	the
O	_Devil;_
O	but
O	in
O	that
O	thou
O	seest
O	the
O	Fire
O	notwithstanding
O	burn
O	higher
O	and
O	hotter
O	,
O	thou
O	shalt
O	also
O	see
O	the
O	reason
O	of
O	that
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	had
O	him
O	about
O	to
O	the
O	backside
O	of
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	man
O	with
O	a
O	Vessel
O	of
O	Oil
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	which
O	he
O	did
O	also
O	continually
O	cast
O	(
O	but
O	secretly
O	)
O	into
O	the
O	Fire
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	_Christian
O	,
O	_
O	What
O	means
O	this
O	?
O	The
O	_Interpreter
O	answered
O	,
O	_
O	This
O	is
O	Christ
O	,
O	who
O	continually
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	Oil
O	of
O	his
O	Grace
O	,
O	maintains
O	the
O	work
O	already
O	begun
O	in
O	the
O	heart
O	:
O	by
O	the
O	means
O	of
O	which
O	notwithstanding
O	what
O	the
O	Devil
O	can
O	do
O	,
O	the
O	souls
O	of
O	his
O	people
O	prove
O	gracious
O	still
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	that
O	thou
O	sawest
O	that
O	the
O	man
O	stood
O	behind
O	the
O	wall
O	to
O	maintain
O	the
O	Fire
O	,
O	that
O	is
O	to
O	teach
O	thee
O	that
O	it
O	is
O	hard
O	for
O	the
O	tempted
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	this
O	work
O	of
O	Grace
O	is
O	maintained
O	in
O	the
O	soul
O	.
O	I
O	saw
O	also
O	that
O	the
O	_Interpreter_
O	took
O	him
O	again
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	pleasant
O	place
O	,
O	where
O	was
O	builded
O	a
O	stately
O	Palace
O	,
O	beautiful
O	to
O	behold;
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	which
O	_Christian_
O	was
O	greatly
O	delighted
O	:
O	He
O	saw
O	also
O	upon
O	the
O	top
O	thereof
O	,
O	certain
O	persons
O	walking
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	cloathed
O	all
O	in
O	gold
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	_Christian
O	,
O	_
O	May
O	we
O	go
O	in
O	thither
O	?
O	Then
O	the
O	_Interpreter_
O	took
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	up
O	toward
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	Palace;
O	and
O	behold
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	stood
O	a
O	great
O	company
O	of
O	men
O	,
O	as
O	desirous
O	to
O	go
O	in
O	,
O	but
O	durst
O	not
O	.
O	There
O	also
O	sat
O	a
O	man
O	at
O	a
O	little
O	distance
O	from
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	at
O	a
O	table-side
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	Book
O	and
O	his
O	Inkhorn
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	him
O	that
O	should
O	enter
O	therein;
O	He
O	saw
O	also
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	door-way
O	stood
O	many
O	men
O	in
O	armour
O	to
O	keep
O	it
O	,
O	being
O	resolved
O	to
O	do
O	the
O	men
O	that
O	would
O	enter
O	what
O	hurt
O	and
O	mischief
O	they
O	could
O	.
O	Now
O	was
O	_Christian_
O	somewhat
O	in
O	a
O	maze
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	when
O	every
O	man
O	started
O	back
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	the
O	armed
O	men
O	,
O	_Christian_
O	saw
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	a
O	very
O	stout
O	countenance
O	come
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	man
O	that
O	sat
O	there
O	to
O	write
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	_Set
O	down
O	my
O	name
O	,
O	Sir_
O	:
O	the
O	which
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	man
O	draw
O	his
O	Sword
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	an
O	Helmet
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	rush
O	toward
O	the
O	door
O	upon
O	the
O	armed
O	men
O	,
O	who
O	laid
O	upon
O	him
O	with
O	deadly
O	force;
O	but
O	the
O	man
O	,
O	not
O	at
O	all
O	discouraged
O	,
O	fell
O	to
O	cutting
O	and
O	hacking
O	most
O	fiercely
O	.
O	So
O	after
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	received
O	and
O	given
O	many
O	wounds
O	to
O	those
O	that
O	attempted
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	out
O	,
O	he
O	cut
O	his
O	way
O	through
O	them
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	pressed
O	forward
O	into
O	the
O	Palace
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	pleasant
O	voice
O	heard
O	from
O	those
O	that
O	were
O	within
O	,
O	even
O	of
O	those
O	that
O	walked
O	upon
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	Palace
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	Come
O	in
O	,
O	Come
O	in;
O	Eternal
O	Glory
O	thou
O	shalt
O	win
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	went
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	cloathed
O	with
O	such
O	garments
O	as
O	they
O	.
O	Then
O	_Christian_
O	smiled
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	I
O	think
O	verily
O	I
O	know
O	the
O	meaning
O	of
O	this
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	said
O	_Christian_
O	,
O	let
O	me
O	go
O	hence
O	.
O	Nay
O	,
O	stay
O	,
O	said
O	the
O	_Interpreter_
O	,
O	till
O	I
O	have
O	shewed
O	thee
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	that
O	thou
O	shalt
O	go
O	on
O	thy
O	way
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	took
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	very
O	dark
O	room
O	,
O	where
O	there
O	sat
O	a
O	man
O	in
O	an
O	Iron
O	Cage
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	Man
O	,
O	to
O	look
O	on
O	,
O	seemed
O	very
O	sad;
O	he
O	sat
O	with
O	his
O	eyes
O	looking
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	his
O	hands
O	folded
O	together;

O	he
O	sighed
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	break
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	Then
O	said

O	,
O	this
O	is
O	fearful;
O	God
O	help
O	me
O	to
O	watch
O	and
O	be
O	sober
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	pray
O	that
O	I
O	may
O	shun
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	this
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	misery
O	.
O	Sir
O	,
O	is
O	it
O	not
O	time
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	my
O	way
O	now
O	?
O	INTER
O	.
O	Tarry
O	till
O	I
O	shall
O	shew
O	thee
O	one
O	thing
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	thou
O	shalt
O	go
O	thy
O	way
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	took
O	_Christian_
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	Chamber
O	,
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	one
O	rising
O	out
O	of
O	bed;
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	raiment
O	,
O	he
O	shook
O	and
O	trembled
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	_Christian_
O	,
O	Why
O	doth
O	this
O	man
O	thus
O	tremble
O	?
O	The
O	_Interpreter_
O	then
O	bid
O	him
O	tell
O	to
O	_Christian_
O	the
O	reason
O	of
O	his
O	so
O	doing
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	began
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	This
O	night
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	my
O	sleep
O	,
O	I
O	dreamed
O	,
O	and
O	behold
O	the
O	Heavens
O	grew
O	exceeding
O	black;
O	also
O	it
O	thundred
O	and
O	lightned
O	in
O	most
O	fearful
O	wise
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	put
O	me
O	into
O	an
O	agony;
O	so
O	I
O	looked
O	up
O	in
O	my
O	Dream
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	Clouds
O	rack
O	at
O	an
O	unusual
O	rate
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	great
O	sound
O	of
O	a
O	Trumpet
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	also
O	a
O	Man
O	sit
O	upon
O	a
O	Cloud
O	,
O	attended
O	with
O	the
O	thousands
O	of
O	Heaven;
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	in
O	flaming
O	fire
O	,
O	also
O	the
O	Heavens
O	were
O	in
O	a
O	burning
O	flame
O	.
O	I
O	heard
O	then
O	a
O	Voice
O	saying
O	,
O	_Arise
O	ye
O	dead
O	,
O	and
O	come
O	to
O	Judgment_;
O	and
O	with
O	that
O	the
O	Rocks
O	rent
O	,
O	the
O	Graves
O	opened
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Dead
O	that
O	were
O	therein
O	came
O	forth
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	them
O	were
O	exceeding
O	glad
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	upward;
O	and
O	some
O	sought
O	to
O	hide
O	themselves
O	under
O	the
O	Mountains
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	saw
O	the
O	Man
O	that
O	sat
O	upon
O	the
O	Cloud
O	open
O	the
O	Book
O	,
O	and
O	bid
O	the
O	World
O	draw
O	near
O	.
O	Yet
O	there
O	was
O	,
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	a
O	fierce
O	flame
O	which
O	issued
O	out
O	and
O	came
O	from
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	a
O	convenient
O	distance
O	betwixt
O	him
O	and
O	them
O	,
O	as
O	betwixt
O	the
O	Judge
O	and
O	the
O	Prisoners
O	at
O	the
O	bar
O	.
O	I
O	heard
O	it
O	also
O	proclaimed
O	to
O	them
O	that
O	attended
O	on
O	the
O	Man
O	that
O	sat
O	on
O	the
O	Cloud
O	,
O	_Gather
O	together
O	the
O	Tares
O	,
O	the
O	Chaff
O	,
O	and
O	Stubble
O	,
O	and
O	cast
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	burning
O	Lake_
O	.
O	And
O	with
O	that
O	,
O	the
O	bottomless
O	pit
O	opened
O	,
O	just
O	whereabout
O	I
O	stood;
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	which
O	there
O	came
O	in
O	an
O	abundant
O	manner
O	,
O	smoke
O	and
O	coals
O	of
O	fire
O	,
O	with
O	hideous
O	noises
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	also
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	same
O	persons
O	,
O	_Gather
O	my
O	Wheat
O	into
O	the
O	Garner_
O	.
O	And
O	with
O	that
O	I
O	saw
O	many
O	catch
O	'
O	d
O	up
O	and
O	carried
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	Clouds
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	was
O	left
O	behind
O	.
O	I
O	also
O	sought
O	to
O	hide
O	myselfs
O	but
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	Man
O	that
O	sat
O	upon
O	the
O	Cloud
O	still
O	kept
O	his
O	eye
O	upon
O	me
O	:
O	my
O	sins
O	also
O	came
O	into
O	my
O	mind;
O	and
O	my
O	Conscience
O	did
O	accuse
O	me
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	.
O	Upon
O	this
O	I
O	awaked
O	from
O	my
O	sleep
O	.
O	CHR
O	.
O	But
O	what
O	was
O	it
O	that
O	made
O	you
O	so
O	afraid
O	of
O	this
O	sight
O	?
O	MAN
O	.
O	Why
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	that
O	the
O	day
O	of
O	Judgment
O	was
O	come
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	ready
O	for
O	it
O	:
O	but
O	this
O	frighted
O	me
O	most
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	Angels
O	gathered
O	up
O	several
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	me
O	behind;
O	also
O	the
O	pit
O	of
O	Hell
O	opened
O	her
O	mouth
O	just
O	where
O	I
O	stood
O	:
O	my
O	Conscience
O	too
O	afflicted
O	me;
O	and
O	as
O	I
O	thought
O	,
O	the
O	Judge
O	had
O	always
O	his
O	eye
O	upon
O	me
O	,
O	shewing
O	indignation
O	in
O	his
O	countenance
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	the
O	_Interpreter_
O	to
O	_Christian
O	,
O	Hast
O	thou
O	considered
O	all
O	these
O	things_
O	?
O	CHR
O	.
O	Yes
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	put
O	me
O	in
O	_hope_
O	and
O	_fear_
O	.
O	INTER
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	keep
O	all
O	things
O	so
O	in
O	thy
O	mind
O	that
O	they
O	may
O	be
O	as
O	a
O	Goad
O	in
O	thy
O	sides
O	,
O	to
O	prick
O	thee
O	forward
O	in
O	the
O	way
O	thou
O	must
O	go
O	.
O	Then
O	_Christian_
O	began
O	to
O	gird
O	up
O	his
O	loins
O	,
O	and
O	address
O	himself
O	to
O	his
O	Journey
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	the
O	_Interpreter_
O	,
O	The
O	Comforter
O	be
O	always
O	with
O	thee
O	,
O	good
O	_Christian_
O	,
O	to
O	guide
O	thee
O	in
O	the
O	way
O	that
O	leads
O	to
O	the
O	City
O	.
O	So
O	_Christian_
O	went
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	.
