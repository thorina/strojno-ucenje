O	In
O	days
O	gone
O	by
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	poor
O	widow
O	who
O	had
O	brought
O	up
O	her
O	only
O	child
O	so
O	well
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	lass
O	was
O	more
O	helpful
O	and
O	handy
O	than
O	many
O	a
O	grown-up
O	person
O	.
O	When
O	other
O	women
O	'
O	s
O	children
O	were
O	tearing
O	and
O	dirtying
O	their
O	clothes
O	,
O	clamouring
O	at
O	their
O	mothers

O	for

O	,
O	losing

O	and
O	spoiling
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	getting
O	into
O	mischief
O	of
O	all
O	kinds
O	,
O	the
O	widow
O	'
O	s
O	little
O	girl
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	tiny
O	thimble
O	on
O	her
O	finger
O	,
O	could
O	patch
O	quite
O	neatly
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	trusted
O	to
O	put
O	anything
O	in
O	its
O	proper
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	meals
O	were
O	over
O	she
O	would
O	stand
O	on
O	a
O	little
O	stool
O	at
O	the
O	table
O	washing
O	up
O	the
O	dishes
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	she
O	could
O	darn
O	stockings
O	so
O	well
O	that
O	the
O	darn
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	stocking
O	.
O	The
O	slatternly
O	mothers
O	,

O	and
O	had
O	never
O	taught
O	them
O	to
O	be
O	tidy
O	and
O	obedient
O	,
O	used
O	often
O	to
O	quote
O	the
O	widow
O	'
O	s
O	little
O	girl
O	to
O	their
O	troublesome
O	brats
O	,

O	,
O	``
O	Why

O	?
O	``
O	Thus
O	it
O	came
O	about
O	that
O	the
O	helpless
O	,
O	useless
O	,
O	untidy
O	little
O	girls
O	hated
O	the
O	very
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	widow
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	,
O	because

O	were
O	always
O	being
O	told
O	of

O	usefulness
O	and
O	neatness

O	Now
O	the
O	widow
O	'
O	s
O	child
O	often
O	earned
O	a
O	few
O	pence
O	by
O	herding
O	sheep
O	or
O	pigs
O	for
O	the

O	be
O	trusted
O	,
O	people
O	were
O	very
O	glad
O	to
O	employ
O	her
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	she
O	was
O	keeping
O	watch
O	over
O	five
O	little
O	pigs
O	in
O	a
O	field
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	not
O	to
O	waste
O	time
O	,
O	was
O	darning
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	stockings
O	as
O	well
O	,
O	when
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	girls
O	who
O	had
O	a
O	spite
O	against
O	her
O	resolved
O	to
O	play
O	her
O	a
O	trick
O	.
O	Near
O	the
O	field
O	where
O	the
O	little
O	maid
O	and
O	the
O	pigs
O	were
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	wood
O	,
O	into
O	which
O	all
O	children
O	were
O	strictly
O	forbidden
O	to
O	go
O	.
O	For
O	in
O	the
O	depths
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	terrible
O	Ogre
O	and
O	Ogress
O	,
O	who
O	kidnapped
O	all
O	children
O	who
O	strayed
O	near
O	their
O	dwelling
O	.
O	Every
O	morning
O	the
O	Ogre
O	threw
O	a
O	big
O	black
O	bag
O	over
O	his
O	shoulder
O	,
O	and
O	stalked
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	making
O	the
O	ground
O	shake
O	as
O	he
O	walked
O	.
O	If
O	he
O	found
O	any
O	truant
O	children
O	he
O	popped
O	them
O	into
O	his
O	bag
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	got
O	home
O	his
O	wife
O	cooked
O	them
O	for
O	supper
O	.
O	The
O	trick
O	played
O	upon
O	the
O	widow
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	was
O	this
O	.
O	Five
O	little
O	girls
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	field
O	where
O	she
O	was
O	herding
O	the
O	five
O	little
O	pigs
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	chasing
O	a
O	pig
O	,
O	they
O	drove
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	Ogre
O	'
O	s
O	wood
O	.
O	In
O	vain
O	the
O	little
O	maid
O	called
O	to
O	her
O	flock
O	;
O	the
O	pigs
O	ran
O	in
O	a
O	frightened
O	troop
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	ran
O	after
O	them
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	five
O	little
O	girls
O	saw
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	got
O	them
O	together
O	again
O	,
O	they
O	ran
O	in
O	to
O	chase
O	them
O	away
O	once
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	together
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	ground
O	shook
O	under
O	them
O	,
O	upsetting
O	the
O	six
O	little
O	girls
O	and
O	the
O	five
O	little
O	pigs
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	they
O	rolled
O	over
O	the
O	Ogre
O	picked
O	them
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	them
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	into
O	his
O	bag
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	were
O	jolting
O	about
O	with
O	the
O	pigs
O	in
O	the
O	poke
O	as
O	the
O	Ogre
O	strode
O	homewards
O	,
O	the
O	five
O	spiteful
O	children
O	were
O	as
O	sorry
O	as
O	you
O	please
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	pigs
O	were
O	always
O	fighting
O	and
O	struggling
O	to
O	get
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	escape
O	without
O	some
O	scratches
O	.
O	And
O	their
O	screams
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	squealing
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	pigs
O	made
O	such
O	a
O	noise
O	that
O	the
O	Ogre
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	heard
O	it
O	a
O	mile
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	depths
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	;
O	and
O	she
O	lighted
O	a
O	fire
O	under
O	the
O	copper
O	,
O	and
O	filled
O	it
O	with
O	water
O	,
O	ready
O	to
O	cook
O	whatever
O	her
O	husband
O	brought
O	home
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	widow
O	'
O	s
O	little
O	daughter
O	she
O	pulled
O	her
O	needle-book
O	from
O	her
O	pocket
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	she
O	pushed
O	a
O	needle
O	through
O	the
O	sack
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	might
O	fall
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	serve
O	as
O	a
O	guide
O	if
O	she
O	should
O	ever
O	have
O	the
O	chance
O	of
O	finding
O	her
O	way
O	home
O	again
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	Ogre
O	arrived
O	,
O	he
O	emptied
O	the
O	sack
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	the
O	six
O	little
O	girls
O	and
O	the
O	five
O	little
O	pigs
O	all
O	sprawling
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	saying
O	:
O	``
O	These
O	will
O	last
O	us
O	some
O	time
O	.
O	Cook
O	the
O	fattest
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	the
O	rest
O	into
O	the
O	cellar
O	.
O	And
O	whilst
O	you
O	get
O	dinner
O	ready
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	take
O	another
O	stroll
O	with
O	the
O	bag
O	.
O	Luck
O	seldom
O	comes
O	singly
O	.
O	``
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	gone
O	,
O	the
O	Ogress
O	looked
O	over
O	the
O	children
O	,
O	and
O	picked
O	out
O	the
O	widow
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	,
O	saying
O	:
O	``
O	You

O	``
O	So
O	she
O	set
O	her
O	down

O	till
O	the

O	go
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	cellar
O	for
O	a
O	bit
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	Ogress
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	meanwhile
O	I
O	'
O	ll
O	sharpen
O	the
O	knife
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	after
O	she
O	had
O	taken
O	back
O	the
O	crying
O	child
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	watched
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	,
O	who
O	now
O	darned
O	away
O	as
O	skilfully
O	as
O	ever
O	,
O	the
O	Ogress
O	took
O	down
O	a
O	huge
O	knife
O	from
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	sharpen
O	it
O	on
O	a
O	grindstone
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	kitchen
O	.
O	As
O	she
O	sharpened
O	the
O	knife
O	,
O	she
O	glanced
O	from
O	time
O	to
O	time
O	at
O	the
O	little
O	maid
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	perceived
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	once
O	more
O	ceased
O	working
O	.
O	``
O	Why
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	you
O	go
O	on
O	darning
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	the
O	Ogress
O	.
O	``
O	Alas
O	!
O	dear
O	mother
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	child
O	,
O	``
O	when
O	I
O	hear
O	you
O	sharpening
O	that
O	terrible
O	knife
O	my

O	so
O	that
O	I

O	not
O	thread
O	my

O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Well
O	,
O	it
O	will
O	do
O	now
O	,
O	``
O	growled
O	the
O	Ogress
O	,
O	feeling
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	blade
O	with
O	her
O	horny
O	finger
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	seen
O	the
O	darning-needle
O	once
O	more
O	at
O	work
O	,
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	fetch
O	up
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	children
O	.
O	As
O	she
O	went
O	,
O	she
O	hummed
O	what
O	cookmaids
O	sing
O	--
O	``
O	Dilly
O	,
O	dilly
O	duckling
O	,
O	come
O	and
O	be
O	killed
O	!
O	``
O	But
O	it
O	sounded
O	like
O	the
O	wheezing
O	and
O	groaning
O	of
O	a
O	heavy
O	old
O	door
O	upon
O	its
O	rusty
O	hinges
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	came
O	in
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	child
O	in
O	one
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	huge
O	knife
O	in
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	she
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	darner
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	her
O	work
O	.
O	The
O	heel
O	of
O	the
O	Ogre
O	'
O	s
O	stocking
O	was
O	exquisitely
O	mended
O	,
O	all
O	but
O	seven
O	threads
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	little
O	maid
O	sat
O	idle
O	with
O	her
O	hands
O	before
O	her
O	.
O	``
O	Why
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	you
O	go
O	on
O	darning
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	the
O	Ogress
O	.
O	``
O	Alas
O	!
O	dear
O	mother
O	,
O	``
O	was
O	the
O	reply
O	,
O	``
O	when
O	I
O	think

O	the
O	tears

O	so
O	that
O	I
O	can

O	take
O	.
O	Wherefore
O	I
O	beg

O	to

O	that
O	a
O	pair

O	ready
O	to-morrow
O	morning
O	when
O	the
O	Ogre
O	will
O	ask
O	for

O	;
O	so
O	my
O	playmate
O	'
O	s
O	life
O	will
O	be
O	spared
O	,
O	and
O	your
O	head

O	into
O	a
O	poke
O	.
O	``
O	At
O	first
O	the
O	Ogress
O	would
O	not
O	hear
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	thing
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	consented
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	stew
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	pigs
O	instead
O	of
O	cooking
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	supposing
O	the
O	Ogre
O	goes
O	to
O	count
O	the
O	children
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	she
O	;
O	``
O	he
O	will
O	find
O	one
O	too
O	many
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Then
O	let
O	her
O	go
O	,
O	dear
O	mother
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	widow
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	;
O	``
O	she
O	will
O	find
O	her

O	,
O	and
O	you
O	will
O	never
O	be
O	blamed
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	But
O	she
O	must
O	stir
O	the
O	stew
O	with
O	her
O	forefinger
O	first
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	Ogress
O	,
O	``
O	that
O	it
O	may
O	have
O	a
O	human
O	flavour
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	had
O	to
O	stir
O	the
O	hot
O	stew
O	with
O	her
O	finger
O	,
O	which
O	scalded
O	it
O	badly
O	;
O	and
O	then
O	she
O	was
O	set
O	at
O	liberty
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	home
O	as
O	hard
O	as
O	she
O	could
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	little
O	maid
O	'
O	s
O	needles
O	sparkled
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	on
O	the
O	path
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	difficulty
O	in
O	finding
O	her
O	way
O	.
O	The
O	Ogre
O	was
O	quite
O	contented
O	with
O	his
O	dinner
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Ogress
O	got
O	great
O	praise
O	for
O	the
O	way
O	in
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	darned
O	his
O	stockings
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	went
O	on
O	for
O	four
O	days
O	more
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	widow
O	'
O	s
O	little
O	girl
O	wouldn
O	'
O	t
O	work
O	if
O	her
O	companions
O	were
O	killed
O	,
O	the
O	Ogress
O	cooked
O	the
O	pigs
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	children
O	were
O	all
O	sent
O	away
O	with
O	burnt
O	forefingers
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	fifth
O	had
O	been
O	dismissed
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	pigs
O	were
O	eaten
O	,
O	the
O	Ogress
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	To-morrow
O	you
O	will
O	have
O	to
O	be
O	stewed
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	I
O	wish
O	I
O	had
O	kept
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	others
O	that
O	I
O	might
O	have
O	saved
O	you
O	altogether
O	to
O	work
O	for
O	me
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	there
O	is
O	one
O	comfort
O	,
O	the
O	stockings
O	are
O	finished
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	meanwhile
O	the
O	other
O	children
O	had
O	got
O	safely
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	told
O	their
O	tale
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	place
O	set
O	off
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	attack
O	the
O	Ogre
O	,
O	and
O	release
O	the
O	widow
O	'
O	s
O	child
O	.
O	Guided
O	by
O	the
O	needles
O	,
O	they
O	arrived
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	Ogress
O	was
O	sharpening
O	the
O	big
O	knife
O	for
O	the
O	last
O	time
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	killed
O	the
O	Ogre
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	industrious
O	little
O	maid
O	back
O	to
O	her
O	mother
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	little
O	girls
O	were
O	now
O	very
O	repentant
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	their
O	fingers
O	were
O	well
O	,
O	they
O	all
O	learned
O	to
O	darn
O	stockings
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	there
O	was
O	now
O	no
O	danger
O	about
O	going
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	forbidden
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	being
O	the
O	case
O	,
O	the
O	children
O	were
O	much
O	less
O	anxious
O	to
O	play
O	there
O	than
O	formerly
O	.
