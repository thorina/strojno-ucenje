O	As
O	Owain
O	one
O	day
O	sat
O	at
O	meat
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Caerleon
O	upon
O	Usk
O	,
O	a
O	damsel
O	entered
O	the
O	hall
O	upon
O	a
O	bay
O	horse
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	curling
O	mane
O	,
O	and
O	covered
O	with
O	foam
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	bridle
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	was
O	seen
O	of
O	the
O	saddle
O	,
O	were
O	of
O	gold
O	.
O	The
O	damsel
O	was
O	arrayed
O	in
O	a
O	dress
O	of
O	yellow
O	satin
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	Owain
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	ring
O	from
O	off
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	``
O	Thus
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	shall
O	be
O	treated
O	the
O	deceiver
O	,
O	the
O	traitor
O	,
O	the
O	faithless
O	,
O	the
O	disgraced
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	beardless
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	she
O	turned
O	her
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	and
O	departed
O	.
O	Then
O	his
O	adventure
O	came
O	to
O	Owain
O	'
O	s
O	remembrance
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	sorrowful
O	.
O	Having
O	finished
O	eating
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	abode
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	preparations
O	that
O	night
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	he
O	arose
O	,
O	but
O	did
O	not
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	,
O	nor
O	did
O	he
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	Countess
O	of
O	the
O	Fountain
O	,
O	but
O	wandered
O	to
O	the
O	distant
O	parts
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	and
O	to
O	uncultivated
O	mountains
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	remained
O	there
O	until
O	all
O	his
O	apparel
O	was
O	worn
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	body
O	was
O	wasted
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	hair
O	was
O	grown
O	long
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	went
O	about
O	with
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	,
O	and
O	fed
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	until
O	they
O	became
O	familiar
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	became
O	so
O	weak
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	no
O	longer
O	bear
O	them
O	company
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	descended
O	from
O	the
O	mountains
O	to
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	park
O	,
O	that
O	was
O	the
O	fairest
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	belonged
O	to
O	a
O	charitable
O	lady
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	the
O	lady
O	and
O	her
O	attendants
O	went
O	forth
O	to
O	walk
O	by
O	a
O	lake
O	that
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	park
O	.
O	They
O	saw
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	lying
O	as
O	if
O	dead
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	terrified
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	they
O	went
O	near
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	touched
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	life
O	in
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	lady
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	a
O	flask
O	full
O	of
O	precious
O	ointment
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	maidens
O	.
O	``
O	Go
O	with
O	this
O	,

O	said
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	and

O	with

O	will
O	revive
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	efficiency
O	of
O	this
O	balsam
O	.
O	Then
O	watch
O	what
O	he
O	will
O	do
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	maiden
O	departed
O	from
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	and
O	poured
O	of
O	the
O	balsam
O	upon
O	Owain
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	horse
O	and
O	garments
O	hard
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	a
O	little
O	way
O	off
O	and
O	hid
O	herself
O	to
O	watch
O	him
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	she
O	saw
O	him
O	begin
O	to
O	move
O	.
O	He
O	rose
O	up
O	,
O	looked
O	at
O	his
O	person
O	,
O	and
O	became
O	ashamed
O	of
O	the
O	unseemliness
O	of
O	his
O	appearance
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	perceived
O	the
O	horse
O	and
O	the
O	garments
O	that
O	were
O	near
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	clothed
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	difficulty
O	mounted
O	the
O	horse
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	damsel
O	discovered
O	herself
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	saluted
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	and
O	the
O	maiden
O	proceeded
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	maiden
O	conducted
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	pleasant
O	chamber
O	,
O	and
O	kindled
O	a
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	stayed
O	at
O	the
O	castle
O	three
O	months
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	was
O	restored
O	to
O	his
O	former
O	guise
O	,
O	and
O	became
O	even
O	more
O	comely
O	than
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	been
O	before
O	.
O	And
O	Owain
O	rendered
O	signal
O	service
O	to
O	the
O	lady
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	controversy
O	with
O	a
O	powerful
O	neighbor
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	made
O	ample
O	requital
O	to
O	her
O	for
O	her
O	hospitality
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	departure
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	journeyed
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	loud
O	yelling
O	in
O	a
O	wood
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	repeated
O	a
O	second
O	and
O	a
O	third
O	time
O	.
O	And
O	Owain
O	went
O	towards
O	the
O	spot
O	,
O	and
O	beheld
O	a
O	huge
O	craggy
O	mound
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	gray
O	rock
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	cleft
O	in
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	serpent
O	was
O	within
O	the
O	cleft
O	.
O	Near
O	the
O	rock
O	stood
O	a
O	black
O	lion
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	time
O	the
O	lion
O	sought
O	to
O	go
O	thence
O	the
O	serpent
O	darted
O	towards
O	him
O	to
O	attack
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	Owain
O	unsheathed
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	near
O	to
O	the
O	rock
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	serpent
O	sprung
O	out
O	he
O	struck
O	him
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	and
O	cut
O	him
O	in
O	two
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	dried
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	Behold
O	the
O	lion
O	followed
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	played
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	as
O	though
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	greyhound
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	reared
O	.
O	They
O	proceeded
O	thus
O	throughout
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	until
O	the
O	evening
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	time
O	for
O	Owain
O	to
O	take
O	his
O	rest
O	he
O	dismounted
O	,
O	and
O	turned
O	his
O	horse
O	loose
O	in
O	a
O	flat
O	and
O	wooded
O	meadow
O	.
O	He
O	struck
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	fire
O	was
O	kindled
O	,
O	the
O	lion
O	brought
O	him
O	fuel
O	enough
O	to
O	last
O	for
O	three
O	nights
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	lion
O	disappeared
O	.
O	Presently
O	the
O	lion
O	returned
O	,
O	bearing
O	a
O	fine
O	large
O	roebuck
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	it
O	down
O	before
O	Owain
O	,
O	who
O	went
O	towards
O	the
O	fire
O	with
O	it
O	.
O	Owain
O	took
O	the
O	roebuck
O	,
O	skinned
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	slices
O	of
O	its
O	flesh
O	upon
O	skewers
O	round
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	The
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	buck
O	he
O	gave
O	to
O	the
O	lion
O	to
O	devour
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	employed
O	,
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	deep
O	groan
O	near
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	second
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	third
O	.
O	The
O	place
O	whence
O	the
O	groans
O	proceeded
O	was
O	a
O	cave
O	in
O	the
O	rock
O	;
O	and
O	Owain
O	went
O	near
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	out
O	to
O	know
O	who
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	groaned
O	so
O	piteously
O	.
O	And
O	a
O	voice
O	answered
O	,
O	``

O	you
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	We
O	will
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	youths
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	attacked
O	Owain
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	hard
O	beset
O	by
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	with
O	that
O	,
O	the
O	lion
O	came
O	to
O	Owain
O	'
O	s
O	assistance
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	two
O	got
O	the
O	better
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	men
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	``
O	Chieftain
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	agreed
O	that
O	we
O	should
O	fight
O	save
O	with
O	thyself
O	alone
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	harder
O	for
O	us
O	to
O	contend
O	with
O	yonder
O	animal
O	than
O	with
O	thee
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	Owain
O	put
O	the
O	lion
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	Luned
O	had
O	been
O	imprisoned
O	,
O	and
O	blocked
O	up
O	the
O	door
O	with
O	stones
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	fight
O	with
O	the
O	young
O	men
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	But
O	Owain
O	had
O	not
O	his
O	usual
O	strength
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	youths
O	pressed
O	hard
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	lion
O	roared
O	incessantly
O	at
O	seeing
O	Owain
O	in
O	trouble
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	burst
O	through
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	way
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	rushed
O	upon
O	the
O	young
O	men
O	and
O	instantly
O	slew
O	them
O	.
O	So
O	Luned
O	was
O	saved
O	from
O	being
O	burnt
O	.
O	Then
O	Owain
O	returned
O	with
O	Luned
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	the
O	Lady
O	of
O	the
O	Fountain
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	went
O	thence
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	countess
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	his
O	wife
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	she
O	lived
O	.
