O	when

O	would

O	She
O	told
O	them
O	in
O	about
O	two
O	weeks
O	;
O	then
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	talk
O	about
O	what
O	they
O	wanted
O	for
O	dinner
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	their
O	mother
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	questions
O	.
O	She
O	told
O	them
O	she
O	hoped
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	turkey
O	and
O	even
O	the
O	pumpkin
O	pie
O	they
O	wanted
O	so
O	much
O	,
O	but
O	that

O	was
O	not

O	us
O	so
O	that
O	we
O	might
O	have
O	a
O	good
O	dinner
O	,

O	been
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	days
O	and
O	weeks
O	preparing
O	for
O	Thanksgiving
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	sent
O	the
O	sunshine
O	and
O	the
O	rain
O	and
O	caused
O	the
O	grains
O	and
O	fruits
O	and
O	vegetables
O	to
O	grow
O	.
O	And
O	Thanksgiving
O	Day
O	was
O	for
O	glad
O	and
O	happy
O	thoughts
O	about
O	God
O	,

O	Not
O	long
O	after
O	,
O	when
O	John

O	were

O	,
O	John

O	:

O	Then

O	they
O	did
O	?
O	Well
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	tell
O	you
O	.
O	They
O	saved
O	their
O	pennies
O	,
O	and
O	bought
O	some
O	corn
O	,
O	and
O	early
O	Thanksgiving
O	Day
O	,
O	before
O	they
O	had
O	their
O	dinner
O	,
O	they
O	went
O	out
O	into
O	the

O	home
O	,
O	and
O	scattered
O	corn

O	.
O	What
O	for
O	?
O	Why

O	for
O	the
O	birds
O	.
O	While

O	were
O	doing
O	it
O	,

O	by
O	the
O	birds
O	came
O	and
O	found
O	such
O	a
O	feast
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	they
O	knew
O	something
O	about
O	Thanksgiving

O	'
O	S
O	THANKSGIVING

O	On
O	the
O	evening
O	of
O	Thanksgiving
O	Day
O	,
O	John
O	Inglefield
O	,
O	the
O	blacksmith
O	,
O	sat
O	in
O	his
O	elbow-chair
O	among
O	those
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	keeping
O	festival
O	at
O	his
O	board
O	.
O	Being
O	the
O	central
O	figure
O	of
O	the
O	domestic
O	circle
O	,
O	the
O	fire
O	threw
O	its
O	strongest
O	light
O	on
O	his
O	massive
O	and
O	sturdy
O	frame
O	,
O	reddening
O	his
O	rough
O	visage
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	looked
O	like
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	an
O	iron
O	statue
O	,
O	all
O	aglow
O	,
O	from
O	his
O	own
O	forge
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	its
O	features
O	rudely
O	fashioned
O	on
O	his
O	own
O	anvil
O	.
O	At
O	John
O	Inglefield
O	'
O	s
O	right
O	hand
O	was
O	an
O	empty
O	chair
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	places
O	round
O	the
O	hearth
O	were
O	filled
O	by
O	the
O	members
O	of
O	the
O	family
O	,
O	who
O	all
O	sat
O	quietly
O	,
O	while
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	semblance
O	of
O	fantastic
O	merriment
O	,
O	their
O	shadows
O	danced
O	on
O	the
O	wall
O	behind
O	them
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	the
O	group
O	was
O	John
O	Inglefield
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	bred
O	at
O	college
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	now
O	a
O	student
O	of
O	theology
O	at
O	Andover
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	also
O	a
O	daughter
O	of
O	sixteen
O	,
O	whom
O	nobody
O	could
O	look
O	at
O	without
O	thinking
O	of
O	a
O	rosebud
O	almost
O	blossomed
O	.
O	The
O	only
O	other
O	person
O	at
O	the
O	fireside
O	was
O	Robert
O	Moore
O	,
O	formerly
O	an
O	apprentice
O	of
O	the
O	blacksmith
O	,
O	but
O	now
O	his
O	journeyman
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	seemed
O	more
O	like
O	an
O	own
O	son
O	of
O	John
O	Inglefield
O	than
O	did
O	the
O	pale
O	and
O	slender
O	student
O	.
O	Only
O	these
O	four
O	had
O	kept
O	New
O	England
O	'
O	s
O	festival
O	beneath
O	that
O	roof
O	.
O	The
O	vacant
O	chair
O	at
O	John
O	Inglefield
O	'
O	s
O	right
O	hand
O	was
O	in
O	memory
O	of
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	whom
O	death
O	had
O	snatched
O	from
O	him
O	since
O	the
O	previous
O	Thanksgiving
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	feeling
O	that
O	few
O	would
O	have
O	looked
O	for
O	in
O	his
O	rough
O	nature
O	,
O	the
O	bereaved
O	husband
O	had
O	himself
O	set
O	the
O	chair
O	in
O	its
O	place
O	next
O	his
O	own
O	;
O	and
O	often
O	did
O	his
O	eye
O	glance
O	hitherward
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	deemed
O	it
O	possible
O	that
O	the
O	cold
O	grave
O	might
O	send
O	back
O	its
O	tenant
O	to
O	the
O	cheerful
O	fireside
O	,
O	at
O	least
O	for
O	that
O	one
O	evening
O	.
O	Thus
O	did
O	he
O	cherish
O	the
O	grief
O	that
O	was
O	dear
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	another
O	grief
O	which
O	he
O	would
O	fain
O	have
O	torn
O	from
O	his
O	heart
O	;
O	or
O	,
O	since
O	that
O	could
O	never
O	be
O	,
O	have
O	buried
O	it
O	too
O	deep
O	for
O	others
O	to
O	behold
O	,
O	or
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	remembrance
O	.
O	Within
O	the
O	past
O	year
O	another
O	member
O	of
O	his
O	household
O	had
O	gone
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	to
O	the
O	grave
O	.
O	Yet
O	they
O	kept
O	no
O	vacant
O	chair
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	While
O	John
O	Inglefield
O	and
O	his
O	family
O	were
O	sitting
O	round
O	the
O	hearth
O	with
O	the
O	shadows
O	dancing
O	behind
O	them
O	on
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	the
O	outer
O	door
O	was
O	opened
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	light
O	footstep
O	came
O	along
O	the
O	passage
O	.
O	The
O	latch
O	of
O	the
O	inner
O	door
O	was
O	lifted
O	by
O	some
O	familiar
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	young
O	girl
O	came
O	in
O	,
O	wearing
O	a
O	cloak
O	and
O	hood
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	took
O	off
O	and
O	laid
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	beneath
O	the
O	looking-glass
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	after
O	gazing
O	a
O	moment
O	at
O	the
O	fireside
O	circle
O	,
O	she
O	approached
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	seat
O	at
O	John
O	Inglefield
O	'
O	s
O	right
O	hand
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	reserved
O	on
O	purpose
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	``
O	Here
O	I
O	am
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	father
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	she
O	.
O	``
O	You

O	,
O	but
O	I

O	come
O	back

O	spend
O	the

O	the
O	same
O	neat
O	and
O	maidenly
O	attire
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	accustomed
O	to
O	put
O	on
O	when
O	the
O	household
O	work
O	was
O	over
O	for
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	hair
O	was
O	parted
O	from
O	her
O	brow
O	in
O	the
O	simple
O	and
O	modest
O	fashion
O	that
O	became
O	her
O	best
O	of
O	all
O	.
O	If
O	her
O	cheek
O	might
O	otherwise
O	have
O	been
O	pale
O	,
O	yet
O	the
O	glow
O	of
O	the
O	fire
O	suffused
O	it
O	with
O	a
O	healthful
O	bloom
O	.
O	If
O	she
O	had
O	spent
O	the
O	many
O	months
O	of
O	her
O	absence
O	in
O	guilt
O	and
O	infamy
O	,
O	yet
O	they
O	seemed
O	to
O	have
O	left
O	no
O	traces
O	on
O	her
O	gentle
O	aspect
O	.
O	She
O	could
O	not
O	have
O	looked
O	less
O	altered
O	had
O	she
O	merely
O	stepped
O	away
O	from
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	fireside
O	for
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	,
O	and
O	returned
O	while
O	the
O	blaze
O	was
O	quivering
O	upward
O	from
O	the

O	burning
O	at
O	her
O	departure
O	.
O	And
O	to
O	John
O	Inglefield
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	very
O	image
O	of
O	his
O	buried
O	wife
O	,
O	such

O	Thanksgiving
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	passed
O	under
O	their
O	own
O	roof
O	.
O	Therefore
O	,
O	though
O	naturally
O	a
O	stern
O	and
O	rugged
O	man
O	,
O	he
O	could

O	Her

O	.
O	He
O	advanced

O	At

O	by
O	a

O	much
O	changed
O	to
O	respond
O	to
O	her
O	affection
O	,
O	or
O	that

O	be
O	felt
O	as
O	a
O	reproach
O	by
O	the
O	lost
O	one
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	familiar
O	voice
O	,
O	while
O	the

O	At

O	Mary
O	shuddered

O	stood
O	still
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	felt
O	that
O	something
O	darker
O	than
O	the
O	grave
O	was
O	between
O	Prudence
O	and
O	herself
O	,
O	though

O	in
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	their
O	father
O	'

O	hearth
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	had
O	grown
O	up
O	together
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	Prudence
O	threw
O	her
O	eyes
O	around
O	the
O	room
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	one
O	who
O	had
O	not
O	yet
O	bidden
O	her
O	welcome
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	withdrawn
O	from
O	his
O	seat
O	by
O	the
O	fireside
O	and
O	was
O	standing
O	near
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	face
O	averted
O	so
O	that
O	his
O	features
O	could
O	be
O	discerned
O	only
O	by
O	the
O	flickering
O	shadow
O	of
O	the
O	profile
O	upon
O	the
O	wall
O	.
O	But
O	Prudence
O	called
O	to
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	cheerful
O	and
O	kindly
O	tone
O	:
O	``
O	Come
O	,
O	Robert

O	``
O	Robert
O	Moore
O	held
O	back
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	,
O	but
O	affection
O	struggled
O	powerfully
O	and
O	overcame
O	his
O	pride
O	and
O	resentment
O	;
O	he
O	rushed
O	toward
O	Prudence
O	,
O	seized
O	her
O	hand

O	,
O	Robert

O	said
O	she
O	,
O	smiling
O	sadly
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	withdrew
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	``
O	you

O	warm
O	a

O	``
O	And
O	now
O	,
O	having
O	exchanged
O	greetings
O	with
O	each
O	member
O	of
O	the
O	family
O	,
O	Prudence
O	again
O	seated
O	herself
O	in
O	the
O	chair
O	at
O	John
O	Inglefield
O	'
O	s
O	right
O	hand
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	naturally
O	a
O	girl
O	of
O	quick
O	and
O	tender
O	sensibilities
O	,
O	gladsome
O	in
O	her
O	general
O	mood
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	a
O	bewitching
O	pathos
O	interfused
O	among
O	her
O	merriest
O	words
O	and
O	deeds
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	remarked
O	of
O	her
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	faculty
O	,
O	even
O	from
O	childhood
O	,
O	of
O	throwing
O	her
O	own
O	feelings
O	like
O	a
O	spell
O	over
O	her
O	companions
O	.
O	Such
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	in
O	her
O	days
O	of
O	innocence
O	,
O	so
O	did
O	she
O	appear
O	this
O	evening
O	.
O	Her
O	friends
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	surprise
O	and
O	bewilderment
O	of
O	her
O	return
O	,
O	almost
O	forgot
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	ever
O	left
O	them
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	forfeited
O	any
O	of
O	her
O	claims
O	to
O	their
O	affection
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	they
O	might
O	have
O	looked
O	at
O	her
O	with
O	altered
O	eyes
O	,
O	but
O	by
O	the
O	Thanksgiving
O	fireside
O	they
O	felt
O	only
O	that
O	their
O	own
O	Prudence
O	had
O	come
O	back
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	thankful
O	.
O	John
O	Inglefield
O	'
O	s
O	rough
O	visage
O	brightened
O	with
O	the
O	glow
O	of
O	his
O	heart
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	grew
O	warm
O	and
O	merry
O	within
O	him
O	;
O	once
O	or
O	twice
O	,
O	even
O	,
O	he
O	laughed
O	till
O	the
O	room
O	rang
O	again
O	,
O	yet
O	seemed
O	startled
O	by
O	the
O	echo
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	mirth
O	.
O	The
O	brave
O	young
O	minister
O	became
O	as
O	frolicsome
O	as
O	a
O	schoolboy
O	.
O	Mary
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	the
O	rosebud
O	,
O	forgot
O	that
O	her
O	twin-blossom
O	had
O	ever
O	been
O	torn
O	from
O	the
O	stem
O	and
O	trampled
O	in
O	the
O	dust
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	for
O	Robert
O	Moore
O	,
O	he
O	gazed
O	at
O	Prudence
O	with
O	the
O	bashful
O	earnestness
O	of
O	love
O	new-born
O	,
O	while
O	she
O	,
O	with
O	sweet
O	maiden
O	coquetry
O	,
O	half
O	smiled
O	upon
O	and
O	half
O	discouraged
O	him
O	.
O	In
O	short
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	those
O	intervals
O	when
O	sorrow
O	vanishes
O	in
O	its
O	own
O	depth
O	of
O	shadow
O	,
O	and
O	joy
O	starts
O	forth
O	in
O	transitory
O	brightness
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	clock
O	struck
O	eight
O	,
O	Prudence
O	poured
O	out
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	customary
O	draught
O	of
O	herb
O	tea
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	steeping
O	by
O	the
O	fireside
O	ever
O	since
O	twilight
O	.
O	``
O	God
O	bless
O	you
O	,
O	child
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	John
O	Inglefield
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	cup
O	from
O	her
O	hand
O	;
O	``
O	you
O	have
O	made
O	your
O	old
O	father
O	happy
O	again
O	.
O	But
O	we
O	miss
O	your
O	mother
O	sadly
O	,
O	Prudence
O	,
O	sadly
O	.
O	It
O	seems
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	ought

O	``
O	``
O	Now

O	the

O	worship
O	.
O	But
O	while
O	the
O	family
O	were
O	making
O	preparations
O	for
O	this
O	duty
O	,
O	they
O	suddenly
O	perceived
O	that

O	had
O	put
O	on
O	her
O	cloak
O	and
O	hood
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	lifting
O	the
O	latch
O	of
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	``
O	Prudence
O	,
O	Prudence

O	where
O	are
O	you
O	going
O	?
O	``
O	cried
O	they
O	all
O	with
O	one
O	voice
O	.
O	As
O	Prudence
O	passed
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	she
O	turned
O	toward
O	them

O	flung
O	back
O	her
O	hand
O	with
O	a
O	gesture
O	of

O	.
O	But
O	her
O	face
O	was
O	so
O	changed
O	that
O	they
O	hardly
O	recognized
O	it
O	.
O	Sin
O	and
O	evil
O	passions
O	glowed
O	through
O	its
O	comeliness
O	,
O	and
O	wrought
O	a
O	horrible
O	deformity
O	;
O	a
O	smile
O	gleamed
O	in
O	her
O	eyes
O	,
O	as
O	of
O	triumphant
O	mockery
O	,
O	at
O	their
O	surprise
O	and
O	grief
O	.
O	``
O	Daughter
O	,
O	``
O	cried
O	John
O	Inglefield
O	,
O	between
O	wrath
O	and

O	``
O	For
O	an
O	instant
O	Prudence
O	lingered

O	looked
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	fire-lighted
O	room
O	,
O	while
O	her
O	countenance
O	wore
O	almost
O	the
O	expression
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	struggling
O	with
O	a
O	fiend
O	who
O	had
O	power
O	to
O	seize
O	his
O	victim
O	even
O	within
O	the
O	hallowed
O	precincts
O	of

O	hearth
O	.
O	The
O	fiend
O	prevailed
O	,
O	and
O	Prudence
O	vanished
O	into
O	the
O	outer
O	darkness
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	family
O	rushed
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	they
O	could
O	see
O	nothing
O	,
O	but
O	heard
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	wheels
O	rattling
O	over
O	the
O	frozen
O	ground
O	.
O	That
O	same
O	night
O	,
O	among
O	the
O	painted
O	beauties
O	at
O	the
O	theatre
O	of
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	city
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	one
O	whose
O	dissolute
O	mirth
O	seemed
O	inconsistent
O	with
O	any
O	sympathy
O	for

O	affections
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	the
O	joys

O	Yet
O	this

O	Prudence
O	Inglefield
O	.
O	Her
O	visit
O	to
O	the
O	Thanksgiving

O	was
O	the
O	realization

O	when

O	got
O	out

O	said
O	to
O	himself
O	that
O	you
O	could
O	not
O	shoot
O	prairie
O	chickens
O	without
O	ammunition
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	bait
O	even
O	if
O	he
O	tried
O	to
O	use
O	his
O	quail
O	traps
O	.
O	He
O	also
O	reflected
O	that
O	his

O	looked
O	thin
O	and
O	pale
O	,
O	that
O	sister
O	Ellie
O	needed
O	shoes
O	,
O	and
O	that

O	used
O	to

O	But
O	this

O	the
O	day
O	for
O	his
O	story
O	paper
O	--
O	post-office
O	day
O	--
O	which
O	seemed
O	to
O	cheer
O	things
O	up
O	somehow
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	town
O	for
O	the
O	mail

O	would
O	see

O	So
O	the

O	,
O	with

O	on

O	and
O	the

O	.
O	His

O	Just
O	then
O	the
O	voice

O	shrank
O	down

O	Minty
O	did
O	not

O	It
O	was
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	relief
O	that
O	tears

O	a
O	little
O	more
O	conversation
O	,
O	the
O	minister
O	'

O	Aunt

O	.
O	And
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	way
O	in

O	could
O	earn
O	money
O	enough
O	to

O	the

O	a

O	Minty

O	could
O	give
O	the
O	minister

O	to
O	ease
O	her
O	troubled
O	conscience

O	There
O	was
O	her
O	Bunker
O	Hill
O	monument
O	,
O	made
O	of
O	shells
O	,
O	her
O	most
O	precious
O	treasure
O	;
O	she
O	would
O	gladly
O	have
O	parted
O	with
O	even
O	that
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	stood
O	upon
O	the
O	table
O	in
O	the
O	parlour
O	,
O	and
O	Aunt
O	Kittredge
O	would
O	discover
O	so
O	soon
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	gone
O	.
O	And
O	Aunt
O	Kittredge
O	was
O	quite
O	capable
O	of
O	asking
O	the
O	minister
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	to
O	return
O	it
O	.
O	Minty
O	felt
O	,
O	despairingly
O	,
O	that
O	this
O	atonement
O	was
O	impossible
O	.
O	But
O	suddenly
O	a
O	bright
O	idea
O	struck
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	feather
O	on
O	her
O	summer
O	Sunday
O	hat
O	!
O	It
O	was
O	blue
O	--
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	white
O	originally
O	,
O	but
O	Aunt
O	Kittredge
O	had
O	thriftily
O	had
O	it
O	dyed
O	when
O	it
O	became
O	soiled
O	.
O	Blue
O	would
O	be
O	very
O	becoming
O	to
O	the
O	minister
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	she
O	would
O	like
O	it
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	her
O	gull
O	'
O	s
O	wing
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	another
O	sly
O	visit
O	to
O	the
O	chilly
O	spare
O	chamber
O	.
O	Minty
O	took
O	the
O	summer
O	Sunday
O	hat
O	from
O	its
O	bandbox
O	in
O	the
O	closet
O	,
O	and
O	carefully
O	abstracted
O	the
O	blue
O	feather
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	slightly
O	faded
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	were
O	some
O	traces
O	of
O	the
O	wetting
O	it
O	had
O	received
O	in
O	a
O	thunderstorm
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	handkerchief
O	which
O	Aunt
O	Kittredge
O	carefully
O	pinned
O	over
O	it
O	;
O	but
O	Minty
O	thought
O	it
O	still
O	a
O	very
O	beautiful
O	feather
O	.
O	She
O	put
O	it
O	into
O	a
O	little
O	pasteboard
O	box
O	,
O	wrote
O	the
O	minister
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	'
O	s
O	name
O	on
O	it
O	,
O	placed
O	it
O	on
O	her
O	doorstep
O	at
O	dusk
O	,
O	rang
O	the
O	bell
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	away
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	nearly
O	a
O	week
O	before
O	she
O	could
O	find
O	this
O	opportunity
O	to
O	present
O	the
O	feather
O	,
O	for
O	Aunt
O	Kittredge
O	didn
O	'
O	t
O	allow
O	her
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	after
O	dark
O	;
O	and
O	in
O	all
O	that
O	time
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	negotiate
O	with
O	Lot
O	Rankin
O	,
O	for
O	Lot
O	had
O	the
O	mumps
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	very
O	next
O	day
O	after
O	the
O	minister
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	received
O	her
O	feather
O	--
O	as

O	Cyrus
O	in
O	the
O	logging

O	stood

O	up
O	with

O	Together
O	they

O	,
O	together
O	they
O	looked
O	;
O	looking
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	things
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	human
O	eyes
O	;

O	had
O	walked
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	together
O	for
O	years
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	a
O	world
O	dividing
O	their
O	hearts
O	;
O	and
O	what
O	was
O	ever
O	to
O	unite
O	them
O	?
O	Even
O	then
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	moved
O	along
O	,
O	she
O	murmured
O	half
O	aloud
O	,
O	half
O	to
O	herself
O	,
O	thinking
O	of
O	the
O	anxiety
O	that
O	had
O	passed
O	away
O	:
O	``
O	Thou
O	visitest
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	and
O	blessest
O	it
O	;
O	thou
O	makest
O	it
O	very
O	plenteous
O	.
O	``
O	To
O	which
O	he
O	answered
O	,
O	if
O	answer
O	it
O	may
O	be
O	called
O	,
O	``
O	Why
O	are
O	you
O	always
O	so
O	gloomy
O	?
O	Why
O	should
O	Scripture
O	be
O	quoted
O	about
O	such
O	common
O	things
O	?
O	``
O	And
O	she
O	looked
O	in
O	his
O	face
O	and
O	smiled
O	,
O	but
O	did
O	not
O	speak
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	read
O	the
O	smile
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	her
O	heart
O	was
O	as
O	hidden
O	to
O	him
O	as
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	the
O	corn
O	blades
O	in
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	they
O	went
O	home
O	together
O	,
O	no
O	more
O	being
O	said
O	by
O	either
O	;

O	round
O	,
O	the

O	setting
O	sun
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	freshly
O	growing
O	wheat

O	brought
O	tears
O	into
O	her

O	.
O	_She_

O	And
O	when

O	that

O	she
O	wrote

O	``
O	Very

O	were
O	the
O	next
O	few
O	weeks
O	that
O	followed
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	nature
O	seemed
O	to
O	rejoice
O	in
O	the
O	weather
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	corn

O	shot
O	up
O	till

O	two

O	the
O	Master
O	of
O	the

O	had
O	no
O	complaints
O	to

O	.
O	But
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	behold
O	,
O	the
O	earth
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	hard
O	and
O	dry
O	again
O	,
O	for
O	once
O	more
O	rain
O	was
O	wanted
O	;
O	and
O	by
O	degrees
O	the
O	growing
O	plants
O	failed
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	moisture
O	and
O	nourishment
O	,
O	and
O	lost
O	power
O	and
O	colour
O	,
O	and
O	became
O	weak
O	and
O	yellow
O	in
O	hue
O	.
O	And
O	once
O	more
O	the
O	husbandmen
O	began
O	to
O	fear
O	and
O	tremble
O	,
O	and
O	once
O	more
O	the
O	brow
O	of
O	the
O	Master
O	of
O	the
O	Harvest
O	was
O	over-clouded
O	with
O	angry
O	apprehension
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	the
O	man
O	got
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	anxious
O	about
O	the
O	fate
O	of
O	his
O	crops
O	,
O	he
O	grew
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	irritable
O	and
O	distrustful
O	,
O	and
O	railed
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	only
O	louder
O	now
O	,
O	against
O	the
O	heavens
O	because
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	rain
O	;
O	against
O	the
O	earth
O	because
O	it
O	lacked
O	moisture
O	;
O	against
O	the
O	corn
O	plants
O	because
O	they
O	had
O	waxed
O	feeble
O	.
O	Nay
O	,
O	once
O	,
O	when
O	his
O	sick
O	wife
O	reproved
O	him
O	gently
O	,
O	praying
O	him
O	to
O	remember
O	how
O	his
O	fears
O	had
O	been
O	turned
O	to
O	joy
O	before
O	,
O	he
O	reproached
O	her
O	in
O	his
O	turn
O	for
O	sitting
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	pretending
O	to
O	judge
O	of
O	what
O	she
O	could
O	know
O	nothing
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	her
O	come
O	out
O	and
O	see
O	for
O	herself
O	how
O	all
O	things
O	were
O	working
O	together
O	for
O	ill
O	.
O	And
O	although
O	he
O	spoke
O	it
O	in
O	bitter
O	jest
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	very
O	ill
O	,
O	she
O	said
O	she
O	would
O	go
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	.
O	So
O	once
O	more
O	they
O	walked
O	out
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	once
O	more
O	looked
O	over
O	the
O	cornfields
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	stretched
O	out
O	his
O	arm
O	and
O	pointed
O	to
O	the
O	long
O	ridges
O	of
O	blades
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	saw
O	them
O	shrunken
O	and
O	faded
O	in
O	hue
O	,
O	her
O	heart
O	was
O	grieved
O	within
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	turned
O	aside
O	and
O	wept
O	over
O	them
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	she
O	said
O	she
O	durst
O	not
O	cease
O	from
O	hope
O	,
O	since
O	an
O	hour
O	might
O	renew
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	if
O	God
O	so
O	willed
O	;
O	neither
O	should
O	she
O	dare
O	to
O	complain
O	,
O	_even
O	the
O	harvest
O	were
O	to
O	fail_
O	.
O	At
O	which
O	words
O	the
O	Master
O	of
O	the
O	Harvest
O	stopped
O	short
O	,
O	amazed
O	,
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	for
O	her
O	soul
O	was
O	growing
O	stronger
O	as
O	her
O	body
O	grew
O	weaker
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	dared
O	to
O	say
O	things
O	now
O	which
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	had
O	no
O	courage
O	to
O	utter
O	before
O	.
O	But
O	of
O	all
O	this
O	he
O	knew
O	nothing
O	,
O	and
O	what
O	he
O	thought
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	listened
O	,
O	was
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	as
O	weak
O	in
O	mind
O	as
O	in
O	body
O	;
O	and
O	what
O	he
O	said
O	was
O	that
O	a
O	man
O	must
O	be
O	an
O	idiot
O	who
O	would
O	not
O	complain
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	bread
O	taken
O	from
O	under
O	his
O	very
O	eyes
O	!
O	And
O	his
O	murmurings
O	and
O	her
O	tears
O	sent
O	a
O	shudder
O	all
O	along
O	the
O	long
O	ridges
O	of
O	sickly
O	corn
O	blades
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	asked
O	one
O	of
O	another
O	,
O	``

O	And
O	behold
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	wish
O	was
O	yet
O	on
O	their
O	lips
O	,
O	the
O	sky
O	became
O	charged
O	with
O	clouds
O	,
O	darkness
O	spread
O	over
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	a
O	wild
O	wind
O	rose
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	growling
O	of
O	thunder
O	announced
O	a
O	storm
O	.
O	And
O	such
O	a
O	storm
O	!
O	People
O	hid
O	from
O	it
O	in
O	cellars
O	and
O	closets
O	and
O	dark
O	corners
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	now
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	,
O	they
O	believed
O	in
O	a
O	God
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	trembling
O	at
O	the
O	new-found
O	fact
O	;
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	could
O	never
O	discover
O	Him
O	in
O	His
O	sunshine
O	and
O	blessings
O	,
O	but
O	only
O	thus
O	in
O	His
O	tempests
O	and
O	wrath
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	along
O	the
O	long
O	ridges
O	of
O	wheat
O	plants
O	drove
O	the
O	rain-laden
O	blast
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	bent
O	down
O	before
O	it
O	and
O	rose
O	up
O	again
O	,
O	like
O	the
O	waves
O	of
O	a
O	labouring
O	sea
O	.
O	Ears
O	over
O	ears
O	they
O	bowed
O	down
O	;
O	ears
O	above
O	ears
O	they
O	rose
O	up
O	.
O	They
O	bowed
O	down
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	knew
O	that
O	to
O	resist
O	was
O	destruction
O	;
O	they
O	rose
O	up
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	a
O	hope
O	beyond
O	the
O	storm
O	.
O	Only
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	whirlwinds
O	were
O	the
O	strongest
O	,
O	they
O	fell
O	down
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	lift
O	themselves
O	again
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	damage
O	done
O	was
O	but
O	little
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	general
O	good
O	was
O	great
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	Master
O	of
O	the
O	Harvest
O	saw
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	patches
O	of
O	overweighted
O	corn
O	yet
O	dripping
O	from
O	the
O	thunder
O	showers
O	,
O	he
O	grew
O	angry
O	for
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	forgot
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	the
O	long
O	ridges
O	that
O	stretched
O	over
O	his
O	fields
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	corn
O	ears
O	were
O	swelling
O	and
O	rejoicing
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	came
O	in
O	gloomy
O	to
O	his
O	home
O	,
O	when
O	his
O	wife
O	was
O	hoping
O	that
O	now
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	all
O	would
O	be
O	well
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	looked
O	at
O	him
O	the
O	tumult
O	of
O	her
O	soul
O	grew
O	beyond
O	control
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	knelt
O	down
O	before
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	sat
O	moody
O	in
O	his
O	chair
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	her
O	arms
O	round
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	out
O	:
O	``
O	It
O	is

O	Oh
O	,
O	husband
O	!
O	pray
O	for
O	the
O	corn
O	and
O	for
O	me
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	may
O	go
O	well
O	with
O	us
O	at
O	the
O	last

O	Carry
O	me
O	upstairs
O	!
O	``
O	And
O	his
O	anger
O	was
O	checked
O	by
O	fear
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	carried
O	her
O	upstairs
O	and
O	laid
O	her
O	on
O	the

O	be
O	the
O	storm

O	.
O	But
O	whether

O	prayed
O	for
O	either
O	the
O	corn
O	or
O	her
O	that
O	night
O	she
O	never
O	knew
O	.
O	And
O	presently
O	came
O	a
O	new
O	distress
O	:
O	for
O	when
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	rain
O	had
O	accomplished
O	their
O	gracious
O	work
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	one
O	was
O	satisfied
O	,
O	behold
O	,
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	cease
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	hitherto
O	the
O	cry
O	had
O	gone
O	up
O	for
O	water
O	on
O	the
O	furrows
O	,
O	so
O	now
O	men

O	,
O	and
O	lest

O	the
O	full
O	,
O	rich
O	ears
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	glorious
O	crops
O	should
O	be
O	lost
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Master
O	of
O	the
O	Harvest
O	walked
O	out
O	by
O	his
O	cornfields
O	,
O	his
O	face
O	darker
O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	railed
O	against
O	the
O	rain
O	because
O	it
O	would
O	not
O	cease
O	;
O	against
O	the
O	sun

O	.

O	little
O	ones
O	pattered
O	after
O	Mamma
O	Mouse
O	,
O	and
O	eight
O	bright
O	eyes
O	spied
O	a
O	dinner
O	worth
O	running
O	for
O	.
O	Never
O	mind
O	what
O	they
O	did
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	Johnnie
O	awoke
O	at
O	the
O	strains
O	of
O	the
O	closing
O	hymn
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	remember
O	what
O	had
O	gone
O	wrong
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	nothing
O	of
O	the
O	pink-frosted
O	cakes
O	save
O	some
O	scattered
O	crumbs
O	.
O	What
O	could
O	have
O	become
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	,
O	in
O	bewilderment
O	.
O	He
O	hardly
O	knew
O	how
O	he
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	church
O	that
O	day
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	rushing
O	down
O	the
O	road
O	a
O	sadder
O	and
O	a
O	wiser
O	boy
O	.
O	Grandma
O	and
O	papa
O	had
O	remained
O	to
O	chat
O	.
O	Johnnie
O	did
O	not
O	feel
O	like
O	chatting
O	to-day
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	house
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	go
O	in
O	,
O	but
O	out
O	to
O	the
O	hayloft
O	,
O	his
O	favourite
O	resort
O	in
O	time
O	of
O	trouble
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	dinner
O	bell
O	sounded
O	,
O	notwithstanding
O	the
O	delicious
O	Thanksgiving
O	odours
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	wafted
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	barn
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	an
O	unwelcome
O	summons
O	;
O	yet
O	go
O	he
O	must
O	,
O	and
O	walking
O	sheepishly
O	into
O	the
O	dining-room
O	,
O	he
O	slunk
O	into
O	his
O	chair
O	.
O	``
O	Well
O	,
O	John
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	helped
O	him
O	to
O	turkey
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	understand
O	that
O	you
O	did
O	not
O	forget
O	the
O	poor
O	to-day
O	.
O	Eh
O	,
O	my
O	son
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	The
O	poor
O	?
O	``
O	What
O	could
O	he
O	mean
O	?
O	Johnnie
O	was
O	too
O	puzzled
O	to
O	speak
O	.
O	Then
O	his
O	father
O	went
O	on
O	to
O	tell
O	how
O	little
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Mouse
O	and
O	her
O	babies
O	had
O	nibbled
O	a
O	wondrous
O	dinner
O	of
O	pink
O	thimble
O	cakes
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	of
O	pew
O	number
O	one
O	while
O	Johnnie
O	slept
O	.
O	Grandma
O	and
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Smiley
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	all
O	about
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	way
O	home
O	;
O	besides
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	enough
O	himself
O	from
O	the
O	pulpit
O	.
O	Johnny
O	bravely
O	bore
O	the
O	laugh
O	at
O	his
O	expense
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	merriment
O	died
O	away
O	heaved
O	a
O	deep
O	sigh
O	of
O	relief
O	,
O	and
O	exclaimed
O	,
O	``
O	Well
