O	heard
O	the
O	lapping
O	of

O	in
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	after

O	into
O	deepening

O	.
O	Stopping

O	an

O	put
O	on
O	the

O	ring
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	walking
O	on
O	again
O	,
O	he

O	the

O	from

O	One
O	step
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	water
O	closed
O	over
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	Once
O	under
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	hesitated
O	,
O	uncertain
O	as
O	to
O	which
O	way
O	to
O	turn
O	.
O	Little
O	by
O	little
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	his
O	eyes
O	grew
O	accustomed
O	to
O	the
O	touch
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	he

O	,
O	lying
O	on

O	a
O	few
O	feet
O	ahead
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	a
O	small
O	ball
O	glowing
O	with
O	a
O	pale
O	phosphorescent
O	light
O	.
O	Stooping
O	to
O	touch
O	this
O	strange
O	object
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	discovered
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	small
O	round
O	sea-plant
O	which
O	had
O	anchored
O	itself
O	to
O	a
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	he
O	discovered
O	that
O	this
O	light
O	was
O	but
O	one
O	of
O	thousands
O	which
O	together
O	formed
O	a
O	long
O	straight
O	line
O	across
O	the
O	level
O	floor
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Rightly
O	imagining
O	these
O	lights
O	to
O	be
O	signs
O	of
O	a
O	sea-world
O	road
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	advanced
O	along
O	them
O	.
O	A
O	slow
O	walk
O	of
O	ten
O	long
O	leagues
O	brought
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	City
O	under
O	the
O	Sea
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	very
O	little
O	light
O	there
O	,
O	save
O	for
O	that
O	which
O	came
O	through
O	the
O	waters
O	from
O	the

O	above
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	was
O	but
O	a
O	faint
O	,
O	pale
O	green
O	glow
O	,
O	which
O	lay
O	,
O	more
O	like

O	than

O	on
O	the
O	roofs
O	and
O	tower-tops
O	of
O	the
O	submerged
O	town
O	.
O	The
O	sailor
O	walked
O	unchallenged
O	through
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	street
O	of
O	the

O	.
O	Along
O	the

O	grew

O	,

O	out
O	in

O	through

O	moved
O	heavily
O	in
O	the
O	currents
O	,
O	little
O	fish
O	darted
O	like
O	birds
O	.
O	Many
O	people
O	walked
O	slowly
O	to
O	and
O	fro--strange
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	all
O	dressed
O	alike
O	in
O	tight-fitting
O	garments
O	of
O	shining
O	,
O	fish-like
O	scales
O	.
O	The
O	sailor
O	looked
O	into
O	their
O	faces
O	and
O	saw
O	that

O	stared
O	as
O	strangely
O	as
O	men
O	suddenly
O	waked
O	from
O	sleep
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	seeing
O	their
O	younger
O	brother
O	,
O	they
O	ran
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	threw
O	their
O	arms
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	a
O	thousand
O	questions
O	about
O	their
O	father
O	and
O	the
O	quest
O	of
O	the
O	emerald
O	.
O	The
O	golden-eyed
O	brides
O	watched
O	them
O	with
O	sad
O	faces
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	broke
O	into
O	quiet
O	tears
O	.
O	Imagine
O	their
O	joy
O	,
O	when
O	their
O	husbands
O	returned
O	to
O	them
O	and
O	bade
O	them
O	be
O	of
O	good
O	cheer
O	.
O	Thus
O	was
O	true
O	love
O	found
O	to
O	be
O	mightier
O	than
O	the
O	mightiest
O	spell
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	princesses
O	of
O	the

O	had
O	dried
O	their
O	tears
O	,
O	the

O	now
O	we

O	.
O	All
O	the

O	,
O	waiting
O	anxiously

O	so
O	anxiously

O	to

O	the
O	quick

O	on
O	the
O	winding

O	the

O	the

O	Meanwhile

O	the

O	the

O	Just
O	as
O	the

O	Suddenly
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	,
O	whose
O	eyes
O	were
O	the

O	,
O	saw
O	a

O	The

O	hurried
O	toward

O	and
O	seized
O	it
O	.
O	Suddenly

O	The
O	old

O	lay
O	on

O	many
O	people
O	doubted
O	whether
O	there
O	could
O	be
O	real
O	trees
O	that
O	bore
O	apples
O	of
O	solid
O	gold
O	upon
O	their
O	branches
O	.
O	All
O	had
O	heard
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	but
O	nobody
O	remembered
O	to
O	have
O	seen
O	any
O	.
O	Children
O	,
O	nevertheless
O	,
O	used
O	to
O	listen
O	,
O	open-mouthed
O	,
O	to
O	stories
O	of
O	the
O	golden
O	apple
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	resolved
O	to
O	discover
O	it
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	should
O	be
O	big
O	enough
O	.
O	Adventurous
O	young
O	men
O	,
O	who
O	desired
O	to
O	do
O	a
O	braver
O	thing
O	than
O	any
O	of
O	their
O	fellows
O	,
O	set
O	out
O	in
O	quest
O	of
O	this
O	fruit
O	.
O	Many
O	of
O	them
O	returned
O	no
O	more;
O	none
O	of
O	them
O	brought
O	back
O	the
O	apples
O	.
O	No
O	wonder
O	that
O	they
O	found
O	it
O	impossible
O	to
O	gather
O	them
O	!
O	It
O	is
O	said
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	dragon
O	beneath
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	hundred
O	terrible
O	heads
O	,
O	fifty
O	of
O	which
O	were
O	always
O	on
O	the
O	watch
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	other
O	fifty
O	slept
O	.
O	In
O	my
O	opinion
O	it
O	was
O	hardly
O	worth
O	running
O	so
O	much
O	risk
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	a
O	solid
O	golden
O	apple
O	.
O	Had
O	the
O	apples
O	been
O	sweet
O	,
O	mellow
O	,
O	and
O	juicy
O	,
O	indeed
O	that
O	would
O	be
O	another
O	matter
O	.
O	There
O	might
O	then
O	have
O	been
O	some
O	sense
O	in
O	trying
O	to
O	get
O	at
O	them
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	hundred-headed
O	dragon
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	already
O	told
O	you
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	a
O	common
O	thing
O	with
O	young
O	persons
O	,
O	when
O	tired
O	of
O	too
O	much
O	peace
O	and
O	rest
O	,
O	to
O	go
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	the
O	garden
O	of
O	the
O	Hesperides
O	.
O	And
O	once
O	the
O	adventure
O	was
O	undertaken
O	by
O	a
O	hero
O	who
O	had
O	enjoyed

O	little

O	or
O	rest
O	since
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	the

O	.
O	At
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	am
O	going
O	to

O	,
O	he
O	was
O	wandering
O	through

O	pleasant

O	of
O	Italy
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	mighty
O	club
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	bow
O	and
O	quiver
O	slung
O	across
O	his
O	shoulders
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	wrapt
O	in
O	the
O	skin
O	of
O	the
O	biggest
O	and
O	fiercest
O	lion
O	that
O	ever
O	had
O	been
O	seen
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	he
O	himself
O	had
O	killed;
O	and
O	though
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	whole
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	kind
O	,
O	and
O	generous
O	,
O	and
O	noble
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	of
O	the
O	lion
O	'
O	s
O	fierceness
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	,
O	he
O	continually
O	inquired
O	whether
O	that
O	were
O	the
O	right
O	road
O	to
O	the
O	famous
O	garden
O	.
O	But

O	You

O	,
O	plainly
O	enough
O	,

O	The

O	Hercules
O	found

O	But
O	,
O	suddenly
O	,
O	as

O	.
O	Another
O	forest
O	sprang
O	up

O	grew
O	ancient

O	oak
O	trees
O	,

O	six
