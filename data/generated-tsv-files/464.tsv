O	Waupee
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	White
O	Hawk
O	,
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	remote
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	where
O	animals
O	abounded
O	.
O	Every
O	day
O	he
O	returned
O	from
O	the
O	chase
O	with
O	a
O	large
O	spoil
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	skillful
O	and
O	lucky
O	hunters
O	of
O	his
O	tribe
O	.
O	His
O	form
O	was
O	like
O	the
O	cedar
O	;
O	the
O	fire
O	of
O	youth
O	beamed
O	from
O	his
O	eye
O	;
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	forest
O	too
O	gloomy
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	penetrate
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	track
O	made
O	by
O	bird
O	or
O	beast
O	of
O	any
O	kind
O	which
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	readily
O	follow
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	he
O	had
O	gone
O	beyond
O	any
O	point
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	before
O	visited
O	.
O	He
O	traveled
O	through
O	an
O	open
O	wood
O	,
O	which
O	enabled
O	him
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	great
O	distance
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	he
O	beheld
O	a
O	light
O	breaking
O	through
O	the
O	foliage
O	of
O	the
O	distant
O	trees
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	sure
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	borders
O	of
O	a
O	prairie
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	wide
O	plain
O	,
O	covered
O	with
O	long
O	blue
O	grass
O	,
O	and
O	enameled
O	with
O	flowers
O	of
O	a
O	thousand
O	lovely
O	tints
O	.
O	After
O	walking
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	without
O	a
O	path
O	,
O	musing
O	upon
O	the
O	open
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	enjoying
O	the
O	fragrant
O	breeze
O	,
O	he
O	suddenly
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	ring
O	worn
O	among
O	the
O	grass
O	and
O	the
O	flowers
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	made
O	by
O	footsteps
O	moving
O	lightly
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	strange
O	--
O	so
O	strange
O	as
O	to
O	cause
O	the
O	White
O	Hawk
O	to
O	pause
O	and
O	gaze
O	long
O	and
O	fixedly
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	--
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	path
O	which
O	led
O	to
O	this
O	flowery
O	circle
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	not
O	even
O	a
O	crushed
O	leaf
O	nor
O	a
O	broken
O	twig
O	,
O	nor
O	the
O	least
O	trace
O	of
O	a
O	footstep
O	,
O	approaching
O	or
O	retiring
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	.
O	He
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	hide
O	himself
O	and
O	lie
O	in
O	wait
O	to
O	discover
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	,
O	what
O	this
O	strange
O	circle
O	meant
O	.
O	Presently
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	faint
O	sounds
O	of
O	music
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	they
O	came
O	from
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	magic
O	notes
O	died
O	away
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	small
O	object
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	little
O	summer
O	cloud
O	that
O	approaches
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	floating
O	down
O	from
O	above
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	small
O	,
O	and
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	could
O	have
O	been
O	blown
O	away
O	by
O	the
O	first
O	breeze
O	that
O	came
O	along
O	;
O	but
O	it
O	rapidly
O	grew
O	as
O	he
O	gazed
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	music
O	every
O	moment
O	came
O	clearer
O	and
O	more
O	sweetly
O	to
O	his
O	ear
O	.
O	As
O	it
O	neared
O	the
O	earth
O	it
O	appeared
O	as
O	a
O	basket
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	twelve
O	sisters
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	lovely
O	forms
O	and
O	enchanting
O	beauty
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	basket
O	touched
O	the
O	ground
O	they
O	leaped
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	straightway
O	to
O	dance
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	joyous
O	manner
O	,
O	around
O	the
O	magic
O	ring
O	,
O	striking
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	did
O	so
O	,
O	a
O	shining
O	ball
O	,
O	which
O	uttered
O	the
O	most
O	ravishing
O	melodies
O	,
O	and
O	kept
O	time
O	as
O	they
O	danced
O	.
O	The
O	White
O	Hawk
O	,
O	from
O	his
O	concealment
O	,
O	entranced
O	,
O	gazed
O	upon
O	their
O	graceful
O	forms
O	and
O	movements
O	.
O	He
O	admired
O	them
O	all
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	most
O	pleased
O	with
O	the
O	youngest
O	.
O	He
O	longed
O	to
O	be
O	at
O	her
O	side
O	,
O	to
O	embrace
O	her
O	,
O	to
O	call
O	her
O	his
O	own
O	;
O	and
O	unable
O	to
O	remain
O	longer
O	a
O	silent
O	admirer
O	,
O	he
O	rushed
O	out
O	and
O	endeavored
O	to
O	seize
O	this
O	twelfth
O	beauty
O	who
O	so
O	enchanted
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	sisters
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	quickness
O	of
O	birds
O	,
O	the
O	moment
O	they
O	descried
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	leaped
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	basket
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	drawn
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	Lamenting
O	his
O	ill-luck
O	,
O	Waupee
O	gazed
O	longingly
O	upon
O	the
O	fairy
O	basket
O	as
O	it
O	ascended
O	and
O	bore
O	the
O	lovely
O	sisters
O	from
O	his
O	view
O	.
O	``
O	They
O	are
O	gone
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	I
O	shall
O	see
O	them
O	no
O	more
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	solitary
O	lodge
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	found
O	no
O	relief
O	to
O	his
O	mind
O	.
O	He
O	walked
O	abroad
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	withdrawn
O	from
O	his
O	sight
O	the
O	only
O	being
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	loved
O	,
O	was
O	painful
O	to
O	him
O	now
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	selecting
O	the
O	same
O	hour
O	,
O	the
O	White
O	Hawk
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	prairie
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	his
O	station
O	near
O	the
O	ring
O	;
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	deceive
O	the
O	sisters
O	,
O	he
O	assumed
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	an
O	opossum
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	among
O	the
O	grass
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	there
O	engaged
O	in
O	chewing
O	the
O	cud
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	not
O	waited
O	long
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	cloudy
O	basket
O	descend
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	the
O	same
O	sweet
O	music
O	falling
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	He
O	crept
O	slowly
O	toward
O	the
O	ring
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	instant
O	the
O	sisters
O	caught
O	sight
O	of
O	him
O	they
O	were
O	startled
O	,
O	and
O	sprang
O	into
O	their
O	car
O	.
O	It
O	rose
O	a
O	short
O	distance
O	when
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	elder
O	sisters
O	spoke
O	:
O	``
O	Perhaps
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	it
O	is
O	come
O	to
O	show
O	us
O	how
O	the
O	game

O	by
O	mortals
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Oh
O	no
O	,
O	``
O	the
O	youngest
O	replied
O	;
O	``
O	quick
O	,
O	let
O	us
O	ascend
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	all
O	joining
O	in
O	a
O	chant
O	,
O	they
O	rose
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	.
O	Waupee
O	,
O	casting
O	off
O	his
O	disguise
O	,
O	walked
O	sorrowfully
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	lodge
O	--
O	but
O	ah
O	,
O	the
O	night
O	seemed
O	very
O	long
O	to
O	lonely
O	White
O	Hawk
O	!
O	His
O	whole
O	soul
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	beautiful
O	sister
O	.
O	Betimes
O	,
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	haunted
O	spot
O	,
O	hoping
O	and
O	fearing
O	,
O	and
O	sighing
O	as
O	though
O	his
O	very
O	soul
O	would
O	leave
O	his
O	body
O	in
O	its
O	anguish
O	.
O	He
O	reflected
O	upon
O	the
O	plan
O	he
O	should
O	follow
O	to
O	secure
O	success
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	already
O	failed
O	twice
O	;
O	to
O	fail
O	a
O	third
O	time
O	would
O	be
O	fatal
O	.
O	Near
O	by
O	he
O	found
O	an
O	old
O	stump
O	,
O	much
O	covered
O	with
O	moss
O	,
O	and
O	just
O	then
O	in
O	use
O	as
O	the
O	residence
O	of
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	mice
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	stopped
O	there
O	on
O	a
O	pilgrimage
O	to
O	some
O	relatives
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	prairie
O	.
O	The
O	White
O	Hawk
O	was
O	so
O	pleased
O	with
O	their
O	tidy
O	little
O	forms
O	that
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	mouse
O	,
O	especially
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	by
O	no
O	means
O	formidable
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	at
O	all
O	likely
O	to
O	create
O	alarm
O	.
O	He
O	accordingly
O	,
O	having
O	first
O	brought
O	the
O	stump
O	and
O	set
O	it
O	near
O	the
O	ring
O	,
O	without
O	further
O	notice
O	became
O	a
O	mouse
O	,
O	and
O	peeped
O	and
O	sported
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	kept
O	his
O	sharp
O	little
O	eyes
O	busy
O	with
O	the
O	others
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	forget
O	to
O	keep
O	one
O	eye
O	up
O	toward
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	ear
O	wide
O	open
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	direction
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	the
O	sisters
O	,
O	at
O	their
O	customary
O	hour
O	,
O	came
O	down
O	and
O	resumed
O	their
O	sport
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	see
O	,
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	younger
O	sister

O	.
O	``
O	She
O	ran
O	off
O	,
O	frightened
O	,
O	toward
O	the
O	basket
O	.
O	Her
O	sisters
O	only
O	smiled
O	,
O	and
O	gathering
O	round
O	the
O	old
O	tree-stump
O	,
O	they
O	struck
O	it
O	,
O	in
O	jest
O	,
O	when
O	out
O	ran
O	the
O	mice
O	,

O	Waupee
O	.
O	They
O	killed
O	them
O	all

O	one
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	pursued
O	by
O	the
O	younger
O	sister
O	.
O	Just
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	raised
O	a
O	silver
O	stick
O	which
O	she
O	held
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	to

O	,
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	the
O	White
O	Hawk
O	arose
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	clasped
O	his
O	prize
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	eleven
O	sprang
O	to
O	their
O	basket
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	drawn
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	skies
O	.
O	Waupee
O	exerted
O	all
O	his
O	skill
O	to
O	please
O	his
O	bride
O	and
O	win
O	her
O	affections
O	.
O	He
O	wiped
O	the
O	tears
O	from
O	her
O	eyes
O	;
O	he
O	related
O	his
O	adventures
O	in
O	the
O	chase
O	;
O	he
O	dwelt
O	upon
O	the
O	charms
O	of
O	life
O	on
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	constant
O	in
O	his
O	attentions
O	,
O	keeping
O	fondly
O	by

O	out
O	the

O	to
O	walk
O	as
O	he
O	led
O	her
O	gently
O	toward

O	Winter

O	the
O	spring
O	drew
O	near
O	with
O	its
O	balmy
O	gales
O	and
O	its
O	many-colored
O	flowers
O	,
O	their
O	happiness
O	was
O	increased
O	by
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	a
O	beautiful
O	boy
O	in
O	their
O	lodge
O	.
O	What
O	more
O	of
O	earthly
O	blessing
O	was
O	there
O	for
O	them
O	to
O	enjoy
O	?
O	Waupee
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	was
O	a
O	daughter
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	stars
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	scenes
O	of
O	earth
O	began
O	to
O	pall
O	upon
O	her
O	sight
O	,
O	she
O	sighed
O	to
O	revisit
O	her
O	father
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	hide
O	these
O	feelings
O	from
O	her
O	husband
O	.
O	She
O	remembered
O	the
O	charm
O	that
O	would
O	carry
O	her
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	while
O	White
O	Hawk
O	was
O	engaged
O	in
O	the
O	chase
O	,
O	she
O	took
O	occasion
O	to
O	construct
O	a
O	wicker
O	basket
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	kept
O	concealed
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	mean
O	time
O	,
O	she
O	collected
O	such
O	rarities
O	from
O	the
O	earth
O	as
O	she
O	thought
O	would
O	please
O	her
O	father
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	most
O	dainty
O	kinds
O	of
O	food
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	when
O	Waupee
O	was
O	absent
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	was
O	in
O	readiness
O	,
O	she
O	went
O	out
O	to
O	the
O	charmed
O	ring
O	,
O	taking
O	with
O	her
O	her
O	little
O	son
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	entered
O	the
O	car
O	she
O	commenced
O	her
O	magical
O	song
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	basket
O	rose
O	.
O	The
O	song
O	was
O	sad
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	a
O	lowly
O	and
O	mournful
O	cadence
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	wafted
O	far
O	away
O	by
O	the
O	wind
O	,
O	it
O	caught
O	her
O	husband
O	'
O	s
O	ear
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	voice
O	which
O	he
O	well
O	knew
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	instantly
O	ran
O	to
O	the
O	prairie
O	Though
O	he
O	made
O	breathless
O	speed
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	reach
O	the
O	ring
O	before
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	child
O	had
O	ascended
O	beyond
O	his
O	reach
O	.
O	He
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	voice
O	in
O	loud
O	appeals
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	unavailing
O	.
O	The
O	basket
O	still
O	went
O	up
O	.
O	He
O	watched
O	it
O	till
O	it
O	became
O	a
O	small
O	speck
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	it
O	vanished
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	bent
O	his
O	head
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	miserable
O	.
O	Through
O	a
O	long
O	winter
O	and
O	a
O	long
O	summer
O	Waupee
O	bewailed
O	his
O	loss
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	found
O	no
O	relief
O	.
O	The
O	beautiful
O	spirit
O	had
O	come
O	and
O	gone
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	should
O	see
O	it
O	no
O	more
O	!
O	He
O	mourned
O	his
O	wife
O	'
O	s
O	loss
O	sorely
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	son
O	'
O	s
O	still
O	more
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	boy
O	had
O	both
O	the
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	beauty
O	and
O	the
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	strength
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	mean
O	time
O	his
O	wife
O	had
O	reached
O	her
O	home
O	in
O	the
O	stars
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	blissful
O	employments
O	of
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	she
O	had
O	almost
O	forgotten
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	left
O	a
O	husband
O	upon
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	But
O	her
O	son
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	grew
O	up
O	,
O	resembled
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	day
O	he
O	was
O	restless
O	and
O	anxious
O	to
O	visit
O	the
O	scene
O	of
O	his
O	birth
O	.
O	His
O	grandfather
O	said
O	to
O	his
O	daughter
O	,
O	one
O	day
O	:
O	``
O	Go
O	,
O	my
O	child
O	,
O	and
O	take
O	your
O	son
O	down
O	to
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	and
O	ask
O	him
O	to
O	come
O	up
O	and
O	live
O	with
O	us
O	.
O	But
O	tell
O	him
O	to
O	bring
O	along
O	a
O	specimen
O	of
O	each
O	kind
O	of
O	bird
O	and
O	animal
O	he
O	kills
O	in
O	the
O	chase
O	.
O	``
O	She
O	accordingly
O	took
O	the
O	boy
O	and
O	descended
O	.
O	The
O	White
O	Hawk
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	ever
O	near
O	the
O	enchanted
O	spot
O	,
O	heard
O	her
O	voice
O	as
O	she
O	came
O	down
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	His
O	heart
O	beat
O	with
O	impatience
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	her
O	form
O	and
O	that
O	of
O	his
O	son
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	soon
O	clasped
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	.
O	He
O	heard
O	the
O	message
O	of
O	the
O	Star
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	hunt
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	activity
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	collect
O	the
O	present
O	with
O	all
O	dispatch
O	.
O	He
O	spent
O	whole
O	nights
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	days
O	,
O	in
O	searching
O	for
O	every
O	curious
O	and
O	beautiful
O	animal
O	and
O	bird
O	.
O	He
O	only
O	preserved
O	a
O	foot
O	,
O	a
O	wing
O	,
O	or
O	a
O	tail
O	of
O	each
O	.
O	When
O	all
O	was
O	ready
O	,
O	Waupee
O	visited
O	once
O	more
O	each
O	favorite
O	spot
O	--
O	the
O	hill-top
O	whence
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	used
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	rising
O	sun
O	;
O	the
O	stream
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	sported
O	as
O	a
O	boy
O	;
O	the
O	old
O	lodge
O	,
O	now
O	looking
O	sad
O	and
O	solemn
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	sit
O	in
O	no
O	more
O	;
O	and
O	last
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	coming
O	to
O	the
O	magic
O	circle
O	,
O	he
O	gazed
O	widely
O	around
O	him
O	with
O	tearful
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	taking
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	child
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	,
O	they
O	entered
O	the
O	car
O	and
O	were
O	drawn
O	up
O	--
O	into
O	a
O	country
O	far
O	beyond
O	the
O	flight
O	of
O	birds
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	mortal
O	eye
O	to
O	pierce
O	.
O	Great
O	joy
O	was
O	manifested
O	upon
O	their
O	arrival
O	at
O	the
O	starry
O	plains
O	.
O	The
O	Star
O	Chief
O	invited
O	all
O	his
O	people
O	to
O	a
O	feast
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	assembled
O	,
O	he
O	proclaimed
O	aloud
O	that
O	each
O	one
O	might
O	continue
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	an
O	inhabitant
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	dominions
O	,
O	or
O	select
O	of
O	the
O	earthly
O	gifts
O	such
O	as
O	he
O	liked
O	best
O	.
O	A
O	very
O	strange
O	confusion
O	immediately
O	arose
O	;
O	not
O	one
O	but
O	sprang
O	forward
O	.
O	Some
O	chose
O	a
O	foot
O	,
O	some
O	a
O	wing
O	,
O	some
O	a
O	tail
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	a
O	claw
O	.
O	Those
O	who
O	selected
O	tails
O	or
O	claws
O	were
O	changed
O	into
O	animals
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	off
O	;
O	the
O	others
O	assumed
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	birds
O	,
O	and
O	flew
O	away
O	.
O	Waupee
O	chose
O	a
O	white
O	hawk
O	'
O	s
O	feather
O	.
O	His
O	wife
O	and
O	son
O	followed
O	his
O	example
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	one
O	became
O	a
O	white
O	hawk
O	.
O	He
O	spread
O	his
O	wings
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	followed
O	by
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	son
O	,
O	descended
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	birds
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	is
O	still
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	brightness
O	of
O	the
O	starry
O	plains
O	in
O	his
O	eye
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	freedom
O	of
O	the
O	heavenly
O	breezes
O	in
O	his
O	wings
O	.
