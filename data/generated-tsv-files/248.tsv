O	Leelinau
O	was
O	the
O	favorite
O	daughter
O	of
O	a
O	hunter
O	,
O	who
O	lived
O	on
O	the
O	lake
O	shore
O	near
O	the
O	base
O	of
O	the
O	lofty
O	highlands
O	,
O	called
O	Kaug
O	Wudjoo
O	.
O	From
O	her
O	earliest
O	youth
O	she
O	was
O	observed
O	to
O	be
O	thoughtful
O	and
O	retiring
O	.
O	She
O	passed
O	much
O	of
O	her
O	time
O	in
O	solitude
O	,
O	and
O	seemed
O	ever
O	to
O	prefer
O	the
O	companionship
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	shadow
O	to
O	the
O	society
O	of
O	the
O	lodge-circle
O	.
O	Whenever
O	she
O	could
O	leave
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	lodge
O	she
O	would
O	fly
O	to
O	remote
O	haunts
O	and
O	recesses
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	or
O	sit
O	in
O	lonely
O	reverie
O	upon
O	some
O	high
O	promontory
O	of
O	rock
O	overlooking
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	In
O	such
O	places
O	she
O	would
O	often
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	face
O	turned
O	upward
O	,
O	linger
O	long
O	in
O	contemplation
O	of
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	invoking
O	her
O	guardian
O	spirit
O	,
O	and
O	beseeching
O	him
O	to
O	lighten
O	her
O	sadness
O	.
O	But
O	amid
O	all
O	the
O	leafy
O	haunts
O	,
O	none
O	drew
O	her
O	steps
O	toward
O	it
O	so
O	often
O	as
O	a
O	forest
O	of
O	pines
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	open
O	shore
O	,
O	called
O	Manitowok
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	Sacred
O	Wood
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	those
O	hallowed
O	places
O	which
O	is
O	the
O	resort
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	wild
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	turtle
O	spirits
O	or
O	fairies
O	which
O	delight
O	in
O	romantic
O	scenes
O	.
O	Owing
O	to
O	this
O	circumstance
O	,
O	its
O	green
O	retirement
O	was
O	seldom
O	visited
O	by
O	Indians
O	,
O	who
O	feared
O	to
O	fall
O	under
O	the
O	influence
O	of
O	its
O	mischievous
O	inhabitants
O	.
O	And
O	whenever
O	they
O	were
O	compelled
O	by
O	stress
O	of
O	weather
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	landing
O	on
O	this
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	coast
O	,
O	they
O	never
O	failed
O	to
O	leave
O	an
O	offering
O	of
O	tobacco
O	,
O	or
O	some
O	other
O	token
O	,
O	to
O	show
O	that
O	they
O	desired
O	to
O	stand
O	well
O	with
O	the
O	proprietors
O	of
O	the
O	fairy

O	.
O	To
O	this
O	sacred
O	spot
O	Leelinau
O	had
O	made
O	her
O	way
O	at
O	an
O	early
O	age
O	,
O	gathering
O	strange
O	flowers
O	and
O	plants
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	would
O	bring
O	home
O	to
O	her
O	parents
O	,
O	and
O	relate
O	to

O	all
O	the
O	haps
O	and
O	mishaps
O	that
O	had
O	occurred
O	in
O	her
O	rambles
O	.
O	Although
O	they
O	discountenanced
O	her
O	frequent
O	visits
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	restrain
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	of
O	so
O	gentle
O	and
O	delicate
O	a
O	temper
O	that
O	they
O	feared
O	to
O	thwart
O	her
O	.
O	Her
O	attachment
O	to
O	the
O	fairy
O	wood
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	grew
O	with
O	her
O	years
O	.
O	If

O	up

O	for
O	safety
O	at
O	the
O	Manitowok
