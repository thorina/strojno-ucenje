O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	lived
O	an
O	old
O	Queen
O	,
O	whose
O	husband
O	had
O	been
O	dead
O	some
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	her
O	with
O	one
O	child
O	,
O	a
O	beautiful
O	daughter
O	.
O	When
O	this
O	daughter
O	grew
O	up
O	she
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	married
O	to
O	a
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	who
O	lived
O	far
O	away
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	the
O	time
O	came
O	for
O	her
O	to
O	leave
O	,
O	the
O	mother
O	gave
O	her
O	daughter
O	a
O	lock
O	of
O	hair
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	Dear
O	child
O	,
O	preserve
O	this
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	will
O	help
O	you
O	out
O	of
O	trouble
O	.
O	``
O	Afterwards
O	the
O	mother
O	and
O	daughter
O	took
O	a
O	sorrowful
O	leave
O	of
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	princess
O	placed
O	the
O	lock
O	of
O	hair
O	in
O	her
O	bosom
O	,
O	mounted
O	her
O	horse
O	Falada
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	away
O	to
O	her
O	intended
O	bridegroom
O	.
O	Now
O	this
O	horse
O	could
O	speak
O	.
O	After
O	she
O	had
O	ridden
O	for
O	about
O	an
O	hour
O	she
O	became
O	very
O	thirsty
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	servant
O	,
O	``
O	Dismount
O	,
O	and
O	bring
O	me
O	some
O	water
O	from
O	yonder

O	in
O	the
O	cup
O	which
O	you
O	carry
O	with
O	you
O	,
O	for

O	.
O	``
O	``
O	If
O	you
O	are
O	thirsty
O	,

O	replied
O	the
O	servant
O	,
O	``
O	dismount
O	yourself

O	down
O	to

O	The
O	Princess

O	on

O	her
O	great
O	thirst
O	,
O	did
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	bid
O	,
O	and
O	bending
O	over
O	the
O	brook
O	she
O	drank
O	of
O	its
O	water
O	without
O	daring
O	to
O	use
O	her
O	golden
O	cup
O	.
O	While
O	she
O	did
O	so
O	the
O	lock
O	of
O	hair
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Ah

O	``
O	As
O	she
O	leaned
O	over
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	the
O	lock
O	of
O	hair
O	fell
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	bosom
O	and
O	floated
O	down
O	the
O	stream
O	without
O	her
O	noticing
O	it
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	her
O	great
O	anguish
O	.
O	But
O	her
O	servant
O	had
O	seen
O	what
O	happened
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	glad
O	,
O	for
O	now
O	she
O	had
O	power
O	over
O	her
O	mistress
O	,
O	because
O	with
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	the
O	lock
O	of
O	hair
O	,
O	she
O	became
O	weak
O	and
O	helpless
O	.
O	When
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	the
O	Princess
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	mount
O	her
O	horse
O	again
O	,
O	the
O	maid
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	No
O	,
O	Falada

O	this
O	horse
O	:
O	``
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	yield
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	servant
O	bade
O	her
O	take
O	off
O	her
O	royal
O	clothes
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	on
O	her
O	common
O	ones
O	instead
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	lastly
O	,
O	she
O	made
O	the
O	Princess
O	promise
O	and
O	swear
O	by
O	the
O	open
O	sky
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	say
O	nought
O	of
O	what
O	had
O	passed
O	at
O	the
O	King

O	palace
O	;

O	have
O	been
O	murdered
O	.
O	But
O	Falada
O	,
O	the
O	horse
O	,
O	observed
O	all
O	that
O	passed
O	with
O	great
O	attention
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	servant
O	mounted
O	upon
O	Falada
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rightful
O	Princess
O	upon
O	a
O	sorry
O	hack
O	;
O	and
O	in
O	that
O	way
O	they
O	traveled
O	on
O	till
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	palace
O	.
O	On
O	their
O	arrival
O	there
O	were
O	great
O	rejoicings
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	young
O	Prince
O	,
O	running
O	towards
O	them
O	,
O	lifted
O	the
O	servant
O	off
O	her
O	horse
O	,
O	supposing
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	true
O	bride
O	;
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	led
O	up
O	the
O	steps
O	in
O	state
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	real
O	Princess
O	had
O	to
O	stop
O	below
O	.
O	Just
O	then
O	the
O	old
O	King
O	chanced
O	to
O	look
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	window
O	and
O	saw
O	her
O	standing
O	in
O	the
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	remarked
O	how
O	delicate
O	and
O	beautiful
O	she
O	was
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	going
O	to
O	the
O	royal
O	apartments
O	,
O	he
O	inquired
O	there
O	of
O	the
O	bride
O	who
O	it
O	was
O	she
O	had
O	brought
O	with

O	the
O	courtyard
O	.
O	``
O	Only
O	a
O	girl
O	whom
O	I
O	brought
O	with

O	said
O	the
O	bride
O	.
O	``
O	Give

O	``
O	The

O	no

O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	of
O	nothing
O	;
O	until
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Ah
O	!

O	is
O	a

O	``
O	This
O	youth
O	was
O	called
O	Conrad

O	and
O	the
O	true
O	bride
O	was
O	set
O	to
O	keep
O	geese
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	false
O	bride
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	betrothed
O	,
O	``
O	Dearest
O	,
O	will

O	grant
O	me

O	``
O	Yes
O	,

O	said
O	he
O	;
O	``
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	pleasure
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Then
O	let
O	the
O	butcher
O	be
O	summoned
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	may
O	cut
O	off
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	horse
O	on
O	which
O	I
O	rode
O	hither
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	has
O	angered
O	me
O	on
O	the
O	way
O	.
O	``
O	In
O	reality
O	she
O	feared
O	lest
O	the
O	horse
O	might
O	tell
O	how
O	she
O	had
O	used
O	the
O	rightful
O	Princess
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	glad
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	decided
O	that
O	Falada
O	should
O	die
O	.
O	This
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	ears
O	of
O	the
O	Princess
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	promised
O	secretly
O	to
O	the
O	butcher
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	gold
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	show
O	her
O	a
O	kindness
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	nail
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	Falada
O	over
O	a
O	certain
O	large
O	and
O	gloomy
O	arch
O	,
O	through
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	to
O	pass
O	daily
O	with
O	the
O	geese
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	then
O	she
O	might
O	still
O	see
O	her
O	old
O	steed
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	accustomed
O	.
O	The
O	butcher
O	promised
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	killing
O	the
O	horse
O	,
O	nailed
O	the
O	head
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	which
O	the
O	Princess
O	pointed
O	out
O	,
O	over
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	arch
O	.
O	Early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	and
O	Conrad
O	drove
O	the
O	geese
O	through
O	the
O	arch
O	,
O	she
O	said
O	in
O	passing
O	:
O	``
O	Ah
O	,
O	Falada
O	,
O	that
O	you
O	hang
O	so
O	high
O	!
O	``
O	and
O	the
O	head
O	replied
O	:
O	``
O	Ah
O	Princess
O	,
O	that
O	you
O	go
O	humbly
O	by
O	!
O	Thy
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	would
O	surely
O	break
O	Were
O	she
O	to
O	know
O	of
O	your
O	heart-ache
O	!
O	``
O	Then
O	she
O	drove
O	on
O	through
O	the
O	town
O	to
O	a
O	field
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	arrived
O	in
O	the
O	meadow
O	,
O	she
O	sat
O	down
O	and
O	unloosened
O	her
O	hair
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	of
O	pure
O	gold
O	.
O	Its
O	shining
O	appearance
O	so
O	charmed
O	Conrad
O	that
O	he
O	tried
O	to
O	pull
O	out
O	a
O	couple
O	of
O	locks
O	.
O	So
O	she
O	sang
O	:
O	``
O	Blow
O	,
O	blow
O	,
O	thou
O	wind
O	,
O	Blow
O	Conrad
O	'
O	s
O	hat
O	away
O	.
O	``
O	Immediately
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	strong
O	wind
O	,
O	which
O	snatched
O	Conrad
O	'
O	s
O	hat
O	off
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	a
O	rare
O	chase
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	returned
O	what
O	with
O	combing
O	and
O	curling
O	,
O	the
O	Princess
O	had
O	rearranged
O	her
O	hair
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	catch
O	a
O	loose
O	lock
O	.
O	This
O	made
O	Conrad
O	very
O	angry
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	speak
O	to
O	her
O	;
O	so
O	all
O	day
O	long
O	they
O	tended
O	their
O	geese
O	in
O	silence
O	.
O	After
O	they
O	returned
O	home
O	Conrad
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	old
O	King
O	and
O	declared
O	he
O	would
O	no
O	longer
O	keep
O	geese
O	with
O	the
O	servant
O	.
O	``
O	Why
O	not
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	the
O	old
O	King
O	.
O	``
O	Oh
O	!
O	she
O	vexes
O	me
O	the
O	whole
O	day
O	long
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Conrad
O	;
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	King
O	bade
O	him
O	tell
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	happened
O	.
O	So
O	Conrad
O	did
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	how
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	passed
O	through
O	a
O	certain
O	archway
O	,
O	she
O	spoke
O	to
O	a
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	nailed
O	up
O	over
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	:

O	Falada
O	,
O	that
O	you
O	hang
O	so
O	high

O	``
O	and
O	it
O	replied
O	:
O	``
O	Ah

O	of
O	your
O	heart-ache
O	!
O	``
O	And
O	,
O	further
O	,
O	he
O	told
O	how
O	when
O	they
O	arrived
O	in
O	the
O	meadow
O	,
O	she
O	caused
O	the
O	wind
O	to
O	blow
O	his
O	hat
O	off
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	run
O	after
O	it
O	ever
O	so
O	far
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	finished
O	his
O	tale
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	King
O	ordered
O	him
O	to
O	drive
O	the
O	geese
O	out
O	again
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	himself
O	,
O	when
O	morning
O	came
O	,
O	stationed
O	himself
O	behind
O	the
O	gloomy
O	archway
O	,

O	heard
O	the
O	servant
O	talk
O	to
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	Falada
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	followed
O	them
O	also
O	into
O	the
O	fields
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	saw
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	eyes
O	the
O	Goose
O	Girl
O	and
O	boy
O	drive
O	in
O	the
O	geese
O	;
O	and
O	after
O	a

O	which
O	shone
O	like
O	gold
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	the
O	old
O	rhyme
O	:
O	``
O	Blow
O	,
O	blow
O	,
O	thou
O	wind
O	,
O	Blow
O	Conrad
O	'
O	s
O	hat
O	away
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	King
O	felt
O	a
O	breeze
O	come
O	,
O	which
O	took
O	off
O	Conrad
O	'
O	s
O	hat
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	run
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	after
O	it
O	;
O	while
O	the
O	Goose
O	Girl
O	combed
O	out
O	her
O	hair
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	back
O	in
O	proper
O	trim
O	before
O	his
O	return
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	the
O	King
O	observed
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	went
O	home
O	unnoticed
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	Goose
O	Girl
O	returned
O	at
O	evening
O	,
O	he
O	called
O	her
O	aside
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	her
O	what
O	it
O	all
O	meant
O	.
O	``
O	That
O	I
O	dare
O	not
O	tell
O	you
O	,
O	nor
O	any
O	other
O	man
O	,
O	``
O	replied
O	she
O	;
O	``
O	for
O	I
O	have
O	sworn
O	by
O	the
O	free
O	sky
O	not
O	to

O	of
O	my
O	griefs
O	,
O	else
O	lose
O	my
O	life
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	King
O	pressed
O	her
O	to
O	say
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	her
O	no
O	peace
O	about
O	it
O	;
O	but
O	still
O	she
O	refused
O	.
O	So
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	If
O	you
O	will
O	not
O	tell
O	me
O	,
O	tell
O	your
O	griefs
O	to
O	this
O	fireplace
O	;
O	``
O	and
O	he
O	went
O	away
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	crept
O	into
O	the
O	fireplace
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	and
O	groan
O	;
O	and
O	soon
O	she
O	relieved
O	her
O	heart
O	by
O	telling
O	her
O	tale
O	.
O	``
O	Here
O	sit
O	I
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	said
O	``
O	forsaken

O	King
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	;
O	and
O	a
O	false
O	servant
O	has
O	exercised
O	some
O	charm
O	over
O	me
O	,
O	whereby
O	I
O	was
O	compelled
O	to
O	lay
O	aside
O	my
O	royal
O	clothes
O	;
O	and
O	she
O	has
O	also
O	taken
O	my
O	place
O	at
O	the
O	bridegroom
O	'
O	s

O	,
O	and
O	I

O	forced
O	to
O	perform
O	the
O	common
O	duties
O	of
O	a
O	Goose
O	Girl
O	.
O	Oh
O	,
O	if
O	my
O	mother
O	knew
O	this
O	,
O	her
O	heart
O	would
O	break
O	with
O	grief
O	!
O	``
O	The
O	old
O	King
O	,
O	meanwhile
O	,
O	stood
O	outside
O	by
O	the
O	chimney
O	and
O	listened
O	to
O	what
O	she
O	said
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	finished
O	he
O	came
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	her
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	fireplace
O	.
O	Then
O	her
O	royal
O	clothes
O	were
O	put
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	King
O	,
O	calling
O	his
O	son
O	,
O	showed
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	a
O	false
O	bride
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	only
O	a
O	servant-girl
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	true
O	bride
O	stood
O	there
O	as
O	a
O	Goose
O	Girl
O	.
O	The
O	prince
O	was
O	glad
O	indeed
O	at
O	heart
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	her
O	beauty
O	and
O	virtue
O	.
O	Then
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	feast
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	the
O	bridegroom
O	sat
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	Princess
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	and
O	the
O	servant-girl
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	latter
O	was
O	dazzled
O	,
O	and
O	recognized
O	her
O	mistress
O	no
O	longer
O	in
O	her
O	shining
O	dress
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	finished
O	their
O	feasting
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	beginning
O	to
O	be
O	gay
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	King
O	set
O	a
O	riddle
O	to
O	the
O	real
O	servant-girl
O	:
O	What
O	such
O	an
O	one
O	were
O	worthy
O	of
O	who
O	had
O	,
O	in
O	such
O	and
O	such
O	a
O	manner
O	,
O	deceived
O	her
O	masters
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	related
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	happened
O	to
O	the
O	true
O	bride
O	.
O	The
O	servant-girl
O	replied
O	,
O	``
O	Such
O	an
O	one
O	deserves
O	nothing
O	better
O	than
O	to

O	a
O	cask
O	,
O	lined
O	with
O	sharp

O	,
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	be
O	dragged
O	by
O	two

O	``
O	``
O	You

O	``
O	The
O	sentence
O	was
O	at
O	once
O	carried
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	afterwards
O	the
