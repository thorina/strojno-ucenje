O	When
O	the
O	great
O	city
O	of
O	Troy
O	was
O	taken
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	chiefs
O	who
O	had
O	fought
O	against
O	it
O	set
O	sail
O	for
O	their
O	homes
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	wrath
O	in
O	heaven
O	against
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	indeed
O	they
O	had
O	borne
O	themselves
O	haughtily
O	and
O	cruelly
O	in
O	the
O	day
O	of
O	their
O	victory
O	.
O	Therefore
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	all
O	find
O	a
O	safe
O	and
O	happy
O	return
O	.
O	For
O	one
O	was
O	shipwrecked
O	,
O	and
O	another
O	was
O	shamefully
O	slain
O	by
O	his
O	false
O	wife
O	in
O	his
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	others
O	found
O	all
O	things
O	at
O	home
O	troubled
O	and
O	changed
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	driven
O	to
O	seek
O	new
O	dwellings
O	elsewhere
O	.
O	And
O	some
O	,
O	whose
O	wives
O	and
O	friends
O	and
O	people
O	had
O	been
O	still
O	true
O	to
O	them
O	through
O	those
O	ten
O	long
O	years
O	of
O	absence
O	,
O	were
O	driven
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	about
O	the
O	world
O	before
O	they
O	saw
O	their
O	native
O	land
O	again
O	.
O	And
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	the
O	wise
O	Ulysses
O	was
O	he
O	who
O	wandered
O	farthest
O	and
O	suffered
O	most
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	well-nigh
O	the
O	last
O	to
O	sail
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	tarried
O	many
O	days
O	to
O	do
O	pleasure
O	to
O	Agamemnon
O	,
O	lord
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	Greeks
O	.
O	Twelve
O	ships
O	he
O	had
O	with
O	him--twelve
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	to
O	Troy--and
O	in
O	each
O	there
O	were
O	some
O	fifty
O	men
O	,
O	being
O	scarce
O	half
O	of
O	those
O	that
O	had
O	sailed
O	in
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	old
O	days
O	,
O	so
O	many
O	valiant
O	heroes
O	slept
O	the
O	last
O	sleep
O	by
O	Simois
O	and
O	Scamander
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	plain
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	slain
O	in
O	battle
O	or
O	by
O	the
O	shafts
O	of
O	Apollo
O	.
O	First
O	they
O	sailed
O	northwest
O	to
O	the
O	Thracian
O	coast
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	Ciconians
O	dwelt
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	helped
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Troy
O	.
O	Their
O	city
O	they
O	took
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	it
O	much
O	plunder
O	,
O	slaves
O	and
O	oxen
O	,
O	and
O	jars
O	of
O	fragrant
O	wine
O	,
O	and
O	might
O	have
O	escaped
O	unhurt
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	they
O	stayed
O	to
O	hold
O	revel
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	Ciconians
O	gathered
O	their
O	neighbours
O	,
O	being
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	blood
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	battle
O	with
O	the
O	invaders
O	,
O	and
O	drove
O	them
O	to
O	their
O	ship
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Ulysses
O	numbered
O	his
O	men
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	lost
O	six
O	out
O	of
O	each
O	ship
O	.
O	Scarce
O	had
O	he
O	set
O	out
O	again
O	when
O	the
O	wind
O	began
O	to
O	blow
O	fiercely;
O	so
O	,
O	seeing
O	a
O	smooth
O	sandy
O	beach
O	,
O	they
O	drave
O	the
O	ships
O	ashore
O	and
O	dragged
O	them
O	out
O	of
O	reach
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	and
O	waited
O	till
O	the
O	storm
O	should
O	abate
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	third
O	morning
O	being
O	fair
O	,
O	they
O	sailed
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	journeyed
O	prosperously
O	till
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	very
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	Peloponnesian
O	land
O	,
O	where
O	Cape
O	Malea
O	looks
O	out
O	upon
O	the
O	southern
O	sea
O	.
O	But
O	contrary
O	currents
O	baffled
O	them
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	round
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	north
O	wind
O	blew
O	so
O	strongly
O	that
O	they
O	must
O	fain
O	drive
O	before
O	it
O	.
O	And
O	on
O	the
O	tenth
O	day
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	where
O	the
O	lotus
O	grows--a
O	wondrous
O	fruit
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	whosoever
O	eats
O	cares
O	not
O	to
O	see
O	country
O	or
O	wife
O	or
O	children
O	again
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	Lotus
O	eaters
O	,
O	for
O	so
O	they
O	call
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	were
O	a
O	kindly
O	folk
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	of
O	the
O	fruit
O	to
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	sailors
O	,
O	not
O	meaning
O	them
O	any
O	harm
O	,
O	but
O	thinking
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	best
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	give
O	.
O	These
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	eaten
O	,
O	said
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	sail
O	any
O	more
O	over
O	the
O	sea;
O	which
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	wise
O	Ulysses
O	heard
O	,
O	he
O	bade
O	their
O	comrades
O	bind
O	them
O	and
O	carry
O	them
O	,
O	sadly
O	complaining
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	ships
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	the
O	wind
O	having
O	abated
O	,
O	they
O	took
O	to
O	their
O	oars
O	,
O	and
O	rowed
O	for
O	many
O	days
O	till
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	country
O	where
O	the
O	Cyclopes
O	dwell
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	a
O	mile
O	or
O	so
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	island
O	,
O	very
O	fair
O	and
O	fertile
O	,
O	but
O	no
O	man
O	dwells
O	there
O	or
O	tills
O	the
O	soil
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	a
O	harbour
O	where
O	a
O	ship
O	may
O	be
O	safe
O	from
O	all
O	winds
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	harbour
O	a
O	stream
O	falling
O	from
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	whispering
O	alders
O	all
O	about
O	it
O	.
O	Into
O	this
O	the
O	ships
O	passed
O	safely
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	hauled
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	crews
O	slept
O	by
O	them
O	,
O	waiting
O	for
O	the
O	morning
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	they
O	hunted
O	the
O	wild
O	goats
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	there
O	was
O	great
O	store
O	on
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	feasted
O	right
O	merrily
O	on
O	what
O	they
O	caught
O	,
O	with
O	draughts
O	of
O	red
O	wine
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	carried
O	off
O	from
O	the
O	town
O	of
O	the
O	Ciconians
O	.
O	But
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	,
O	Ulysses
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	ever
O	fond
O	of
O	adventure
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	know
O	of
O	every
O	land
O	to
O	which
O	he
O	came
O	what
O	manner
O	of
O	men
O	they
O	were
O	that
O	dwelt
O	there
O	,
O	took
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	twelve
O	ships
O	and
O	bade
O	row
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	hill
O	sloping
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	rose
O	up
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	a
O	smoke
O	from
O	the
O	caves
O	where
O	the
O	Cyclopes
O	dwelt
O	apart
O	,
O	holding
O	no
O	converse
O	with
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	a
O	rude
O	and
O	savage
O	folk
O	,
O	but
O	ruled
O	each
O	his
O	own
O	household
O	,
O	not
O	caring
O	for
O	others
O	.
O	Now
O	very
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	caves
O	,
O	very
O	huge
O	and
O	deep
O	,
O	with
O	laurels
O	round
O	about
O	the
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	front
O	a
O	fold
O	with
O	walls
O	built
O	of
O	rough
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	shaded
O	by
O	tall
O	oaks
O	and
O	pines
O	.
O	So
O	Ulysses
O	chose
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	crew
O	the
O	twelve
O	bravest
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	the
O	rest
O	guard
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	manner
O	of
O	dwelling
O	this
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	abode
O	there
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	his
O	sword
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	his
O	shoulder
O	a
O	mighty
O	skin
O	of
O	wine
O	,
O	sweet
O	smelling
O	and
O	strong
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	he
O	might
O	win
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	some
O	fierce
O	savage
O	,
O	should
O	he
O	chance
O	to
O	meet
O	with
O	such
O	,
O	as
O	indeed
O	his
O	prudent
O	heart
O	forecasted
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	entered
O	the
O	cave
O	,
O	and
O	judged
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	dwelling
O	of
O	some
O	rich
O	and
O	skilful
O	shepherd
O	.
O	For
O	within
O	there
O	were
O	pens
O	for
O	the
O	young
O	of
O	the
O	sheep
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	goats
O	,
O	divided
O	all
O	according
O	to
O	their
O	age
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	were
O	baskets
O	full
O	of
O	cheeses
O	,
O	and
O	full
O	milkpails
O	ranged
O	along
O	the
O	wall
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	Cyclops
O	himself
O	was
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	pastures
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	companions
O	of
O	Ulysses
O	besought
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	depart
O	,
O	taking
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	,
O	a
O	store
O	of
O	cheeses
O	and
O	sundry
O	of
O	the
O	lambs
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	kids
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	see
O	,
O	after
O	his
O	wont
O	,
O	what
O	manner
O	of
O	host
O	this
O	strange
O	shepherd
O	might
O	be
O	.
O	And
O	truly
O	he
O	saw
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	cost
O	!
O	It
O	was
O	evening
O	when
O	the
O	Cyclops
O	came
O	home
O	,
O	a
O	mighty
O	giant
O	,
O	twenty
O	feet
O	in
O	height
O	,
O	or
O	more
O	.
O	On
O	his
O	shoulder
O	he
O	bore
O	a
O	vast
O	bundle
O	of
O	pine
O	logs
O	for
O	his
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	them
O	down
O	outside
O	the
O	cave
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	crash
O	,
O	and
O	drove
O	the
O	flocks
O	within
O	,
O	and
O	closed
O	the
O	entrance
O	with
O	a
O	huge
O	rock
O	,
O	which
O	twenty
O	wagons
O	and
O	more
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	milked
O	the
O	ewes
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	she
O	goats
O	,
O	and
O	half
O	of
O	the
O	milk

O	curdled
O	for

O	and
O	half
O	he
O	set
O	ready
O	for
O	himself
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	should
O	sup
O	.
O	Next
O	he
O	kindled
O	a

O	the
