O	Early

O	a
O	great

O	talk
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	jested
O	idly
O	with
O	one

O	they
O	heard
O	a

O	for
O	a

O	``
O	said
O	his
O	comrade
O	.
O	``
O	If
O	so
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	tell
O	you
O	in
O	a
O	few

O	what
O	we
O	must
O	do
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Yes
O	,

O	answered
O	the
O	other
O	;
O	``
O	trust
O	me

O	``
O	Look
O	you

O	and
O	two
O	are
O	stronger
O	than
O	one
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	comes
O	back
O	and
O	sits
O	down
O	,
O	do
O	you
O	rise
O	and
O	go
O	to
O	him
O	as
O	if
O	for
O	a
O	friendly
O	wrestling
O	bout
O	.
O	I
O	will
O	stab
O	him
O	in
O	the

O	that
O	you
O	also
O	do
O	the
O	like
O	with

O	Thus
O	shall
O	the

O	divided
O	between
O	us

O	,
O	dear

O	``
O	The
O	two
O	rogues
O	agreed
O	on
O	this
O	plan
O	for
O	getting
O	rid
O	of
O	their
O	comrade
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	could
O	not
O	take
O	his
O	mind
O	away

O	bright
O	golden
O	florins
O	.
O	``
O	If
O	only
O	I
O	could
O	have
O	this
O	treasure
O	all
O	for
O	myself
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	thought
O	,
O	``
O	no
O	man
O	on
O	earth
O	would
O	live
O	so
O	merrily
O	as
O	I

O	``
O	And
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	idea
O	of
O	poisoning
O	his
O	comrades
O	came
O	into
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	without
O	hesitating
O	any
O	more
O	to
O	an
O	apothecary
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	to
O	sell
O	him
O	some
O	poison
O	to
O	kill
O	the
O	rats
O	in
O	his
O	house
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	polecat
O	also
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	which
O	ate
O	his
O	chickens
O	.
O	``
O	You
O	shall
O	have
O	a
O	poison
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	the
O	apothecary
O	,
O	``
O	the
O	like
O	of
O	which
O	is
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	on
O	earth
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	so
O	strong
O	that
O	if
O	a
O	man
O	does
O	but
O	taste
O	a
O	little
O	piece
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	a
O	grain
O	of
O	wheat
O	,
O	he
O	shall
O	die
O	at
O	once
O	;
O	before
O	you
O	can
O	walk
O	a
O	mile
O	he
O	will
O	be
O	dead
O	,
O	so
O	strong
O	and
O	violent
O	is
O	this
O	poison
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	man
O	took
O	the
O	poison
O	in
O	a
O	box
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	next
O	street
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	borrowed
O	three
O	large
O	bottles
O	,
O	and
O	into
O	two
O	he
O	put
O	the
O	poison
O	;
O	the
O	third
O	he
O	kept
O	clean
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	drink
O	,
O	thinking
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	working
O	hard
O	that
O	night
O	,
O	carrying
O	the
O	gold
O	all
O	by
O	himself
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	house
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	filled
O	all
O	the
O	bottles
O	up
O	with
O	wine
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	comrades
O	.
O	Why
O	should
O	a
O	long
O	tale
O	be
O	made
O	of
O	it
O	?
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	back
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	set
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	killed
O	him
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	planned
O	.
O	``
O	Now
O	let
O	us
O	eat
O	and
O	drink
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	one
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	``
O	When
O	we
O	have
O	made
O	merry
O	we
O	will
O	bury
O	him
O	.
O	``
O	With
O	that
O	word
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	bottles
O	;
O	it
O	happened
O	to
O	be
O	one
O	of
O	those
O	containing
O	the
O	poisoned
O	wine
O	.
O	He
O	drank
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	fellow
O	;
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	they
O	both
O	fell
O	dead
O	beside
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	their
O	comrade
O	.
O	Thus
O	the
O	three
O	revellers
O	met
O	Death
O	,
O	whom
O	they
O	set
O	out
O	to
O	kill
O	.
