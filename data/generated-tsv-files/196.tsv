O	There
O	was
O	once
O	a
O	very
O	rich
O	gentleman
O	who
O	lost
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	loved
O	her
O	exceedingly
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	sorry
O	when
O	she
O	died
O	.
O	Finding
O	himself
O	quite
O	unhappy
O	for
O	her
O	loss
O	,
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	marry
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	,
O	thinking
O	by
O	this
O	means
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	as
O	happy
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	Unfortunately
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	lady
O	he
O	chanced
O	to
O	fix
O	upon
O	was
O	the
O	proudest
O	and
O	most
O	haughty
O	woman
O	ever
O	known;
O	she
O	was
O	always
O	out
O	of
O	humour
O	with
O	every
O	one;
O	nobody
O	could
O	please
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	returned
O	the
O	civilities
O	of
O	those
O	about
O	her
O	with
O	the
O	most
O	affronting
O	disdain
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	two
O	daughters
O	by
O	a
O	former
O	husband
O	.
O	These
O	she
O	brought
O	up
O	to
O	be
O	proud
O	and
O	idle
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	in
O	temper
O	and
O	behaviour
O	they
O	perfectly
O	resembled
O	their
O	mother;
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	love
O	their
O	books
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	learn
O	to
O	work;
O	in
O	short
O	they
O	were
O	disliked
O	by
O	every
O	body
O	.
O	The
O	gentleman
O	on
O	his
O	side
O	too
O	had
O	a
O	daughter
O	,
O	who
O	in
O	sweetness
O	of
O	temper
O	and
O	carriage
O	was
O	the
O	exact
O	likeness
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	mother
O	,
O	whose
O	death
O	he
O	had
O	so
O	much
O	lamented
O	,
O	and
O	whose
O	tender
O	care
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	hopes
O	to
O	see
O	replaced
O	by
O	that
O	of
O	his
O	new
O	bride
O	.
O	But
O	scarcely
O	was
O	the
O	marriage
O	ceremony
O	over
O	,
O	before
O	his
O	wife
O	began
O	to
O	show
O	her
O	real
O	temper
O	.
O	She
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	the
O	pretty
O	little
O	girl
O	,
O	because
O	her
O	sweet
O	obliging
O	manners
O	made
O	those
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	daughters
O	appear
O	a
O	thousand
O	times
O	the
O	more
O	odious
O	and
O	disagreeable
O	.
O	She
O	therefore
O	ordered
O	her
O	to
O	live
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen;
O	and
O	,
O	if
O	ever
O	she
O	brought
O	any
O	thing
O	into
O	the
O	parlour
O	,
O	always
O	scolded
O	her
O	till
O	she
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	.
O	She
O	made
O	her
O	work
O	with
O	the
O	servants
O	in
O	washing
O	the
O	dishes
O	,
O	and
O	rubbing
O	the
O	tables
O	and
O	chairs;
O	it
O	was
O	her
O	place
O	to
O	clean
O	madam
O	'
O	s
O	chamber
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	misses
O	her
O	daughters
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	all
O	inlaid
O	,
O	had
O	beds
O	of
O	the
O	newest
O	fashion
O	,
O	and
O	looking-glasses
O	so
O	long
O	and
O	broad
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	saw
O	themselves
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
O	in
O	them;
O	while
O	the
O	little
O	creature
O	herself
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	sleep
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	sorry
O	garret
O	,
O	upon
O	a
O	wretched
O	straw
O	bed
O	,
O	without
O	curtains
O	,
O	or
O	any
O	thing
O	to
O	make
O	her
O	comfortable
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	child
O	bore
O	this
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	patience
O	,
O	not
O	daring
O	to
O	complain
O	to
O	her
O	father
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	she
O	feared
O	,
O	would
O	only
O	reprove
O	her
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	saw
O	that
O	his
O	wife
O	governed
O	him
O	entirely
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	had
O	done
O	all
O	her
O	work
O	she
O	used
O	to
O	sit
O	in
O	the
O	chimney-corner
O	among
O	the
O	cinders;
O	so
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	she
O	went
O	by
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Cinderbreech
O	.
O	The
O	youngest
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	sisters
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	being
O	rather
O	more
O	civil
O	than
O	the
O	eldest
O	,
O	called
O	her
O	Cinderella
O	.
O	And
O	Cinderella
O	,
O	dirty
O	and
O	ragged
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	,
O	as
O	often
O	happens
O	in
O	such
O	cases
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	thousand

O	prettier
O	than
O	her
O	sisters
O	,
O	drest
O	out
O	in
O	all
O	their
O	splendour
O	.
O	It
O	happened
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	gave
O	a
O	ball
O	,
O	to
O	which
O	he
O	invited
O	all
O	the
O	persons
O	of
O	fashion
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	Our
O	two
O	misses
O	were
O	of
O	the
O	number
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	disagreeable
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	but
O	supposed
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	so
O	much
O	indulged
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	extremely
O	amiable
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	invite
O	Cinderella
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	or
O	heard
O	of
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	sisters
O	began
O	immediately
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	busy
O	in
O	preparing
O	for
O	the
O	happy
O	day
O	.
O	Nothing
O	could
O	exceed
O	their
O	joy
O	.
O	Every
O	moment
O	of
O	their
O	time
O	was
O	spent
O	in
O	fancying
O	such

O	set

O	glass
O	slipper
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	dropped
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	mean
O	while
O	,
O	the
O	prince
O	had
O	inquired
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	guards
O	at
O	the
O	palace
O	gates
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	seen
O	a
O	magnificent
O	princess
O	pass
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	way
O	she
O	went
O	?
O	The
O	guards
O	replied
O	,
O	that
O	no
O	princess
O	had
O	passed
O	the
O	gates;
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	seen
O	a
O	creature
O	but
O	a
O	little
O	ragged
O	girl
O	,
O	who
O	looked
O	more
O	like
O	a
O	beggar
O	than
O	a
O	princess
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	two
O	sisters
O	returned
O	from
O	the
O	ball
O	,
O	Cinderella
O	asked
O	them
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	as
O	much
O	amused
O	as
O	the
O	night
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	the
O	beautiful
O	princess
O	had
O	been
O	there
O	?
O	They
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	had;
O	but
O	that
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	clock
O	struck
O	twelve
O	,
O	she
O	hurried
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	ball
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	haste
O	she
O	had
O	made
O	,
O	had
O	dropped
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	glass
O	slippers
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	prettiest
O	shape
O	that
O	could
O	be;
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	had
O	picked
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	done
O	nothing
O	but
O	look
O	at
O	it
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	evening;
O	and
O	that
O	every
O	body
O	believed
O	he
O	was
O	violently
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	the
O	handsome
O	lady
O	to
O	whom
O	it
O	belonged
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	very
O	true;
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	after
O	,
O	the
O	prince
O	had
O	it
O	proclaimed
O	,
O	by
O	sound
O	of
O	trumpet
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	marry
O	the
O	lady
O	whose
O	foot
O	should
O	exactly
O	fit
O	the
O	slipper
O	he
O	had
O	found
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	the
O	prince
O	'
O	s
O	messengers
O	took
O	the
O	slipper
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	it
O	first
O	to
O	all
O	the
O	princesses
O	,
O	then
O	to
O	the
O	duchesses
O	,
O	in
O	short
O	,
O	to
O	all
O	the
O	ladies
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	.
O	But
O	without
O	success
O	.
O	They
O	then
O	brought
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	two
O	sisters
O	,
O	who
O	each
O	tried
O	all
O	she
O	could
O	to
O	squeeze
O	her
O	foot
O	into
O	the
O	slipper
O	,
O	but
O	saw
O	at
O	last
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	quite
O	impossible
O	.
O	Cinderella
O	who
O	was
O	looking
O	at
O	them
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	her
O	slipper
O	,
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	smiling
O	,
O	and
O	ventured
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	""""
O	Pray
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	let
O	me
O	try
O	to
O	get
O	on
O	the
O	slipper
O	.
O	""""
O	The
O	gentleman
O	made
O	her
O	sit
O	down;
O	and
O	putting
O	the
O	slipper
O	to
O	her
O	foot
O	,
O	it
O	instantly
O	slipped
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	fitted
O	her
O	like
O	wax
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	sisters
O	were
O	amazed
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	the
O	slipper
O	fitted
O	Cinderella;
O	but
O	how
O	much
O	greater
O	was
O	their
O	astonishment
O	when
O	she
O	drew
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	pocket
O	the
O	other
O	slipper
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	on
O	!
O	Just
O	at
O	this
O	moment
O	the
O	fairy
O	entered
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	touching
O	Cinderella
O	'
O	s
O	clothes
O	with
O	her
O	wand
O	,
O	made
O	her
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	appear
O	more
O	magnificently
O	dressed
O	than
O	they
O	had
O	ever
O	seen
O	her
O	before
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	sisters
O	immediately
O	perceived
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	beautiful
O	princess
O	they
O	had
O	seen
O	at
O	the
O	ball
O	.
O	They
O	threw
O	themselves
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	her
O	forgiveness
O	for
O	the
O	ill
O	treatment
O	she
O	had
O	received
O	from
O	them
O	.
O	Cinderella
O	helped
O	them
O	to
O	rise
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	tenderly
O	embracing
O	them
O	,
O	said
O	that
O	she
O	forgave
O	them
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	begged
O	them
O	to
O	bestow
O	on
O	her
O	their
O	affection
O	.
O	Cinderella
O	was
O	then
O	conducted
O	,
O	dressed
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	young
O	prince
O	,
O	who
O	finding
O	her
O	more
O	beautiful
O	than
O	ever
O	,
O	instantly
O	desired
O	her
O	to
O	accept
O	of
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	The
O	marriage
O	ceremony
O	took
O	place
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	days;
O	and
O	Cinderella
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	as
O	amiable
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	handsome
O	,
O	gave
O	her
O	sisters
O	magnificent
O	apartments
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	after
O	married
O	them
O	to
O	two
O	great
O	lords
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	.
