O	At
O	the
O	expiration
O	of
O	another
O	year
O	,
O	I
O	prepared
O	for
O	a
O	sixth
O	voyage
O	.
O	This
O	proved
O	very
O	long
O	and
O	unfortunate
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	pilot
O	lost
O	his
O	course
O	and
O	knew
O	not
O	where
O	to
O	steer
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	he
O	told
O	us
O	we
O	must
O	inevitably
O	be
O	dashed
O	to
O	pieces
O	against
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	were
O	fast
O	approaching
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	the
O	vessel
O	was
O	a
O	complete
O	wreck
O	.
O	We
O	saved
O	our
O	lives
O	,
O	our
O	provisions
O	,
O	and
O	our
O	goods
O	.
O	The
O	shore
O	on
O	which
O	we
O	were
O	cast
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	a
O	mountain
O	which
O	it
O	was
O	impossible
O	to
O	climb
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	shortly
O	beheld
O	my
O	companions
O	die
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	frightful
O	cavern
O	in
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	through
O	which
O	flowed
O	a
O	river
O	.
O	To
O	this
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	fit
O	of
O	desperation
O	,
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	trust
O	myself
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	work
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	long
O	raft
O	.
O	I
O	loaded
O	it
O	with
O	bales
O	of
O	rich
O	stuffs
O	,
O	and
O	large
O	pieces
O	of
O	rock
O	crystal
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	mountain
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	measure
O	formed
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	raft
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	current
O	carried
O	me
O	along
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	carried
O	in
O	darkness
O	during
O	many
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	awoke
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	in
O	a
O	pleasant
O	country
O	.
O	My
O	raft
O	was
O	tied
O	up
O	and
O	some
O	blacks
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	near
O	me
O	,
O	said
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	found
O	me
O	floating
O	in
O	the
O	river
O	which
O	waters
O	their
O	land
O	.
O	They
O	took
O	me
O	to
O	their
O	King
O	,
O	and
O	carefully
O	conducted
O	my
O	cargo
O	with
O	me
O	.
O	When
O	we
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Serindib
O	,
O	I
O	related
O	my
O	story
O	to
O	the
O	monarch
O	,
O	who
O	ordered
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	written
O	in
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	.
O	I
O	presented
O	the
O	King
O	with
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	pieces
O	of
O	rock
O	crystal
O	,
O	and
O	entreated
O	him
O	to
O	let
O	me
O	return
O	to
O	my
O	own
O	country
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	readily
O	agreed
O	to
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	letter
O	and
O	a
O	present
O	to
O	my
O	sovereign
O	,
O	the
O	Caliph
O	Haroun
O	Alrashid
O	.
O	The
O	present
O	consisted
O	of
O	a
O	ruby
O	made
O	into
O	a
O	cup
O	,
O	and
O	decorated
O	with
O	pearls;
O	the
O	skin
O	of
O	a
O	serpent
O	,
O	which
O	appeared
O	like
O	burnished
O	gold
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	could
O	repel
O	disease;
O	some
O	aloe-wood
O	,
O	camphire
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	beautiful
O	female
O	slave
O	.
O	I
O	returned
O	to
O	my
O	native
O	country
O	,
O	delivered
O	the
O	present
O	to
O	the
O	Caliph
O	,
O	and
O	received
O	his
O	thanks
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	reward
O	.
