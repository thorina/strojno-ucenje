O	Great
O	was
O	the
O	alarm
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	Rome
O	,
O	which
O	soon
O	spread
O	throughout
O	the
O	entire
O	city
O	.
O	The
O	empress
O	had
O	lost
O	her
O	costly
O	diadem
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	found
O	.
O	They
O	searched
O	in
O	every
O	direction
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	Half
O	distracted
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	mishap
O	boded
O	no
O	good
O	to
O	her
O	or
O	her
O	house
O	,
O	the
O	empress
O	redoubled
O	her
O	exertions
O	to
O	regain
O	her
O	precious
O	possession
O	,
O	but
O	without
O	result
O	.
O	As
O	a
O	last
O	resource
O	it
O	was
O	proclaimed
O	in
O	the
O	public
O	streets
O	:
O	``
O	The
O	empress
O	has
O	lost
O	a
O	precious
O	diadem
O	.
O	Whoever
O	restores
O	it
O	within
O	thirty
O	days
O	shall
O	receive
O	a
O	princely
O	reward
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	who
O	delays
O	,
O	and
O	brings
O	it
O	after
O	thirty
O	days
O	,
O	shall
O	lose
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	``
O	In
O	those
O	times
O	all
O	nationalities
O	flocked
O	toward
O	Rome
O	;
O	all
O	classes
O	and
O	creeds
O	could
O	be
O	met
O	in
O	its
O	stately
O	halls
O	and
O	crowded
O	thoroughfares
O	.
O	Among
O	the
O	rest
O	was
O	a
O	rabbi
O	,
O	a
O	learned
O	sage
O	from
O	the
O	East
O	,
O	who
O	loved
O	goodness
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	a
O	righteous
O	life
O	in
O	the
O	stir
O	and
O	turmoil
O	of
O	the
O	Western
O	world
O	.
O	It
O	chanced
O	one
O	night
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	strolling
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	,
O	in
O	busy
O	meditation
O	,
O	beneath
O	the
O	clear
O	,
O	moonlit
O	sky
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	diadem
O	sparkling
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	.
O	He
O	seized
O	it
O	quickly
O	,
O	brought
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	dwelling
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	guarded
O	it
O	carefully
O	until
O	the
O	thirty
O	days
O	had
O	expired
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	return
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	owner
O	.
O	He
O	proceeded
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	undismayed
O	at
O	sight
O	of
O	long
O	lines
O	of
O	soldiery
O	and
O	officials
O	,
O	asked
O	for
O	an
O	audience
O	with
O	the
O	empress
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	dost
O	thou
O	mean
O	by
O	this
O	?
O	``
O	she
O	inquired
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	his
O	story
O	and
O	gave
O	her
O	the
O	diadem
O	.
O	``
O	Why

O	Thy

O	.
O	``
O	``
O	I
O	delayed
O	until

O	,
O	``
O	the

O	answered
O	,

O	dismissed
O	the

O	without
O	further
