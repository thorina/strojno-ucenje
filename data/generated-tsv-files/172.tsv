O	not
O	feel
O	hungry
O	,
O	either
O	.
O	He
O	sat
O	and
O	stared
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	remembered
O	his
O	letter
O	.
O	He
O	drew
O	it
O	from
O	his
O	pocket
O	and
O	opened
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	very
O	thick;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	pulled
O	it
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	envelope
O	the
O	first
O	thing
O	he
O	saw
O	was
O	the
O	smiling
O	face
O	of
O	his
O	sister
O	Jessie
O	,
O	his
O	twin
O	sister
O	,
O	his
O	playmate
O	and
O	comrade
O	,
O	his
O	confidante
O	from
O	the
O	cradle
O	.
O	The
O	loss
O	of
O	her
O	ever-willing
O	sympathy
O	had
O	been
O	almost
O	more
O	to
O	him
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	his
O	troubles
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	another
O	shock
O	that
O	brought
O	something
O	to
O	his
O	eyes
O	that
O	made
O	him
O	see
O	the
O	others
O	through
O	a
O	mist
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	the
O	pictures
O	of
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	whose
O	gentle
O	voice
O	he
O	could
O	almost
O	hear
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	whose
O	gray
O	hairs
O	and
O	sad
O	face
O	he
O	suddenly
O	remembered
O	were
O	partly
O	his
O	work
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	read
O	the
O	letter
O	.
O	It
O	began
O	:
O	DEAR
O	JACK
O	:
O	--I
O	'
O	ve
O	just
O	found
O	out
O	where
O	you
O	are
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	'
O	m
O	so
O	glad
O	.
O	I
O	send
O	you
O	this
O	Thanksgiving
O	dinner
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	too
O	bad
O	for
O	you
O	to
O	go
O	off
O	so
O	.
O	You
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	know
O	how
O	dreadful
O	it
O	was
O	for
O	mamma;
O	she
O	was
O	sick
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	were
O	scared
O	to

O	now;

O	didn

O	Uncle
O	John
O	helped
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	,
O	Jack
O	,
O	he
O	says
O	he
O	wants
O	just
O	such
O	a
O	fellow
O	as
O	you

O	and
O	he

O	and
O	this

O	.
O	I

O	I

O	Your
O	affectionate
O	sister
O	,
O	JESSIE
O	.
O	Jack
O	laid
O	the
O	letter
O	down
O	with
O	a
O	rush
O	of
O	new
O	feelings
O	and
O	thoughts
O	that
O	overwhelmed
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	sat
O	there
O	for
O	hours;
O	he
O	knew
O	nothing
O	of
O	time
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	mechanically
O	turned
O	the
O	cranberry
O	jar
O	upside
O	down
O	and
O	taken
O	from
O	the
O	bottom
O	,
O	carefully
O	wrapped
O	in
O	white
O	paper
O	,
O	fifty
O	dollars
O	.
O	A
O	pang
O	went
O	through
O	him
O	.
O	Well
O	did
O	he
O	know
O	what
O	that
O	money
O	represented
O	to
O	his
O	sister;
O	by
O	how
O	many
O	sacrifices
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	saving
O	it
O	for
O	a
O	year
O	or
O	two
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	single
O	purpose
O	of
O	taking
O	the
O	lessons
O	from
O	a
O	great
O	master
O	that
O	were
O	to
O	fit
O	her
O	to
O	teach
O	,
O	to
O	take
O	an
O	independent
O	position
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	to
O	relieve
O	her
O	father
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	lost
O	a
O	large
O	slice
O	of
O	his
O	comfortable
O	income
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	was
O	growing
O	old
O	and
O	sad
O	under
O	his
O	burden
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	often
O	talked
O	it
O	over
O	with
O	Jack
O	.
O	Now
O	she
O	had
O	generously
O	given
O	up
O	the
O	whole
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	all
O	her
O	hopes
O	and
O	dreams
O	of
O	independence;
O	and
O	he--he
O	who
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	the
O	support
O	of
O	his
O	sister
O	,
O	the
O	right
O	arm
O	of
O	his
O	father--he
O	had
O	basely
O	deserted
O	.
O	These
O	thoughts
O	and
O	many
O	more
O	surged
O	through
O	his
O	mind
O	that
O	long
O	afternoon
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	Tom
O	returned

O	,
O	before
O	any
O	one
O	could
O	calm
O	down
O	enough
O	to
O	eat
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	reaction
O	set
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	justice
O	was
O	done
O	to
O	the
O	dinner
O	,
O	while
O	talk
O	went
O	on
O	in
O	a
O	stream
O	.
O	Jack
O	did
O	not
O	tell
O	his
O	adventures;
O	he
O	only
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	from
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	arrangements
O	for
O	a
O	situation
O	with
O	Uncle
O	John--at
O	which
O	Jessie
O	'
O	s
O	eyes
O	sparkled
O	.
O	His
O	looks
O	,
O	even
O	after
O	a
O	week
O	of
O	comfort
O	and
O	hope
O	,
O	spoke
O	for
O	his
O	sufferings
O	.
O	There
O	is
O	little
O	more
O	to
O	tell
O	.
O	Jack
O	Jarvis
O	at
O	seventeen
O	was
O	a
O	different
O	boy
O	from
O	the
O	Jack
O	who
O	at
O	sixteen
O	started
O	out
O	to
O	seek
O	his
O	fortune
O	.
O	You
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	that
O	Jessie
O	had
O	her
O	music
O	lessons
O	after
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	a
O	new
O	Winnie
O	with
O	a
O	fine
O	young
O	brood
O	at
O	her
O	heels
O	stalked
O	about
O	the
O	Jarvis
O	grounds
O	the
O	next
O	spring
O	.
