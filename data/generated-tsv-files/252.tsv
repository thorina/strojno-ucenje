O	My
O	father
O	had
O	a
O	small
O	estate
O	in
O	Nottinghamshire
O	;
O	I
O	was
O	the
O	third
O	of
O	five
O	sons
O	.
O	He
O	sent
O	me
O	to
O	Emmanuel
O	College
O	in
O	Cambridge
O	,
O	at
O	fourteen
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	resided
O	three
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	applied
O	myself
O	close
O	to
O	my
O	studies
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	charge
O	of
O	maintaining
O	me
O	(
O	although
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	very
O	scanty
O	allowance
O	)
O	being
O	too
O	great
O	for
O	a
O	narrow
O	fortune
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	bound
O	apprentice
O	to
O	Mr
O	.
O	James
O	Bates
O	,
O	an
O	eminent
O	surgeon
O	in
O	London
O	,
O	with
O	whom
O	I
O	continued
O	four
O	years
O	;
O	and
O	my
O	father
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	sending
O	me
O	small
O	sums
O	of
O	money
O	,
O	I
O	laid
O	them
O	out
O	in
O	learning
O	navigation
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	parts
O	of
O	the
O	mathematics
O	,
O	useful
O	to
O	those
O	who
O	intend
O	to
O	travel
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	always
O	believed
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	some
O	time
O	or
O	other
O	my
O	fortune
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	left
O	Mr
O	.
O	Bates
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	down
O	to
O	my
O	father
O	;
O	where
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	assistance
O	of
O	him
O	and
O	my
O	uncle
O	John
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	other
O	relations
O	,
O	I
O	got
O	forty
O	pounds
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	promise
O	of
O	thirty
O	pounds
O	a
O	year
O	to
O	maintain
O	me
O	at
O	Leyden
O	;
O	there
O	I
O	studied
O	physic
O	two
O	years
O	and
O	seven
O	months
O	,
O	knowing
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	useful
O	in
O	long
O	voyages
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	my
O	return
O	from
O	Leyden
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	recommended
O	by
O	my
O	good
O	master
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	Bates
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	surgeon
O	to
O	the
O	_Swallow
O	,
O	_
O	Captain
O	Abraham
O	Pannell
O	,
O	commander
O	;
O	with
O	whom
O	I
O	continued
O	three
O	years
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	,
O	making
O	a
O	voyage
O	or
O	two
O	into
O	the
O	Levant
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	other
O	parts
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	came
O	back
O	,
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	settle
O	in
O	London
O	,
O	to
O	which
O	Mr
O	.
O	Bates
O	,
O	my
O	master
O	,
O	encouraged
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	him
O	I
O	was
O	recommended
O	to
O	several
O	patients
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	part
O	of
O	a
O	small
O	house
O	in
O	the
O	Old
O	Jewry
O	;
O	and
O	being
O	advised
O	to
O	alter
O	my
O	condition
O	,
O	I
O	married
O	Miss
O	Mary
O	Burton
O	,
O	second
O	daughter
O	to
O	Mr
O	.
O	Edmund
O	Burton
O	,
O	hosier
O	,
O	in
O	Newgate
O	Street
O	,
O	with
O	whom
O	I
O	received
O	four
O	hundred
O	pounds
O	for
O	a
O	portion
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	my
O	good
O	master
O	Bates
O	dying
O	in
O	two
O	years
O	after
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	having
O	few
O	friends
O	,
O	my
O	business
O	began
O	to
O	fail
O	;
O	for
O	my
O	conscience
O	would
O	not
O	suffer
O	me
O	to
O	imitate
O	the
O	bad
O	practice
O	of
O	too
O	many
O	among
O	my
O	brethren
O	.
O	Having
O	therefore
O	consulted
O	with
O	my
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	my
O	acquaintance
O	,
O	I
O	determined
O	to
O	go
O	again
O	to
O	sea
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	surgeon
O	successively
O	in
O	two
O	ships
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	several
O	voyages
O	for
O	six
O	years
O	to
O	the
O	East
O	and
O	West
O	Indies
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	I
O	got
O	some
O	addition
O	to
O	my
O	fortune
O	.
O	My
O	hours
O	of
O	leisure
O	I
O	spent
O	in
O	reading
O	the
O	best
O	authors
O	,
O	ancient
O	and
O	modern
O	,
O	being
O	always
O	provided
O	with
O	a
O	good
O	number
O	of
O	books
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	ashore
O	,
O	in
O	observing
O	the
O	manners
O	and
O	dispositions
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	learning
O	their
O	language
O	,
O	wherein
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	great
O	facility
O	by
O	the
O	strength
O	of
O	my
O	memory
O	.
O	The
O	last
O	of
O	these
O	voyages
O	not
O	proving
O	very
O	fortunate
O	,
O	I
O	grew
O	weary
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	intended
O	to
O	stay
O	at
O	home
O	with
O	my
O	wife
O	and
O	family
O	.
O	I
O	removed
O	from
O	the
O	Old
O	Jewry
O	to
O	Fetter
O	Lane
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	thence
O	to
O	Wapping
O	,
O	hoping
O	to
O	get
O	business
O	among
O	the
O	sailors
O	;
O	but
O	it
O	would
O	not
O	turn
O	to
O	account
O	.
O	After
O	three
O	years
O	'
O	expectation
O	that
O	things
O	would
O	mend
O	,
O	I
O	accepted
O	an
O	advantageous
O	offer
O	from
O	Captain
O	William
O	Prichard
O	,
O	master
O	of
O	the
O	_Antelope_
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	making
O	a
O	voyage
O	to
O	the
O	South
O	Sea
O	.
O	We
O	set
O	sail
O	from
O	Bristol
O	,
O	May
O	4
O	,
O	1699
O	,
O	and
O	our
O	voyage
O	at
O	first
O	was
O	very
O	prosperous
O	.
O	It
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	proper
O	,
O	for
O	some
O	reasons
O	,
O	to
O	trouble
O	the
O	reader
O	with
O	the
O	particulars
O	of
O	our
O	adventures
O	in
O	those
O	seas
O	;
O	let
O	it
O	suffice
O	to
O	inform
O	him
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	our
O	passage
O	from
O	thence
O	to
O	the
O	East
O	Indies
O	,
O	we
O	were
O	driven
O	by
O	a
O	violent
O	storm
O	to
O	the
O	northwest
O	of
O	Van
O	Diemen
O	'
O	s
O	Land
O	.
O	By
O	an
O	observation
O	we
O	found
O	ourselves
O	in
O	the
O	latitude
O	of
O	30
O	degrees
O	2
O	minutes
O	south
O	.
O	Twelve
O	of
O	our
O	crew
O	were
O	dead
O	by
O	immoderate
O	labor
O	,
O	and
O	ill
O	food
O	,
O	the
O	rest
O	were
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	weak
O	condition
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	fifth
O	of
O	November
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	summer
O	in
O	those
O	parts
O	,
O	the
O	weather
O	being
O	very
O	hazy
O	,
O	the
O	seamen
O	spied
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	within
O	half
O	a
O	cable
O	'
O	s
O	length
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	wind
O	was
O	so
O	strong
O	that
O	we
O	were
O	driven
O	directly
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	split
O	.
O	Six
O	of
O	the
O	crew
O	,
O	of
O	whom
O	I
O	was
O	one
O	,
O	having
O	let
O	down
O	the
O	boat
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	made
O	a
O	shift
O	to
O	get
O	clear
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	and
O	the
O	rock
O	.
O	We
O	rowed
O	,
O	by
O	my
O	computation
O	,
O	about
O	three
O	leagues
O	,
O	till
O	we
O	were
O	able
O	to
O	work
O	no
O	longer
O	,
O	being
O	already
O	spent
O	with
O	labor
O	while
O	we
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	ship
O	.
O	We
O	therefore
O	trusted
O	ourselves
O	to
O	the
O	mercy
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	about
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	the
O	boat
O	was
O	overset
O	by
O	a
O	sudden
O	flurry
O	from
O	the
O	north
O	.
O	What
O	became
O	of
O	my
O	companions
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	escaped
O	on
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	or
O	were
O	left
O	in
O	the
O	vessel
O	,
O	I
O	can
O	not
O	tell
O	;
O	but
O	conclude
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	lost
O	.
O	For
O	my
O	own
O	part
O	,
O	I
O	swam
O	as
O	fortune
O	directed
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	pushed
O	forward
O	by
O	wind
O	and
O	tide
O	.
O	I
O	often
O	let
O	my
O	legs
O	drop
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	feel
O	no
O	bottom
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	almost
O	gone
O	,
O	and
O	able
O	to
O	struggle
O	no
O	longer
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	within
O	my
O	depth
O	;
O	and
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	storm
O	was
O	much
O	abated
O	.
O	The
O	declivity
O	was
O	so
O	small
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	walked
O	near
O	a
O	mile
O	before
O	I
O	got
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	conjectured
O	was
O	about
O	eight
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	advanced
O	forward
O	near
O	half
O	a
O	mile
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	discover
O	any
O	sign
O	of
O	houses
O	or
O	inhabitants
O	;
O	at
O	least
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	so
O	weak
O	a
O	condition
O	that
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	observe
O	them
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	extremely
O	tired
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	that
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	heat
O	of
O	the
O	weather
O	,
O	and
O	about
O	half
O	a
O	pint
O	of
O	brandy
O	that
O	I
O	drank
O	as
O	I
O	left
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	much
O	inclined
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	I
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	grass
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	very
O	short
O	and
O	soft
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	slept
O	sounder
O	than
O	ever
O	I
O	remembered
O	to
O	have
O	done
O	in
O	my
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	reckoned
O	,
O	about
O	nine
O	hours
O	;
O	for
O	when
O	I
O	awaked
O	it
O	was
O	just
O	daylight
O	.
O	I
O	attempted
O	to
O	rise
O	but
O	was
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	stir
O	;
O	for
O	as
O	I
O	happened
O	to
O	lie
O	on
O	my
O	back
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	my
O	arms
O	and
O	legs
O	were
O	strongly
O	fastened
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	;
O	and
O	my
O	hair
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	long
O	and
O	thick
O	,
O	tied
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	.
O	I
O	likewise
O	felt
O	several
O	slender
O	ligatures
O	across
O	my
O	body
O	,
O	from
O	my
O	arm-pits
O	to
O	my
O	thighs
O	.
O	I
O	could
O	only
O	look
O	upwards
O	,
O	the
O	sun
O	began
O	to
O	grow
O	hot
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	light
O	offended
O	my
O	eyes
O	.
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	confused
O	noise
O	about
O	me
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	posture
O	I
O	lay
O	,
O	could
O	see
O	nothing
O	except
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	I
O	felt
O	something
O	alive
O	moving
O	on
O	my
O	left
O	leg
O	,
O	which
O	advancing
O	gently
O	forward
O	,
O	over
O	my
O	breast
O	,
O	came
O	almost
O	up
O	to
O	my
O	chin
O	;
O	when
O	bending
O	my
O	eyes
O	downward
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	I
O	perceived
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	human
O	creature
O	not
O	six
O	inches
O	high
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	bow
O	and
O	arrow
O	in
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	quiver
O	at
O	his
O	back
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	,
O	I
O	felt
O	at
O	least
O	forty
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	kind
O	(
O	as
O	I
O	conjectured
O	)
O	following
O	the
O	first
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	utmost
O	astonishment
O	,
O	and
O	roared
O	so
O	loud
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	all
O	ran
O	back
O	in
O	a
O	fright
O	;
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	afterwards
O	told
O	,
O	were
O	hurt
O	with
O	the
O	falls
O	they
O	got
O	by
O	leaping
O	from
O	my
O	sides
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	they
O	soon
O	returned
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	who
O	ventured
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	to
O	get
O	a
O	full
O	sight
O	of
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	lifting
O	up
O	his
O	hands
O	and
O	eyes
O	by
O	way
O	of
O	admiration
O	,
O	cried
O	out
O	in
O	a
O	shrill
O	but
O	distinct
O	voice
O	,
O	Hekinah
O	degul
O	;
O	the
O	others
O	repeated
O	the
O	same
O	words
O	several
O	times
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	then
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	they
O	meant
O	.
O	I
O	lay
O	all
O	this
O	while
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	reader
O	may
O	believe
O	,
O	in
O	great
O	uneasiness
O	;
O	at
O	length
O	,
O	struggling
O	to
O	get
O	loose
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	fortune
O	to
O	break
O	the
O	strings
O	,
O	and
O	wrench
O	out
O	the
O	pegs
O	that
O	fastened
O	my
O	left
O	arm
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	;
O	for
O	,
O	by
O	lifting
O	it
O	up
O	to
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	I
O	discovered
O	the
O	methods
O	they
O	had
O	taken
O	to
O	bind
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	violent
O	pull
O	,
O	which
O	gave
O	me
O	excessive
O	pain
O	,
O	I
O	a
O	little
O	loosened
O	the
O	strings
O	that
O	tied
O	down
O	my
O	hair
O	on
O	the
O	left
O	side
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	just
O	able
O	to
O	turn
O	my
O	head
O	about
O	two
O	inches
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	creatures
O	ran
O	off
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	,
O	before
O	I
O	could
O	seize
O	them
O	;
O	whereupon
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	shout
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	shrill
O	accent
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	it
O	ceased
O	,
O	I
O	heard
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	cry-aloud
O	,
O	Tolgo
O	phonac
O	;
O	when
O	in
O	an
O	instant
O	I
O	felt
O	above
O	an
O	hundred
O	arrows
O	discharged
O	on
O	my
O	left
O	hand
O	,
O	which
O	pricked
O	me
O	like
O	so
O	many
O	needles
O	;
O	and
O	besides
O	,
O	they
O	shot
O	another
O	flight
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	as
O	we
O	do
O	bombs
O	in
O	Europe
O	,
O	whereof
O	many
O	I
O	suppose
O	fell
O	on
O	my
O	body
O	(
O	though
O	I
O	felt
O	them
O	not
O	)
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	on
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	immediately
O	covered
O	with
O	my
O	left
O	hand
O	.
O	When
O	this
O	shower
O	of
O	arrows
O	was
O	over
O	,
O	I
O	fell
O	a-groaning
O	with
O	grief
O	and
O	pain
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	striving
O	again
O	to
O	get
O	loose
O	,
O	they
O	discharged
O	another
O	volley
O	larger
O	than
O	the
O	first
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	attempted
O	with
O	spears
O	to
O	stick
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	sides
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	by
O	good
O	luck
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	on
O	me
O	a
O	buff
O	jerkin
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	pierce
O	.
O	I
O	thought
O	it
O	the
O	most
O	prudent
O	method
O	to
O	lie
O	still
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	design
O	was
O	to
O	continue
O	so
O	till
O	night
O	,
O	when
O	my
O	left
O	hand
O	being
O	already
O	loose
O	,
O	I
O	could
O	easily
O	free
O	myself
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	for
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	reason
O	to
O	believe
O	I
O	might
O	be
O	a
O	match
O	for
O	the
O	greatest
O	army
O	they
O	could
O	bring
O	against
O	me
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	size
O	with
O	him
O	that
O	I
O	saw
O	.
O	But
O	fortune
O	disposed
O	otherwise
O	of
O	me
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	people
O	observed
O	I
O	was
O	quiet
O	,
O	they
O	discharged
O	no
O	more
O	arrows
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	noise
O	I
O	heard
O	,
O	I
O	knew
O	their
O	numbers
O	increased
O	;
O	and
O	about
O	four
O	yards
O	from
O	me
O	,
O	over
O	against
O	my
O	right
O	ear
O	,
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	knocking
O	for
O	above
O	an
O	hour
O	,
O	like
O	that
O	of
O	people
O	at
O	work
O	;
O	when
O	turning
O	my
O	head
O	that
O	way
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	pegs
O	and
O	strings
O	would
O	permit
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	stage
O	erected
O	,
O	about
O	a
O	foot
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	capable
O	of
O	holding
O	four
O	of
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	,
O	with
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	ladders
O	to
O	mount
O	it
O	;
O	from
O	whence
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	who
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	person
O	of
O	quality
O	,
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	long
O	speech
O	,
O	whereof
O	I
O	understood
O	not
O	one
O	syllable
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	mentioned
O	,
O	that
O	before
O	the
O	principal
O	person
O	began
O	his
O	oration
O	,
O	he
O	cried
O	out
O	three
O	times
O	,
O	_Langro
O	dehul
O	san_
O	(
O	these
O	words
O	and
O	the
O	former
O	were
O	afterwards
O	repeated
O	and
O	explained
O	to
O	me
O	)
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	immediately
O	about
O	fifty
O	of
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	came
O	and
O	cut
O	the
O	strings
O	that
O	fastened
O	the
O	left
O	side
O	of
O	my
O	head
O	,
O	which
O	gave
O	me
O	the
O	liberty
O	of
O	turning
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	right
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	observing
O	the
O	person
O	and
O	gesture
O	of
O	him
O	that
O	was
O	to
O	speak
O	.
O	He
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	of
O	a
O	middle
O	age
O	,
O	and
O	taller
O	than
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	three
O	who
O	attended
O	him
O	,
O	whereof
O	one
O	was
O	a
O	page
O	that
O	held
O	up
O	his
O	train
O	,
O	and
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	somewhat
O	longer
O	than
O	my
O	middle
O	finger
O	;
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	stood
O	one
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	to
O	support
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	acted
O	every
O	part
O	of
O	an
O	orator
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	could
O	observe
O	many
O	periods
O	of
O	threatenings
O	,
O	and
O	others
O	of
O	promises
O	,
O	pity
O	,
O	arid
O	kindness
O	.
O	I
O	answered
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	words
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	submissive
O	manner
O	,
O	lifting
O	up
O	my
O	left
O	hand
O	and
O	both
O	my
O	eyes
O	to
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	as
O	calling
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	witness
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	being
O	almost
O	famished
O	with
O	hunger
O	,
O	having
O	not
O	eaten
O	a
O	morsel
O	for
O	some
O	hours
O	before
O	I
O	left
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	the
O	demands
O	of
O	nature
O	so
O	strong
O	upon
O	me
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	forbear
O	showing
O	my
O	impatience
O	(
O	perhaps
O	against
O	the
O	strict
O	rules
O	of
O	decency
O	)
O	by
O	putting
O	my
O	finger
O	frequently
O	to
O	my
O	mouth
O	,
O	to
O	signify
O	that
O	I
O	wanted
O	food
O	.
O	The
O	_Hurgo_
O	(
O	for
O	so
O	they
O	call
O	a
O	great
O	lord
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	afterwards
O	learnt
O	)
O	understood
O	me
O	very
O	well
O	.
O	He
O	descended
O	from
O	the
O	stage
O	,
O	and
O	commanded
O	that
O	several
O	ladders
O	should
O	be
O	applied
O	to
O	my
O	sides
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	above
O	an
O	hundred
O	of
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	mounted
O	,
O	and
O	walked
O	towards
O	my
O	mouth
O	,
O	laden
O	with
O	baskets
O	full
O	of
O	meat
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	provided
O	and
O	sent
O	thither
O	by
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	orders
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	first
O	intelligence
O	he
O	received
O	of
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	observed
O	there
O	was
O	the
O	flesh
O	of
O	several
O	animals
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	distinguish
O	them
O	by
O	the
O	taste
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	shoulders
O	,
O	legs
O	,
O	and
O	loins
O	,
O	shaped
O	like
O	those
O	of
O	mutton
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	well
O	dressed
O	,
O	but
O	smaller
O	than
O	the
O	wings
O	of
O	a
O	lark
O	.
O	I
O	ate
O	them
O	by
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	at
O	a
O	mouthful
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	three
O	loaves
O	at
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	about
O	the
O	bigness
O	of
O	musket
O	bullets
O	.
O	They
O	supplied
O	me
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	,
O	showing
O	a
O	thousand
O	marks
O	of
O	wonder
O	and
O	astonishment
O	at
O	my
O	bulk
O	and
O	appetite
O	,
O	I
O	then
O	made
O	another
O	sign
O	that
O	I
O	wanted
O	drink
O	.
O	They
O	found
O	by
O	my
O	eating
O	,
O	that
O	a
O	small
O	quantity
O	would
O	not
O	suffice
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	being
O	a
O	most
O	ingenious
O	people
O	,
O	they
O	flung
O	up
O	with
O	great
O	dexterity
O	one
O	of
O	their
O	largest
O	hogsheads
O	,
O	then
O	rolled
O	it
O	towards
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	beat
O	out
O	the
O	top
O	;
O	I
O	drank
O	it
O	off
O	at
O	a
O	draught
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	might
O	well
O	do
O	for
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	hold
O	half
O	a
O	pint
O	,
O	and
O	tasted
O	like
O	a
O	small
O	wine
O	of
O	Burgundy
O	,
O	but
O	much
O	more
O	delicious
O	.
O	They
O	brought
O	me
O	a
O	second
O	hogshead
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	drank
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	signs
O	for
O	more
O	;
O	but
O	they
O	had
O	none
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	performed
O	these
O	wonders
O	,
O	they
O	shouted
O	for
O	joy
O	,
O	and
O	danced
O	upon
O	my
O	breast
O	,
O	repeating
O	several
O	times
O	as
O	they
O	did
O	at
O	first
O	,
O	_Hekinah
O	degul
O	.
O	_
O	They
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	sign
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	throw
O	down
O	the
O	two
O	hogsheads
O	,
O	but
O	first
O	warning
O	the
O	people
O	below
O	to
O	stand
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	crying
O	aloud
O	,
O	_Borach
O	mevolah
O	,
O	_
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	vessels
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	universal
O	shout
O	of
O	_Hekinah
O	degul
O	.
O	_
O	I
O	confess
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	often
O	tempted
O	,
O	while
O	they
O	were
O	passing
O	backwards
O	and
O	forwards
O	on
O	my
O	body
O	,
O	to
O	seize
O	forty
O	or
O	fifty
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	that
O	came
O	in
O	my
O	reach
O	,
O	and
O	dash
O	them
O	against
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	remembrance
O	of
O	what
O	I
O	had
O	felt
O	,
O	which
O	probably
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	the
O	worst
O	they
O	could
O	do
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	promise
O	of
O	honor
O	I
O	made
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	so
O	I
O	interpreted
O	my
O	submissive
O	behavior
O	,
O	soon
O	drove
O	out
O	these
O	imaginations
O	.
O	Besides
O	,
O	I
O	now
O	considered
O	myself
O	as
O	bound
O	by
O	the
O	laws
O	of
O	hospitality
O	to
O	a
O	people
O	who
O	had
O	treated
O	me
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	expense
O	and
O	magnificence
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	in
O	my
O	thoughts
O	,
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	sufficiently
O	wonder
O	at
O	the
O	intrepidity
O	of
O	these
O	diminutive
O	mortals
O	,
O	who
O	durst
O	venture
O	to
O	mount
O	and
O	walk
O	upon
O	my
O	body
O	,
O	while
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	hands
O	was
O	at
O	liberty
O	,
O	without
O	trembling
O	at
O	the
O	very
O	sight
O	of
O	so
O	prodigious
O	a
O	creature
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	must
O	appear
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	After
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	observed
O	that
O	I
O	made
O	no
O	more
O	demands
O	for
O	meat
O	;
O	there
O	appeared
O	before
O	me
O	a
O	person
O	of
O	high
O	rank
O	from
O	his
O	Imperial
O	Majesty
O	.
O	His
O	Excellency
O	,
O	having
O	mounted
O	on
O	the
O	small
O	of
O	my
O	right
O	leg
O	,
O	advanced
O	forwards
O	up
O	to
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	with
O	about
O	a
O	dozen
O	of
O	his
O	retinue
O	.
O	And
O	producing
O	his
O	credentials
O	under
O	the
O	signet-
O	royal
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	applied
O	close
O	to
O	my
O	eyes
O	,
O	spoke
O	about
O	ten
O	minutes
O	,
O	without
O	any
O	signs
O	of
O	anger
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	determinate
O	resolution
O	;
O	often
O	pointing
O	forwards
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	afterwards
O	found
O	,
O	was
O	towards
O	the
O	capital
O	city
O	,
O	about
O	half
O	a
O	mile
O	distant
O	,
O	whither
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	agreed
O	by
O	his
O	Majesty
O	in
O	council
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	must
O	be
O	conveyed
O	.
O	I
O	answered
O	in
O	few
O	words
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	no
O	purpose
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	with
O	my
O	hand
O	that
O	was
O	loose
O	,
O	putting
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	(
O	but
O	over
O	his
O	Excellency
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	hurting
O	him
O	or
O	his
O	train
O	)
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	my
O	own
O	head
O	and
O	body
O	,
O	to
O	signify
O	that
O	I
O	desired
O	my
O	liberty
O	.
O	It
O	appeared
O	that
O	he
O	understood
O	me
O	well
O	enough
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	shook
O	his
O	head
O	by
O	way
O	of
O	disapprobation
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	his
O	hand
O	in
O	a
O	posture
O	,
O	to
O	show
O	that
O	I
O	must
O	be
O	carried
O	as
O	a
O	prisoner
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	other
O	signs
O	to
O	let
O	me
O	understand
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	meat
O	and
O	drink
O	enough
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	good
O	treatment
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	I
O	once
O	more
O	thought
O	of
O	attempting
O	to
O	break
O	my
O	bonds
O	;
O	but
O	again
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	felt
O	the
O	smart
O	of
O	their
O	arrows
O	,
O	upon
O	my
O	face
O	and
O	hands
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	all
O	in
O	blisters
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	darts
O	still
O	sticking
O	in
O	them
O	;
O	and
O	observing
O	likewise
O	that
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	my
O	enemies
O	increased
O	,
O	I
O	gave
O	tokens
O	,
O	to
O	let
O	them
O	know
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	do
O	with
O	me
O	what
O	they
O	pleased
O	.
O	Upon
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	_Hurgo_
O	and
O	his
O	train
O	withdrew
O	,
O	with
O	much
O	civility
O	and
O	cheerful
O	countenances
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	,
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	general
O	shout
O	,
O	with
O	frequent
O	repetitions
O	of
O	the
O	words
O	,
O	_Peplom
O	selan
O	,
O	_
O	and
O	I
O	felt
O	great
O	numbers
O	of
O	people
O	on
O	my
O	left
O	side
O	,
O	relaxing
O	the
O	cords
O	to
O	such
O	a
O	degree
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	turn
O	upon
O	my
O	right
O	.
O	But
O	before
O	this
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	daubed
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	both
O	my
O	hands
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	ointment
O	very
O	pleasant
O	to
O	the
O	smell
O	,
O	which
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	removed
O	all
O	the
O	smart
O	of
O	their
O	arrows
O	.
O	These
O	circumstances
O	,
O	added
O	to
O	the
O	refreshment
O	I
O	had
O	received
O	by
O	their
O	victuals
O	and
O	drink
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	very
O	nourishing
O	,
O	disposed
O	me
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	I
O	slept
O	about
O	eight
O	hours
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	afterwards
O	assured
O	;
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	wonder
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	physicians
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	emperor
O	'
O	s
O	order
O	had
O	mingled
O	a
O	sleepy
O	potion
O	in
O	the
O	hogsheads
O	of
O	wine
O	.
O	It
O	seems
O	that
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	first
O	moment
O	I
O	was
O	discovered
O	sleeping
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	after
O	my
O	landing
O	,
O	the
O	emperor
O	had
O	early
O	notice
O	of
O	it
O	by
O	an
O	express
O	;
O	and
O	determined
O	in
O	council
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	tied
O	in
O	the
O	manner
O	I
O	have
O	related
O	(
O	which
O	was
O	done
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	while
O	I
O	slept
O	)
O	,
O	that
O	plenty
O	of
O	meat
O	and
O	drink
O	should
O	be
O	sent
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	machine
O	prepared
O	to
O	carry
O	me
O	to
O	the
O	capital
O	city
O	.
O	This
O	resolution
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	may
O	appear
O	very
O	bold
O	and
O	dangerous
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	am
O	confident
O	,
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	imitated
O	by
O	any
O	prince
O	in
O	Europe
O	on
O	the
O	like
O	occasion
O	;
O	however
O	,
O	in
O	my
O	opinion
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	extremely
O	prudent
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	generous
O	;
O	for
O	,
O	supposing
O	these
O	people
O	had
O	endeavored
O	to
O	kill
O	me
O	with
O	their
O	spears
O	and
O	arrows
O	,
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	asleep
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	certainly
O	have
O	awaked
O	with
O	the
O	first
O	sense
O	of
O	smart
O	,
O	which
O	might
O	so
O	far
O	have
O	roused
O	my
O	rage
O	and
O	strength
O	,
O	as
O	to
O	have
O	enabled
O	me
O	to
O	break
O	the
O	strings
O	wherewith
O	I
O	was
O	tied
O	;
O	after
O	which
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	make
O	resistance
O	,
O	so
O	they
O	could
O	expect
O	no
O	mercy
O	.
O	These
O	people
O	are
O	most
O	excellent
O	mathematicians
O	,
O	and
O	arrived
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	perfection
O	in
O	mechanics
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	countenance
O	and
O	encouragement
O	of
O	the
O	emperor
O	,
O	who
O	is
O	a
O	renowned
O	patron
O	of
O	learning
O	.
O	This
O	prince
O	has
O	several
O	machines
O	fixed
O	on
O	wheels
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	carriage
O	of
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	great
O	weights
O	.
O	He
O	often
O	builds
O	his
O	largest
O	men-of-war
O	,
O	whereof
O	some
O	are
O	nine
O	feet
O	long
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	timber
O	grows
O	,
O	and
O	has
O	them
O	carried
O	on
O	these
O	engines
O	three
O	or
O	four
O	hundred
O	yards
O	to
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Five
O	hundred
O	carpenters
O	and
O	engineers
O	were
O	immediately
O	set
O	at
O	work
O	to
O	prepare
O	the
O	greatest
O	engine
O	they
O	had
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	frame
O	of
O	wood
O	raised
O	three
O	inches
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	about
O	seven
O	feet
O	long
O	,
O	and
O	four
O	wide
O	,
O	moving
O	upon
O	twenty-two
O	wheels
O	.
O	The
O	shout
O	I
O	heard
O	was
O	upon
O	the
O	arrival
O	of
O	this
O	engine
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	it
O	seems
O	,
O	set
O	out
O	in
O	four
O	hours
O	after
O	my
O	landing
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	brought
O	parallel
O	to
O	me
O	as
O	I
O	lay
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	principal
O	difficulty
O	was
O	,
O	to
O	raise
O	and
O	place
O	me
O	in
O	this
O	vehicle
O	.
O	Eighty
O	poles
O	,
O	each
O	of
O	one
O	foot
O	high
O	,
O	were
O	erected
O	for
O	this
O	purpose
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	strong
O	cords
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	bigness
O	of
O	packthread
O	,
O	were
O	fastened
O	by
O	hooks
O	to
O	many
O	bandages
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	workmen
O	had
O	girt
O	round
O	my
O	neck
O	,
O	my
O	hands
O	,
O	my
O	body
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	legs
O	.
O	Nine
O	hundred
O	of
O	the
O	strongest
O	men
O	were
O	employed
O	to
O	draw
O	up
O	these
O	cords
O	by
O	many
O	pulleys
O	fastened
O	on
O	the
O	poles
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	,
O	in
O	less
O	than
O	three
O	hours
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	raised
O	,
O	and
O	flung
O	into
O	the
O	engine
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	tied
O	fast
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	I
O	was
O	told
O	,
O	for
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	whole
O	operation
O	was
O	performing
O	,
O	I
O	lay
O	in
O	a
O	profound
O	sleep
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	force
O	of
O	that
O	soporiferous
O	medicine
O	infused
O	into
O	my
O	liquor
O	.
O	Fifteen
O	hundred
O	of
O	the
O	emperor
O	'
O	s
O	largest
O	horses
O	,
O	each
O	about
O	four
O	inches
O	and
O	an
O	half
O	high
O	,
O	were
O	employed
O	to
O	draw
O	me
O	towards
O	the
O	metropolis
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	said
O	,
O	was
O	half
O	a
O	mile
O	distant
O	.
O	About
O	four
O	hours
O	after
O	we
O	began
O	our
O	journey
O	,
O	I
O	awaked
O	by
O	a
O	very
O	ridiculous
O	accident
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	carriage
O	being
O	stopped
O	a
O	while
O	to
O	adjust
O	something
O	that
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	order
O	,
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	natives
O	had
O	the
O	curiosity
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	I
O	looked
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	asleep
O	;
O	they
O	climbed
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	engine
O	,
O	and
O	advancing
O	very
O	softly
O	to
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	an
O	officer
O	in
O	the
O	guards
O	,
O	put
O	the
O	sharp
O	end
O	of
O	his
O	half-pike
O	a
O	good
O	way
O	up
O	into
O	my
O	left
O	nostril
O	,
O	which
O	tickled
O	my
O	nose
O	like
O	a
O	straw
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	me
O	sneeze
O	violently
O	;
O	whereupon
O	they
O	stole
O	off
O	unperceived
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	three
O	weeks
O	before
O	I
O	knew
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	my
O	awaking
O	so
O	suddenly
O	.
O	We
O	made
O	a
O	long
O	march
O	the
O	remaining
O	part
O	of
O	that
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	rested
O	at
O	night
O	with
O	five
O	hundred
O	guards
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	of
O	me
O	,
O	half
O	with
O	torches
O	,
O	and
O	half
O	with
O	bows
O	and
O	arrows
O	,
O	ready
O	to
O	shoot
O	me
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	should
O	offer
O	to
O	stir
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	at
O	sunrise
O	we
O	continued
O	our
O	march
O	,
O	and
O	arrived
O	within
O	two
O	hundred
O	yards
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	gates
O	about
O	noon
O	.
O	The
O	emperor
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	court
O	,
O	came
O	out
O	to
O	meet
O	us
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	great
O	officers
O	would
O	by
O	no
O	means
O	suffer
O	his
O	Majesty
O	to
O	endanger
O	his
O	person
O	by
O	mounting
O	on
O	my
O	body
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	carriage
O	stopped
O	,
O	there
O	stood
O	an
O	ancient
O	temple
O	,
O	esteemed
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	largest
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	kingdom
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	having
O	been
O	polluted
O	some
O	years
O	before
O	by
O	an
O	unnatural
O	murder
O	,
O	was
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	zeal
O	of
O	those
O	people
O	,
O	looked
O	on
O	as
O	profane
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	had
O	been
O	applied
O	to
O	common
O	use
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	ornaments
O	and
O	furniture
O	carried
O	away
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	edifice
O	it
O	was
O	determined
O	I
O	should
O	lodge
O	.
O	The
O	great
O	gate
O	fronting
O	to
O	the
O	north
O	,
O	was
O	about
O	four
O	feet
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	almost
O	two
O	feet
O	wide
O	,
O	through
O	which
O	I
O	could
O	easily
O	creep
O	.
O	On
O	each
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	gate
O	was
O	a
O	small
O	window
O	,
O	not
O	above
O	six
O	inches
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	;
O	into
O	that
O	on
O	the
O	left
O	side
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	smith
O	conveyed
O	fourscore
O	and
O	eleven
O	chains
O	,
O	like
O	those
O	that
O	hang
O	to
O	a
O	lady
O	'
O	s
O	watch
O	in
O	Europe
O	,
O	and
O	almost
O	as
O	large
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	locked
O	to
O	my
O	left
O	leg
O	,
O	with
O	six
O	and
O	thirty
O	padlocks
O	.
O	Over
O	against
O	this
O	temple
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	highway
O	,
O	at
O	twenty
O	feet
O	distance
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	turret
O	at
O	least
O	five
O	feet
O	high
O	.
O	Here
O	the
O	emperor
O	ascended
O	,
O	with
O	many
O	principal
O	lords
O	of
O	his
O	court
O	,
O	to
O	have
O	an
O	opportunity
O	of
O	viewing
O	me
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	told
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	them
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	reckoned
O	,
O	that
O	above
O	an
O	hundred
O	thousand
O	inhabitants
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	upon
O	the
O	same
O	errand
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	my
O	guards
O	,
O	I
O	believe
O	there
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	fewer
O	than
O	ten
O	thousand
O	,
O	at
O	several
O	times
O	,
O	who
O	mounted
O	my
O	body
O	by
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	ladders
O	.
O	But
O	a
O	proclamation
O	was
O	soon
O	issued
O	to
O	forbid
O	it
O	,
O	upon
O	pain
O	of
O	death
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	workmen
O	found
O	it
O	was
O	impossible
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	break
O	loose
O	,
O	they
O	cut
O	all
O	the
O	strings
O	that
O	bound
O	me
O	;
O	whereupon
O	I
O	rose
O	up
O	with
O	as
O	melancholy
O	a
O	disposition
O	as
O	ever
O	I
O	had
O	in
O	my
O	life
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	noise
O	and
O	astonishment
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	at
O	seeing
O	me
O	rise
O	and
O	walk
O	,
O	are
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	expressed
O	.
O	The
O	chains
O	that
O	held
O	my
O	left
O	leg
O	were
O	about
O	two
O	yards
O	long
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	me
O	not
O	only
O	the
O	liberty
O	of
O	walking
O	backwards
O	and
O	forwards
O	in
O	a
O	semicircle
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	being
O	fixed
O	within
O	four
O	inches
O	of
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	allowed
O	me
O	to
O	creep
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	lie
O	at
O	my
O	full
O	length
O	in
O	the
O	temple
O	.
