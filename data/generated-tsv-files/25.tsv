O	Hermes

O	the
O	swift-footed

O	wedded
O	Dryope

O	the

O	lustily
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	his

O	,

O	,
O	examined
O	him
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	rosy-cheeked
O	thing

O	,
O	while
O	instead

O	the
O	strong
O	,
O	hairy
O	hind

O	of
O	a

O	.
O	He

O	merry
O	withal
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	Hermes
O	had
O	wrapped
O	him
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	hare
O	skin
O	,
O	he
O	sped
O	to
O	Olympus
O	and
O	showed
O	his
O	fellow-gods
O	the
O	son
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	born
O	to
O	him

O	.
O	Baby
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	Pan
O	made
O	the
O	Olympians
O	laugh
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	only
O	made
O	a
O	woman
O	,
O	his
O	own
O	mother
O	,
O	cry
O	;
O	all
O	others
O	rejoiced
O	at
O	the
O	new
O	creature
O	that
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	increase
O	their
O	merriment
O	.
O	And
O	Bacchus
O	,
O	who
O	loved
O	him
O	most
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	felt
O	that
O	here
O	was
O	a
O	babe
O	after
O	his
O	own
O	heart
O	,
O	bestowed
O	on
O	him
O	the
O	name
O	by
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	forever
O	known
O	--
O	Pan
O	,
O	meaning
O	_All_

O	Thus
O	Pan
O	grew
O	up
O	,
O	the
O	earthly
O	equal
O	of
O	the
O	Olympians
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	grew
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	to
O	himself
O	the
O	lordship
O	of
O	woods
O	and
O	of
O	solitary
O	places

O	and
O	of
O	fishermen
O	,
O	lord
O	of
O	flocks

O	herds
O	and
O	of

O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	All
O	living
O	,
O	soulless
O	things
O	owned
O	him
O	their
O	master
O	;
O	even
O	the
O	wild
O	bees
O	claimed
O	him
O	as
O	their
O	overlord
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	ever
O	merry
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	a
O	riot
O	of
O	music
O	and
O	of
O	laughter
O	slew
O	the
O	stillness
O	of
O	the
O	shadowy
O	woods

O	white-limbed
O	nymphs
O	and
O	gambolling
O	satyrs
O	,
O	for

O	from

O	for
O	whose
O	creation
O	a
O	maid
O	had
O	perished
O	.
O	Round
O	his
O	horns
O	and
O	thick
O	curls
O	he
O	presently
O	came
O	to
O	wear
O	a
O	crown
O	of
O	sharp
O	pine-leaves
O	,

O	of
O	another
O	fair
O	nymph
O	whose
O	destruction
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	about

O	Pitys
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	music
O	of
O	Pan
O	,
O	and
O	followed
O	him
O	even
O	as
O	the
O	children
O	followed
O	the
O	Pied
O	Piper
O	of
O	later

O	.
O	And
O	ever
O	his
O	playing
O	lured
O	her
O	further
O	on
O	and
O	into
O	more
O	dangerous
O	and
O	desolate
O	places
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	length
O	she
O	stood
O	on
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	a
O	high
O	cliff
O	whose
O	pitiless
O	front
O	rushed
O	sheer
O	down
O	to
O	cruel
O	rocks
O	far
O	below

O	There
O	Pan
O	'
O	s
O	music
O	ceased
O	,
O	and
O	Pitys
O	knew
O	all
O	the
O	joy
O	and
O	the
O	sorrow
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	as
O	the
O	god
O	held
O	out

O	to
O	embrace

O	.
O	But
O	neither
O	Pan

O	,
O	whose

O	From
