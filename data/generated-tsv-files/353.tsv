O	One
O	fine
O	spring
O	day
O	two
O	friends
O	went
O	out
O	to
O	a
O	moor
O	to
O	gather
O	fern
O	,
O	attended
O	by
O	a
O	boy
O	with
O	a
O	bottle
O	of
O	wine
O	and
O	a
O	box
O	of
O	provisions
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	were
O	straying
O	about
O	,
O	they
O	saw
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	a
O	hill
O	two
O	foxes
O	that
O	had
O	brought
O	out
O	their
O	cub
O	to
O	play
O	;
O	and
O	whilst
O	they
O	looked
O	on
O	,
O	struck
O	by
O	the
O	strangeness
O	of
O	the
O	sight
O	,
O	three
O	children
O	came
O	up
O	from
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	village
O	with
O	baskets
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	same
O	errand
O	as
O	themselves
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	children
O	saw
O	the
O	foxes
O	,
O	they
O	picked
O	up
O	a
O	bamboo
O	stick
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	creatures
O	stealthily
O	in
O	the
O	rear
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	old
O	foxes
O	took
O	to
O	flight
O	,
O	they
O	surrounded
O	them
O	and
O	beat
O	them
O	with
O	the
O	stick
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	ran
O	away
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	their
O	legs
O	could
O	carry
O	them
O	;
O	but
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	boys
O	held
O	down
O	the
O	cub
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	seizing
O	it
O	by
O	the
O	scruff
O	of
O	the
O	neck
O	,
O	went
O	off
O	in
O	high
O	glee
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	friends
O	were
O	looking
O	on
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	raising
O	his
O	voice
O	,
O	shouted
O	out
O	,
O	``
O	Hallo
O	!
O	you
O	boys
O	!
O	what
O	are
O	you
O	doing
O	with

O	fox
O	?
O	``
O	The
O	eldest
O	of
O	the
O	boys
O	replied
O	,

O	``
O	Oh

O	the

O	he
O	made
O	fast
O	the

O	round
O	the

O	the

O	of
O	the

O	the

O	.
O	The
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	friend
O	,
O	upon
O	this
O	,
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	:
O	``
O	Well
O	,
O	certainly
O	you

O	queer

O	you

O	.
O	If
O	we
O	had
O	not
O	interfered
O	just
O	now
O	,
O	the
O	fox
O	'

O	cub
O	would
O	have
O	lost
O	its
O	life
O	.
O	If

O	the
O	affair
O	,
O	there
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	no

O	How
O	could
O	I
O	stand
O	by
O	and
O	see
O	life
O	taken
O	?
O	It
O	was
O	but
O	a
O	little
O	I
O	spent
O	--
O	only
O	half
O	a
O	bu
O	--
O	to
O	save
O	the
O	cub
O	,
O	but
O	had
O	it
O	cost
O	a
O	fortune
O	I
O	should
O	not
O	have
O	grudged
O	it
O	.
O	I
O	thought
O	you
O	were
O	intimate
O	enough
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	know
O	my
O	heart
O	;
O	but
O	to-day
O	you
O	have
O	accused
O	me
O	of
O	being
O	eccentric
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	see
O	how
O	mistaken
O	I

O	been
O	in
O	you
O	.
O	However

O	this
O	day
O	forth
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	when
O	he

O	this
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	firmness
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	retiring
O	backward
O	and
O	bowing
O	with

O	:
O	``

O	filled
O	with
O	admiration
O	at

O	goodness
O	of
O	your
O	heart
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	hear
O	you

O	how
O	great
O	is
O	the

O	had
O	some
O	suspicions

O	you
O	;

O	When
O	the
O	two

O	thus
O	become
O	reconciled
O	,
O	they
O	examined
O	the
O	cub
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	a
O	slight
O	wound
O	in

O	foot
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	not

O	while
O	they
O	were
O	thinking
O	what
O	they
O	should
O	do
O	,
O	they
O	spied
O	out
O	the
O	herb
O	called
O	``
O	Doctor
O	'
O	s
O	Nakas√©
O	,
O	``
O	which
O	was
O	just
O	sprouting
O	;
O	so
O	they
O	rolled
O	up
O	a
O	little
O	of
O	it
O	in
O	their
O	fingers
O	and
O	applied
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	part
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	pulled
O	out
O	some
O	boiled
O	rice
O	from
O	their
O	luncheon-box
O	and
O	offered
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	cub
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	showed
O	no
O	sign
O	of
O	wanting
O	to
O	eat
O	;
O	so
O	they
O	stroked
O	it
O	gently
O	on
O	the
O	back
O	and
O	petted
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	pain
O	of

O	seemed
O	to

O	when
O	,
O	opposite
O	to
O	them

O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	old
O	foxes
O	sitting
O	watching
O	them
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	some
O	stacks
O	of
O	rice
O	straw
O	.
O	``

O	'
O	s
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	turned

O	head
O	toward
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	the

O	foxes
O	sat
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	the

O	foot
O	was
O	no

O	they
O	seemed
O	to
O	bow
O	their
O	thanks
O	,
O	looking

O	.
O	So
O	,
O	with
O	peace
O	in
O	their
O	hearts
O	,
O	the

O	went
O	off
O	to
O	another
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	choosing
O	a
O	pretty
O	spot
O	,
O	produced
O	the
O	wine
O	bottle
O	and
O	ate
O	their
O	noonday
O	meal
O	;
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	pleasant
O	day
O	,
O	they
O	returned
O	to
O	their
O	homes
O	,
O	and
O	became
O	firmer

O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	man
O	who
O	had
O	rescued
O	the
O	fox
O	'
O	s
O	cub
O	was
O	a
O	tradesman
O	in
O	good
O	circumstances
O	:

O	had
O	three

O	and
O	two
O	maid-servants
O	,
O	besides
O	men-servants
O	;
O	and
O	altogether
O	he
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	liberal
O	manner
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	married
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	union
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	one
O	son
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	reached
O	his
O	tenth
O	year
O	,
O	but
O	had
O	been
O	attacked
O	by
O	a
O	strange
O	disease
O	which
O	defied
O	all
O	the
O	physicians
O	'
O	skill
O	and
O	drugs
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	a
O	famous
O	physician
O	prescribed
O	the
O	liver
O	taken
O	from
O	a
O	live
O	fox
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	as

O	would
O	certainly
O	effect
O	a
O	cure

O	If

O	,
O	the
O	most

O	medicine
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	would
O	not
O	restore
O	the
O	boy
O	to
O	health
O	.
O	When

O	heard

O	.
O	However

O	told
O	the
O	state

O	the
O	case
O	to
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	lived
O	on
