O	at

O	.
O	There
O	was
O	great
O	confusion
O	.
O	The
O	night

O	At

O	grew

O	INDIAN
O	BOYS
O	SETTLED
O	A
O	QUARREL
O	Flying
O	Squirrel
O	and
O	Lightning
O	Bow
O	were
O	two
O	little
O	Indian
O	boys
O	.
O	They
O	lived
O	by
O	Singing
O	River
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	played
O	from
O	sunrise
O	to
O	sunset
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	as
O	happy
O	as
O	the
O	day
O	was
O	long
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	summer
O	,
O	they
O	fished
O	and
O	swam
O	in
O	Singing
O	River
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	shot
O	their
O	arrows
O	into
O	chipmunk
O	and
O	woodpecker
O	holes
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	they
O	played
O	``
O	Dodging
O	Arrows
O	,
O	``
O	a
O	game
O	their
O	mother
O	had
O	taught

O	when
O	they
O	were
O	very
O	young
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	winter
O	,
O	they
O	jumped
O	into
O	fleecy
O	snowdrifts
O	and
O	rolled
O	until
O	their
O	little
O	bronze
O	bodies
O	took
O	on
O	a
O	red-raspberry
O	tint
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	would
O	send
O	their
O	snow-snakes
O	skimming
O	over
O	the
O	hard
O	crust
O	of
O	snow
O	.
O	Snow-snakes
O	were
O	small
O	rods
O	of
O	wood
O	,
O	polished
O	smooth
O	with
O	resin
O	,
O	oil

O	,
O	over

O	crust

O	tipped

O	Six

O	quarreled
O	.
O	One
O	morning

O	No

O	run
O	,
O	so
O	no

O	could
O	decide
O	the
O	game
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	fell
O	to
O	quarreling

O	Louder
O	and
O	louder

O	voices

O	raised
