O	There
O	was
O	once
O	an
O	Indian
O	boy
O	,
O	who
O	thought
O	he
O	knew
O	more
O	and
O	could
O	do
O	more
O	than
O	anyone
O	else
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	proud
O	of
O	himself
O	that
O	he
O	walked
O	around
O	like
O	a
O	great
O	chief
O	,
O	who
O	wears
O	a
O	war
O	shirt
O	with
O	many
O	scalp
O	locks
O	on
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	Indian
O	boys
O	and
O	girls
O	called
O	him
O	Spread
O	Feather
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	strutted
O	about
O	like
O	a
O	big
O	turkey
O	or
O	a
O	peacock
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	Spread
O	Feather
O	was
O	playing
O	ball
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	boys
O	.
O	Not
O	once
O	had
O	he
O	failed
O	to
O	drive
O	or
O	catch
O	the
O	ball
O	with
O	his
O	crosse
O	stick
O	.
O	Twice
O	he
O	had
O	thrown
O	the
O	ball
O	with
O	such
O	force
O	that
O	some
O	one
O	had
O	been
O	hurt
O	.
O	Spread
O	Feather
O	grew
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	pleased
O	with
O	himself
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	played
O	.
O	He
O	began
O	to
O	use
O	tricks
O	and
O	to
O	talk
O	very
O	large
O	.
O	``
O	No
O	one
O	can
O	play
O	ball
O	as
O	I
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	can
O	catch
O	the
O	swiftest
O	ball
O	that
O	can
O	be
O	thrown
O	.
O	I
O	can
O	throw
O	the
O	ball
O	to
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	I
O	can
O	run
O	faster
O	than
O	the
O	deer
O	.
O	``
O	Spread
O	Feather
O	boasted
O	so
O	loudly
O	that
O	a
O	rabbit
O	heard
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	rabbit
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	bushes
O	and
O	sat
O	up
O	on
O	his
O	hind
O	legs
O	.
O	He
O	watched
O	Spread
O	Feather
O	play
O	,
O	and
O	listened
O	to
O	his
O	boasting
O	.
O	Soon
O	a
O	strange
O	boy
O	was
O	standing
O	where
O	the
O	rabbit
O	had
O	sat
O	.
O	The
O	stranger
O	said
O	to
O	Spread
O	Feather
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	would
O	like
O	to
O	play
O	ball
O	with
O	you
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Come
O	on
O	,
O	then
O	!
O	``
O	taunted
O	the
O	boastful
O	boy
O	.
O	``
O	Spread
O	Feather
O	will
O	show
O	the
O	strange
O	ball
O	player
O	how
O	to
O	catch
O	a
O	ball
O	.
O	``
O	They
O	began
O	to
O	play
O	.
O	The
O	stranger
O	could
O	run
O	like
O	a
O	deer
O	.
O	His
O	balls
O	were
O	so
O	swift
O	and
O	so
O	curved
O	that
O	Spread
O	Feather
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	them
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	catch
O	one
O	.
O	They
O	seemed
O	to
O	come
O	from
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	one
O	ball
O	hit
O	Spread
O	Feather
O	on
O	the
O	mouth
O	.
O	He
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	His
O	face
O	was
O	red
O	with
O	anger
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	lips
O	were
O	red
O	with
O	blood
O	.
O	He
O	sprang
O	to
O	his
O	feet
O	and
O	shouted
O	to
O	the
O	stranger
O	,
O	``
O	Though
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	like
O	the
O	taste

O	``
O	``
O	Very
O	well
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	stranger
O	.
O	``
O	We

O	Spread

O	set
O	his

O	very
O	hard
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	``
O	My

O	he
O	boasted
O	.
O	They
O	began
O	to
O	wrestle
O	.
O	Soon
O	Spread
O	Feather
O	'
O	s
O	arms
O	fell
O	at
O	his
O	sides
O	.
O	He
O	panted
O	for
O	air
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	no
O	breath
O	and
O	no
O	strength
O	.
O	The
O	stranger
O	picked
O	Spread
O	Feather
O	up
O	and
O	tossed
O	him
O	over
O	his
O	head
O	like
O	a
O	ball
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	fell
O	without
O	a
O	word
O	.
O	When
O	Spread
O	Feather
O	opened
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	a
O	rabbit
O	sprang
O	into
O	the
O	bushes
O	.
O	All
O	night
O	,
O	Spread
O	Feather
O	lay
O	and
O	thought
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	too
O	weak
O	and
O	too
O	sore
O	to
O	go
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	wigwam
O	.
O	Nor
O	was
O	he
O	eager
O	to
O	meet
O	the
O	other
O	boys
O	.
O	At
O	sunrise
O	a
O	rabbit
O	hopped
O	near
O	.
O	The
O	rabbit
O	slyly
O	suggested
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	like
O	to
O	play
O	another
O	game
O	of
O	ball
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	sat
O	up
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	rabbit
O	,
O	``
