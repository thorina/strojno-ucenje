O	August
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	town
O	called
O	Hall
O	.
O	Hall
O	is
O	a
O	favourite
O	name
O	for
O	several
O	towns
O	in
O	Austria
O	and
O	in
O	Germany
O	;
O	but
O	this
O	one
O	especial
O	little
O	Hall
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	Upper
O	Innthal
O	,
O	is
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	charming
O	Old-World
O	places
O	that
O	I
O	know
O	,
O	and
O	August
O	for
O	his
O	part
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	any
O	other
O	.
O	It
O	has
O	the
O	green
O	meadows
O	and
O	the
O	great
O	mountains
O	all
O	about
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	gray-green
O	glacier-fed
O	water
O	rushes
O	by
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	has
O	paved
O	streets
O	and
O	enchanting
O	little
O	shops
O	that
O	have
O	all
O	latticed
O	panes
O	and
O	iron
O	gratings
O	to
O	them
O	;
O	it
O	has
O	a
O	very
O	grand
O	old
O	Gothic
O	church
O	,
O	that
O	has
O	the
O	noblest
O	blendings
O	of
O	light
O	and
O	shadow
O	,
O	and
O	marble
O	tombs
O	of
O	dead
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	look
O	of
O	infinite
O	strength
O	and
O	repose
O	as
O	a
O	church
O	should
O	have
O	.
O	Then
O	there
O	is
O	the
O	Muntze
O	Tower
O	,
O	black
O	and
O	white
O	,
O	rising
O	out
O	of
O	greenery
O	and
O	looking
O	down
O	on
O	a
O	long
O	wooden
O	bridge
O	and
O	the
O	broad
O	rapid
O	river
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	is
O	an
O	old
O	schloss
O	which
O	has
O	been
O	made
O	into
O	a
O	guard-house
O	,
O	with
O	battlements
O	and
O	frescoes
O	and
O	heraldic
O	devices
O	in
O	gold
O	and
O	colours
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	man-at-arms
O	carved
O	in
O	stone
O	standing
O	life-size
O	in
O	his
O	niche
O	and
O	bearing
O	his
O	date
O	1530
O	.
O	A
O	little
O	farther
O	on
O	,
O	but
O	close
O	at
O	hand
O	,
O	is
O	a
O	cloister
O	with
O	beautiful
O	marble
O	columns
O	and
O	tombs
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	colossal
O	wood-carved
O	Calvary
O	,
O	and
O	beside
O	that
O	a
O	small
O	and
O	very
O	rich
O	chapel
O	:
O	indeed
O	,
O	so
O	full
O	is
O	the
O	little
O	town
O	of
O	the
O	undisturbed
O	past
O	,
O	that
O	to
O	walk
O	in
O	it
O	is
O	like
O	opening
O	a
O	missal
O	of
O	the
O	Middle
O	Ages
O	,
O	all
O	emblazoned
O	and
O	illuminated
O	with
O	saints
O	and
O	warriors
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	so
O	clean
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	still
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	noble
O	,
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	its
O	monuments
O	and
O	its
O	historic
O	colour
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	marvel
O	much
O	no
O	one
O	has
O	ever
O	cared
O	to
O	sing
O	its
O	praises
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	pious
O	heroic
O	life
O	of
O	an
O	age
O	at
O	once
O	more
O	restful
O	and
O	more
O	brave
O	than
O	ours
O	still
O	leaves
O	its
O	spirit
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	there
O	is
O	the
O	girdle
O	of
O	the
O	mountains
O	all
O	around
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	alone
O	means
O	strength
O	,
O	peace
O	,
O	majesty
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	little
O	town
O	a
O	few
O	years
O	ago
O	August
O	Strehla
O	lived
O	with
O	his
O	people
O	in
O	the
O	stone-paved
O	irregular
O	square
O	where
O	the
O	grand
O	church
O	stands
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	small
O	boy
O	of
O	nine
O	years
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	--
O	a
O	chubby-faced
O	little
O	man
O	with
O	rosy
O	cheeks
O	,
O	big
O	hazel
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	clusters
O	of
O	curls
O	the
O	brown
O	of
O	ripe
O	nuts
O	.
O	His
O	mother
O	was
O	dead
O	,
O	his
O	father
O	was
O	poor
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	were
O	many
O	mouths
O	at
O	home
O	to
O	feed
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	country
O	the
O	winters
O	are
O	long
O	and
O	very
O	cold
O	,
O	the
O	whole
O	land
O	lies
O	wrapped
O	in
O	snow
O	for
O	many
O	months
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	night
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	trotting
O	home
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	jug
O	of
O	beer
O	in
O	his
O	numb
O	red
O	hands
O	,
O	was
O	terribly
O	cold
O	and
O	dreary
O	.
O	The
O	good
O	burghers
O	of
O	Hall
O	had
O	shut
O	their
O	double
O	shutters
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	few
O	lamps
O	there
O	were
O	flickered
O	dully
O	behind
O	their
O	quaint
O	,
O	old-fashioned
O	iron
O	casings
O	.
O	The
O	mountains
O	indeed
O	were
O	beautiful
O	,
O	all
O	snow-white
O	under
O	the
O	stars
O	that
O	are
O	so
O	big
O	in
O	frost
O	.
O	Hardly
O	anyone
O	was
O	astir
O	;
O	a
O	few
O	good
O	souls
O	wending
O	home
O	from
O	vespers
O	,
O	a
O	tired
O	post-boy
O	who
O	blew
O	a
O	shrill
O	blast
O	from
O	his
O	tasseled
O	horn
O	as
O	he
O	pulled
O	up
O	his
O	sledge
O	before
O	a
O	hostelry
O	,
O	and
O	little
O	August
O	hugging
O	his
O	jug
O	of
O	beer
O	to
O	his
O	ragged
O	sheepskin
O	coat
O	,
O	were
O	all
O	who
O	were
O	abroad
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	snow
O	fell
O	heavily
O	and
O	the
O	good
O	folks
O	of
O	Hall
O	go
O	early
O	to
O	their
O	beds
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	run
O	,
O	or
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	spilled
O	the
O	beer
O	;
O	he
O	was
O	half
O	frozen
O	and
O	a
O	little
O	frightened
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	kept
O	up
O	his
O	courage
O	by
O	saying
O	over
O	and
O	over
O	again
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	shall
O	soon
O	be
O	at
O	home
O	with
O	dear
O	Hirschvogel
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	went
O	on
O	through
O	the
O	streets
O	,
O	past
O	the
O	stone
O	man-at-arms
O	of
O	the
O	guard-house
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	into
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	great
O	church
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	near
O	it
O	stood
O	his
O	father
O	Karl
O	Strehla
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	sculptured
O	Bethlehem
O	over
O	the
O	doorway
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Pilgrimage
O	of
O	the
O	Three
O	Kings
O	painted
O	on
O	its
O	wall
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	on
O	a
O	long
O	errand
O	outside
O	the
O	gates
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	,
O	over
O	the
O	frozen
O	fields
O	and
O	broad
O	white
O	snow
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	been
O	belated
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	the
O	wolves
O	behind
O	him
O	at
O	every
O	step
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	town
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	state
O	of
O	terror
O	,
O	thankful
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	little
O	panting
O	heart
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	oil-lamp
O	burning
O	under
O	the
O	first
O	house-shrine
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	forgotten
O	to
O	call
O	for
O	the
O	beer
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	carried
O	it
O	carefully
O	now
O	,
O	though
O	his
O	hands
O	were
O	so
O	numb
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	afraid
O	they
O	would
O	let
O	the
O	jug
O	down
O	every
O	moment
O	.
O	The
O	snow
O	outlined
O	with
O	white
O	every
O	gable
O	and
O	cornice
O	of
O	the
O	beautiful
O	old
O	wooden
O	houses
O	;
O	the
O	moonlight
O	shone
O	on
O	the
O	gilded
O	signs
O	,
O	the
O	lambs
O	,
O	the
O	grapes
O	,
O	the
O	eagles
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	quaint
O	devices
O	that
O	hung
O	before
O	the
O	doors
O	;
O	covered
O	lamps
O	burned
O	before
O	the
O	Nativities

O	on

O	;
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	where
O	a
O	shutter
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	closed
O	,
O	a
O	ruddy
O	fire-light
O	lit
O	up
O	a
O	homely
O	interior
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	noisy
O	band
O	of
O	children
O	clustering
O	round
O	the
O	house-mother
O	and
O	a
O	big
O	brown
O	loaf
O	,
O	or
O	some
O	gossips
O	spinning
O	and
O	listening
O	to
O	the
O	cobbler
O	'
O	s
O	or
O	the
O	barber
O	'
O	s
O	story
O	of
O	a
O	neighbour
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	oil-wicks
O	glimmered
O	,
O	and
O	the

O	blazed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	chestnuts
O	sputtered
O	in

O	iron
O	roasting-pot
O	.
O	Little
O	August
O	saw
O	all
O	these
O	things
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	everything
O	with
O	his
O	two
O	big
O	bright
O	eyes
O	that
O	had
O	such
O	curious
O	lights
O	and
O	shadows
O	in
O	them
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	went
O	heedfully
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	the
O	beer
O	which
O	a
O	single
O	slip
O	of
O	the
O	foot
O	would
O	make
O	him
O	spill
O	.
O	At
O	his
O	knock
O	and

O	solid
O	oak

O	,
O	four
O	centuries
O	old
O	if
O	one
O	,
O	flew
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boy
O	darted
O	in
O	with
O	his
O	beer
O	,
O	and
O	shouted
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	force
O	of
O	mirthful
O	lungs
O	,
O	``
O	Oh
O	,

O	It

O	Dorothea

O	a

O	dark-haired
O	and
O	serious
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	sweet
O	,
O	sad
O	face
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	had
O	had
O	many
O	cares
O	laid
O	on
O	her
O	shoulders
O	,
O	even
O	whilst

O	a

O	;

O	were
O	ten

O	in

O	.
O	Next
O	to

O	there
O	came
O	Jan
O	and
O	Karl
O	and
O	Otho
O	,
O	big
O	lads
O	,
O	gaining
O	a
O	little
O	for

O	August

O	went
O	up
O	in

O	summer
O	to
O	the
O	high
O	Alps
O	with
O	the
O	farmers

O	,
O	but
O	in

O	then
O	all

O	,
O	who
O	could
O	only
O	open

O	little
O	three-year-old
O	Ermengilda
O	,
O	with
O	eyes
O	like
O	forget-me-nots

O	whose
O	birth
O	had
O	cost
O	them
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	their
O	mother
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	of
O	that
O	mixed
O	race
O	,
O	half
O	Austrian
O	,
O	half
O	Italian
O	,
O	so
O	common
O	in

O	Tyrol
O	;
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	children
O	were
O	white
O	and
O	golden
O	as

O	,
O	others
O	were
O	brown
O	and
O	brilliant
O	as
O	fresh-fallen

O	The

O	a

O	to

O	so
O	little
O	to

O	He
O	worked
O	at
O	the

O	by

O	a

O	worked
O	better
O	and
O	kept

O	more
O	easily
O	if

O	his
O	pipe
O	and
O	a

O	too
O	well
O	;
O	but
O	this
O	had
O	only
O	been
O	said
O	of
O	him
O	after
O	his
O	wife
O	'
O	s
O	death
O	,
O	when
O	trouble
O	and
O	perplexity
O	had
O	begun
O	to
O	dull
O	a
O	brain
O	never
O	too
O	vigorous
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	enfeeble
O	further
O	a

O	.
O	As
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	the

O	often
O	bayed
O	at

O	without
O	a

O	from
O	the

O	Dorothea
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	those

O	almost
O	work

O	wholesome
O	and
O	a

O	into
O	twenty
O	.
O	The
O	children
O	were
O	always
O	clean
O	and
O	happy
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	table

O	seldom
O	without

O	pot
O	of
O	soup

O	,
O	and
O	never
O	grudged
O	them

O	grumbled
O	at

O	a

O	on
O	the
O	children
O	;
O	only
O	to
O	August
O	she
O	did
O	speak
O	a
O	little
O	sometimes
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	thoughtful
O	and
O	so
O	tender
O	of
O	her
O	always
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	she
O	did
O	that

O	were
O	troubles
O	about
O	money
O	--

O	vague
O	to
O	them
O	both
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	debtors
O	were
O	patient
O	and
O	kindly
O	,
O	being
O	neighbours
O	all

O	the
O	old
O	twisting
O	streets
O	between
O	the
O	guard-house
O	and
O	the
O	river
O	.
O	Supper
O	was
O	a
O	huge
O	bowl
O	of
O	soup
O	,
O	with
O	big
O	slices
O	of
O	brown

O	some

O	up

O	:
O	the
O	bowl
O	was
O	soon
O	emptied
O	by
O	ten
O	wooden
O	spoons
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	three
O	eldest
O	boys
O	slipped
O	off
O	to
O	bed
O	,
O	being
O	tired
O	with
O	their
O	rough
O	bodily
O	labour
O	in
O	the
O	snow
O	all
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	Dorothea
O	drew
O	her
O	spinning-wheel
O	by
O	the

O	set
O	it

O	got
O	August
O	down
O	upon

O	to
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	picture
O	or
O	a
O	story
O	.
O	For
O	August
O	was
O	the
O	artist
O	of
O	the
O	family
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	planed
O	deal
O	that
O	his
O	father
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	sticks
O	of
O	charcoal
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	would
O	draw
O	a
O	hundred
O	things
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	in
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	sweeping
O	each
O	out
O	with
O	his
O	elbow
O	when
O	the
O	children
O	had
O	seen
O	enough
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	sketching
O	another
O	in
O	its
O	stead
O	--
O	faces
O	and
O	dogs
O	'

O	,
O	and
O	men
O	in
O	sledges
O	,
O	and
O	old

O	in
O	their
O	furs
O	,
O	and
O	pine-trees

O	and
O	cocks

O	very
O	reverently

O	a
O	Madonna

O	It
O	was
O	all
O	very
O	rough
O	,
O	for
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	one
O	to
O	teach
O	him
O	anything
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	life-like
O	,
O	and
O	kept
O	the
O	whole
O	troop
O	of
O	children
O	shrieking
O	with
O	laughter
O	,
O	or
O	watching
O	breathless
O	,
O	with
O	wide
O	open
O	,
O	wondering
O	,
O	awed
O	eyes
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	all
O	so
O	happy

O	what
O	did
O	they
O	care
O	for
O	the
O	snow

O	?
O	Their
O	little

O	after

O	out
O	loud

O	looked
O	up

O	burnished
O	with
O	gilding
O	in
O	many
O	parts
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	radiant
O	everywhere
O	with
O	that
O	brilliant
O	colouring
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	Hirschvogel
O	family
O	,
O	painters
O	on
O	glass
O	and
O	great
O	in
O	chemistry
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	were
O	all
O	masters
O	.
O	The
O	stove
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	grand
O	thing
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	say
O	:
O	possibly
O	Hirschvogel
O	had
O	made
O	it
O	for
O	some
O	mighty
O	lord
O	of
O	the
O	Tyrol
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	an
O	imperial
O	guest
O	at
O	Innspruck
O	and
O	fashioned
O	so
O	many
O	things
O	for
O	the
O	Schloss
O	Amras
O	and
O	beautiful
O	Philippine
O	Welser
O	,
O	the
O	Burgher
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	,
O	who
O	gained
O	an
O	Archduke
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	by
O	her
O	beauty
O	and
O	the
O	right
O	to
O	wear
O	his
O	honors
O	by
O	her
O	wit
O	.
O	Nothing
O	was
O	known
O	of
O	the
O	stove
O	at
O	this
O	latter
O	day
O	in
O	Hall
O	.
O	The
O	grandfather
O	Strehla
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	master-mason
O	,
O	had
O	dug
O	it
O	up
O	out
O	of
O	some
O	ruins
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	building
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	finding
O	it
O	without
O	a
O	flaw
O	,
O	had
O	taken
O	it
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	only
O	thought
O	it
O	worth
O	finding
O	because
O	it
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	good
O	one
O	to
O	burn
O	.
O	That
O	was
O	now
O	sixty
O	years
O	past
O	,
O	and
O	ever
O	since
O	then
O	the
O	stove
O	had
O	stood
O	in
O	the
O	big
O	desolate
O	empty
O	room
O	,
O	warming
O	three
O	generations
O	of
O	the
O	Strehla
O	family
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	seen
O	nothing
O	prettier
O	perhaps
O	in
O	all
O	its
O	many
O	years
O	than
O	the
O	children
O	tumbled
O	now
O	in
O	a
O	cluster
O	like
O	gathered
O	flowers
O	at
O	its
O	feet
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	Strehla
O	children
O	,
O	born
O	to
O	nothing
O	else
O	,
O	were
O	all
O	born
O	to
O	beauty
O	;
O	white
O	or
O	brown
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	equally
O	lovely
O	to
O	look
O	upon
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	church
O	to
O	mass
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	curling
O	locks
O	and
O	their
O	clasped
O	hands
O	,
O	they
O	stood
O	under
O	the
O	grim
O	statues
O	like
O	cherubs
O	flown
O	down
O	off
O	some
O	fresco
O	.
O	``
O	Tell
O	us
O	a
O	story
O	,
O	August
O	,
O	``
O	they
O	cried
O	,
O	in
O	chorus
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	seen
O	charcoal
O	pictures
O	till
O	they
O	were
O	tired
O	;
O	and
O	August
O	did
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	every
O	night
O	,
O	pretty
O	nearly
O	,
O	looked
O	up
O	at
O	the
O	stove
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	what
O	he
O	imagined
O	of
O	the
O	many
O	adventures
O	and
O	joys
O	and
O	sorrows
O	of
O	the
O	human
O	being
O	who
O	figured
O	on
O	the
O	panels
O	from
O	his
O	cradle
O	to
O	his
O	grave
O	.
O	To
O	the
O	children
O	the
O	stove
O	was
O	a
O	household
O	god
O	.
O	In
O	summer
O	they
O	laid
O	a
O	mat
O	of
O	fresh
O	moss
O	all
O	round
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	dressed
O	it
O	up
O	with
O	green
O	boughs
O	and
O	the
O	numberless
O	beautiful
O	wild
O	flowers
O	of
O	the
O	Tyrol
O	country
O	.
O	In
O	winter
O	all
O	their
O	joys
O	centred
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	scampering
O	home
O	from
O	school
O	over
O	the
O	ice
O	and
O	snow
O	they
O	were
O	happy
O	,
O	knowing
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	soon
O	be
O	cracking
O	nuts
O	or
O	roasting
O	chestnuts
O	in
O	the
O	broad
O	ardent
O	glow
O	of
O	its
O	noble
O	tower
O	,
O	which
O	rose
O	eight
O	feet
O	high
O	above
O	them
O	with
O	all
O	its
O	spires
O	and
O	pinnacles
O	and
O	crowns
O	.
O	Once
O	a
O	travelling
O	peddler
O	had
O	told
O	them
O	that
O	the
O	letters
O	on
O	it
O	meant
O	Augustin
O	Hirschvogel
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	Hirschvogel
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	great
O	German
O	potter
O	and
O	painter
O	,
O	like
O	his
O	father
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	art-sanctified
O	city
O	of
O	Nürnberg
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	made
O	many
O	such
O	stoves
O	,
O	that
O	were
O	all
O	miracles
O	of
O	beauty
O	and
O	of
O	workmanship
O	,
O	putting
O	all
O	his
O	heart
O	and
O	his
O	soul
O	and
O	his
O	faith
O	into
O	his
O	labours
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	those
O	earlier

O	did
O	,
O	and
O	thinking
O	but
O	little
O	of
O	gold
O	or
O	praise
O	.
O	An
O	old
O	trader
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	who
O	sold
O	curiosities
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	church
O	,
O	had
O	told
O	August
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	about
O	the
O	brave
O	family
O	of
O	Hirschvogel
O	,
O	whose
O	houses
O	can
O	be
O	seen
O	in
O	Nürnberg
O	to
O	this
O	day
O	;
O	of
O	old
O	Veit
O	,
O	the
O	first
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	who
O	painted
O	the
O	Gothic
O	windows
O	of
O	St
O	.
O	Sebald
O	with
O	the
O	marriage
O	of
O	the
O	Margravine
O	;
O	of
O	his

O	of
O	his
O	grandsons
O	,
O	potters
O	,
O	painters
O	,
O	engravers
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	chief
O	of
O	them
O	great
O	Augustin
O	,
O	the
O	Luca
O	della
O	Robbia
O	of
O	the
O	North
O	.
O	And
O	August
O	'
O	s
O	imagination
O	,
O	always
O	quick
O	,
O	had
O	made
O	a
O	living
O	personage
O	out
O	of
O	these
O	few
O	records
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	Hirschvogel
O	as
O	though
O	he
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	flesh
O	walking
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	Maximilian-Strass
O	in
O	his
O	visit
O	to
O	Innspruck
O	,
O	and
O	maturing
O	beautiful
O	things
O	in
O	his
O	brain
O	as
O	he
O	stood
O	on
O	the
O	bridge
O	and
O	gazed
O	on
O	the
O	emerald-green
O	flood
O	of
O	the
O	Inn
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	stove
O	had
O	got
O	to
O	be
O	called
O	Hirschvogel
O	in
O	the
O	family
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	a
O	living
O	creature
O	,
O	and
O	little
O	August
O	was
O	very
O	proud
O	because
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	named
O	after
O	that
O	famous
O	old
O	dead
O	German
O	who
O	had
O	had
O	the
O	genius
O	to
O	make
O	so
O	glorious
O	a
O	thing
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	children
O	loved
O	the
O	stove
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	August
O	the
O	love
O	of
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	passion
O	;
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	secret
O	heart
O	he
O	used
O	to
O	say
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	``
O	When
O	I
O	am

O	I
O	will
O	make
O	just
O	such
O	things
O	too
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	I
O	will
O	set
O	Hirschvogel
O	in
O	a
O	beautiful
O	room
O	in
O	a
O	house
O	that
O	I
O	will
O	build
O	myself
O	in
O	Innspruck
O	just
O	outside
O	the
O	gates
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	chestnuts
O	are
O	,

O	a

O	cow-keeper
O	when
O	he
O	was

O	,
O	with
O	the
O	stillness

O	the

O	,
O	was
O	quite
O	certain
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	live
O	for

O	driving
O	the

O	little
O	'
O	Gilda
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	ailing
O	,
O	and
O	sobbed
O	over
O	the
O	child
O	,
O	whilst
O	the
O	others
O	stood
O	looking
O	on
O	,
O	dimly
O	understanding
O	that
O	with
O	Hirschvogel
O	was
O	going
O	all
O	the
O	warmth
O	of
O	their
O	bodies
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	their
O	hearth
O	.
O	Even
O	their
O	father
O	now
O	was
O	very
O	sorry
O	and
O	ashamed
O	;
O	but
O	two
O	hundred
O	florins
O	seemed
O	a
O	big
O	sum
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	the
O	children
O	could
O	warm
O	themselves
O	quite
O	as
O	well
O	at
O	the
O	black
O	iron
O	stove
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen
O	.
O	Besides
O	,
O	whether
O	he
O	regretted
O	it
O	now
O	or
O	not
O	,
O	the
O	work
O	of
O	the
O	Nürnberg
O	potter
O	was
O	sold
O	irrevocably
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	stand
O	still
O	and
O	see
O	the
O	men
O	from
O	Munich
O	wrap
O	it
O	in
O	manifold
O	wrappings
O	and
O	bear
O	it
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	snowy
O	air
O	to
O	where
O	an
O	ox-cart
O	stood
O	in
O	waiting
O	for
O	it
O	.
O	In
O	another
O	moment
O	Hirschvogel
O	was
O	gone
O	--
O	gone
O	forever
O	and
O	aye
O	.
O	August
O	stood
O	still
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	leaning
O	,
O	sick
O	and
O	faint
O	from
O	the
O	violence
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	used
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	against
O	the
O	back
O	wall
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	The
O	wall
O	looked
O	on
O	a
O	court
O	where
O	a
O	well
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	backs
O	of
O	other
O	houses
O	,
O	and
O	beyond
O	them
O	the
O	spire
O	of
O	the
O	Muntze
O	Tower
O	and
O	the
O	peaks
O	of
O	the
O	mountains
O	.
O	Into
O	the
O	court
O	an
O	old
O	neighbour
O	hobbled
O	for
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	seeing
O	the
O	boy
O	,
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	:
O	``

O	August

O	He
O	hid

O	in
O	the
O	grand
O	portico
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	so

O	the

O	out
O	and

O	with
O	infinite
O	care
O	on

O	Two
O	of

O	for

O	August
O	had
O	no

O	;
O	he
O	only
O	watched
O	for

O	Then
O	he
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	unnoticeable
O	figure
O	enough
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	score
O	of
O	other
O	boys
O	in
O	Hall
O	,
O	crept
O	,
O	unseen
O	by
O	any

O	and
O	followed
O	in
O	the
O	wake
O	of

O	dray
O	.
O	Its
O	course
O	lay
O	toward

O	and
O	vanish
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	said
O	anything

O	people
O	are
O	kind-hearted
O	and
O	easy
O	of
O	temper
O	in
O	this
O	pleasant
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	children
O	and
O	dogs
O	are
O	both
O	happy
O	there
O	.
O	He
O	heard
O	the
O	Bavarians
O	arguing
O	and
O	vociferating
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	,
O	and
O	learned
O	that
O	they
O	meant
O	to
O	go
O	too
O	and
O	wanted
O	to
O	go
O	with
O	the
O	great
O	stove
O	itself
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	do
O	,
O	for
O	neither

O	the
O	stove
O	go
O	by

O	passenger
O	train
O	nor
O	they
O	themselves
O	go
O	in
O	a
O	goods-train
O	.
O	So
O	at
O	length
O	they
O	insured
O	their
O	precious
O	burden
O	for
O	a
O	large
O	sum
O	,
O	and
O	consented
O	to
O	send
O	it
O	by
O	a
O	luggage
O	train
O	which
O	was

O	seldom
O	deign

O	all
O	.
O	August
O	heard
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	desperate
O	resolve

O	itself
O	up

O	Where
O	Hirschvogel
O	went
O	would
O	he
O	go
O	.

O	--
O	sitting

O	carpets
O	,
O	of
O	Russian
O	skins
O	,
O	of
O	Hungarian
O	wines
O	,
O	which
O	shared
O	the
O	same
O	abode
O	as
O	did
O	his
O	swathed
O	and
O	bound
O	Hirschvogel
O	.
O	No
O	doubt
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	naughty
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	never
O	occurred
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	:
O	his
O	whole
O	mind
O	and
O	soul
O	were
O	absorbed
O	in
O	the
O	one
O	entrancing
O	idea
O	,
O	to
O	follow
O	his
O	beloved
O	friend
O	and
O	fire-king
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	very
O	dark
O	in
O	the
O	closed
O	truck
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	only
O	a
O	little
O	window
O	above
O	the
O	door
O	;
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	crowded
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	strong
O	smell
O	in
O	it
O	from
O	the
O	Russian
O	hides
O	and
O	the
O	hams
O	that
O	were
O	in
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	August
O	was
O	not
O	frightened
O	;
O	he
O	was
O	close
O	to
O	Hirschvogel
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	he
O	meant
O	to
O	be
O	closer
O	still
O	;
O	for
O	he
O	meant
O	to
O	do
O	nothing
O	less
O	than
O	get
O	inside
O	Hirschvogel
O	itself
O	.
O	Being
O	a
O	shrewd
O	little
O	boy
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	had
O	by
O	great
O	luck
O	two
O	silver
O	groschen
O	in
O	his
O	breeches-pocket
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	earned
O	the
O	day
O	before
O	by
O	chopping
O	wood
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	bought
O	some
O	bread
O	and
O	sausage
O	at
O	the
O	station
O	of
O	a
O	woman
O	there
O	who
O	knew
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	thought
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	out
O	to
O	his
O	uncle
O	Joachim
O	'
O	s
O	châlet
O	above
O	Jenbach
O	.
O	This
O	he
O	had
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	he
O	ate
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
O	and
O	the
O	lumbering
O	,
O	pounding
O	,
O	thundering
O	noise
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	giddy
O	,
O	as
O	never
O	had
O	he
O	been
O	in
O	a
O	train
O	of
O	any
O	kind
O	before
O	.
O	Still
O	he
O	ate
O	,
O	having
O	had
O	no
O	breakfast
O	,
O	and
O	being
O	a
O	child
O	,
O	and
O	half
O	a
O	German
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	knowing
O	at
O	all
O	how
O	or
O	when
O	he
O	ever
O	would
O	eat
O	again
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	eaten
O	,
O	not
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	he
O	wanted
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	he
O	thought
O	was
O	prudent
O	(
O	for
O	who
O	could
O	say
O	when
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	buy
O	anything
O	more
O	?
O	)
O	,
O	he
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	like
O	a
O	little
O	mouse
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	withes
O	of
O	straw
O	and
O	hay
O	which
O	enveloped
O	the
O	stove
O	.
O	If
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	put
O	in
O	a
O	packing-case
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	defeated
O	at
O	the
O	onset
O	.
O	As
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	he
O	gnawed
O	,
O	and
O	nibbled
O	,
O	and
O	pulled
O	,
O	and
O	pushed
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	a
O	mouse
O	would
O	have
O	done
O	,
O	making
O	his
O	hole
O	where
O	he
O	guessed
O	that
O	the
O	opening
O	of
O	the
O	stove
O	was
O	--
O	the
O	opening
O	through
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	so
O	often
O	thrust
O	the
O	big
O	oak
O	logs
O	to
O	feed
O	it
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	disturbed
O	him
O	;
O	the
O	heavy
O	train
O	went
O	lumbering
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	nothing
O	at
O	all
O	of
O	the
O	beautiful
O	mountains
O	,
O	and
O	shining
O	waters
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	forests
O	through
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	being
O	carried
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	hard
O	at
O	work
O	getting
O	through
O	the
O	straw
O	and
O	hay
O	and
O	twisted
O	ropes
O	;
O	and
O	get
O	through
O	them
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	did
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	stove
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	knew
O	so
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	was
O	quite
O	large
O	enough
O	for
O	a
O	child
O	of
O	his
O	age
O	to
O	slip
O	through
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	this
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	counted
O	upon
O	doing
O	.
O	Slip
O	through
O	he
O	did
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	often
O	done
O	at
O	home
O	for
O	fun
O	,
O	and
O	curled
O	himself
O	up
O	there
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	anyhow
O	remain
O	during
O	many
O	hours
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	;
O	air
O	came
O	in
O	through
O	the
O	brass
O	fretwork
O	of
O	the
O	stove
O	;
O	and
O	with
O	admirable
O	caution
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	little
O	fellow
O	he
O	leaned
O	out
O	,
O	drew
O	the
O	hay
O	and
O	straw
O	together
O	,
O	rearranged
O	the
O	ropes
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	could
O	ever
O	have
O	dreamed
O	a
O	little
O	mouse
O	had
O	been
O	at
O	them
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	curled
O	himself
O	up
O	again
O	,
O	this
O	time
O	more
O	like
O	a
O	dormouse
O	than
O	anything
O	else
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	being
O	safe
O	inside
O	his
O	dear
O	Hirschvogel
O	and
O	intensely
O	cold
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	fast
O	asleep
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	bed
O	at
O	home
O	with
O	Albrecht
O	,
O	and
O	Christof
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	train
O	lumbered
O	on
O	,
O	stopped
O	often
O	and
O	long
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	goods-trains
O	is
O	,
O	sweeping
O	the
O	snow
O	away
O	with
O	its
O	cow-switcher
O	,
O	and
O	rumbling
O	through
O	the
O	deep
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	mountains
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	lamps
O	aglow
O	like
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	a
O	dog
O	in
O	a
O	night
O	of
O	frost
O	.
O	The
O	train
O	rolled
O	on
O	in
O	its
O	heavy
O	,
O	slow
O	fashion
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	child
O	slept
O	soundly
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	while
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	did
O	awake
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	dark
O	outside
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	;
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	course
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	absolute
O	darkness
O	;
O	and
O	for
O	a
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	solely
O	frightened
O	,
O	and
O	trembled
O	terribly
O	,
O	and
O	sobbed
O	in
O	a
O	quiet
O	heart-broken
O	fashion
O	,
O	thinking
O	of
O	them
O	all
O	at
O	home
O	.
O	Poor
O	Dorothea
O	!
O	how
O	anxious
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	!
O	How
O	she
O	would
O	run
O	over
O	the
O	town
O	and
O	walk
O	up
O	to
O	grandfather
O	'
O	s
O	at
O	Dorf
O	Ampas
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	even
O	send
O	over
O	to
O	Jenbach
O	,
O	thinking
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	refuge
O	with
O	Uncle
O	Joachim
O	!
O	His
O	conscience
O	smote
O	him
O	for
O	the
O	sorrow
O	he
O	must
O	be
O	even
O	then
O	causing
O	to
O	his
O	gentle
O	sister
O	;
O	but
O	it
O	never
O	occurred
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	try
O	and
O	go
O	back
O	.
O	If
O	he
O	once
O	were
O	to
O	lose
O	sight
O	of
O	Hirschvogel
O	how
O	could
O	he
O	ever
O	hope
O	to
O	find
O	it
O	again
O	?
O	how
O	could
O	he
O	ever
O	know
O	whither
O	it
O	had
O	gone
O	--
O	north
O	,
O	south
O	,
O	east
O	or
O	west
O	?
O	The
O	old
O	neighbour
O	had
O	said
O	that
O	the
O	world
O	was
O	small
O	;
O	but
O	August
O	knew
O	at
O	least
O	that
O	it
O	must
O	have
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	places
O	in
O	it
O	;
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	himself
O	on
O	the
O	maps
O	on
O	his
O	school-house
O	walls
O	.
O	Almost
O	any
O	other
O	little
O	boy
O	would
O	,
O	I
O	think
O	,
O	have
O	been
O	frightened
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	wits
O	at
O	the
O	position
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	;
O	but
O	August
O	was
O	brave
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	firm
O	belief
O	that
O	God
O	and
O	Hirschvogel
O	would
O	take
O	care
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	master-potter
O	of
O	Nürnberg
O	was
O	always
O	present
O	to
O	his
O	mind
O	,
O	a
O	kindly
O	,
O	benign
O	,
O	and
O	gracious
O	spirit
O	,
O	dwelling
O	manifestly
O	in
O	that
O	porcelain
O	tower
O	whereof
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	maker
O	.
O	A
O	droll
O	fancy
O	,
O	you
O	say
O	?
O	But
O	every
O	child
O	with
O	a
O	soul
O	in
O	him
O	has
O	quite
O	as
O	quaint
O	fancies
O	as
O	this
O	one
O	was
O	of
O	August
O	'
O	s
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	got
O	over
O	his
O	terror
O	and
O	his
O	sobbing
O	both
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	utterly
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	feel
O	cramped
O	at
O	all
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	stove
O	was
O	so
O	large
O	,
O	and
O	air
O	he
O	had
O	in
O	plenty
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	came
O	through
O	the
O	fretwork
O	running
O	round
O	the
O	top
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	hungry
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	nibbled
O	with
O	prudence
O	at
O	his
O	loaf
O	and
O	his
O	sausage
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	at
O	all
O	tell
O	the
O	hour
O	.
O	Every
O	time
O	the
O	train
O	stopped
O	and
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	banging
O	,
O	stamping
O	,
O	shouting
O	,
O	and
O	jangling
O	of
O	chains
O	that
O	went
O	on
O	,
O	his
O	heart
O	seemed
O	to
O	jump
O	up
O	into
O	his
O	mouth
O	.
O	If
O	they
O	should
O	find
O	him
O	out
O	!
O	Sometimes
O	porters
O	came
O	and
O	took
O	away
O	this
O	case
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	a
O	sack
O	here
O	,
O	a
O	bale
O	there
O	,
O	now
O	a
O	big
O	bag
O	,
O	now
O	a
O	dead
O	chamois
O	.
O	Every
O	time
O	the
O	men
O	trampled
O	near
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	swore
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	banged
O	this
O	and
O	that
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	frightened
O	that
O	his
O	very
O	breath
O	seemed
O	to
O	stop
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	lift
O	the
O	stove
O	out
O	,
O	would
O	they
O	find
O	him
O	?
O	and
O	if
O	they
O	did
O	find
O	him
O	,
O	would
O	they
O	kill
O	him
O	?
O	That
O	was
O	what
O	he
O	kept
O	thinking
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	all
O	through
O	the
O	dark
O	hours
O	,
O	which
O	seemed
O	without
O	end
O	.
O	The
O	goods-trains
O	are
O	usually
O	very
O	slow
O	,
O	and
O	are
O	many
O	days
O	doing
O	what
O	a
O	quick
O	train
O	does
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	hours
O	.
O	This
O	one
O	was
O	quicker
O	than
O	most
O	,
O	because
O	it
O	was
O	bearing
O	goods
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Bavaria
O	;
O	still
O	,
O	it
O	took
O	all
O	the
O	short
O	winter
O	'
O	s
O	day
O	and
O	the
O	long
O	winter
O	'
O	s
O	night
O	and
O	half
O	another
O	day
O	to
O	go
O	over
O	ground
O	that
O	the
O	mail-trains
O	cover
O	in
O	a
O	forenoon
O	.
O	It
O	passed
O	great
O	armoured
O	Kuffstein
O	standing
O	across
O	the
O	beautiful
O	and
O	solemn
O	gorge

O	denying
O	the
O	right
O	of
O	way
O	to
O	all
O	the
O	foes
O	of
O	Austria
O	.
O	It
O	passed
O	twelve
O	hours
O	later
O	,
O	after
O	lying
O	by
O	in
O	out-of-the-way
O	stations
O	,
O	pretty
O	Rosenheim
O	,
O	that
O	marks
O	the
O	border
O	of
O	Bavaria
O	.
O	And
O	here
O	the
O	Nürnberg
O	stove
O	,
O	with
O	August
O	inside
O	it
O	,
O	was
O	lifted
O	out
O	heedfully
O	and
O	set
O	under
O	a
O	covered
O	way
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	lifted
O	out
O	,
O	the
O	boy
O	had
O	hard
O	work
O	to
O	keep
O	in
O	his
O	screams
O	;
O	he
O	was
O	tossed
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	as
O	the
O	men
O	lifted
O	the
O	huge
O	thing
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	earthenware
O	walls
O	of
O	his
O	beloved
O	fire-king
O	were
O	not
O	cushions
O	of
O	down
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	though
O	they
O	swore
O	and
O	grumbled
O	at
O	the
O	weight
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	they
O	never
O	suspected
O	that
O	a
O	living
O	child
O	was
O	inside
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	carried
O	it
O	out
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	platform
O	and
O	set
O	it
O	down
O	under
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	the
O	goods-shed
O	.
O	There
O	it
O	passed
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	August
O	was
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	within
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	winds
O	of
O	early
O	winter
O	sweep
O	bitterly
O	over
O	Rosenheim
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	vast
O	Bavarian
O	plain
O	was
O	one
O	white
O	sheet
O	of
O	snow
O	.
O	If
O	there
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	whole
O	armies
O	of
O	men
O	at
O	work
O	always
O	clearing
O	the
O	iron
O	rails
O	of
O	the
O	snow
O	,
O	no
O	trains
O	could
O	ever
O	have
O	run
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	Happily
O	for
O	August
O	,
O	the
O	thick
O	wrappings
O	in
O	which
O	the

O	He

O	a
O	little

O	sausage
O	.
O	What
O	he
O	did
O	begin
O	to
O	suffer
O	from
O	was
O	thirst
O	;
O	and
O	this
O	frightened
O	him
O	almost
O	more
O	than
O	anything
O	else
O	,
O	for
O	Dorothea
O	had
O	read
O	aloud
O	to
O	them
O	one
O	night
O	a
O	story
O	of
O	the
O	tortures
O	some
O	wrecked
O	men
O	had
O	endured
O	because
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	any
O	water
O	but
O	the
O	salt
O	sea
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	many
O	hours
O	since
O	he
O	had
O	last
O	taken
O	a
O	drink
O	from
O	the
O	wooden
O	spout
O	of
O	their

O	them
O	the
O	sparkling
O	,

O	water
O	of
O	the
O	hills
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	fortunately

O	had
O	brought
O	some

O	in

O	was
O	finally
O	,

O	nipping
O	his

O	then
O	;

O	All

O	up

O	and
O	was
O	almost
O	on
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	shouting
O	out
O	to
O	them
O	that
O	they
O	were

O	should

O	that
O	to

O	sever
O	him
O	forever
O	from
O	Hirschvogel

O	he
O	kept
O	quite
O	still

O	the

O	barred

O	perhaps
O	passed
O	by

O	anything
O	strange
O	inside
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	talked
O	long
O	and
O	low
O	with
O	the
O	tradesmen
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	his
O	accent
O	was
O	different
O	from
O	that
O	which
O	August
O	was
O	used
O	to
O	,
O	the
O	child
O	could
O	distinguish
O	little
O	that
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	except
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	the
O	word
O	``
O	gulden
O	``
O	again
O	and
O	again
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	while
O	he
O	went
O	away
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	dealers
O	accompanying
O	him
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	lingering
O	behind
O	to
O	bar
O	up
O	the
O	shutters
O	.
O	Then
O	this
O	one
O	also
O	withdrew
O	again
O	,
O	double-locking
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	little
O	hedgehog
O	uncurled
O	itself
O	and
O	dared
O	to
O	breathe
O	aloud
O	.
O	What
O	time
O	was
O	it
O	?
O	Late
O	in
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	,
O	for
O	to
O	accompany
O	the
O	stranger
O	they
O	had
O	lighted
O	a
O	lamp
O	;
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	the
O	scratch
O	of
O	the
O	match
O	,
O	and
O	through
O	the
O	brass
O	fretwork
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	lines
O	of
O	light
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	night
O	here
O	,
O	that
O	was
O	certain
O	.
O	He
O	and
O	Hirschvogel
O	were
O	locked
O	in
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	least
O	they
O	were
O	together
O	.
O	If
O	only
O	he
O	could
O	have
O	had
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	!
O	He
O	thought
O	with
O	a
O	pang
O	of
O	how
O	at
O	this
O	hour
O	at
O	home
O	they
O	ate
O	the
O	sweet
O	soup
O	,
O	sometimes
O	with
O	apples
O	in
O	it
O	from
O	Aunt
O	Maila
O	'
O	s
O	farm
O	orchard
O	,
O	and
O	sang
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	listened
O	to
O	Dorothea
O	'
O	s
O	reading
O	of
O	little
O	tales
O	,
O	and
O	basked
O	in
O	the
O	glow
O	and
O	delight
O	that
O	had
O	beamed
O	on
O	them
O	from
O	the
O	great
O	Nürnberg
O	fire-king
O	.
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	poor
O	,
O	poor
O	little

O	What

O	she
O	doing
O	without

O	now
O	the

O	ugly
O	little
O	kitchen
O	.
O	Oh
O	,
O	how
O	cruel
O	of
O	father
O	!
O	August
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	to
O	hear
O	the
O	dealers
O	blame
O	or
O	laugh
O	at
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	feel
O	that
O	it

O	been
O	so
O	,
O	so
O	cruel
O	to
O	sell
O	Hirschvogel

O	The
O	mere
O	memory
O	of
O	all
O	those
O	long
O	winter
O	evenings
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	all
O	closed
O	round
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	roasted
O	chestnuts
O	or
O	crab-apples
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	howling
O	of
O	the
O	wind
O	and
O	the
O	deep
O	sound
O	of
O	the
O	church-bells
O	,
O	and
O	tried
O	very
O	much
O	to
O	make
O	each
O	other
O	believe
O	that
O	the
O	wolves
O	still
O	came
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	mountains
O	into
O	the
O	streets
O	of
O	Hall
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	that
O	very
O	minute
O	growling
O	at
O	the
O	house
O	door
O	--
O	all
O	this
O	memory
O	coming
O	on
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	bells
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	knowledge
O	that
O	night
O	drew
O	near
O	upon
O	him
O	so
O	completely
O	,
O	being
O	added
O	to
O	his
O	hunger
O	and
O	his
O	fear
O	,
O	so
O	overcame
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	burst
O	out
O	crying
O	for
O	the
O	fiftieth
O	time
O	since
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	inside
O	the
O	stove
O	,
O	and
O	felt
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	starve
O	to
O	death
O	,
O	and
O	wondered
O	dreamily
O	if
O	Hirschvogel
O	would
O	care
O	.
O	Yes
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	sure
O	Hirschvogel
O	would
O	care
O	.
O	Had
O	he
O	not
O	decked
O	it
O	all
O	summer
O	long
O	with
O	alpine
O	roses
O	and
O	edelweiss
O	and
O	heaths
O	and
O	made
O	it
O	sweet
O	with
O	thyme
O	and
O	honeysuckle
O	and
O	great
O	garden-lilies
O	?
O	Had
O	he
O	ever
O	forgotten
O	when
O	Santa
O	Claus
O	came
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	its
O	crown
O	of
O	holly
O	and
O	ivy
O	and
O	wreathe
O	it
O	all
O	around
O	?
O	``
O	Oh
O	,

O	me
O	;
O	save
O	me
O	;

O	care

O	me
O	!
O	``
O	he
O	prayed
O	to
O	the
O	old
O	fire-king
O	,
O	and
O	forgot
O	poor
O	little
O	man
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	on
O	this
O	wild-goose
O	chase
O	northward
O	to
O	save
O	and
O	take
O	care
O	of
O	Hirschvogel
O	!
O	After
O	a
O	time
O	he
O	dropped
O	asleep
O	,
O	as
O	children
O	can
O	do
O	when
O	they
O	weep
O	,
O	and
O	little
O	robust
O	hill-born
O	boys
O	most
O	surely
O	do
O	,
O	be
O	they
O	where
O	they
O	may
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	very
O	cold
O	in
O	this
O	lumber-room
O	;
O	it
O	was
O	tightly
O	shut
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	full
O	of
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	back
O	of
O	it
O	were
O	the
O	hot
O	pipes
O	of
O	an
O	adjacent
O	house
O	,
O	where
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	fuel
O	was
O	burnt
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	August
O	'
O	s
O	clothes
O	were
O	warm
O	ones
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	blood
O	was
O	young
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	cold
O	,
O	though
O	Munich
O	is
O	terribly
O	cold
O	in
O	the
O	nights
O	of
O	December
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	slept
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	--
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	comfort
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	forgot
O	his
O	woes
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	perils
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	hunger
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	.
O	Midnight
O	was
O	once
O	more
O	chiming
O	from
O	all
O	the
O	brazen
O	tongues
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	when
O	he
O	awoke
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	all
O	being
O	still
O	around
O	him
O	,
O	ventured
O	to
O	put
O	his
O	head
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	brass
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	stove
O	to
O	see
O	why
O	such
O	a
O	strange
O	bright
O	light
O	was
O	round
O	him
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	strange
O	and
O	brilliant
O	light
O	indeed
O	;
O	and
O	yet
O	,
O	what
O	is
O	perhaps
O	still
O	stranger
O	,
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	frighten
O	or
O	amaze
O	him
O	,
O	nor
O	did
O	what
O	he
O	saw
O	alarm
O	him
O	either
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	I
O	think
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	done
O	you
O	or
O	me
O	.
O	For
O	what
O	he
O	saw
O	was
O	nothing
O	less
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	_bric-à-brac_
O	in
O	motion
O	.
O	A
O	big
O	jug
O	,
O	an
O	Apostel-Krug
O	,
O	of
O	Kruessen
O	,
O	was
O	solemnly
O	dancing
O	a
O	minuet
O	with
O	a
O	plump
O	Faenza
O	jar
O	;
O	a
O	tall
O	Dutch
O	clock
O	was
O	going
O	through
O	a

O	with
O	a
O	spindle-legged

O	chair

O	a
O	very
O	droll
O	porcelain
O	figure
O	of
O	Zitzenhausen
O	was
O	bowing
O	to
O	a
O	very
O	stiff
O	soldier
O	in
O	_terre
O	cuite_
O	of
O	Ulm
O	;
O	an
O	old
O	violin
O	of
O	Cremona
O	was
O	playing
O	itself
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	queer
O	little
O	shrill
O	plaintive
O	music
O	that
O	thought
O	itself
O	merry
O	came
O	from
O	a
O	painted
O	spinet
O	covered
O	with
O	faded
O	roses
O	;
O	some
O	gilt
O	Spanish
O	leather
O	had
O	got
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	wall
O	and
O	laughed

O	a
O	Dresden
O	mirror
O	was
O	tripping
O	about
O	,
O	crowned
O	with
O	flowers
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	Japanese
O	bonze
O	was
O	riding
O	along
O	on
O	a
O	griffin
O	;
O	a
O	slim
O	Venetian

O	a

O	in
O	_grès

O	nobody

O	A

O	were
O	all
O	skipping

O	waltzing
O	;
O	the
O	teapots
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	broad
O	round
O	faces
O	,
O	were
O	spinning

O	lids
O	like

O	;
O	the
O	high-backed
O	gilded
O	chairs

O	poodle
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	blue
O	ribbon
O	at
O	its
O	throat
O	,
O	was
O	running
O	from

O	on
O	a

O	in

O	of

O	Meanwhile
O	the
O	brilliant
O	light
O	shed
O	on
O	the
O	scene
O	came
O	from
O	three
O	silver

O	,
O	what

O	miracle
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	August
O	looked
O	on

O	heard

O	felt
O	an

O	No

O	would
O	be
O	the
O	best
O	that
O	could
O	befall
O	us

O	they
O	are

O	and
O	even
O	the
O	perishable
O	labours
O	of
O	their
O	lives
O	outlive
O	them
O	.

O	feet

O	I
O	knew
O	that

O	become
O	my
O	lot

O	was

O	would
O	have
O	wished

O	was
O	content

O	Sometimes
O	a
O	tired

O	would
O	creep
O	up

O	smile

O	was

O	fruit

O	was
O	better

O	hall

O	great
O	city
O	,
O	cold
O	and
O	empty
O	,
O	even
O	though
O	wise
O	men
O	came
O	to
O	gaze
O	and
O	throngs
O	of
O	fools
O	gaped
O	,
O	passing
O	with
O	flattering
O	words
O	.
O	Where
O	I
O	go
O	now
O	I
O	know
O	not
O	;
O	but
O	since
O	I
O	go
O	from
O	that
O	humble
O	house
O	where
O	they
O	loved
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	shall
O	be
O	sad
O	and
O	alone
O	.
O	They
O	pass
O	so
O	soon
O	--
O	those
O	fleeting
O	mortal
O	lives
O	!
O	Only
O	we
O	endure
O	--
O	we
O	the
O	things
O	that
O	the
O	human
O	brain
O	creates
O	.
O	We
O	can
O	but
O	bless
O	them
O	a
O	little
O	as
O	they
O	glide
O	by
O	:
O	if
O	we
O	have
O	done
O	that
O	,
O	we
O	have
O	done
O	what
O	our
O	masters
O	wished
O	.
O	So
O	in
O	us
O	our
O	masters
O	,
O	being
O	dead
O	,
O	yet
O	may
O	speak
O	and
O	live
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	voice
O	sank
O	away
O	in

O	golden
O	light

O	her
O	side
O	.
O	He
O	rose
O	slowly
O	to
O	his
O	feet
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	very
O	cold
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	sensible
O	of
O	it
O	or
O	of
O	the
O	hunger
O	that
O	was
O	gnawing
O	his
O	little
O	empty
O	entrails
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	absorbed
O	in
O	the
O	wondrous
O	sight
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	wondrous
O	sounds
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	and
O	heard
O	.
O	All
O	was
O	dark
O	around
O	him
O	.
O	Was
O	it
O	still
O	midnight
O	or
O	had
O	morning
O	come
O	?
O	Morning
O	,
O	surely
O	;
O	for
O	against
O	the
O	barred
O	shutters
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	tiny
O	song
O	of
O	the
O	robin
O	.
O	Tramp
O	,
O	tramp
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	came
O	a
O	heavy
O	step
O	up
O	the
O	stair
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	but
O	a
O	moment
O	in
O	which
O	to
O	scramble
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	interior
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	stove
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	door
O	opened
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	dealers
O	entered
O	,
O	bringing
O	burning
O	candles
O	with
O	them
O	to
O	see
O	their
O	way
O	.
O	August
O	was
O	scarcely
O	conscious
O	of
O	danger
O	more
O	than
O	he
O	was
O	of
O	cold
O	or
O	hunger
O	.
O	A
O	marvellous
O	sense
O	of
O	courage
O	,
O	of
O	security
O	,
O	of
O	happiness
O	,
O	was
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	like
O	strong
O	and
O	gentle
O	arms
O	enfolding
O	him
O	and
O	lifting
O	him
O	upward
O	--
O	upward
O	--
O	upward
O	!
O	Hirschvogel
O	would
O	defend
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	dealers
O	undid
O	the
O	shutters
O	,
O	scaring
O	the
O	red-breast
O	away
O	;
O	and
O	then
O	tramped
O	about
O	in
O	their
O	heavy
O	boots
O	and
O	chatted
O	in
O	contented
O	voices
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	wrap
O	up
O	the
O	stove
O	once
O	more
O	in
O	all
O	its
O	straw
O	and
O	hay
O	and
O	cordage
O	.
O	It
O	never
O	once
O	occurred
O	to
O	them
O	to
O	glance
O	inside
O	.
O	Why
O	should
O	they
O	look
O	inside
O	a
O	stove
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	bought
O	and
O	were
O	about
O	to
O	sell
O	again
O	for
O	all
O	its
O	glorious
O	beauty
O	of
O	exterior
O	.
O	The
O	child
O	still
O	did
O	not
O	feel
O	afraid
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	exaltation
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	him
O	:
O	he
O	was
O	like
O	one
O	lifted
O	up
O	by
O	his
O	angels
O	.
O	Presently
O	the
O	two
O	traders
O	called
O	up
O	their
O	porters
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	stove
O	,
O	heedfully
O	swathed
O	and
O	wrapped
O	and
O	tended
O	as
O	though
O	it
O	were
O	some
O	sick
O	prince
O	going
O	on
O	a
O	journey
O	,
O	was
O	borne
O	on
O	the
O	shoulders
O	of
O	six
O	stout
O	Bavarians
O	down
O	the
O	stairs
O	and
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	door
O	into
O	the
O	Marienplatz
O	.
O	Even
O	behind
O	all
O	those
O	wrappings
O	August
O	felt
O	the
O	icy
O	bite
O	of
O	the
O	intense
O	cold
O	of
O	the
O	outer
O	air
O	at
O	dawn
O	of
O	a
O	winter
O	'
O	s
O	day
O	in
O	Munich
O	.
O	The
O	men
O	moved
O	the
O	stove
O	with
O	exceeding
O	gentleness
O	and
O	care
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	often
O	been
O	far
O	more
O	roughly
O	shaken
O	in
O	his
O	big
O	brothers
O	'
O	arms
O	than
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	journey
O	now
O	;
O	and
O	though
O	both
O	hunger
O	and
O	thirst
O	made
O	themselves
O	felt
O	,
O	being
O	foes
O	that
O	will
O	take
O	no
O	denial
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	still
O	in
O	that
O	state
O	of
O	nervous
O	exaltation
O	which
O	deadens
O	all
O	physical
O	suffering
O	and
O	is
O	at
O	once
O	a
O	cordial
O	and
O	an
O	opiate
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	heard
O	Hirschvogel
O	speak
O	;
O	that
O	was
O	enough
O	.
O	The
O	stout
O	carriers
O	tramped
O	through
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	six
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	Nürnberg
O	fire-castle
O	on
O	their
O	brawny
O	shoulders
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	right
O	across
O	Munich
O	to
O	the
O	railway-station
O	,
O	and
O	August
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	recognised
O	all
O	the
O	ugly
O	,
O	jangling
O	,
O	pounding
O	,
O	roaring
O	,
O	hissing
O	railway-noises
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	,
O	despite
O	his
O	courage
O	and
O	excitement
O	,
O	``
O	Will
O	it
O	be
O	a
O	_very_
O	long
O	journey
O	?
O	``
O	For
O	his
O	stomach
O	had
O	at
O	times
O	an
O	odd
O	sinking
O	sensation
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	head
O	often
O	felt
O	sadly
O	light
O	and
O	swimming
O	.
O	If
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	,
O	very
O	long
O	journey
O	he
O	felt
O	half
O	afraid
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	dead
O	or
O	something
O	bad
O	before
O	the
O	end
O	,
O	and
O	Hirschvogel
O	would
O	be
O	so
O	lonely

O	knew
O	that
O	;

O	he
O	heard
O	their
O	voices
O	.
O	The
O	train
O	glided
O	away
O	over
O	the
O	Bavarian
O	plain
O	southward
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	men

O	something
O	of
O	Berg
O	and
O	the
O	Wurm-See
O	,
O	but
O	their

O	and
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	make
O	out
O	what
O	these

O	after
O	a
O	very
O	long
O	time
O	he
O	lost
O	the
O	sense
O	of
O	the
O	fresh
O	icy
O	wind
O	blowing
O	on
O	his
O	face
O	through
O	the
O	brass-work
O	above
O	,
O	and
O	felt
O	by
O	their
O	movements
O	beneath
O	him
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	mounting
O	steps
O	or
O	stairs
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	different
O	voices
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	understand
O	what
O	was
O	being
O	said
O	.
O	He
O	felt
O	that
O	his
O	bearers
O	paused
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	then
O	moved
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	again
O	.
O	Their
O	feet
O	went
O	so
O	softly
O	he
O	thought
O	they
O	must
O	be
O	moving
O	on
O	carpet
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	felt
O	a
O	warm
O	air
O	come
O	to
O	him
O	he
O	concluded
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	some
O	heated
O	chambers
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	clever
O	little
O	fellow
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	put
O	two
O	and
O	two
O	together
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	hungry
O	and
O	so
O	thirsty
O	and
O	his
O	empty
O	stomach
O	felt
O	so
O	strangely
O	.
O	They
O	must
O	have
O	gone
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	,
O	through
O	some
O	very
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	rooms
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	walked
O	so
O	long
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	,
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	stove
O	was
O	set
O	down
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	happily
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	set
O	so
O	that
O	his
O	feet
O	were
O	downward
O	.
O	What
O	he
O	fancied
O	was
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	some
O	museum
O	,
O	like
O	that
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Innspruck
O	.
O	The
O	voices
O	he
O	heard
O	were
O	very
O	hushed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	steps
O	seemed
O	to
O	go
O	away
O	,
O	far
O	away
O	,
O	leaving
O	him
O	alone
O	with
O	Hirschvogel
O	.
O	He
O	dared
O	not
O	look
O	out
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	peeped
O	through
O	the
O	brass-work
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	was
O	a
O	big
O	carved
O	lion
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	in
O	ivory
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	gold
O	crown
O	atop
O	.
O	It
O	belonged
O	to
O	a
O	velvet
O	fauteuil
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	the
O	chair
O	,
O	only
O	the
O	ivory
O	lion
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	delicious
O	fragrance
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	--
O	a
O	fragrance
O	as
O	flowers
O	.
O	``
O	Only
O	how
O	can
O	it
O	be

O	From

O	off
O	,
O	as

O	seemed
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	dreamy
O	,
O	exquisite
O	music
O	,
O	as
O	sweet
O	as
O	the
O	spinet

O	s
O	had
O	been
O	,
O	but
O	so
O	much
O	fuller
O	,
O	so
O	much
O	richer
O	,
O	seeming
O	as
O	though
O	a
O	chorus
O	of
O	angels
O	were
O	singing
O	all
O	together
O	.
O	August
O	ceased
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	the
O	museum
O	;
O	he
O	thought

O	All
O	was
O	so
O	still
O	around
O	him
O	;

O	was
O	no
O	sound
O	anywhere
O	except
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	the
O	far-off
O	choral
O	music
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	know

O	,
O	and
O	the
O	music

O	heard
O	a

O	,
O	during

O	no

O	the

O	of
O	making
O	the
O	dealers
O	of
O	the
O	Marienplatz
O	disgorge
O	their
O	ill-gotten
O	gains
O	.
O	August
O	heard
O	,
O	and
O	felt
O	dazzled
O	yet
O	miserable
O	.
O	Two
O	thousand
O	gold
O	Bavarian
O	ducats
O	for
O	his
O	father
O	!
O	Why
O	,
O	his
O	father
O	would
O	never
O	need
O	to
O	go
O	any
O	more
O	to
O	the
O	salt-baking
O	!
O	And
O	yet
O	,
O	whether
O	for
O	ducats
O	or
O	for
O	florins
O	,
O	Hirschvogel
O	was
O	sold
O	just
O	the
O	same
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	the
O	king
O	let
O	him
O	stay
O	with
O	it
O	?
O	--
O	would
O	he
O	?
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	do
O	!
O	oh
O	,
O	please
O	do
O	!
O	``
O	he
O	murmured
O	,
O	joining
O	his
O	little
O	brown
O	weather-stained
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	kneeling
O	down
O	before
O	the
O	young
O	monarch
O	,
O	who
O	himself
O	stood
O	absorbed
O	in
O	painful
O	thought
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	deception
O	so
O	basely
O	practised
O	for
O	the
O	greedy
O	sake
O	of
O	gain
O	on
O	him
O	by
O	a
O	trusted
O	counsellor
O	was
O	bitter
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	child
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	so
O	smiled
O	once
O	more
O	.
O	``
O	Rise
O	up
O	,
O	my
O	little
O	man
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	kind
O	voice
O	;
O	``
O	kneel
O	only
O	to
O	your
O	God

O	I
O	let

O	Hirschvogel
O	?
O	Yes
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	,
O	you
O	shall
O	stay
O	at
O	my
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	you
O	shall
O	be
O	taught
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	painter
O	--
O	in
O	oils
O	or
O	on
O	porcelain
O	as
O	you
O	will
O	--
O	and
O	you
O	must
O	grow
O	up
O	worthily
O	,
O	and
O	win
O	all
O	the
O	laurels
O	at
O	our
O	Schools

O	,
O	and
O	if

O	you
O	are
O	twenty-one
O	years
O	old
O	you
O	have
O	done
O	well
O	and
O	bravely
O	,
O	then
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	you
O	your
O	Nürnberg

O	,
O	or
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	am
O	no
O	more
O	living
O	,
O	then
O	those
O	who
O	reign
O	after
O	me
O	shall
O	do
O	so
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	go
O	away
O	with
O	this
O	gentleman
O	,
O	and
O	be
O	not
O	afraid
O	,
O	and
O	you
O	shall
O	light
O	a
O	fire
O	every
O	morning
O	in
O	Hirschvogel
O	,
O	but
O	you
O	will
O	not
O	need
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	and
O	cut
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	he
O	smiled
O	and
O	stretched
O	out
O	his
O	hand
O	;
O	the
O	courtiers
O	tried
O	to
O	make
O	August
O	understand
O	that
O	he
O	ought
O	to
O	bow
O	and
O	touch
O	it
O	with
O	his
O	lips
O	,
O	but
O	August
O	could
O	not
O	understand
O	that
O	anyhow
O	;
O	he
O	was
O	too
O	happy
O	.
O	He
O	threw
O	his
O	two
O	arms
O	about
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	knees
O	,
O	and
O	kissed
O	his
O	feet
O	passionately
O	;
O	then
O	he
O	lost
O	all
O	sense
O	of
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	fainted
O	away
O	from
O	hunger
O	,
O	and
O	tire
O	,
O	and
O	emotion
O	,
O	and
O	wondrous
O	joy
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	darkness
O	of
O	his
O	swoon
O	closed
O	in
O	on
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	heard
O	in
O	his
O	fancy
O	the
O	voice
O	from
O	Hirschvogel
O	saying
O	:
O	``
O	Let
O	us
O	be
O	worthy
O	our
O	maker
O	!
O	``
O	He
O	is
O	only
O	a
O	scholar
O	yet
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	is
O	a
O	happy
O	scholar
O	,
O	and
O	promises
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	great
O	man
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	he
O	goes
O	back
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	to
O	Hall
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	gold
O	ducats
O	have
O	made
O	his
O	father
O	prosperous
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	old
O	house-room
O	there
O	is
O	a
O	large
O	white
O	porcelain
O	stove
O	of
O	Munich
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	gift
O	to
O	Dorothea
O	and
O	'
O	Gilda
O	.
O	And
O	August
O	never
O	goes
O	home
O	without
O	going
O	into
O	the
O	great
O	church
O	and
O	saying
O	his
O	thanks
O	to
O	God
O	,
O	who
O	blessed
O	his
O	strange
O	winter
O	'
O	s
O	journey
O	in
O	the
O	Nürnberg
O	stove
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	his
O	dream
O	in
O	the
O	dealers
O	'
O	room
O	that
O	night
O	,
O	he
O	will
O	never
O	admit
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	dream
O	it
O	;
O	he
O	still
O	declares
O	that
O	he
O	saw
O	it
O	all
O	and
O	heard
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	Hirschvogel
O	.
O	And
O	who
O	shall
O	say
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	?
O	for
O	what
O	is
O	the
O	gift
O	of
O	the
O	poet
O	and
O	the
O	artist
O	except
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	sights
O	which
O	others
O	can
O	not
O	see
O	and
O	to
