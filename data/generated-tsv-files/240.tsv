O	As

O	off
O	of
O	such
O	roots
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	dig
O	with
O	his
O	slender
O	hands
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	wandered
O	about
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	wherewithal
O	to
O	stay
O	his
O	hunger
O	,
O	he
O	often
O	looked
O	up
O	to
O	heaven
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	gray
O	clouds
O	going
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	he
O	looked
O	about
O	upon
O	the
O	wide
O	earth
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	never
O	saw
O	sister
O	nor
O	brother
O	returning
O	from
O	their
O	long
O	delay
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	even
O	the
O	roots
O	and
O	berries
O	gave
O	out
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	blighted
O	by
O	the
O	frost
O	or
O	hidden
O	out
O	of
O	reach
O	by
O	the

O	away

O	Sometimes
O	he
O	was
O	enforced
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	clefts
O	of
O	old
O	trees
O	or
O	caverns
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	break
O	his
O	fast
O	with
O	the
O	refuse
O	meals
O	of
O	the
O	savage
O	wolves
O	.
O	These
O	at
O	last
O	became
O	his
O	only
O	resource
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	grew
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	little
O	fearful
O	of
O	these
O	animals
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	sit
O	by
O	them
O	while
O	they
O	devoured
O	their
O	meat
O	,
O	and
O	patiently
O	await
O	his
O	share
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	the
O	wolves
O	took
O	to
O	little
O	Sheem
O	very
O	kindly
O	,
O	and
O	seeming
O	to
O	understand
O	his
O	outcast
O	condition
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	always
O	leave
O	something
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	eat
O	.
O	By
O	and
O	by
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	talk
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	inquire
O	into
O	his
O	history
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	told
O	them
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	forsaken
O	by
O	his
O	brother
O	and
O	his
O	sister
O	,
O	the
O	wolves
O	turned
O	about
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	lifted
O	up
O	their
O	eyes
O	to
O	heaven
O	,
O	and
O	wondered
O	among
O	themselves
O	,
O	with
O	raised
O	paws
O	,
O	that
O	such
O	a
O	thing
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	way
O	,
O	Sheem
O	lived
O	on
O	till
O	the
O	spring
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	lake
O	was
O	free
O	from
O	ice
O	,
O	he
O	followed
O	his
O	new

O	the
O	same
O	day
O	,
O	that
O	his
O	elder
O	brother
O	,
O	Owasso
O	,
O	was
O	fishing
O	in
O	his
O	magic
O	canoe
O	,
O	a
O	considerable
O	distance
O	out
O	upon
O	the
O	lake;
O	when

O	heard
O	the
O	cries

O	child
O	upon
O	the

O	.
O	He
O	wondered
O	how

O	could
O	exist
O	on
O	so
O	bleak
O	and

O	listened
