O	Then
O	,
O	with

O	out

O	,
O	he
O	spied
O	the

O	.
O	With
O	his
O	steel
O	finger
O	nails
O	the
O	hideous
O	fiend
O	seized
O	thirty
O	of
O	them
O	in

O	.
O	He
O	gave
O	yells
O	of

O	,
O	to

O	prey
O	.
O	When
O	the

O	awoke
O	,
O	they
O	raised
O	a
O	great
O	cry
O	of
O	sorrow
O	,
O	whilst
O	the
O	aged
O	King
O	himself
O	sat
O	speechless
O	with

O	None
O	could
O	do

O	,

O	was
O	too

O	,
O	too
O	horrible
O	for
O	any

O	to

O	For
O	twelve
O	long

O	Grendel
O	warred
O	against
O	Hrothgar;
O	like
O	a

O	full
O	of

O	,

O	light
O	,
O	calm

O	as
O	that
O	of

O	He
O	scanned
O	the
O	vast

O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	Grendel
O	lying
O	there
O	dead
O	.
O	He
O	cut
O	off
O	his

O	as
O	a

O	for

O	,
O	whose

O	the

O	killed
O	and

O	Now
O	those

O	on
O	the

O	of
O	the

O	watching
O	with
O	Hrothgar
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	water
O	was
O	tinged
O	with
O	blood
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	old
O	men
O	spoke
O	together
O	of
O	the
O	brave
O	Beowulf
O	,
O	saying
O	they
O	feared
O	they
O	would
O	never

O	The

O	King
O	went
O	homeward
O	.
O	Beowulf
O	'
O	s
O	men
O	stayed
O	on
O	,
O	sick
O	at
O	heart
O	,
O	gazing
O	at
O	the
O	pool
O	.
O	They
O	longed
O	,
O	but
O	did
O	not
O	expect
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	their
O	lord
O	and
O	master
O	.
O	Under
O	the
O	depths
O	,
O	Beowulf
O	was
O	making
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	magic
O	sword
O	melted
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	like
O	snow
O	in
O	sunshine;
O	only
O	the
O	hilt
O	remained
O	,
O	so
O	venomous
O	was
O	the
O	fiend
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	slain
O	therewith
O	.
O	He
O	brought
O	nothing
O	more
O	with
O	him
O	than
O	the
O	hilt
O	and
O	Grendel
O	'

O	.
O	Up
O	he
O	rose
O	through
O	the
O	waters
O	where
O	the
O	furious
O	sea-beasts
O	before

O	chased
O	him
O	.
O	Now
O	not

O	depths
O	were
O	purified
O	when
O	the

O	lost
O	her

O	.
O	So
O	he
O	came
O	to

O	,
O	bravely
O	swimming
O	,
O	bearing

O	His

O	rejoiced
O	to

O	,

O	Now

O	A

O	,
O	stumbled

O	an

O	into
O	the
O	den
O	of
O	a
O	dragon
O	.
O	There
O	he

O	gold
O	,
O	guarded
O	by
O	the
O	dragon
O	for
O	three
O	hundred
O	winters
O	.
O	The
O	treasure
O	tempted
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	carried
O	off
O	a
O	tankard

O	to
O	give
O	to
O	his

O	The

O	.
O	He

O	done
O	the
O	mischief
O	in

O	In
O	his

O	swung

O	now

O	He
O	found
O	it
O	hard
O	to
O	wait
O	until
O	evening
O	came
O	,
O	when

O	meant

O	Presently
O	the

O	set
O	forth
O	,
O	burning
