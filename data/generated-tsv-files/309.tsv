O	foretold
O	by

O	,
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	snared
O	by
O	a
O	greater

O	than
O	his
O	,

O	buried

O	beneath
O	the
O	great
O	stone
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	of
O	Broceliande
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	prophesied

O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,

O	But
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	little

O	,
O	they
O	would
O	become
O	proud
O	,
O	and
O	finding
O	that

O	,

O	sat

O	turning
O	to
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	old
O	British
O	pagans
O	,
O	some
O	of

O	still
O	lurked

O	The
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	heavy
O	as
O	he
O	sat
O	thinking
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	wondered
O	why
O	this
O	evil

O	entering
O	into
O	the

O	resolved

O	,

O	.
O	For
O	as
O	I
O	came
O	riding
O	hitherwards
O	this
O	morning
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	in
O	the
O	snow
O	where
O	a
O	hawk
O	had
O	torn
O	a
O	thrush
O	,

O	the
O	blood
O	lay
O	on

O	.
O	I
O	stopped
O	and

O	upon

O	,

O	the
O	blood
O	that
O	He
O	had
O	shed
O	upon
O	the
O	cruel
O	Cross
O	would

O	flat
O	of

O	.
O	I
O	turned
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	knight
O	,
O	who
O	asked
O	me
O	why
O	I
O	gaped
O	like
O	a
O	mooncalf
O	at
O	the
O	torn
O	bird
O	.
O	I
O	told

O	pleasure
O	so

O	pursue
O	my
O	thoughts
O	again
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	let
O	me
O	in
O	quiet
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	drew
O	my
O	sword
O	and
O	beat
O	him
O	in
O	my
O	anger
O	to
O	the

O	seven
O	nights
O	before
O	,
O	the
O	good
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	had
O	fared
O	forth
O	from
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	Arthur
O	to
O	seek
O	knightly
O	adventures
O	.
O	And
O	his
O	spirit
O	was
O	joyful
O	as
O	he
O	rode
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	felt
O	that
O	some
O	great
O	adventure
O	was
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	howbeit
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	why
O	he
O	felt
O	this
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	.
O	Northward
O	he
O	fared
O	through
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	snow
O	had
O	not
O	yet
O	fallen
O	,
O	but
O	so
O	mild
O	was
O	the
O	season
O	that
O	men
O	'
O	s
O	thoughts
O	had
O	stirred
O	towards
O	spring
O	.
O	For
O	many
O	days
O	he
O	journeyed
O	and
O	the
O	ways
O	were
O	more
O	lonely
O	,
O	the
O	country
O	more
O	desolate
O	,
O	the
O	rocky
O	hills
O	more
O	bare
O	.
O	He
O	wondered
O	why
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	the
O	land
O	seemed
O	so
O	forsaken
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	folk
O	had
O	long
O	since
O	left
O	the
O	fields
O	to
O	become
O	solitary
O	wastes
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	it
O	befell
O	that
O	one
O	evening
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	no
O	place
O	wherein
O	to
O	shelter
O	for
O	the
O	night;
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	hermit
O	'
O	s
O	cell
O	nor
O	castle
O	nor
O	knight
O	'
O	s
O	hold
O	through
O	all
O	the
O	way
O	by
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	that
O	day
O	.
O	Towards
O	twilight
O	he
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	wide
O	moor
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	cold
O	moon
O	peered
O	at
O	him
O	over
O	the
O	distant
O	mountains
O	.
O	Far
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	waste
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	pile
O	,
O	as
O	of
O	a
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	pricked
O	his
O	horse
O	towards
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	indeed
O	a
O	castle
O	,
O	but
O	its
O	walls
O	were
O	broken
O	and
O	mossy
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	long
O	years
O	had
O	passed
O	since
O	it
O	housed
O	fire
O	and
O	gay
O	company
O	.
O	He
O	rode
O	over
O	the
O	drawbridge
O	into
O	the
O	great
O	courtyard
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	echo
O	of
O	his
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	hoofbeats
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	sound
O	that
O	greeted
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	sought
O	the
O	upper
O	chambers
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	in
O	one
O	a
O	rough
O	bed
O	of
O	fern
O	leaves
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	supped
O	from
O	the
O	scrip
O	he
O	carried
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	composed
O	himself
O	to
O	sleep
O	,
O	glad
O	that
O	at
O	least
O	a
O	roof
O	and
O	thick
O	walls
O	shielded
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	freezing
O	cold
O	which
O	now
O	swept
O	over
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	Forthwith
O	he
O	slept;
O	but
O	at
O	midnight
O	he
O	awoke
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	was
O	deeply
O	dark
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	to
O	the
O	arrow
O	slit
O	in
O	the
O	wall
O	he
O	sought
O	some
O	friendly
O	star
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	looked
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	red
O	light
O	burst
O	through
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	that
O	there
O	came
O	,
O	thrusting
O	fiercely
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	spear
O	like
O	a
O	long
O	flame
O	,
O	which
O	darted
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	stayed
O	just
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	point
O	of
O	it
O	burned
O	blue
O	and
O	dazzling
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	lay
O	marvelling
O	,
O	the
O	spear
O	went
O	back
O	a
O	space;
O	then
O	he
O	grasped
O	his
O	sword
O	that
O	lay
O	beside
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	before
O	he
O	could
O	defend
O	himself
O	the
O	flaming
O	spear
O	dashed
O	forward
O	again
O	and
O	smote
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	shoulder
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	spear
O	went
O	back
O	and
O	the
O	chamber
O	was
O	deep
O	dark
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	very
O	pain
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	lay
O	and
O	groaned
O	.
O	Nor
O	could
O	he
O	sleep
O	more
O	that
O	night
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	dawn
O	he
O	arose
O	,
O	thinking
O	to
O	ride
O	forth
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	went
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	courtyard
O	to
O	saddle
O	his
O	horse
O	in
O	the
O	stable
O	,
O	he
O	marvelled
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	where
O	there
O	had
O	been
O	an
O	open
O	ruined
O	gateway
O	the
O	night
O	before
O	,
O	was
O	now
O	a
O	great
O	black
O	oaken
O	door
O	,
O	spiked
O	and
O	bolted
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	he
O	essayed
O	by
O	every
O	means
O	to
O	get
O	himself
O	out
O	of
O	that
O	castle
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	a
O	way
O	.
O	Yet
O	never
O	did
O	he
O	hear
O	or
O	see
O	aught
O	that
O	showed
O	that
O	any
O	one
O	lived
O	there
O	.
O	Many
O	times
O	he
O	went
O	throughout
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	but
O	never
O	found
O	aught
O	but
O	ruin
O	and
O	emptiness
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dust
O	and
O	darkness
O	of
O	long
O	neglect
O	everywhere
O	.
O	When
O	three
O	days
O	had
O	gone
O	,
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	was
O	faint
O	with
O	the
O	pain
O	of
O	his
O	wound
O	and
O	the
O	hunger
O	with
O	which
O	he
O	suffered
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	sat
O	beside
O	his
O	horse
O	in
O	its
O	stall
O	,
O	he
O	suddenly
O	heard
O	the
O	clank
O	of
O	armour
O	,
O	and
O	going
O	forth
O	into
O	the
O	courtyard
O	saw
O	a
O	knight
O	all
O	armed
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	shield
O	on
O	his
O	shoulder
O	and
O	his
O	sword
O	naked
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	Without
O	a
O	word
O	the
O	stranger
O	darted
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	hardly
O	did
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	have
O	time
O	to
O	dress
O	his
O	shield;
O	and
O	then
O	they
O	lashed
O	mightily
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	thrust
O	and
O	hewed
O	sorely
O	.
O	Thus
O	for
O	half
O	the
O	day
O	they
O	fought
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	fiercely
O	that
O	soon
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	had
O	many
O	wounds
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	blood
O	oozed
O	from
O	the
O	joints
O	of
O	his
O	armour
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	other
O	knight
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	unharmed
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	seemed
O	to
O	breathe
O	heavily
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	became
O	extremely
O	wroth
O	,
O	and
O	beat
O	so
O	fiercely
O	upon
O	the
O	other
O	that
O	he
O	pressed
O	him
O	always
O	backward
O	until
O	the
O	stranger
O	was
O	nigh
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	a
O	chamber
O	which
O	opened
O	into
O	the
O	courtyard;
O	and
O	suddenly
O	he
O	dashed
O	backwards
O	into
O	the
O	chamber
O	and
O	shut
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	Nor
O	would
O	he
O	come
O	forth
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	that
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	called
O	him
O	coward
O	and
O	recreant
O	.
O	Nor
O	would
O	he
O	answer
O	one
O	word
O	,
O	nor
O	had
O	he
O	said
O	one
O	word
O	since
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	had
O	seen
O	him
O	.
O	After
O	some
O	time
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	back
O	and
O	rest
O	himself
O	beside
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	great
O	wounds
O	burned
O	him
O	sorely;
O	but
O	as
O	he
O	turned
O	,
O	suddenly
O	,
O	without
O	a
O	sound
O	,
O	the
O	stranger
O	knight
O	dashed
O	forth
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	a
O	felon
O	blow
O	at
O	the
O	good
O	knight
O	'
O	s
O	neck
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	was
O	aware
O	of
O	him
O	in
O	time
O	and
O	defended
O	himself
O	full
O	well
O	.
O	So
O	fiercely
O	did
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	lay
O	on
O	,
O	that
O	soon
O	the
O	other
O	was
O	beaten
O	to
O	his
O	knees
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	good
O	knight
O	rushed
O	at
O	him
O	to
O	hurl
O	him
O	headlong
O	and
O	to
O	slay
O	him
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	the
O	other
O	knight
O	seemed
O	to
O	fall
O	together
O	as
O	if
O	dead;
O	but
O	the
O	armour
O	sounded
O	hollow
O	as
O	it
O	fell
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	marvelled
O	.
O	Swiftly
O	he
O	hacked
O	the
O	fastenings
O	of
O	the
O	helm
O	and
O	tore
O	it
O	from
O	the
O	neck
O	armour
O	.
O	Then
O	a
O	great
O	fear
O	seized
O	and
O	shook
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	armour
O	was
O	empty
O	!
O	He
O	knew
O	then
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	fought
O	with
O	a
O	demon
O	.
O	He
O	crossed
O	himself
O	and
O	prayed
O	,
O	and
O	weak
O	with
O	deadly
O	fear
O	and
O	his
O	wounds
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	stall
O	and
O	sat
O	beside
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	marvelled
O	how
O	he
O	could
O	win
O	with
O	life
O	from
O	the
O	fell
O	power
O	that
O	seemed
O	to
O	hold
O	him
O	prisoner
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	from
O	a
O	dark
O	cavernous
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	dungeons
O	,
O	came
O	a
O	great
O	boar
O	,
O	with
O	curving
O	tusks
O	keen
O	as
O	sword-blades
O	,
O	and
O	rushed
O	at
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	full
O	fiercely
O	.
O	Hardily
O	did
O	the
O	knight
O	defend
O	himself
O	from
O	the
O	strength
O	and
O	the
O	fierce
O	rushes
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	beast
O	.
O	The
O	boar
O	with
O	its
O	long
O	tusks
O	tore
O	the
O	shield
O	from
O	the
O	grasp
O	of
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	,
O	and
O	slashed
O	his
O	shield
O	arm
O	sorely
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	was
O	wroth
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	very
O	fierce
O	blow
O	he
O	smote
O	off
O	the
O	boar
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	.
O	Immediately
O	thereupon
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	pain
O	of
O	his
O	many
O	wounds
O	and
O	the
O	weakness
O	of
O	his
O	famine
O	,
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	fainted
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	upon
O	the
O	frozen
O	snow
O	as
O	one
O	dead
O	.
O	For
O	long
O	he
O	stayed
O	thus
O	ere
O	he
O	revived
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	rose
O	and
O	dragged
O	himself
O	into
O	the
O	stall
O	where
O	lay
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	half
O	dead
O	with
O	hunger
O	,
O	before
O	an
O	empty
O	manger
O	.
O	All
O	that
O	night
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	lay
O	in
O	a
O	sad
O	pass
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	now
O	he
O	would
O	never
O	see
O	dawn
O	again
O	in
O	life
O	.
O	He
O	prayed
O	and
O	commended
O	his
O	soul
O	to
O	God
O	,
O	and
O	confessed
O	his
O	sins
O	and
O	prepared
O	himself
O	for
O	death
O	as
O	behoved
O	a
O	good
O	knight;
O	and
O	thereafter
O	he
O	slept
O	sweetly
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	dawn
O	he
O	awoke
O	,
O	exceeding
O	hungry
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	forth
O	into
O	the
O	court
O	he
O	had
O	it
O	in
O	his
O	mind
O	to
O	carve
O	meat
O	from
O	the
O	dead
O	boar
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	was
O	astounded
O	beyond
O	measure
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	there
O	.
O	In
O	its
O	place
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	trencher
O	of
O	steaming
O	hot
O	collops
O	of
O	meat
O	,
O	and
O	toasted
O	bread
O	,
O	with
O	hot
O	milk
O	in
O	great
O	plenty
O	.
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	ran
O	towards
O	the
O	food
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	ravenous
O	was
O	his
O	hunger
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	devoured
O	it
O	instantly
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	bethought
O	him
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	placed
O	any
O	of
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	lips
O	,
O	and
O	dropping
O	it
O	he
O	crossed
O	himself
O	and
O	ran
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	stall
O	and
O	tried
O	not
O	to
O	look
O	forth
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	food
O	was
O	placed
O	there
O	by
O	some
O	fell
O	fiend
O	or
O	demon
O	to
O	tempt
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	he
O	ate
O	of
O	that
O	unholy
O	food
O	,
O	his
O	soul
O	would
O	be
O	for
O	ever
O	lost
O	.
O	Anon
O	sweet
O	voices
O	sounded
O	in
O	the
O	courtyard
O	as
O	if
O	to
O	attract
O	him
O	forth
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	smell
O	of
O	the
O	hot
O	food
O	was
O	wafted
O	strongly
O	into
O	the
O	stable
O	.
O	The
O	fiends
O	themselves
O	could
O	not
O	enter
O	,
O	for
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	horse-shoe
O	hung
O	in
O	the
O	proper
O	way
O	upon
O	the
O	lintel
O	of
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	moreover
O	,
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	had
O	stuck
O	his
O	sword-point
O	in
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	holy
O	sign
O	of
O	the
O	cross
O	prevented
O	the
O	evil
O	things
O	from
O	crossing
O	the
O	threshold
O	.
O	All
O	that
O	day
O	did
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	lie
O	half
O	dying
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	fiends
O	tempted
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	knight
O	was
O	too
O	strong
O	and
O	manful
O	of
O	soul
O	to
O	yield
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	liefer
O	die
O	than
O	become
O	the
O	slave
O	of
O	the
O	powers
O	of
O	the
O	Netherworld
O	.
O	Then
O	in
O	the
O	twilight
O	he
O	commended
O	his
O	soul
O	to
O	God
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	felt
O	near
O	to
O	death
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	finished
O	his
O	prayer
O	,
O	he
O	heard
O	great
O	and
O	horrible
O	cries
O	in
O	the
O	court
O	as
O	of
O	rage
O	and
O	disappointment
O	.
O	Then
O	came
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	stable
O	,
O	white
O	of
O	hair
O	and
O	very
O	reverend;
O	and
O	he
O	came
O	and
O	put
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	'
O	head
O	and
O	spoke
O	mildly
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	'
O	Good
O	and
O	faithful
O	knight
O	,
O	sorely
O	tried
O	have
O	ye
O	been
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	you
O	shall
O	have
O	no
O	more
O	adventures
O	here
O	.
O	Full
O	worshipfully
O	have
O	ye
O	done
O	and
O	better
O	shall
O	ye
O	do
O	hereafter
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	your
O	wounds
O	shall
O	be
O	healed
O	and
O	ye
O	shall
O	have
O	good
O	cheer
O	until
O	to-morrow
O	.
O	'
O	Therewith
O	there
O	was
O	all
O	manner
O	of
O	sweetness
O	and
O	savour
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	saw
O	as
O	in
O	a
O	mist
O	a
O	shining
O	vessel
O	borne
O	by
O	a
O	wondrous
O	maiden
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	Holy
O	Graal;
O	and
O	he
O	bowed
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	forthwith
O	he
O	was
O	whole
O	of
O	his
O	wounds
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morrow
O	he
O	departed
O	after
O	a
O	night
O	'
O	s
O	sweet
O	sleep
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	to
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	court
O	and
O	told
O	of
O	his
O	adventures
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	fellowship
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	were
O	passing
O	glad
O	to
O	see
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	whole
O	and
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	made
O	much
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	felt
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	do
O	things
O	of
O	great
O	renown
O	.
O	Then
O	at
O	the
O	feast
O	of
O	Pentecost
O	went
O	all
O	the
O	court
O	to
O	the
O	minster
O	to
O	hear
O	their
O	service;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	the
O	king
O	ordered
O	that
O	dinner
O	should
O	be
O	prepared
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	,
O	for
O	this
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	days
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	wont
O	to
O	assemble
O	all
O	his
O	knights
O	at
O	a
O	great
O	feast
O	of
O	knighthood
O	.
O	While
O	they
O	waited
O	for
O	the
O	horn
O	to
O	sound
O	,
O	warning
O	them
O	that

O	meal
O	was

O	,
O	one
O	came
O	running
O	to

O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	a
O	thing
O	of
O	marvel
O	had
O	happened
O	.
O	And
O	Arthur
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	hall
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	with
O	his
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	in
O	the
O	seats
O	about
O	the
O	great
O	circular
O	board
O	they
O	found
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	written
O	,

O	said

O	dared
O	to

O	dead
O	by
O	a
O	sudden
O	flashing
O	blow
O	of

O	All
O	the

O	marvelled

O	'
O	It
O	was
O	seen
O	that
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	Siege
O	Perilous
O	was

O	Then
O	the

O	was
O	sounded
O	to

O	,
O	and

O	took

O	should
O	happen
O	that
O	day

O	suddenly
O	a

O	without

O	He
O	set
O	the

O	upon

O	before
O	him
O	,

O	she

O	Sadly
O	did
O	that

O	Swiftly
O	Sir

O	made
O	his

O	to

O	forward
O	,

O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while

O	All
O	turned
O	at
O	the
O	cry
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	seeing
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	knight
O	Sir
O	Hewlin
O	threw
O	down
O	his
O	sword
O	.
O	And
O	leaping
O	from
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	the
O	reverend
O	lady

O	the
O	two

O	.

O	he
O	received
O	upon

O	snapped
O	in
O	twain;

O	The

O	he
O	set
O	forth
O	to

O	Sir

O	s
O	bidding
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	the
O	stainless
O	knight
O	had
O	foretold
O	,
O	for
O	in
O	seven
O	days
O	Sir
O	Nulloth
O	had
O	found
O	death
O	,
O	bravely
O	fighting
O	the
O	pagan
O	pirates
O	.
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	went
O	forward
O	,
O	sore
O	of
O	heart
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	such
O	evil
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	and
O	in
O	men
O	'
O	s
O	minds
O	,
O	that
O	any
O	could
O	be
O	found
O	to
O	wish
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	a
O	brother
O	and
O	to
O	care
O	naught
O	for
O	the
O	sorrow
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	mother
O	.
O	Thus
O	for
O	many
O	months
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	rode
O	about
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	seeking
O	out
O	the
O	knights
O	who
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	bands
O	of
O	soldiers
O	,
O	fought
O	to
O	wrest
O	from
O	each
O	other
O	land
O	and
O	castles
O	.
O	And
O	ever
O	he
O	strove
O	to
O	make
O	peace
O	between
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	show
O	them
O	how
O	,
O	while
O	they
O	fought
O	with
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	Christian
O	against
O	Christian
O	,
O	the
O	pagan
O	hordes
O	were
O	let
O	unhindered
O	into
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	ravening
O	,
O	burning
O	,
O	and
O	slaying
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	battling
O	knights
O	did
O	forsake
O	their
O	evil
O	ways
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	and
O	Sir
O	Uriens
O	,
O	with
O	whom
O	they
O	strove
O	to
O	push
O	back
O	the
O	fierce
O	pagans
O	into
O	their
O	long
O	black
O	ships
O	.
O	But
O	many
O	others
O	,
O	so
O	lost
O	to
O	honour
O	and
O	knightliness
O	were
O	they
O	,
O	performed
O	not
O	their
O	promises
O	,
O	and
O	continued
O	to
O	fight
O	each
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	So
O	fierce
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	fighting
O	through
O	all
O	that
O	land
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	peasants
O	forsook
O	the
O	fields
O	and
O	hid
O	themselves;
O	and
O	the
O	pagans
O	from
O	the
O	northern
O	wilderness
O	came
O	over
O	the
O	walls
O	and
O	wandered
O	,
O	killing
O	and
O	burning
O	and
O	robbing
O	.
O	And
O	thus
O	in
O	many
O	parts
O	the
O	crops
O	were
O	not
O	sown
O	or
O	reaped
O	,
O	the
O	wheat
O	stood
O	unharvested
O	and
O	wild
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	grass
O	and
O	weeds
O	grew
O	tall
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	hearths
O	of
O	the
O	poor
O	peasants
O	and
O	husbandmen
O	.
O	The
O	heart
O	of
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	grew
O	sick
O	,
O	seeing
O	the
O	evil
O	which
O	was
O	come
O	into
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	feared
O	that
O	soon
O	the
O	Holy
O	Graal
O	would
O	be
O	taken
O	from
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	Britain
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	then
O	ruin
O	would
O	stalk
O	throughout
O	the
O	length
O	and
O	breadth
O	of
O	the
O	realm
O	.
O	Once
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	dawning
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	looked
O	from
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	hermitage
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	passed
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	aware
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	company
O	of
O	men
O	coming
O	over
O	the
O	moor
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	all
O	horsed
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	going
O	towards
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	right
O	hand
O	,
O	where
O	steep
O	and
O	fearful
O	cliffs
O	fell
O	sheer
O	to
O	the
O	thundering
O	surf
O	beneath
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	their
O	midst
O	he
O	saw
O	they
O	held
O	captive
O	a
O	full
O	noble
O	knight
O	,
O	who
O	seemed
O	wounded
O	,
O	and
O	whose
O	armour
O	was
O	all
O	broken
O	and
O	cracked
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	fought
O	valiantly
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	overcome
O	.
O	Him
O	they
O	were
O	going
O	to
O	hurl
O	headlong
O	down
O	the
O	cliffs
O	.
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	began
O	to
O	arm
O	himself
O	full
O	hastily
O	to
O	meet
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	he
O	dressed
O	his
O	armour
O	he
O	was
O	aware
O	of
O	a
O	knight
O	coming
O	swiftly
O	from
O	a
O	little
O	wood
O	that
O	lay
O	towards
O	the
O	sea-edge
O	.
O	Then
O	was
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	exceeding
O	joyful
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	knight
O	was
O	all
O	in
O	white
O	armour
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	on
O	his
O	shield
O	was
O	the
O	device
O	of
O	a
O	heart;
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	Sir
O	Perceval
O	.
O	Sir
O	Perceval
O	spurred
O	towards
O	the
O	band
O	of
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	called
O	on
O	them
O	to
O	release
O	their
O	captive
O	.
O	'

O	by
O	this

O	then
O	the
O	spear
O	broke
O	.
O	Therewith

O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	,

O	seven
O	that
O	were
O	fighting
O	Sir
O	Perceval
O	.
O	So
O	valiantly
O	and
O	hardily
O	did
O	the
O	three
O	knights
O	lay
O	about
O	them
O	that
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	their
O	enemies
O	had
O	fled
O	,
O	leaving
O	more
O	than
O	half
O	their
O	number
O	slain
O	.
O	Then
O	did
O	the
O	three
O	knights
O	make
O	great
O	cheer
O	and
O	welcome
O	of
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	each
O	their
O	adventures
O	,
O	and
O	promised
O	that
O	now
O	they
O	were
O	together
O	they
O	would
O	never
O	more
O	part
O	till
O	death
O	should
O	summon
O	them
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	together
O	,
O	they
O	fared
O	thereafter
O	many
O	months
O	,
O	doing
O	noble
O	deeds
O	,
O	and
O	seeking
O	earnestly
O	to
O	bring
O	men
O	'
O	s
O	hearts
O	to
O	turn
O	to
O	friendship
O	and
O	union
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	united
O	,
O	the
O	lords
O	of
O	the
O	northern
O	lands
O	should
O	turn
O	upon
O	the
O	pagans
O	and
O	destroy
O	them
O	utterly
O	.
O	It
O	befell
O	that
O	,
O	on
O	a
O	morn
O	,
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	castle
O	on
O	a
O	great
O	cliff
O	that
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	marches
O	of
O	Scotland;
O	and
O	they
O	heard
O	a
O	horn
O	sound
O	in
O	that
O	castle
O	and
O	much
O	shouting
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	walls
O	thereof
O	were
O	men
O	of
O	a
O	savage
O	aspect
O	,
O	peering
O	and
O	looking
O	down
O	at
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	those
O	men
O	had
O	fair
O	hair
O	,
O	with
O	steel
O	helms
O	which
O	had
O	great
O	horns
O	or
O	wings
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	On
O	their
O	tall
O	bodies
O	were
O	leather
O	jerkins
O	,
O	with
O	gold
O	chains
O	and
O	many
O	ornaments
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	and
O	his
O	friends
O	were
O	aware
O	that
O	on
O	the
O	topmost
O	pinnacle
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	was
O	a
O	banner
O	,
O	floating
O	and
O	flapping
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	wind
O	.
O	Black
O	was
O	that
O	banner
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	midmost
O	part
O	thereof
O	was
O	a
O	golden
O	raven
O	,
O	with
O	beaks
O	open
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	croaked
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	wings
O	were
O	wide
O	thrown
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	flew
O	over
O	a
O	field
O	of
O	slain
O	men
O	.
O	They
O	knew
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	a
O	horde
O	of
O	pagans
O	who
O	had
O	wrested
O	this
O	castle
O	from
O	its
O	rightful
O	lord
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	full
O	fierce
O	would
O	be
O	the
O	battle
O	.
O	Then
O	from
O	a
O	hole
O	or
O	cave
O	beneath
O	a
O	tree
O	near
O	by
O	came
O	a
O	maiden
O	,
O	richly
O	dressed
O	,
O	but
O	sad
O	and
O	pitiable
O	of
O	face
O	and
O	thin
O	of
O	form
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	from
O	long
O	pining
O	.
O	'
O	Fair

O	'

O	But
O	three
O	nights
O	ago

O	certain
O	knights
O	with
O	a
O	horde
O	of

O	When

O	rushed
O	upon
O	my
O	father

O	my
O	nurse
O	dragged
O	me
O	away

O	Then
O	,
O	glancing
O	at
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	portcullis

O	,
O	and
O	some

O	rush
O	forth
O	,
O	with

O	besides
O	on
O	foot
O	.

O	dread
O	is
O	on
O	me
O	for
O	your
O	deaths
O	,
O	brave
O	knights
O	.
O	'
O	Full
O	wrathful
O	were
O	the
O	three
O	good
O	knights
O	to
O	hear
O	the
O	girl
O	'
O	s
O	sad
O	tale
O	,
O	and
O	hard
O	was
O	their
O	rage
O	to
O	hear
O	that
O	Christian
O	knights
O	had
O	leagued
O	themselves
O	with
O	the
O	heathen
O	Saxons
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	get
O	their
O	aid
O	in
O	a
O	private
O	quarrel
O	with
O	the
O	Earl
O	Hernox
O	.
O	Therefore
O	,
O	very
O	joyously
O	did
O	Galahad
O	and
O	Perceval
O	leap
O	forward
O	,
O	lances
O	in
O	rest
O	,
O	against
O	the
O	traitorous
O	knights
O	that
O	rushed
O	towards
O	them
O	from
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	Marvellous
O	indeed
O	was
O	it
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	deeds
O	of
O	those
O	three
O	stainless
O	knights
O	that
O	day;
O	for
O	when
O	their
O	lances
O	were
O	broken
O	,
O	they
O	drew
O	their
O	swords
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	wrath
O	,
O	their
O	fierceness
O	and
O	their
O	valour
O	,
O	none
O	could
O	withstand
O	.
O	While
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	smote
O	with
O	deadly
O	blows
O	the
O	pagans
O	that
O	swarmed
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	and
O	Sir
O	Perceval
O	dealt
O	death
O	among
O	the
O	traitorous
O	knights
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	not
O	one
O	was
O	left
O	alive
O	.
O	And
O	seeing
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	fair-haired
O	fierce
O	pagans
O	lost
O	heart
O	.
O	Turning
O	,
O	they
O	wished
O	to
O	flee
O	into
O	the
O	castle
O	and
O	pull
O	down
O	the
O	portcullis
O	.
O	But
O	swiftly
O	on
O	their
O	heels
O	dashed
O	the
O	three
O	brave
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	pagans
O	,
O	never
O	stopping
O	,
O	heard
O	the
O	hoofs
O	of
O	their
O	horses
O	thunder
O	over
O	the
O	drawbridge
O	close
O	behind
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	horde
O	of
O	Saxons
O	took
O	flight
O	into
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	they
O	stood
O	and
O	got
O	breath
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	knights
O	,
O	leaping
O	from
O	their
O	horses
O	,
O	rushed
O	in
O	on
O	foot
O	,
O	and
O	back
O	to
O	back
O	they
O	met
O	the
O	onslaught
O	of
O	the
O	yelling
O	heathens
O	.
O	Very
O	fierce
O	was
O	the
O	anger
O	in
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	the
O	three
O	knights
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	stayed
O	not
O	their
O	hands
O	even
O	when
O	the
O	pirates
O	gave
O	way
O	and
O	fled
O	from
O	the
O	dreadful
O	place
O	of
O	slaughter
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	knights
O	pursued
O	them
O	wheresoever
O	they
O	tried
O	to
O	hide
O	,
O	and
O	hither
O	and
O	thither
O	about
O	the
O	castle
O	they
O	ran
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	the
O	chambers
O	,
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	stairs
O	,
O	until
O	for
O	very
O	weariness
O	they
O	had
O	perforce
O	to
O	cease
O	.
O	Then
O	when
O	they
O	beheld
O	the
O	great
O	multitude
O	of
O	pagans
O	they
O	had
O	slain
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	sobered
O	and
O	sad
O	,
O	thinking
O	themselves
O	great
O	sinners
O	.
O	'
O	Certes
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	,
O	'
O	I
O	ween
O	that

O	willed
O	that

O	great

O	,

O	said
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	,
O	'

O	little
O	children
O	through
O	this
O	fair
O	land
O	of

O	.
O	But
O	I
O	doubt
O	we
O	have
O	been
O	mad

O	little
O	while
O	to
O	slay
O	so
O	many
O	mothers

O	as

O	'
O	Then
O	from
O	out
O	a
O	secret
O	chamber
O	came
O	a
O	priest
O	,
O	white
O	with
O	great
O	age
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	countenance
O	that
O	shone
O	marvellously
O	bright;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	how
O	many
O	were
O	slain
O	in
O	that
O	hall
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	abashed
O	.
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	put
O	off
O	his
O	helm
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	three
O	kneeled
O	down
O	and
O	confessed
O	the
O	madness
O	of
O	their
O	sin
O	which
O	had
O	slain
O	even

O	said
O	the
O	priest
O	,
O	when

O	had
O	absolved
O	them;
O	'
O	for
O	the

O	well
O	cleansed
O	and
O	fresh
O	rushes
O	laid
O	along
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	the
O	three
O	knights
O	sat
O	on
O	a
O	bench
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Earl
O	Hernox
O	and
O	the
O	maid
O	Issyllt
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	much
O	cheer
O	and
O	rejoicing
O	between
O	them
O	all
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	old
O	priest
O	called
O	the
O	earl
O	and
O	his
O	daughter
O	from
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	three
O	knights
O	together
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	sat
O	talking
O	,
O	the
O	doors
O	were
O	shut
O	and
O	the
O	windows
O	were
O	darkened
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	wind
O	arose
O	with
O	a
O	sad
O	sound
O	,
O	wailing
O	and
O	piping
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	darkness
O	suddenly
O	went
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	light
O	shining
O	in
O	the
O	midmost
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	so
O	bright
O	and
O	strong
O	that
O	hardly
O	could
O	their
O	eyes
O	suffer
O	it
O	.
O	Soon
O	through
O	the
O	light
O	they
O	could
O	see
O	a
O	table
O	of
O	silver
O	,
O	whereon
O	was
O	a
O	wide
O	dish
O	also
O	of
O	silver
O	,
O	marvellously
O	and
O	delicately
O	wrought
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	doors
O	opened
O	and
O	they
O	saw
O	angels
O	entering;
O	and
O	two
O	bare
O	candles
O	of
O	wax
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	third
O	held
O	a
O	towel
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	hand
O	of
O	the
O	fourth
O	was
O	a
O	spear
O	which
O	bled
O	marvellously
O	from
O	the
O	point
O	thereof
O	.
O	Going
O	to
O	the
O	table
O	the
O	angels
O	set
O	the
O	candles
O	and
O	the
O	towel
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	spear
O	was
O	placed
O	beside
O	the
O	shining
O	vessel
O	.
O	Of
O	a
O	sudden
O	the
O	knights
O	were
O	aware
O	that
O	there
O	sat
O	one
O	beside
O	the
O	table
O	who
O	was
O	marvellously
O	old
O	and
O	white;
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	dressed
O	in
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	a
O	bishop
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	face
O	was
O	very
O	winning
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	brightness
O	flowed
O	from
O	it
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	breast
O	of
O	his
O	robe
O	were
O	words
O	in
O	the
O	Latin
O	tongue
O	,
O	which
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	Lo
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	Joseph
O	,
O	the
O	first
O	bishop
O	of
O	Christendom
O	,
O	who
O	did
O	take
O	our
O	Lord
O	'
O	s
O	body
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	cruel
O	rood
O	.
O	'
O	The
O	three
O	marvelled
O	greatly
O	,
O	for
O	that
O	bishop
O	had
O	been
O	dead
O	more
O	than
O	four
O	hundred
O	years
O	.
O	Seeing
O	their
O	looks
O	of
O	perplexity
O	,
O	the
O	bishop
O	smiled
O	sweetly
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	'
O	Marvel
O	not
O	,
O	O
O	knights
O	,
O	for
O	though
O	I
O	am
O	now
O	a
O	spirit
O	,
O	I
O	know
O	thy
O	weakness
O	,
O	and
O	have
O	come
O	to
O	aid
O	thee
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	the
O	bishop
O	took
O	up
O	the
O	shining
O	vessel
O	from
O	the
O	table
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	Galahad;
O	and
O	the
O	knight
O	kneeled
O	down
O	and
O	took
O	of
O	the
O	food
O	that
O	was
O	within
O	the
O	holy
O	dish
O	.
O	And
O	after
O	that
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	received
O	it
O	.
O	Of
O	marvellous
O	savour
O	was
O	the
O	food
O	,
O	and
O	like
O	none
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	ever
O	eaten
O	or
O	thought
O	of
O	at
O	any
O	time
O	before
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	bishop
O	said
O	to
O	Galahad
O	:
O	'
O	Son
O	,
O	knowest
O	thou
O	what

O	'
O	Nay

O	,

O	Galahad
O	.
O	'

O	Sangreal

O	out
O	of
O	which
O	our
O	Lord
O	ate
O	the
O	lamb
O	at
O	the
O	feast
O	before
O	He
O	was

O	to
O	that
O	death
O	upon
O	the
O	rood
O	whereby
O	He
O	redeemed
O	the
O	world
O	,

O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	it

O	,
O	no
O	others
O	in
O	this
O	realm
O	shall
O	ever
O	see

O	said
O	the
O	bishop;
O	and
O	his
O	countenance
O	,
O	which
O	before
O	had
O	been
O	sweet
O	and
O	gentle
O	,
O	now
O	saddened
O	and
O	was
O	dark
O	.
O	'

O	given
O	up

O	again
O	?
O	'
O	'
O	It
O	must
O	be
O	so
O	,

O	said
O	the
O	bishop
O	sadly
O	.
O	'
O	Christ

O	not
O	served
O	in
O	gentleness
O	,
O	nor
O	is
O	His
O	law
O	worshipped
O	in
O	this
O	land
O	,
O	where
O	men
O	slay
O	their

O	,
O	rob
O	their
O	kindred
O	,

O	.

O	are
O	turned
O	to
O	evil
O	livers
O	,
O	desiring
O	mastery
O	and
O	proud
O	power
O	.
O	Therefore
O	hath
O	Christ
O	sent
O	me
O	to
O	disinherit
O	this
O	land
O	of
O	this
O	holy
O	thing
O	with
O	which
O	He
O	hath
O	honoured
O	it
O	since
O	that
O	time

O	it
O	here
O	four
O	hundred
O	and
O	fifty-five
O	winters
O	ago
O	.
O	'
O	Hearing
O	these
O	words
O	of
O	doom
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	and
O	Sir
O	Perceval
O	wept
O	full
O	piteously
O	for
O	the
O	fate
O	of
O	their
O	country
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	mourned
O	greatly
O	,
O	they
O	asked

O	from
O	its

O	.
O	'
O	There
O	is

O	said
O	the
O	bishop
O	sorrowfully
O	.
O	'
O	Have
O	ye

O	two

O	,

O	stalk
O	through
O	the
O	land
O	,

O	naught
O	shall
O	stand
O	of
O	its
O	present
O	kingdoms;
O	the
O	pagans
O	shall
O	blot
O	out
O	the
O	holy
O	memory
O	of
O	God
O	and
O	Christ
O	,
O	and
O	shall
O	turn
O	the
O	fanes
O	of
O	prayer
O	into
O	the
O	lairs
O	of
O	wolves
O	,

O	shall
O	rest
O	where
O	hymns

O	may
O	hinder
O	these
O	things

O	dreadful
O	doom

O	still
O	find
O	in
O	your
O	heart
O	the
O	love

O	a
O	longing
O	for

O	'
O	Suddenly
O	a
O	fierce
O	light
O	came
O	where
O	they
O	sat
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	kneeled
O	as
O	one
O	blinded
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	had
O	passed
O	,
O	he
O	looked
O	and
O	saw
O	where
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	and
O	Sir
O	Perceval
O	still
O	kneeled
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	hands
O	lifted
O	as
O	if
O	in
O	prayer
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	naught
O	to
O	see
O	of
O	the
O	holy
O	vessel
O	or
O	the
O	spear
O	,
O	nor
O	was
O	Joseph

O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	going
O	to
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	dead
O	.
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	knew
O	then
O	that
O	their
O	souls
O	had
O	gone
O	with
O	Joseph
O	and
O	the
O	holy
O	vessel
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	been
O	borne
O	to
O	the
O	heaven
O	for
O	which
O	their
O	pure
O	and
O	humble
O	hearts
O	had
O	yearned
O	while
O	yet
O	they
O	lived
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	made
O	great
O	sorrow
O	for
O	his
O	two
O	fellows
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	that
O	never
O	more
O	would
O	he
O	be
O	as
O	joyful
O	or
O	as
O	careless
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	.
O	With
O	right
O	heavy
O	mood
O	he
O	craved
O	of
O	Earl
O	Hernox
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	grave
O	dug
O	deep
O	in
O	the
O	living
O	rock
O	whereon
O	the
O	castle
O	was
O	builded
O	.
O	This
O	the
O	earl
O	gladly
O	did
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	solemnly
O	the
O	two
O	good
O	knights
O	were
O	buried
O	,
O	and
O	long
O	did
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	mourn
O	over
O	the
O	grave
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	thereafter
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	armed
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	departed
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	many
O	adventures
O	,
O	rode
O	southwards
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	Camelot
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	he
O	told
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	such
O	knights
O	as
O	there
O	were
O	,
O	how
O	the
O	two
O	stainless
O	knights
O	had
O	achieved
O	the
O	Holy
O	Graal
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	their
O	souls
O	had
O	been
O	taken
O	up
O	with
O	the
O	sacred
O	vessel
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	court
O	mourned
O	for
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	commanded
O	a
O	history
O	to
O	be
O	written
O	of
O	what
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	had
O	told
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	so
O	done
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	book
O	richly
O	adorned
O	with
O	many
O	coloured
O	letters
O	,
O	was
O	kept
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	treasure-chest
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	Sarum
O	.
O	Ever
O	after
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	was
O	a
O	silent
O	man
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	forget

O	and

O	Of
O	the

O	which
O	was
O	coming

O	due

O	upon
O	the
O	dear

O	XI
O	OF
O	THE
O	PLOTS
O	OF
O	SIR
O	MORDRED;
O	AND
O	HOW
O	SIR
O	LANCELOT
O	SAVED
O	THE
O	QUEEN
O	After
O	the
O	quest
O	of
O	the
O	Sangreal
O	was
O	completed
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	that
O	were
O	left
O	alive
O	had
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	great
O	joy
O	among
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	Queen
O	Gwenevere
O	were
O	passing
O	glad
O	of
O	the
O	remnant
O	that
O	had
O	come
O	home
O	again
O	.
O	Especially
O	did
O	the
O	queen
O	make
O	much
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	of
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	his
O	cousin
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	the
O	two
O	most
O	noble
O	and
O	courteous
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	,
O	and
O	none
O	thought
O	of
O	them
O	but
O	as
O	men
O	peerless
O	and
O	beyond
O	compare
O	.
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	nephew
O	,
O	was
O	jealous
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	about
O	privily
O	among
O	such
O	knights
O	as
O	were
O	his
O	familiars
O	,
O	and
O	spoke
O	sneering
O	words
O	concerning
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	and
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	.
O	Once
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	said
O	such
O	words
O	in
O	the
O	hearing
O	of
O	his
O	brother
O	Sir
O	Gawaine;
O	but
O	that
O	knight
O	so
O	heavily
O	and
O	wrathfully
O	took
O	him
O	to
O	task
O	,
O	that
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	knew
O	that
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	envied
O	not
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	never
O	be
O	brought
O	to
O	think
O	other
O	than
O	friendly
O	thoughts
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	Therefore
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	hated
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	more
O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	Of
O	a
O	slight
O	frame
O	was
O	Mordred
O	,
O	but
O	tall
O	,
O	with
O	dark
O	hair
O	,
O	sallow
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	deep-set
O	grey
O	eyes
O	beside
O	a
O	thin
O	long
O	nose
O	.
O	Few
O	loved
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	never
O	cheery
O	nor
O	very
O	friendly
O	,
O	and
O	ever
O	seemed
O	to
O	sneer
O	with
O	his
O	thin
O	lips
O	and
O	his
O	cold
O	wolfish
O	eyes
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	strange
O	dark
O	rumours
O	began
O	to
O	go
O	about
O	the
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	whispered
O	that
O	so
O	proud
O	had
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	become
O	of
O	his
O	fame
O	and
O	prowess
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	harboured
O	evil
O	thoughts
O	against
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	aimed
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	kingdom
O	for
O	himself
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	countries
O	that
O	lay
O	about
O	his
O	own
O	lands
O	of
O	Joyous
O	Gard
O	in
O	the
O	northern
O	marches
O	.
O	Then
O	fresh
O	rumours
O	went
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	these
O	were
O	the
O	most
O	evil
O	of
O	all
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	sought
O	to
O	slay
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	wished
O	to
O	make
O	Gwenevere
O	his
O	own
O	queen
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	her
O	he
O	would
O	rule
O	over
O	all
O	Britain
O	.
O	First
O	,
O	men
O	laughed
O	and
O	passed
O	the
O	rumours
O	with
O	a
O	shrug
O	and
O	a
O	gesture
O	of
O	scorn;
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	repeated
O	again
O	and
O	again
O	,
O	some
O	began
O	half
O	to
O	believe
O	them
O	.
O	Many
O	said
O	that
O	there
O	must
O	be
O	some
O	truth
O	therein
O	,
O	for
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	was
O	ever
O	wending
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	north
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	fought
O	there
O	many
O	battles
O	and
O	overcame
O	many
O	knights
O	.
O	But
O	others
O	said
O	this
O	was
O	because
O	many
O	ladies
O	and
O	damsels
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	lost
O	lands
O	and
O	homes
O	and
O	been
O	evilly
O	oppressed
O	by
O	the
O	warring
O	barons
O	in
O	those
O	parts
O	,
O	had
O	heard
O	of
O	his
O	great
O	fame
O	for
O	knightly
O	deeds
O	and
O	noble
O	manners
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	beseeching
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	their
O	champion
O	against
O	those
O	who
O	had
O	robbed
O	them
O	.
O	Others
O	said
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	but
O	natural
O	that
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	court
O	he
O	should
O	speak
O	much
O	to
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	from
O	the
O	first
O	vowed
O	himself
O	to
O	be
O	her
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	deeds
O	of
O	daring
O	and
O	prowess
O	had
O	he
O	done
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	Yet
O	others
O	there
O	were
O	who
O	believed
O	that
O	what
O	rumour
O	said
O	might
O	be
O	true;
O	and
O	others
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	good
O	and
O	noble
O	knights
O	,
O	sorrowed
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	such
O	evil
O	thoughts
O	should
O	be
O	spread
O	about
O	by
O	some
O	treacherous
O	tongues
O	.
O	When
O	men
O	came
O	to
O	ask
O	who
O	had
O	set
O	these
O	evil
O	tongues
O	to
O	wag
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	always
O	found
O	that
O	a
O	certain
O	mean
O	knight
O	,
O	named
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	,
O	had
O	first
O	spoken
O	wrong
O	of
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	.
O	And
O	men
O	noticed
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	the
O	queen
O	began
O	to
O	look
O	coldly
O	at
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	they
O	knew
O	that
O	his
O	rumours
O	had
O	reached
O	her
O	ears
O	.
O	'
O	What
O	profit
O	doth
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	think
O	to
O	gain
O	from
O	those
O	false
O	tales
O	of
O	her
O	?
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Brastias
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	and
O	Sir
O	Gareth
O	came
O	from
O	the
O	hawking
O	together
O	.
O	'
O	For
O	none
O	ever
O	reckoned
O	him
O	as
O	a
O	knight
O	of
O	any
O	merit
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	good
O	men
O	will
O	now
O	think
O	less
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	I
O	fear
O	me
O	,

O	said
O	Sir
O	Gareth
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	there
O	is
O	more
O	beneath
O	it
O	all
O	than
O	we
O	wot
O	of
O	.
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	is
O	a
O	bosom
O	friend
O	of
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	'

O	.
O	Often
O	have
O	I
O	seen
O	their
O	heads
O	together
O	in
O	places
O	apart
O	.
O	And
O	though
O	he
O	is
O	my
O	brother
O	,
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	is
O	one
O	I
O	cannot
O	love
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	What
O	fear
O	you
O	,
O	Gareth
O	?
O	'
O	asked
O	Sir
O	Brastias
O	.
O	'
O	I
O	fear
O	naught
O	that
O	he
O	may
O	do
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Gareth
O	,
O	'
O	but
O	I
O	think
O	he
O	hates
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	he
O	hates
O	Gawaine
O	also
O	,
O	the
O	chief
O	of
O	our
O	party
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	hath
O	roundly
O	told
O	Mordred
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	a
O	traitor
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	will
O	not
O	be
O	drawn
O	from
O	his
O	firm
O	friendship
O	with
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	his
O	kinsmen
O	.
O	I
O	think
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	would
O	do
O	much
O	to
O	cause
O	some
O	ill
O	to
O	Gawaine
O	or
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	so
O	long
O	as
O	his
O	own
O	evil
O	body
O	was
O	not
O	hurt
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Sad
O	it
O	is
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Brastias
O	full
O	gloomily
O	,
O	'
O	to
O	think
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	such
O	great
O	kin
O	should
O	harbour
O	hatred
O	and
O	murder
O	against
O	the
O	chief
O	of
O	his
O	kin
O	.
O	And
O	that
O	such
O	should
O	be
O	,
O	methinks
O	,
O	betokens
O	that
O	evil
O	is
O	about
O	to
O	fall
O	upon
O	our
O	famous
O	brotherhood
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	this
O	dear
O	land
O	of
O	Britain
O	.
O	'
O	Now
O	it
O	befell
O	that
O	the
O	poor
O	queen
O	had
O	heard
O	,
O	through
O	her
O	maidens
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	rumours
O	concerning
O	herself
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	taking
O	counsel
O	of
O	no
O	one
O	,
O	she
O	bethought
O	how
O	she
O	could
O	prove
O	to
O	the
O	remnant
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	free
O	of
O	any
O	plots
O	against
O	the
O	king
O	or
O	the
O	fair
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Britain
O	.
O	She
O	resolved
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	invite
O	the
O	knights
O	to
O	a
O	privy
O	dinner
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	eaten
O	she
O	would
O	throw
O	herself
O	upon
O	their
O	knightly
O	pity
O	and
O	honour
O	,
O	telling
O	them
O	how
O	the
O	evil
O	rumours
O	wronged
O	and
O	hurt
O	her
O	bitterly
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	doubted
O	not
O	that
O	thus
O	their
O	manly
O	sympathy
O	and
O	worship
O	of
O	her
O	,
O	their
O	queen
O	,
O	would
O	,
O	by
O	her
O	words
O	,
O	cast
O	out
O	the
O	evil
O	effects
O	of
O	the
O	slanderous
O	tales
O	.
O	Therefore
O	,
O	at
O	that
O	dinner
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	and
O	his
O	brethren
O	,
O	that
O	is
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gareth
O	,
O	Sir
O	Agravaine
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gaheris
O	and
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	.
O	Also
O	there
O	were
O	the
O	kin
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	to
O	wit
O	,
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	,
O	Sir
O	Blamore
O	,
O	Sir
O	Bleobaris
O	,
O	Sir
O	Ector
O	de
O	Maris
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lionel
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	had
O	gone
O	into
O	the
O	Scottish
O	marches
O	,
O	to
O	do
O	battle
O	with
O	a
O	notable
O	robber
O	and
O	oppressor
O	there
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	other
O	knights
O	,
O	making
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	twenty-four
O	.
O	And
O	these
O	were
O	all
O	the
O	remnant
O	of
O	the
O	one
O	hundred
O	and
O	fifty
O	that
O	had
O	gone
O	forth
O	in
O	the
O	Quest
O	of
O	the
O	Sangreal
O	.
O	Among
O	the
O	guests
O	were
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	and
O	his
O	cousin
O	,
O	Sir
O	Mador
O	.
O	Now
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	had
O	a
O	custom
O	of
O	eating
O	apples
O	which
O	he
O	used
O	daily
O	at
O	dinner
O	and
O	at
O	supper
O	.
O	He
O	loved
O	all
O	manner
O	of
O	fruit
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	especial
O	a
O	certain
O	brown
O	or
O	russet
O	apple
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	called
O	Afal
O	Coch
O	.
O	Every
O	one
O	knew
O	of
O	this
O	fondness
O	of
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	and
O	whoever
O	dined
O	or
O	feasted
O	him
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	provide
O	such
O	apples
O	for
O	his
O	pleasure
O	.
O	The
O	queen
O	had
O	known
O	this
O	,
O	and
O	among
O	the
O	fruit
O	for
O	the
O	table
O	she
O	had
O	ordered
O	such
O	apples
O	to
O	be
O	placed
O	.
O	Now
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	,
O	as
O	Sir
O	Gareth
O	had
O	suspected
O	,
O	hated
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	with
O	a
O	deep
O	hatred
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	he
O	had
O	,
O	by
O	crafty
O	dealing
O	,
O	taken
O	all
O	the
O	russet
O	apples
O	from
O	the
O	dish
O	except
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	into
O	this
O	he
O	had
O	thrust
O	a
O	deadly
O	poison
O	.
O	He
O	guessed
O	that
O	,
O	as
O	every
O	one
O	knew
O	of
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	'
O	s
O	fondness
O	for
O	that
O	sort
O	of
O	fruit
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	would
O	take
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	would
O	leave
O	it
O	for
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	who
O	would
O	eat
O	it
O	and
O	die
O	thereof
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	feast
O	was
O	near
O	an
O	end
O	,
O	and
O	men
O	laughed
O	and
O	jested
O	together
O	,
O	the
O	dish
O	of
O	fruit
O	was
O	handed
O	round
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	,
O	the
O	mean
O	knight
O	,
O	noticed
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	but
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	apples
O	which
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	loved;
O	and
O	to
O	spite
O	that
O	knight
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	hated
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	that
O	apple
O	,
O	ere
O	the
O	dish
O	went
O	to
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	.
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	saw
O	him
O	take
O	it
O	,
O	yet
O	would
O	not
O	cry
O	out
O	to
O	warn
O	his
O	fellow-traitor
O	,
O	for
O	this
O	would
O	have
O	revealed
O	himself
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	'
O	s
O	teeth
O	sink
O	into
O	the
O	brown
O	apple
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	'
O	s
O	sneering
O	look
O	as
O	he
O	glanced
O	across
O	at
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	searching
O	vainly
O	in
O	the
O	dish
O	for
O	his
O	favourite
O	fruit
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	saw
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	'
O	s
O	face
O	go
O	red
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	deadly
O	white
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	the
O	poison
O	gripped
O	him
O	,
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	rose
O	shrieking
O	from
O	the
O	table
O	,
O	crying
O	out
O	that
O	some
O	enemy
O	had
O	poisoned
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	sank
O	writhing
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	shrieking
O	and
O	moaning
O	,
O	clutching
O	at
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	legs
O	of
O	the
O	chairs
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	groan
O	,
O	he
O	lay
O	still
O	and
O	was
O	dead
O	.
O	Every
O	knight
O	leaped
O	from
O	the
O	table
O	,
O	ashamed
O	,
O	full
O	of
O	rage
O	and
O	fear
O	,
O	nigh
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	wits
O	,
O	but
O	dumb
O	.
O	They
O	looked
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	and
O	then
O	at
O	the
O	dead
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	their
O	eyes
O	kept
O	from
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	where
O	she
O	sat
O	on
O	the
O	high
O	seat
O	,
O	with
O	two
O	of
O	her
O	ladies
O	beside
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	reason
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	speak
O	was
O	that
O	they
O	knew
O	the
O	queen
O	had
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	evil
O	tales
O	which
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	had
O	spread
O	about
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	she
O	must
O	have
O	hated
O	him
O	bitterly
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	had
O	made
O	this
O	feast
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	invited
O	him
O	thereto
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	he
O	was
O	dead
O	at
O	the
O	board
O	,
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	deadly
O	poison
O	placed
O	in
O	the
O	food
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	set
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	for
O	very
O	shame
O	some
O	began
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	chamber;
O	and
O	others
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	to
O	look
O	upon
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	who
O	sat
O	with
O	a
O	face
O	that
O	went
O	now
O	pale
O	,
O	now
O	red
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	seen
O	what
O	happened
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	it
O	was
O	had
O	been
O	slain
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	had
O	read
O	the
O	suspicion
O	in
O	men
O	'
O	s
O	gestures
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	Sir
O	Mador
O	rang
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	checked
O	men
O	from
O	going
O	from
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	all
O	eyes
O	to
O	where
O	he
O	stood
O	,
O	a
O	tall
O	and
O	burly
O	man
O	,
O	red
O	and
O	angry
O	of
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	fierce
O	of
O	eyes
O	.
O	'
O	Look
O	!
O	'
O	he
O	cried
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	between
O	his
O	fingers
O	and
O	high
O	above
O	his
O	head
O	the
O	apple
O	which
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	had
O	bitten
O	,
O	'
O	this
O	is
O	the
O	thing
O	whereof
O	my
O	kinsman
O	,
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	,
O	hath
O	lost
O	his
O	life
O	.
O	The
O	matter
O	shall
O	not
O	end
O	here
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	have
O	lost
O	a
O	noble
O	knight
O	of
O	my
O	blood
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	be
O	revenged
O	to
O	the
O	uttermost
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	,
O	turning
O	,
O	he
O	savagely
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	fierce
O	rolling
O	eyes
O	he
O	roared
O	out
O	:
O	'
O	Thou
O	art
O	the
O	murderess
O	!
O	Thou--the
O	queen
O	!
O	Hear
O	me
O	,
O	knights
O	and
O	chieftains
O	.
O	I
O	charge
O	the
O	queen
O	with
O	the
O	murder
O	of
O	my
O	kinsman
O	,
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	,
O	and
O	justice
O	upon
O	her
O	will
O	I
O	have
O	.
O	'
O	Every
O	one
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	stood
O	still
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	of
O	stone
O	.
O	None
O	could
O	gainsay
O	him
O	,
O	none
O	could
O	utter
O	a
O	word
O	on
O	behalf
O	of
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	had
O	suspicion
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	slain
O	Sir
O	Pinel
O	for
O	his
O	slanders
O	of
O	her
O	.
O	Then
O	suddenly
O	the
O	queen
O	rose
O	,
O	white
O	and
O	trembling
O	.
O	'
O	My
O	lords
O	and
O	knights
O	,
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	cause
O	it

O	'
O	she
O	cried
O	in
O	a
O	broken
O	voice
O	.
O	'
O	I

O	'
O	And
O	therewith
O	she
O	fell
O	down
O	in
O	a
O	swoon
O	.
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	'
O	s
O	pale
O	face
O	smiled
O	with
O	a
O	bitter
O	sneer
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	not
O	then
O	whether
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	would
O	help
O	his
O	evil
O	plots
O	or
O	no;
O	but
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	say
O	naught
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	went
O	out
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	other
O	silent
O	knights
O	,
O	whilst
O	the
O	ladies
O	of
O	the
O	queen
O	took
O	her
O	up
O	lamenting
O	,
O	and
O	bore
O	her
O	to
O	her
O	chamber
O	.
O	With
O	the
O	noise
O	and
O	the
O	sorrow
O	that
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	court
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	came
O	and
O	craved
O	to
O	know
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter;
O	but
O	none
O	of
O	the
O	silent
O	knights
O	would
O	speak
O	until
O	he
O	met
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	who
O	replied
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	'
O	Sir

O	.
O	'
O	King

O	was
O	passing
O	heavy
O	at
O	the
O	hearing
O	of

O	went
O	unto

O	to
O	comfort

O	.
O	On
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	,

O	the
O	king
O	sat
O	in
O	hall
O	with

O	laughing
O	and
O	jesting
O	talk
O	,
O	as
O	was
O	usual
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	.
O	Sir
O	Mador
O	came
O	forward
O	and
O	charged
O	the
O	queen
O	of
O	murder
O	,
O	and
O	required
O	that

O	heard
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	sad
O	face
O	and
O	in
O	silence
O	.
O	Then
O	he

O	turned
O	to

O	The

O	strode
O	up

O	rushed
O	from

O	to
O	the
O	gentle
O	persuasions

O	but
O	one
O	thing
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	first
O	:
O	that
O	ye
O	knightly
O	rescue
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	if
O	your
O	enemies
O	force
O	the
O	king
O	to
O	put
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	stake
O	.
O	For
O	if
O	she
O	be
O	burnt
O	,
O	then
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	to
O	your
O	shame
O	,
O	seeing
O	that
O	you
O	vowed
O	yourself
O	her
O	true
O	knight
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	,
O	a
O	young
O	fair
O	bride
O	,
O	to
O	our
O	king
O	,
O	twenty
O	years
O	agone
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	whatsoever
O	way
O	ye
O	would
O	rescue
O	her
O	,
O	ye
O	may
O	count
O	upon
O	us
O	to
O	our
O	last
O	breath
O	.
O	'
O	With
O	a
O	great
O	shout
O	all
O	the
O	other
O	knights
O	raised
O	their
O	right
O	hands
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	and
O	cried
O	:
O	'
O	Yea
O	!
O	yea
O	!
O	'
O	Then
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	advice
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	they
O	kept
O	hidden
O	in
O	the
O	little
O	wood
O	,
O	while
O	one
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	city
O	to
O	learn
O	what
O	was
O	being
O	done
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	what
O	manner
O	the
O	queen
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	treated
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	men
O	sat
O	or
O	stood
O	with
O	anxious
O	looks
O	,
O	glancing
O	in
O	silence
O	at
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	walked
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	apart
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	stern
O	look
O	on
O	his
O	face
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Mador
O	strode
O	forward
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	'
O	Lord
O	,
O	I

O	you
O	to

O	me
O	,
O	to
O	wit
O	,
O	that

O	What
O	I

O	said
O	the
O	king;
O	and
O	men
O	sorrowed
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	heavy
O	of
O	anguish
O	were
O	his
O	looks
O	,
O	and
O	full
O	of
O	sorrow
O	his
O	words
O	.
O	'

O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	,

O	Then
O	came
O	Sir

O	forward
O	quickly
O	,
O	and
O	his

O	dark

O	This

O	did
O	not
O	doubt
O	that
O	if
O	Sir

O	came
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	little
O	trouble
O	to
O	persuade
O	the

O	that
O	he
O	was
O	innocent
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	messenger
O	was
O	gone
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	sent
O	a
O	servant
O	after

O	,
O	who
O	slew
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	wood

O	a
O	bush

O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	counselled
O	Sir
O	Mador
O	to
O	repeat
O	his
O	demand
O	that

O	to
O	fight
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	time
O	the
O	king
O	put
O	him
O	off
O	,
O	hoping
O	that
O	as

O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	ran
O	upon
O	him
O	when

O	gave
O	his
O	message
O	and

O	sadly
O	.
O	The

O	suffered
O	would
O	have
O	softened
O	any
O	ordinary

O	the
O	murderer
O	was
O	a
O	hard
O	and
O	callous
O	wretch
O	,

O	sorrowfully

O	Very

O	night

O	day

O	,
O	innocent

O	she
O	knew
O	she

O	.
O	Her
O	ladies

O	in
O	her
O	meanest

O	.
O	Then
O	arose
O	a

O	,

O	lined
O	each
O	side
O	of
O	the

O	streets
O	.
O	Many
O	were
O	the

O	praying
O	God
O	to

O	to

O	so
O	sweet
O	a
O	lady

O	in
O	bands
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	their
O	stout
O	young
O	hearts
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	rage
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	in
O	their
O	minds
O	to
O	dash
O	upon
O	the
O	guard
O	of
O	armoured
O	knights

O	sticks
O	would
O	be
O	against
O	the
O	keen
O	blades
O	of
O	swords
O	.
O	So
O	stricken
O	with
O	horror
O	were
O	all
O	those
O	that
O	looked
O	on
O	that
O	they
O	noticed
O	not
O	how
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	queen
O	and
O	her
O	guard
O	issued
O	from
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	a
O	man
O	in
O	the
O	coarse
O	dress
O	of
O	a
O	peasant
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	standing
O	in
O	the
O	crowd
O	,
O	strode
O	swiftly
O	away
O	down
O	a
O	narrow
O	lane
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	vaulted
O	,
O	with
O	an
O	unpeasant-like
O	deftness
O	,
O	upon
O	a
O	good
O	steed
O	that
O	stood
O	in
O	the
O	charge

O	striking
O	spurs
O	in
O	the
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	flanks
O	,
O	he
O	dashed
O	away
O	madly
O	along
O	the
O	streets

O	through
O	the
O	northern
O	gate
O	into
O	the
O	fields

O	the
O	sorrowing
O	people
O	,
O	with
O	women
O	crying
O	and
O	men
O	muttering
O	and
O	looking
O	darkly
O	at
O	the

O	was
O	a
O	stake
O	.
O	To
O	this
O	she
O	was
O	fastened
O	with
O	a
O	rope
O	,
O	and
O	faggots
O	of
O	wood
O	were
O	piled
O	about
O	her
O	feet
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	knees
O	.
O	Near
O	her
O	stood
O	the
O	priest
O	of
O	her
O	household
O	,
O	trying
O	to
O	cheer
O	her
O	with
O	comforting
O	words;
O	but
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	pale
O	and
O	without
O	tears
O	,
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	dazed
O	and
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	hear
O	him
O	.
O	A
O	hundred
O	knights
O	ranged
O	themselves
O	behind
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	some
O	on
O	horseback
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	most
O	on
O	foot
O	.
O	Many
O	of

O	followed
O	the
O	example

O	Sir
O	Gaheris
O	and

O	without

O	Then
O	Sir
O	Gaheris
O	called
O	upon

O	and
O	that

O	eagerly
O	up

O	down
O	the
O	lists
O	to
O	see

O	to
O	do
O	battle
O	for
O	the
O	innocence
O	of
O	the
O	queen
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	looked
O	to
O	where

O	,
O	pale

O	still
O	,

O	heart
O	already
O	rejoiced
O	to

O	would
O	surely

O	A
O	great
O	stillness

O	,

O	the
O	white
O	figure

O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	faggots

O	.
O	With
O	the
O	sound

O	threw
O	up
O	his

O	turned
O	to

O	men
O	heard
O	a
O	strange
O	throbbing
O	sound
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	from
O	a
O	distance;
O	then
O	quickly
O	it

O	what
O	it
O	meant
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	great
O	gate
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	lists
O	dashed
O	knights
O	in
O	armour
O	,
O	on
O	horses
O	whose
O	foam-flecked
O	trappings
O	showed
O	at
O	what
O	a
O	speed
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	them
O	rode
O	a
O	great
O	knight;
O	and
O	as
O	men
O	caught
O	the
O	device
O	upon
O	his
O	shield
O	a
O	great
O	roar
O	of
O	gladness
O	burst
O	from
O	the
O	throats
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	while
O	women
O	sobbed
O	for
O	joy
O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	!
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	to
O	the
O	rescue
O	!
O	'
O	was
O	the
O	cry
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	knights
O	entered
O	,
O	Sir
O	Mador
O	'
O	s
O	quick
O	commands
O	sounded
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	knights
O	about
O	him
O	ran
O	forward
O	and
O	surrounded
O	the
O	queen
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	barely
O	reached
O	the
O	place
O	when
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	crashing
O	sound
O	,
O	the
O	party
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	was
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	Many
O	of
O	Sir
O	Mador
O	'
O	s
O	people
O	were
O	at
O	once
O	thrown
O	headlong
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	by
O	the
O	force
O	of
O	the
O	shock;
O	but
O	the
O	others
O	fought
O	fiercely
O	.
O	This
O	way
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	battle
O	swayed;
O	Sir
O	Mador
O	trying
O	to
O	thrust
O	the
O	others
O	from
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	'
O	s
O	kinsmen
O	striving
O	to
O	reach
O	the
O	queen
O	.
O	All
O	was
O	in
O	confusion;
O	the
O	knights
O	on
O	foot
O	were
O	mingled
O	with
O	those
O	on
O	horseback
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	were
O	cut
O	down
O	who
O	did
O	not
O	bear
O	arms
O	.
O	Full
O	of
O	a
O	mad
O	wrath
O	was
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	raged
O	among
O	the
O	knights
O	that
O	stood
O	about
O	the
O	faggots;
O	nor
O	could
O	any
O	withstand
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	blind
O	was
O	he
O	in
O	his
O	fury
O	that
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	whom
O	he
O	slew
O	,
O	except
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	men
O	who
O	stood
O	between
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	by
O	great
O	mischance
O	,
O	at
O	this
O	rushing
O	and
O	hurtling
O	,
O	he
O	slew
O	two
O	knights
O	and
O	knew
O	not
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	unarmed
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	of
O	those
O	he
O	loved
O	most
O	.
O	One
O	was
O	Sir
O	Gareth
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	himself
O	knighted
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	was
O	Sir
O	Gaheris
O	.
O	In
O	very
O	truth
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	knew
O	them
O	not;
O	and
O	afterwards
O	they
O	were
O	found
O	dead
O	where
O	the
O	corpses
O	lay
O	thickest
O	.
O	Short
O	but
O	very
O	fierce
O	was
O	that
O	battle
O	,
O	for
O	none
O	could
O	long
O	withstand
O	the
O	fury
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	his
O	kinsmen
O	.
O	Many
O	were
O	slain
O	on
O	both
O	sides;
O	Sir
O	Mador
O	had
O	his
O	head
O	sheared
O	from
O	his
O	shoulders
O	by
O	a
O	stroke
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	'
O	s
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	remnant
O	of
O	his
O	party
O	fled
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	rode
O	to
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	cut
O	her
O	bonds
O	,
O	and
O	lifted
O	her
O	upon
O	his
O	horse
O	full
O	tenderly
O	.
O	Her
O	eyes
O	streamed
O	with
O	tears
O	as
O	she
O	returned
O	thanks
O	to
O	God
O	for
O	her
O	deliverance
O	,
O	and
O	hardly
O	could
O	she
O	tell
O	her
O	gratitude
O	to
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	continued
O	praises
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	in
O	his
O	ears
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	fared
O	forth
O	amidst
O	his
O	kinsmen
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	the
O	road
O	northwards
O	he
O	rode
O	with
O	the
O	queen
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	castle
O	of
O	Joyous
O	Gard
O	.
O	'
O	For
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	'
O	I
O	will
O	keep
O	the
O	queen
O	in
O	safety
O	until
O	I
O	know
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	is
O	assured
O	of
O	our
O	innocence
O	of
O	any
O	treason
O	against
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	doubt
O	our
O	enemies
O	have
O	poisoned
O	his
O	mind
O	,
O	for
O	never
O	else
O	would
O	he
O	have
O	suffered
O	her
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	stake
O	.
O	'
O	But
O	therein
O	was
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	in
O	great
O	error
O	,
O	as
O	in
O	much
O	grief
O	and
O	remorse
O	he
O	came
O	later
O	to
O	see;
O	for
O	if
O	instantly
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	the
O	queen
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	dared
O	his
O	enemies
O	to
O	prove
O	his
O	treason
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	instantly
O	discountenanced
O	,
O	and
O	King
O	Arthur
O	would
O	have
O	known
O	and
O	loved
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	done
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	true
O	knight
O	and
O	a
O	peerless
O	one
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	would
O	ever
O	have
O	had
O	the
O	hatred
O	of
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	caused
O	by
O	his
O	slaying
O	,
O	though
O	unwittingly
O	,
O	the
O	two
O	good
O	knights
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gaheris
O	and
O	Sir
O	Gareth;
O	whereof
O	came
O	great
O	bale
O	and
O	sorrow
O	.
