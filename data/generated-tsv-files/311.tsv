O	When
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	men
O	had
O	left
O	the
O	realm
O	of
O	Britain
O	and
O	had
O	betaken
O	themselves
O	to
O	Brittany
O	,
O	where
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	had
O	a
O	kingdom
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	the
O	Saxons
O	began
O	to
O	increase
O	in
O	Britain
O	,
O	both
O	in
O	strength
O	and
O	numbers
O	.
O	Almost
O	daily
O	a
O	long
O	black
O	ship
O	,
O	crammed
O	with
O	pagans
O	,
O	was
O	sighted
O	from
O	some
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	coast;
O	and
O	the
O	British
O	,
O	praying
O	that
O	the
O	fierce
O	pirates
O	would
O	not
O	visit
O	their
O	homes
O	,
O	would
O	watch
O	the
O	terrible
O	warship
O	till
O	it
O	passed;
O	or
O	else
O	,
O	caught
O	unawares
O	,
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	flee
O	inland
O	in
O	a
O	breathless
O	panic
O	when
O	the
O	dragon-headed
O	prow
O	loomed
O	through
O	the
O	sea-mist
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	barbarous
O	warriors
O	swarmed
O	over
O	the
O	sides
O	and
O	ran
O	knee-deep
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	their
O	eyes
O	gleaming
O	with
O	the
O	joy
O	of
O	killing
O	and
O	their
O	hands
O	eager
O	for
O	the
O	looting
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Arthur
O	made
O	ready
O	a
O	great
O	host
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	two
O	years
O	he
O	fought
O	in
O	the
O	northern
O	parts
O	against
O	the
O	bands
O	of
O	the
O	pirates
O	.
O	Swift
O	were
O	the
O	blows
O	he
O	struck
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	great
O	wide
O	Roman
O	roads
O	were
O	still
O	open
O	,
O	not
O	grass-grown
O	and
O	deserted
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	his
O	mounted
O	knights
O	and
O	men
O	he
O	could
O	ride
O	quickly
O	from
O	place
O	to
O	place
O	,
O	striking
O	fiercely
O	and
O	scattering
O	the
O	foul
O	pagans
O	.
O	Ten
O	was
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	these
O	battles
O	which
O	he
O	fought
O	in
O	the
O	north
O	,
O	six
O	against
O	the
O	Saxon
O	pirates
O	and
O	four
O	against
O	the
O	wild
O	cats
O	of
O	Caledonia
O	,
O	whom
O	men
O	call
O	Picts
O	and
O	Scots
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	had
O	ventured
O	south
O	in
O	greater
O	numbers
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	heard
O	how
O	the
O	king
O	warred
O	with
O	his
O	lords
O	and
O	the
O	rich
O	land
O	was
O	open
O	to
O	plunder
O	.
O	Two
O	others
O	he
O	fought
O	in
O	the
O	south
O	,
O	one
O	against
O	an
O	insolent
O	band
O	of
O	pirates
O	who
O	dared
O	even
O	to
O	attack
O	his
O	palace-city
O	of
O	Caerleon-upon-Usk
O	.
O	But
O	so
O	heavy
O	and
O	deadly
O	a
O	blow
O	did
O	he
O	strike
O	at
O	them
O	then
O	,
O	that
O	from
O	that
O	battle
O	barely
O	a
O	dozen
O	pagans
O	were
O	left
O	to
O	flee
O	like
O	fire
O	to
O	their
O	ships
O	.
O	Not
O	without
O	loss
O	of
O	many
O	of
O	his
O	brave
O	warriors
O	did
O	Arthur
O	win
O	these
O	battles
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	pagans
O	were
O	good
O	men
O	of
O	their
O	hands
O	and
O	not
O	easily
O	were
O	they
O	beaten
O	.
O	Saddest
O	of
O	all
O	was
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	the
O	noble
O	Geraint
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	thrusting
O	back
O	the
O	pirates
O	once
O	again
O	from
O	the
O	harbour
O	of
O	Llongporth
O	,
O	got
O	his
O	death
O	there
O	with
O	many
O	of
O	his
O	valiant
O	men
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	fame
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	prowess
O	and
O	the
O	might
O	of
O	his
O	knights
O	had
O	gone
O	abroad
O	among
O	the
O	pagans
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	afraid
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	venture
O	in
O	great
O	numbers
O	to
O	invade
O	the
O	land
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	peace
O	and
O	rest
O	in
O	Britain
O	for
O	a
O	space
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	remembering
O	his
O	hatred
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	persuaded
O	the
O	king
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	ready
O	another
O	host
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	to
O	invade
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	Brittany
O	where
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	ruled
O	his
O	kingdom
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	the
O	king
O	would
O	not
O	listen
O	to
O	his
O	advice
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	power
O	,
O	strove
O	against
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	.
O	But
O	that
O	knight
O	and
O	his
O	large
O	following
O	of
O	knights
O	and
O	men-at-arms
O	had
O	been
O	of
O	great
O	service
O	in
O	the
O	recent
O	wars
O	against
O	the
O	pagans
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	could
O	not
O	wholly
O	refuse
O	to
O	listen
O	to
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	'
O	s
O	demands
O	.
O	Also
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	added
O	his
O	words
O	to
O	those
O	of
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	men
O	who
O	came
O	from
O	Brittany
O	said
O	that
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	was
O	getting
O	him
O	ready
O	a
O	large
O	army
O	,
O	and
O	training
O	many
O	men
O	,
O	although
O	he
O	was
O	at
O	peace
O	with
O	his
O	neighbours
O	in
O	Gaul
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	rumour
O	went
O	,
O	as
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	reported
O	,
O	that
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	was
O	only
O	waiting
O	his
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	King
O	Arthur
O	should
O	be
O	more
O	than
O	usually
O	pressed
O	by
O	his
O	pagan
O	foes
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	his
O	great
O	host
O	would
O	sail
O	swiftly
O	across
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	seize
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Britain
O	,
O	when
O	Arthur
O	,
O	exhausted
O	by
O	war
O	,
O	would
O	be
O	unable
O	to
O	withstand
O	the
O	fresh
O	warriors
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	lose
O	both
O	his
O	queen
O	and
O	his
O	crown
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	time
O	the
O	king
O	would
O	not
O	suffer
O	these
O	evil
O	rumours
O	to
O	be
O	mentioned
O	in
O	his
O	presence
O	,
O	but
O	many
O	of
O	his
O	counsellors
O	thought
O	there
O	was
O	much
O	truth
O	in
O	them
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	so
O	persistent
O	was
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	and
O	those
O	whom
O	he
O	craftily
O	persuaded
O	to
O	believe
O	him
O	,
O	that
O	for
O	sheer
O	weariness
O	the
O	king
O	consented
O	to
O	take
O	an
O	army
O	across
O	to
O	Brittany
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	demand
O	that
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	should
O	own
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	his
O	overlord
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	do
O	homage
O	to
O	King
O	Arthur
O	for
O	his
O	kingdom
O	.
O	The
O	host
O	was
O	prepared
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	a
O	meeting
O	of
O	his
O	council
O	King
O	Arthur
O	made
O	his
O	nephew
O	,
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	,
O	Regent
O	of
O	Britain
O	,
O	to
O	rule
O	in
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	place
O	while
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	abroad;
O	and
O	Queen
O	Gwenevere
O	he
O	placed
O	under
O	the
O	governance
O	of
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	officers
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	passed
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	landed
O	in
O	the
O	coasts
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	'
O	s
O	country
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	ordered
O	his
O	knights
O	to
O	go
O	through
O	the
O	nearer
O	parts
O	,
O	burning
O	the
O	houses
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	and
O	wasting
O	their
O	lands
O	.
O	This
O	he
O	did
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	enrage
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	against
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	listen
O	quietly
O	to
O	any
O	demand
O	which
O	the
O	king
O	might
O	make
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	Word
O	was
O	brought
O	to
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	of
O	the
O	landing
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	and
O	the
O	plundering
O	and
O	wasting
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	some
O	days
O	he
O	would
O	do
O	naught;
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	loath
O	to
O	take
O	up
O	arms
O	against
O	the
O	king

O	loved
O	,

O	harshly
O	.

O	I
O	come
O	hither
O	to
O	speak
O	with
O	King
O	Arthur

O	,

O	'
O	With
O	an
O	angry
O	gesture
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	seized
O	her
O	bridle
O	and
O	led
O	her
O	palfrey
O	swiftly
O	to
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	camp
O	.

O	Depart
O	!

O	he
O	cried
O	harshly
O	,
O	'

O	is
O	idle

O	,
O	that

O	knighthood
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	never

O	slain
O	.
O	Now
O	go
O	!
O	'
O	When
O	this
O	message
O	was
O	told
O	to
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	the
O	tears
O	stood
O	in
O	his
O	eyes
O	and
O	he
O	went
O	apart
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	that
O	day
O	the
O	knights
O	his
O	comrades
O	held
O	their
O	counsel
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	resolved
O	that
O	next
O	day
O	they
O	would
O	prevail
O	upon
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	to
O	issue
O	forth
O	and
O	give
O	battle
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	looked
O	from
O	the
O	walls
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	they
O	saw
O	that
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	had
O	crept
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	dawn
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	was
O	the
O	place
O	besieged
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	there
O	was
O	fierce
O	fighting
O	,
O	for
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	caused
O	ladders
O	to
O	be
O	reared
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	knights
O	strove
O	to
O	climb
O	over
O	the
O	Wall
O	,
O	but
O	were
O	mightily
O	beaten
O	back
O	by
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	'
O	s
O	party
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	attackers
O	drew
O	off
O	for
O	a
O	space
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	well
O	armed
O	,
O	came
O	before
O	the
O	chief
O	gate
O	,
O	upon
O	a
O	stout
O	steed
O	.
O	He
O	shook
O	his
O	lance
O	at
O	the
O	men
O	over
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	:
O	'
O	Where
O	art
O	thou
O	,
O	false
O	traitor
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	?
O	Why
O	dost
O	thou
O	hide
O	thyself
O	within
O	holes
O	and
O	walls
O	like
O	a
O	coward
O	?
O	Look
O	out
O	now
O	,

O	timid
O	soul
O	,
O	for
O	when
O	I
O	may
O	get
O	at
O	thee
O	I
O	will
O	revenge
O	upon

O	evil
O	body
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	my
O	brothers
O	twain
O	.
O	'
O	These
O	shameful
O	words
O	were
O	heard
O	by
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	knights
O	and
O	kin
O	that
O	stood
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	said
O	:
O	'
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	now
O	ye
O	must
O	be
O	done
O	with
O	thy
O	courtesy
O	and
O	go
O	forth
O	and
O	beat
O	back
O	those
O	evil
O	words
O	upon
O	his
O	foul
O	mouth
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	It
O	is
O	even
O	so
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Lancelot;
O	'
O	but
O	sorry
O	I
O	am
O	and
O	heavy
O	of
O	spirit
O	thus
O	to
O	fight
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	who
O	hath
O	been
O	my
O	dear
O	brother-in-arms
O	so
O	long
O	,
O	and
O	whose
O	brothers
O	I
O	did
O	unwittingly
O	slay
O	.
O	And
O	much
O	evil
O	shall
O	come
O	of
O	this
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	he
O	commanded
O	his
O	strongest
O	horse
O	to
O	be
O	saddled
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	his
O	armour
O	to
O	be
O	dressed
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	fully
O	armed
O	he
O	stood
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	gate
O	and
O	cried
O	upon
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	'
O	My
O	lord
O	Arthur
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	'

O	me
O	knight
O	,
O	wit
O	you
O	well
O	that

O	am
O	right
O	heavy
O	that
O	ever
O	ye
O	do
O	pursue
O	me
O	thus;
O	but
O	now
O	that
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	hath
O	used
O	villainous
O	words
O	about
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	must
O	needs
O	defend
O	myself
O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	seated
O	upon
O	his
O	horse
O	below
O	,
O	laughed
O	grimly
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	upon
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	'
O	O
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	what
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	words
O	thou
O	art
O	!
O	If
O	thou
O	darest
O	to
O	battle
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	cease
O	thy
O	babbling
O	,
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	come
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	us
O	ease
O	our
O	hearts
O	with
O	strong
O	blows
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	issued
O	forth
O	with
O	many
O	of
O	his
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	covenant
O	was
O	made
O	between
O	the
O	hosts
O	that
O	there
O	should
O	be
O	no
O	fighting
O	until
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	had
O	fought
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	was
O	either
O	dead
O	or
O	yielden
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	departed
O	some
O	way
O	and
O	then
O	came
O	together
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	might
O	of
O	their
O	horses
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	smote
O	the
O	other
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	shield
O	.
O	So
O	strong
O	were
O	the
O	knights
O	and
O	stout
O	and
O	big
O	the
O	spears
O	,
O	that
O	their
O	horses
O	could
O	not
O	stand
O	the
O	shock
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	knights
O	quickly
O	avoided
O	their
O	horses
O	and
O	dressed
O	their
O	shields
O	,
O	and
O	fought
O	fiercely
O	together
O	with
O	their
O	swords
O	.
O	So
O	valiantly
O	did
O	each
O	give
O	and
O	receive
O	blows
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	heavy
O	and
O	grim
O	was
O	their
O	fighting
O	,
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	and
O	lords
O	that
O	stood
O	thereabout
O	marvelled
O	thereat
O	and
O	were
O	fain
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	in
O	as
O	many
O	good
O	words
O	,
O	that
O	never
O	had
O	they
O	seen
O	such
O	sword-play
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	,
O	so
O	shrewd
O	and
O	skilful
O	were
O	they
O	,
O	both
O	were
O	wounded
O	and
O	the
O	blood
O	oozed
O	from
O	the
O	joints
O	of
O	their
O	armour
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	great
O	marvel
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	still
O	stand
O	,
O	dashing
O	their
O	shields
O	upon
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	beating
O	upon
O	the
O	other
O	with
O	great
O	slashes
O	of
O	their
O	swords
O	.
O	And
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	stronger
O	of
O	the
O	twain
O	none
O	might
O	say
O	.
O	Now
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	had
O	a
O	magic
O	power
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	endowed
O	upon
O	him
O	at
O	his
O	birth
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	witch
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	friend
O	of
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	the
O	sorceress
O	,
O	Queen
O	Morgan
O	le
O	Fay
O	,
O	wife
O	of
O	King
O	Lot
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	knew
O	of
O	this
O	secret
O	power
O	except
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	and
O	often
O	had
O	it
O	availed
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	in
O	dire
O	perils
O	of
O	onfall
O	,
O	sudden
O	ambush
O	,
O	or
O	long
O	battle
O	,
O	it
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	the
O	victory
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	about
O	him
O	had
O	been
O	slain
O	or
O	wounded
O	or
O	taken
O	captive
O	.
O	The
O	magic
O	was
O	that
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	hour
O	of
O	nine
O	until
O	high
O	noon
O	,
O	the
O	strength
O	of
O	his
O	body
O	increased
O	until
O	it
O	was
O	three
O	times
O	his
O	natural
O	strength
O	,
O	which
O	itself
O	was
O	full
O	great
O	,
O	though
O	in
O	that
O	,
O	for
O	deep
O	wind
O	and
O	breath
O	and
O	might
O	of
O	arm
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	was
O	the
O	stronger
O	.
O	Now
O	while
O	they
O	fought
O	together
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	felt
O	that
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	seemed
O	not
O	to
O	weaken
O	as
O	time
O	went
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	marvelled
O	greatly
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	felt
O	that
O	indeed
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	'
O	s
O	strength
O	was
O	greater
O	than
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	at
O	the
O	beginning
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	fear
O	came
O	into
O	his
O	heart
O	that
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	was
O	possessed
O	of
O	a
O	demon
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	was
O	stout
O	of
O	heart
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	old
O	in
O	warcraft
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	tire
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	he
O	might
O	,
O	by
O	one
O	blow
O	,
O	get
O	the
O	better
O	of
O	him
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	good
O	chance
O	.
O	Therefore
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	began
O	to
O	husband
O	his
O	strength
O	,
O	and
O	instead
O	of
O	spending
O	it
O	in
O	feinting
O	and
O	attacking
O	,
O	he
O	bore
O	his
O	shield
O	ever
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	covering
O	himself
O	from
O	the
O	fierce
O	blows
O	of
O	his
O	enemy
O	.
O	Thus
O	he
O	kept
O	up
O	his
O	own
O	strength;
O	but
O	hard
O	put
O	to
O	it
O	was
O	he
O	when
O	,
O	towards
O	midday
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	seemed
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	might
O	of
O	a
O	very
O	giant
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	shield
O	arm
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	was
O	numbed
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	the
O	crashing
O	blows
O	which
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	'
O	s
O	sword
O	rained
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	Great
O	travail
O	indeed
O	had
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	to
O	stand
O	up
O	and
O	not
O	to
O	yield;
O	and
O	while
O	men
O	marvelled
O	how
O	he
O	could
O	endure
O	,
O	none
O	knew
O	all
O	he
O	suffered
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	bell
O	of
O	the
O	convent
O	in
O	the
O	town
O	boomed
O	forth
O	the
O	hour
O	of
O	noon
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	heaved
O	up
O	his
O	sword
O	for
O	a
O	final
O	blow;
O	but
O	his
O	sword
O	descended
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	last
O	stroke
O	of
O	twelve
O	had
O	died
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	marvelled
O	to
O	feel
O	that
O	what
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	so
O	grievous
O	a
O	blow
O	that
O	,
O	belike
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	have
O	stood
O	before
O	it
O	,
O	fell
O	upon
O	his
O	shield
O	with
O	no
O	more
O	than
O	the
O	strength
O	of
O	the
O	blow
O	given
O	by
O	an
O	ordinary
O	man
O	.
O	When
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	felt
O	the
O	might
O	of
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	so
O	suddenly
O	give
O	way
O	,
O	he
O	drew
O	himself
O	up
O	to
O	his
O	full
O	height
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	'
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	I
O	know
O	not
O	by
O	what
O	evil
O	power

O	have
O	fought
O	,
O	but
O	now
O	I
O	feel
O	that
O	ye
O	have
O	done
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	my
O	lord
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gawaine

O	With

O	his

O	,

O	of

O	,

O	gave
O	so

O	a

O	on
O	the

O	stood
O	for

O	words
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	his
O	mercy;

O	Galahad

O	Sir
O	Perceval

O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Gawaine

O	borne
O	into

O	s
O	tent
O	and
O	his
O	wounds
O	were
O	cleaned
O	and
O	salved
O	.

O	lay
O	for
O	three
O	weeks
O	,
O	hard
O	of
O	mood

O	bitter
O	in
O	his
O	hatred
O	,
O	and

O	try
O	again
O	to
O	slay
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	he
O	prayed
O	the

O	forgiveness

O	,

O	.
O	Come
O	thou
O	over
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	thy
O	knights
O	do
O	thou
O	press
O	to
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	Arthur
O	,
O	our
O	noble
O	lord
O	,
O	who
O	is
O	beset
O	by
O	a
O	traitorous
O	villain
O	,
O	my
O	brother
O	Mordred
O	,
O	who
O	hath
O	dared
O	to
O	rebel
O	against
O	his
O	rightful
O	lord
O	,
O	and
O	hath
O	crowned
O	himself
O	king
O	.
O	Do
O	thou
O	hasten
O	,
O	good
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	when
O	thou
O	shalt
O	receive
O	this
O	letter
O	,
O	and
O	follow
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	But
O	ere
O	thou
O	goest
O	from
O	this
O	seashore
O	do
O	thou
O	come
O	to
O	my
O	tomb
O	,
O	and
O	pray
O	some
O	prayer
O	more
O	or
O	less
O	for
O	my
O	sinful
O	soul
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	its
O	madness
O	did
O	evilly
O	entreat
O	thee
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	was
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	shriven
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	he
O	swooned
O	,
O	while
O	all
O	stood
O	uncovered
O	round
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	rays
O	of
O	the
O	afternoon
O	sun
O	cast
O	long
O	shadows
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	and
O	fighting
O	men
O	who
O	were
O	hurrying
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	shore
O	making
O	ready
O	to
O	depart
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	awoke
O	from
O	his
O	swoon
O	and
O	looked
O	up
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	moment
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	recognise
O	King
O	Arthur;
O	then
O	he
O	smiled
O	at
O	him
O	very
O	sweetly
O	and
O	said
O	in
O	a
O	low
O	voice
O	:
O	'
O	Kiss
O	me--and
O	forgive
O	me
O	!
O	'
O	The
O	king
O	knelt
O	down
O	and
O	kissed
O	the
O	pallid
O	face
O	of
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	very
O	sorrow
O	he
O	felt
O	that
O	the
O	heart
O	in
O	his
O	breast
O	was
O	nigh
O	to
O	bursting
O	.
O	So
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	beat
O	of
O	the
O	surf
O	and
O	the
O	cry
O	of
O	the
O	seagulls
O	upon
O	his
O	ears
O	,
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	in
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	free
O	air
O	of
O	heaven
O	all
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	died
O	.
O	And
O	his
O	death
O	was
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	craved
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	,
O	under
O	the
O	open
O	sky
O	,
O	after
O	battle
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	good
O	strokes
O	and
O	received
O	them
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	letter
O	which
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	had
O	written
O	was
O	given
O	unto
O	a
O	young
O	squire
O	of
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	by
O	name
O	Tewder
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	commanded
O	to
O	depart
O	forthwith
O	back
O	to
O	Brittany
O	,
O	and
O	deliver
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	among
O	the
O	knights
O	that
O	had
O	stood
O	about
O	the
O	dying
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	traitor
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	the
O	rebel
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	if
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	should
O	receive
O	that
O	letter
O	,
O	and
O	come
O	to
O	Britain
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	brave
O	kin
O	and
O	their
O	host
O	,
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	would
O	have
O	much
O	ado
O	to
O	conquer
O	King
O	Arthur
O	.
O	Therefore
O	the
O	traitor
O	knight
O	,
O	whose
O	name
O	was
O	Sir
O	Fergus
O	,
O	did
O	accost
O	Tewder
O	the
O	squire
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	fair
O	seeming
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	also
O	was
O	bidden
O	to
O	go
O	back
O	to
O	Brittany
O	,
O	to
O	bring
O	back
O	certain
O	jewels
O	which
O	the
O	king
O	in
O	his
O	hasty
O	departure
O	had
O	left
O	in
O	his
O	lodging
O	at
O	the
O	town
O	of
O	Dol
O	.
O	Tewder
O	,
O	unsuspecting
O	of
O	all
O	evil
O	,
O	went
O	aboard
O	a
O	boat
O	with
O	Sir
O	Fergus
O	,
O	and
O	together
O	they
O	bargained
O	with
O	the
O	master
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	across
O	when
O	the
O	tide
O	should
O	rise
O	again
O	at
O	dark
O	.
O	Together
O	they
O	crossed
O	the
O	sea
O	that
O	night
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	road
O	towards
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	'
O	s
O	town;
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	dark
O	wood
O	Sir
O	Fergus
O	set
O	upon
O	the
O	squire
O	,
O	who
O	fought
O	bravely
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	slain
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	letter
O	of
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	was
O	taken
O	by
O	the
O	traitor
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	returning
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	the
O	wretch
O	went
O	aboard
O	another
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	chaffered
O	with
O	the
O	merchant
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	across
O	the
O	sea
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	of
O	Llongporth
O	,
O	whence
O	he
O	thought
O	to
O	get
O	quickly
O	to
O	Mordred
O	,
O	to
O	receive
O	from
O	him
O	the
O	reward
O	of
O	his
O	treachery
O	and
O	murder
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	sailed
O	over
O	the
O	dark
O	sea
O	,
O	a
O	fifty-oared
O	longship
O	,
O	filled
O	with
O	Saxon
O	pirates
O	,
O	crept
O	upon
O	them;
O	the
O	pagans
O	poured
O	over
O	the
O	sides
O	,
O	slew
O	men
O	almost
O	in
O	their
O	sleep
O	,
O	and
O	flung
O	their
O	bodies
O	overboard
O	.
O	And
O	though
O	Fergus
O	fought
O	well
O	,
O	his
O	head
O	was
O	almost
O	struck
O	from
O	his
O	body
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	sheering
O	axe-blow
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	pirates
O	had
O	taken
O	all
O	the
O	goods
O	they
O	desired
O	from
O	the
O	merchant
O	vessel
O	,
O	they
O	stove
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	its
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	sank
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	So
O	that
O	no
O	man
O	ever
O	again
O	saw
O	the
O	letter
O	which
O	was
O	meant
O	for
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	.
O	For
O	some
O	weeks
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	lay
O	quiet
O	,
O	knowing
O	naught
O	of
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	or
O	of
O	the
O	letter
O	desiring
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	.
O	Many
O	rumours
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	ship-folk
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	wicked
O	rebellion
O	of
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	longed
O	to
O	go
O	across
O	to
O	Britain
O	and
O	fight
O	for
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	his
O	kinsmen
O	would
O	not
O	consent
O	,
O	but
O	said
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	unseemly
O	,
O	unless
O	the
O	king
O	craved
O	his
O	aid
O	,
O	and
O	sued
O	for
O	pardon
O	for
O	making
O	war
O	against
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	country
O	.
O	Thus
O	the
O	precious
O	weeks
O	went
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	much
O	ill
O	fortune
O	happened
O	in
O	Britain
O	,
O	that
O	had
O	ended
O	otherwise
O	if
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	had
O	been
O	by
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	Three
O	days
O	after
O	the
O	battle
O	upon
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	host
O	came
O	up
O	with
O	the
O	host
O	of
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	on
O	Barham
O	down
O	.
O	Many
O	folks
O	had
O	joined
O	the
O	rebels
O	'
O	side
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	hated
O	the
O	king
O	for
O	making
O	war
O	upon
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	sorely
O	hurt
O	in
O	his
O	mind
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	banner
O	borne
O	by
O	one
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	usurper
O	'
O	s
O	army
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	device
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	'
O	s
O	.
O	This
O	the
O	crafty
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	had
O	commanded
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	,
O	knowing
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	damp
O	the
O	spirits
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	and
O	his
O	men
O	.
O	'
O	Verily

O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	'

O	evil

O	sprung
O	up
O	as

O	fought
O	unjustly

O	some
O	that

O	war

O	'
O	If

O	All
O	day
O	the
O	battle
O	raged
O	upon
O	the
O	great
O	green
O	down
O	,

O	many
O	were
O	the
O	fierce
O	fights

O	freshly

O	them
O	for
O	many
O	miles
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	running
O	fight
O	and
O	much
O	wounding
O	and
O	slaying
O	all
O	through
O	the
O	fresh
O	green
O	countryside
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	hedges
O	were
O	laden
O	with
O	May-blossoms
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	the
O	larks
O	were
O	trilling
O	.
O	And
O	that
O	day
O	many
O	a
O	wounded
O	man
O	crawled
O	groaning
O	into
O	the
O	thickets
O	to
O	die
O	,
O	many
O	a
O	chalky
O	cart-rut
O	ran
O	red
O	with
O	blood
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	a
O	white
O	face
O	,
O	with
O	wide-open
O	,
O	sightless
O	eyes
O	,
O	stared
O	up
O	at
O	the
O	blue
O	sky
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	fleecy
O	clouds
O	sailed
O	in
O	the
O	gentle
O	wind
O	.
O	For
O	three
O	weeks
O	after
O	this
O	battle
O	both
O	sides
O	rested
O	,
O	and
O	like
O	great
O	wrestlers
O	gathered
O	all
O	their
O	strength
O	for
O	one
O	great
O	struggle
O	.
O	Knights
O	and
O	riders
O	were
O	sent
O	by
O	both
O	sides
O	into
O	all
O	parts
O	,
O	with
O	letters
O	to
O	lords
O	and
O	knights
O	,
O	charging
O	them
O	to
O	take
O	their
O	sides
O	in
O	the
O	war
O	.
O	Many
O	people
O	from
O	about
O	London
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	banner
O	of
O	Mordred
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	parts
O	now
O	called
O	Kent
O	,
O	Sussex
O	and
O	Surrey
O	,
O	Essex
O	and
O	Suffolk
O	held
O	wholly
O	with
O	him;
O	but
O	those
O	in
O	the
O	west
O	,
O	as
O	Wales
O	,
O	Devon
O	,
O	Cornwall
O	and
O	the
O	middle
O	parts
O	,
O	thronged
O	to
O	the
O	banner
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	Few
O	came
O	from
O	the
O	north
O	,
O	for
O	there
O	the
O	pagan
O	pirates
O	stalked
O	with
O	fire
O	and
O	sword
O	through
O	and
O	through
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	British
O	lords
O	and
O	chiefs
O	that
O	were
O	alive
O	had
O	little
O	power
O	to
O	stay
O	them
O	now
O	.
O	King
O	Uriens
O	was
O	dead
O	,
O	slain
O	by
O	the
O	dagger
O	of
O	a
O	traitor
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	were
O	two
O	other
O	great
O	chieftains;
O	so
O	that
O	men
O	south
O	of
O	Trent
O	sorrowfully
O	shook
O	their
O	heads
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	now
O	the
O	north
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	British
O	folk
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	given
O	over
O	to
O	the
O	savage
O	heathen
O	hordes
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	to
O	meet
O	the
O	many
O	that
O	flocked
O	together
O	in
O	his
O	favour
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	drew
O	him
O	with
O	his
O	host
O	westward
O	beyond
O	Sarum
O	.
O	There
O	on
O	the
O	wide
O	downs
O	beside
O	the
O	great
O	standing-stones
O	of
O	the
O	Old
O	Princes
O	,
O	which
O	men
O	now
O	call
O	Stonehenge
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	multitude
O	of
O	chiefs
O	and
O	knights
O	and
O	yeomen
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	banner
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	avoided
O	a
O	battle
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	instead
O	,
O	kept
O	aloof
O	with
O	his
O	army
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	burn
O	and
O	harry
O	the
O	country
O	which
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	Arthur
O	.
O	He
O	took
O	Calleva
O	and
O	Cunetio
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	the
O	people
O	to
O	the
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	much
O	gear
O	from
O	those
O	wealthy
O	cities;
O	then
O	he
O	stole
O	through
O	the
O	great
O	forest
O	by
O	night
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	Palladun
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	rich
O	town
O	builded
O	upon
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	hill
O	.
O	He
O	thought
O	to
O	take
O	this
O	unawares
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	well
O	watched
O	and
O	well
O	armed
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	strove
O	to
O	break
O	into
O	it
O	and
O	was
O	kept
O	about
O	it
O	for
O	some
O	days
O	.
O	That
O	delay
O	was
O	used
O	well
O	by
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	made
O	great
O	haste
O	to
O	pass
O	through
O	the
O	wild
O	country
O	,
O	filled
O	with
O	wide
O	marshes
O	and
O	thick
O	woods
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	which
O	separated
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	enemy
O	.
O	Then
O	Mordred
O	,
O	hearing
O	through
O	the
O	spies
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	approach
O	,
O	got
O	his
O	host
O	away
O	and
O	thought
O	to
O	pass
O	into
O	the
O	lands
O	of
O	Devon
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	those
O	of
O	King
O	Dewer
O	,
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	Geraint
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	firmly
O	for
O	Arthur
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	the
O	wild
O	waste-land
O	beside
O	the
O	Endless
O	Waters
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	caught
O	up
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	barred
O	his
O	further
O	way
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	remembered
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	that
O	same
O	land
O	,
O	full
O	of
O	gaunt
O	standing-stones
O	and
O	haunted
O	by
O	trolls
O	and
O	witches
O	,
O	where
O	Merlin
O	had
O	once
O	led
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	gained
O	the
O	sword
O	Excalibur
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	day
O	when
O	the
O	two
O	armies
O	faced
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	both
O	prepared
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	night
O	upon
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	Bitter
O	was
O	the
O	wind
O	that
O	evening
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	skies
O	were
O	dun
O	and
O	leaden
O	of
O	hue
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	spring
O	had
O	been
O	overcome
O	by
O	winter;
O	and
O	to
O	shelter
O	the
O	king
O	a
O	tent
O	had
O	been
O	put
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	dark
O	wood
O	of
O	stunted
O	firs
O	,
O	called
O	the
O	Wood
O	of
O	Drood
O	.
O	Just
O	in
O	the
O	deep
O	dark
O	before
O	the
O	dawn
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	blood
O	in
O	men
O	'
O	s
O	veins
O	was
O	coldest
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	life
O	in
O	their
O	hearts
O	was
O	weakest
O	,
O	a
O	dreadful
O	cry
O	wailed
O	out
O	through
O	the
O	dark
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	came
O	the
O	sound
O	as
O	of
O	leathery
O	wings
O	flapping
O	heavily
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	above
O	where
O	the
O	king
O	lay
O	sleeping
O	.
O	Men
O	started
O	up
O	about
O	their
O	ashen
O	fires
O	,
O	their
O	faces
O	blanching
O	at
O	the
O	terror
O	that
O	cried
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	heard
O	the
O	wailing
O	twice
O	repeated
O	,
O	while
O	none
O	dared
O	try
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	thing
O	that
O	wailed
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	while
O	their
O	blood
O	chilled
O	and
O	their
O	breath
O	stayed
O	,
O	they
O	heard
O	the
O	heavy
O	flapping
O	pass
O	over
O	their
O	heads
O	and
O	die
O	away
O	towards
O	the
O	camp
O	of
O	Mordred;
O	and
O	there
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	did
O	the
O	three
O	cries
O	sound
O	again
O	.
O	Men
O	'
O	s
O	hearts
O	sickened
O	as
O	they
O	turned
O	and
O	crept
O	the
O	nearer
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	but
O	few
O	dared
O	to
O	utter
O	the
O	words
O	upon
O	their
O	lips
O	.
O	Two
O	knights
O	slept
O	in
O	the
O	tent
O	with
O	king
O	,
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	and
O	Sir
O	Owen;
O	and
O	they
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	,
O	trembling
O	at
O	the
O	cries
O	of
O	terrible
O	import
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	passed
O	,
O	the
O	knights
O	would
O	not
O	move
O	,
O	fearing
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	first
O	to
O	speak
O	.
O	'
O	My
O	Lords
O	,
O	'
O	came
O	the
O	quiet
O	voice
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	dark
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	was
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	the
O	Hag
O	of
O	Warning
O	.
O	Men
O	say
O	it
O	hath
O	foretold
O	the
O	deaths
O	of
O	many
O	of
O	my
O	house
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	know
O	not
O	.
O	Yet
O	will
O	I
O	take
O	the
O	issue
O	as
O	God
O	shall
O	give
O	it
O	me
O	,
O	trusting
O	in
O	His
O	mercy
O	and
O	the
O	blood
O	of
O	His
O	Son
O	Jesus
O	,
O	and
O	Him
O	crucified
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Amen
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	no
O	more
O	.
O	When
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	,
O	the
O	sun
O	rose
O	,
O	flashing
O	his
O	warm
O	rays
O	into
O	the
O	fearful
O	eyes
O	that
O	greeted
O	him
O	,
O	men
O	'
O	s
O	terror
O	quickly
O	vanished;
O	and
O	when
O	fires
O	were
O	lit
O	and
O	oaten
O	cakes
O	were
O	browning
O	on
O	the
O	irons
O	,
O	or
O	collops
O	sputtered
O	on
O	their
O	skewers
O	,
O	tongues
O	were
O	loosened
O	and
O	faces
O	began
O	to
O	smile
O	.
O	But
O	few
O	spoke
O	of
O	the
O	cries
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	heard
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	loved
O	their
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	hoped
O	that
O	somehow
O	they
O	had
O	dreamed
O	an
O	evil
O	dream
O	,
O	or
O	had
O	but
O	heard
O	the
O	cries
O	of
O	some
O	foul
O	night-bird
O	.
O	Breakfast
O	being
O	ended
O	,
O	the
O	captains
O	and
O	knights
O	began
O	to
O	trim
O	their
O	men
O	in
O	army
O	array
O	,
O	and
O	talk
O	was
O	eager
O	of
O	the
O	coming
O	battle
O	.
O	Then
O	were
O	seen
O	,
O	coming
O	from
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	'
O	s
O	camp
O	,
O	two
O	bishops;
O	and
O	these
O	were
O	taken
O	at
O	their
O	desire
O	to
O	Arthur
O	,
O	where

O	stood
O	surrounded
O	by

O	.
O	'

O	to

O	so
O	many
O	great

O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gaheris
O	and
O	Sir
O	Gareth

O	,
O	faithful
O	in
O	all

O	,
O	and
O	a
O	strong
O	arm
O	against

O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	some
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	knights
O	would
O	have
O	him
O	agree
O	to
O	these
O	terms
O	,
O	but
O	others
O	would
O	not
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	should
O	make
O	no
O	treaty
O	with
O	a
O	traitor
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	Mordred
O	should
O	come
O	and
O	throw
O	himself
O	upon
O	the
O	mercy
O	of
O	his
O	king
O	and
O	uncle
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	last
O	,
O	after
O	much
O	counsel
O	had
O	been
O	taken
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	agreed
O	to
O	meet
O	Mordred
O	,
O	with
O	fourteen

O	in
O	the
O	space
O	betwixt

O	hosts
O	,

O	the
O	king
O	should
O	also
O	take
O	fourteen
O	knights
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	bishops
O	went
O	back
O	with
O	this
O	message
O	,
O	and
O	King
O	Arthur
O	called
O	the
O	chieftains
O	of
O	his
O	host
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	I
O	go
O	to
O	see
O	this
O	traitor
O	,

O	he
O	said
O	to
O	them
O	,

O	whether
O	he

O	falsely
O	or
O	truly
O	with

O	treaty
O	.
O	But
O	look
O	ye
O	,
O	I
O	in
O	no
O	wise
O	trust
O	him
O	.
O	Hold
O	ye
O	your

O	with
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	In
O	like

O	did
O	Mordred

O	,

O	said
O	he
O	,
O	knowing
O	how
O	greatly
O	he
O	had
O	sinned
O	against
O	his
O	generous
O	and
O	noble

O	,
O	'
O	I
O	know
O	well
O	that
O	King
O	Arthur

O	avenged
O	on
O	me
O	if
O	they
O	could
O	.
O	'
O	The
O	party
O	from
O	each
O	army
O	went
O	forward
O	over
O	the
O	stony
O	hillside
O	,
O	until
O	they
O	met
O	midway
O	between
O	the
O	armies
O	,
O	and
O	men
O	watched
O	them
O	keenly
O	.
O	King
O	Arthur
O	spoke
O	chidingly
O	to
O	his
O	nephew
O	Mordred
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	sour
O	and
O	dark
O	of
O	face
O	,
O	looked
O	craftily
O	at
O	the
O	faces
O	of
O	his
O	uncle
O	and
O	his
O	knights
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	chiefs
O	with
O	Mordred
O	,
O	men
O	for
O	the
O	most
O	part
O	of
O	violent
O	and
O	ambitious
O	natures
O	,
O	looked
O	haughtily
O	at
O	King
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	party
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	bad
O	blood
O	shown
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	talk
O	was
O	continued
O	,
O	and
O	Mordred
O	repeated
O	the
O	demands
O	which
O	the
O	bishops
O	had
O	made
O	.
O	'
O	But
O	I

O	young
O	man
O	.
O	'
O	Let
O	us

O	be
O	big
O	enough
O	to

O	all
O	the
O	kingdom
O	if

O	fight
O	.
O	'
O	The
O	king
O	looked
O	sternly
O	at
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	silence
O	among
O	them
O	all
O	as
O	men
O	waited
O	for
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	reply
O	.
O	Then
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	a
O	young
O	chieftain
O	,
O	standing
O	near
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	felt
O	something
O	bite
O	his
O	foot
O	where
O	the
O	low
O	leathern
O	shoe
O	left
O	it
O	naked
O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	down
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	treading
O	on
O	a
O	viper
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	struck
O	him
O	and
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	strike
O	again
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	cry
O	the
O	knight
O	stepped
O	aside
O	,
O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	the
O	reptile
O	in
O	two
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	blade
O	flashed
O	,
O	silvery
O	bright
O	in
O	the
O	sunlight
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	hoarse
O	cry
O	rose
O	like
O	thunder
O	from
O	the
O	two
O	masses
O	of
O	men
O	watching
O	them
O	on
O	either
O	side;
O	trumpets
O	blared
O	and
O	horns
O	squealed
O	,
O	and
O	shouts
O	of
O	command
O	rose
O	sharp
O	and
O	keen
O	.
O	Instantly
O	the
O	men
O	standing
O	with
O	Arthur
O	and
O	Mordred
O	looked
O	about
O	them
O	,
O	saw
O	where
O	the
O	young
O	chieftain
O	stood
O	with
O	drawn
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	that
O	now
O	nothing
O	could
O	avert
O	the
O	battle
O	.
O	'
O	The
O	gods
O	will
O	have
O	it
O	so
O	!
O	'
O	sneered
O	Mordred
O	.
O	Already
O	the
O	earth
O	trembled
O	and
O	shook
O	with
O	the
O	beat
O	of
O	ten
O	thousand
O	feet
O	of
O	the
O	armies
O	rushing
O	together
O	.
O	A
O	knight
O	of
O	Mordred
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	drawing
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	thrust
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	breast
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	chieftains
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	cry
O	:
O	'
O	This
O	for
O	thy
O	land
O	,
O	Sir
O	Digon
O	,
O	that
O	marches
O	with
O	mine
O	!
O	'
O	Instantly
O	others
O	fell
O	to
O	fighting
O	hand-to-hand
O	,
O	striking
O	on
O	targe
O	and
O	helm;
O	but
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	,
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	and
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	surrounded
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	hurried
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	army
O	approaching
O	them
O	.
O	So
O	likewise
O	did
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	.
O	Then
O	came
O	the
O	crash
O	of
O	battle
O	,
O	as
O	line
O	on
O	line
O	,
O	with
O	flashing
O	swords
O	held
O	high
O	,
O	the
O	ranks
O	of
O	war
O	closed
O	.
O	Blades
O	rose
O	again
O	,
O	stained
O	red
O	,
O	fierce
O	strangled
O	cries
O	came
O	from
O	men
O	in
O	the
O	death-grips
O	,
O	helms
O	were
O	cracked
O	,
O	shields
O	riven
O	,
O	dirks
O	sank
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	men
O	who
O	once
O	had
O	drunk
O	and
O	jested
O	with
O	laughing
O	looks
O	over
O	the
O	same
O	mead-board
O	,
O	now
O	met
O	fierce
O	eye
O	to
O	eye
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	parted
O	until
O	one
O	or
O	both
O	fell
O	in
O	the
O	swaths
O	of
O	the
O	death-harvest
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	the
O	stubborn
O	battle
O	raged
O	,
O	and
O	ever
O	the
O	king
O	sought
O	out
O	the
O	rebel
O	Mordred
O	,
O	but
O	never
O	reached
O	him
O	.
O	Many
O	valiant
O	deeds
O	he
O	did
O	,
O	wielding
O	his
O	sword
O	Excalibur;
O	and
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	were
O	Owen
O	and
O	Kay
O	,
O	Lucan
O	and
O	Bedevere
O	.
O	So
O	spent
O	were
O	they
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	that
O	hardly
O	could
O	they
O	lift
O	their
O	swords
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	sick
O	of
O	the
O	slaying
O	were
O	they
O	that
O	gladly
O	would
O	they
O	have
O	ceased
O	.
O	But
O	ever
O	some
O	vicious
O	band
O	of
O	Mordred
O	'
O	s
O	knights
O	would
O	come
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	they
O	quitted
O	them
O	like
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	ceased
O	not
O	till
O	their
O	enemies
O	had
O	fled
O	or
O	were
O	slain
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	the
O	king
O	came
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	standing
O	still
O	,
O	looked
O	upon
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	but
O	a
O	bare
O	hillside
O	of
O	hungry
O	,
O	stunted
O	grass
O	,
O	through
O	which
O	the
O	stones
O	showed
O	grey
O	and
O	sallow
O	,
O	like
O	ancient
O	bones
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	low
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	sinking
O	orb
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	red--red
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	pallid
O	faces
O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	stained
O	a
O	lighter
O	red
O	in
O	the
O	rays
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	Here
O	and
O	there
O	bands
O	still
O	fought
O	together
O	,
O	cries
O	of
O	fury
O	rose
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	groans
O	of
O	the
O	dying
O	mingled
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	'
O	Alas
O	!
O	'
O	cried
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	'
O	where
O	are
O	all
O	my
O	noble
O	knights
O	?
O	'
O	There
O	were
O	but
O	two
O	with
O	him
O	now
O	,
O	Lucan
O	and
O	his
O	brother
O	Bedevere
O	.
O	'
O	Where
O	is
O	Owen
O	,
O	and
O	Kay
O	?
O	'
O	he
O	asked
O	.
O	'
O	Alas
O	,
O	lord
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Bedevere
O	,
O	'
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	got
O	his
O	death-wound
O	by
O	the
O	thorn
O	where

O	those
O	five
O	knights
O	but
O	now
O	,

O	Kay
O	suddenly
O	fell
O	as

O	walked
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	I
O	knelt
O	to
O	speak
O	to
O	him

O	found
O	him
O	dead
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Alas
O	,

O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	that

O	,

O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	spoke
O	,
O	he
O	looked
O	towards
O	the
O	east
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	where
O	,
O	by
O	a
O	tall
O	standing-stone
O	,
O	a
O	man
O	leaned
O	as

O	'
O	'
O	God
O	speed
O	you
O	well

O	said
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	the
O	king
O	his
O	spear
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	king
O	ran
O	towards
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	,
O	crying
O	:
O	'
O	Traitor
O	,
O	prepare
O	,
O	now
O	is
O	thy
O	death-day
O	come
O	!

O	When
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	heard
O	King
O	Arthur
O	he
O	raised
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	then
O	came
O	towards
O	the
O	king
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	shadow
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	stone
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	smote
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	under
O	the
O	shield
O	,
O	with
O	so
O	keen
O	a
O	stroke
O	of
O	his
O	spear
O	that
O	it
O	went
O	through
O	the
O	body
O	and
O	out
O	beyond
O	.
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	,
O	feeling
O	that
O	death
O	was
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	thrust
O	himself
O	along
O	the
O	spear
O	almost
O	to
O	the
O	butt
O	thereof
O	,
O	nigh
O	where
O	King
O	Arthur
O	held
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	grasping
O	his
O	sword
O	in
O	both
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	he
O	struck
O	his
O	uncle
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	head
O	,
O	with
O	so
O	keen
O	and
O	fierce
O	a
O	blow
O	that
O	the
O	sword
O	pierced
O	the
O	helm
O	and
O	the
O	skull
O	.
O	With
O	that
O	stroke
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	fell
O	stark
O	dead
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	sank
O	in
O	a
O	swoon
O	upon
O	his
O	body
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lucan
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	both
O	sore
O	wounded
O	and
O	weakly
O	,
O	came
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	between
O	them
O	,
O	with
O	many
O	rests
O	upon
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	took
O	the
O	king
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	combe
O	beside
O	the
O	waters
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	they
O	took
O	off
O	his
O	helm
O	and
O	bathed
O	his
O	wound
O	and
O	bound
O	it
O	.
O	After
O	which
O	the
O	king
O	felt
O	easier
O	.
O	'
O	We

O	said
O	Sir
O	Lucan
O	,

O	and
O	it

O	thee
O	to
O	some

O	.
O	'
O	'
O	It
O	would
O	be
O	better
O	so
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	but
O	I
O	fear
O	me

O	have
O	my
O	death-wound
O	.
O	'
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	rested
O	Sir
O	Lucan
O	tried
O	to
O	rise
O	,
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	take
O	up
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	'
O	I
O	may
O	not

O	he
O	cried
O	,
O	his

O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	'
O	my
O	brain
O	works
O	so
O	.
O	'
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	the
O	knight
O	staggered
O	to
O	his
O	feet
O	and
O	lifted
O	up
O	the
O	feet
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	effort
O	was
O	too
O	much
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	deathly
O	groan
O	he
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	twitched
O	and
O	struggled
O	a
O	little
O	he
O	lay
O	dead
O	.
O	'
O	Alas
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	this
O	is
O	to
O	me
O	a
O	full
O	heavy
O	sight
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	this
O	noble
O	knight
O	so
O	die
O	for
O	my
O	sake
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	not
O	complain
O	,
O	so
O	set
O	was
O	he
O	to
O	help
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	his
O	heart
O	has
O	broken
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	and
O	kissed
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	closed
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	'
O	Now
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	come
O	hither
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	Bedevere
O	,
O	for
O	my
O	time
O	goeth
O	fast
O	and
O	I
O	remember
O	me
O	of
O	a
O	promise
O	.
O	Therefore
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	bade
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	,
O	'
O	do
O	thou
O	take
O	Excalibur
O	,
O	my
O	good
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	go
O	with
O	it
O	beyond
O	the
O	combe
O	side
O	there
O	where
O	a
O	low
O	thorn
O	grows
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	thou
O	comest
O	there
O	,
O	I
O	charge
O	thee
O	,
O	throw
O	my
O	sword
O	in
O	that
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	come
O	again
O	and
O	tell
O	me
O	what
O	thou
O	seest
O	.
O	'
O	So
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	departed
O	with
O	the
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	way
O	he
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	how
O	noble
O	was
O	the
O	blade
O	and
O	how
O	shining
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	the
O	pommel
O	and
O	haft
O	were
O	full
O	of
O	precious
O	stones
O	.
O	'
O	If
O	I
O	throw
O	this
O	sword
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	'
O	how
O	great
O	a
O	sin
O	'
O	twould
O	be
O	to
O	waste
O	so
O	noble
O	a
O	weapon
O	.
O	'
O	Therefore
O	he
O	hid
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	branches
O	of
O	the
O	thorn
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	'
O	What
O	sawest
O	thou
O	?
O	'
O	asked
O	the
O	king
O	when
O	Bedevere
O	returned
O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	I
O	saw
O	the
O	wind
O	beat
O	on
O	the
O	waves
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Ye
O	have
O	not
O	done
O	as
O	I
O	bid
O	thee
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	'
O	Now
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	do
O	thou
O	go
O	again
O	and
O	do

O	I
O	bid
O	thee;
O	and
O	as
O	thou
O	art
O	dear
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	spare
O	it
O	not
O	,
O	but
O	throw
O	it
O	in
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	went
O	back
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	sword
O	in
O	his
O	hand;
O	but
O	again
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	bring
O	himself
O	to
O	throw
O	away
O	that
O	noble
O	sword
O	,
O	so
O	again
O	he
O	hid
O	the
O	sword
O	and
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	'
O	What
O	sawest
O	thou
O	this
O	time

O	the
O	king
O	.
O	'
O	Lord
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Bedevere
O	,
O	'
O	I
O	saw
O	the
O	waters
O	ebb
O	and
O	flow
O	and
O	the
O	sedges
O	trembling
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Ah
O	,
O	traitor
O	untrue
O	!
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	deep
O	sorrow
O	in
O	his
O	voice
O	,
O	'
O	who
O	would
O	have
O	weened

O	dear
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	hast
O	been
O	named
O	a
O	noble
O	knight
O	,
O	would
O	betray
O	me
O	for
O	the
O	jewels
O	on
O	a
O	sword
O	?
O	Now
O	go
O	ye
O	again
O	,
O	I
O	charge
O	thee
O	,
O	and
O	as

O	shalt
O	answer
O	for
O	thy
O	sins
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	day
O	,
O	throw
O	ye
O	the
O	sword
O	far
O	into
O	the
O	waters
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	in
O	heavy
O	mood
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	went
O	the
O	third
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	sword
O	from
O	its
O	hiding-place
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	weapon
O	lest
O	its
O	beauty
O	should
O	soften
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	bound
O	the
O	girdle
O	about
O	the
O	hilt
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	threw
O	the
O	sword
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	might
O	far
O	out
O	over
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	looked
O	,
O	inwardly
O	lamenting
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	jewels
O	flash
O	in
O	the
O	low
O	light
O	as
O	the
O	sword
O	passed
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	.
O	Then
O	suddenly
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	neared
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	he
O	marvelled
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	great
O	arm
O	and
O	hand
O	come
O	up
O	through
O	the
O	waves
O	.
O	The
O	hand
O	caught
O	the
O	weapon
O	by
O	the
O	haft
O	,
O	shook
O	it
O	and
O	brandished
O	it
O	thrice
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	vanished
O	with
O	the
O	sword
O	under
O	the
O	waves
O	.
O	With
O	some
O	fear
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	.
O	'
O	It
O	is
O	well
O	,

O	the
O	king
O	.
O	'

O	some

O	,
O	for

O	Then
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	took
O	the
O	king
O	upon
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	thinking
O	that

O	would
O	find
O	some
O	road
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	which
O	should
O	lead
O	them
O	to
O	a
O	hamlet
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	along
O	,

O	passed
O	by
O	the
O	waterside
O	,
O	near
O	the
O	low
O	thorn
O	whence
O	he
O	had
O	thrown
O	the
O	sword
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	There
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	sedges
O	,
O	he
O	marvelled
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	barge
O	draped
O	all
O	in
O	black
O	cloth
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	it
O	sat
O	many
O	fair
O	ladies
O	,
O	all
O	with
O	black
O	hoods
O	on
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	saw
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	with
O	the
O	king
O	upon
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	they
O	shrieked
O	and
O	wept
O	.
O	And
O	one
O	that

O	a
O	queen
O	,
O	so
O	fair
O	and
O	stately
O	,
O	yet
O	so
O	sad
O	was
O	she
O	,
O	held
O	out
O	her
O	arms
O	towards
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	unto
O	him
O	in
O	a

O	wondrous
O	sweet
O	,
O	'

O	'
O	Put
O	me

O	the
O	king
O	to
O	Bedevere
O	,
O	'
O	for
O	there
O	I
O	shall

O	'
O	Softly
O	did
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	lay
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	barge
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fair
O	ladies
O	wept
O	over
O	the
O	king
O	with
O	much
O	mourning
O	,

O	laid
O	his

O	in
O	her
O	lap
O	and

O	Then
O	,
O	without

O	to
O	the
O	letter

O	squire
O	of
O	his
O	to
O	go
O	across
O	to
O	Brittany
O	,
O	to
O	tell
O	Sir

O	of
O	all
O	that

O	passed
O	and
O	how
O	King

O	longed
O	for
O	his

O	his
O	love
O	.
O	Nigh
O	mad
O	with
O	grief
O	was
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	learned
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	deep
O	was
O	his
O	sorrow
O	and
O	so
O	wild
O	was
O	his
O	regret
O	,
O	that
O	hardly
O	could
O	he
O	wait
O	till

O	him
O	and

O	across
O	to
O	Britain
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	arrived
O	at
O	Dover
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	sought
O	out
O	the
O	tomb
O	of
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	with
O	much
O	weeping
O	he
O	prayed
O	long
O	and
O	earnestly
O	for
O	the
O	repose
O	of
O	the
O	soul
O	of
O	that
O	dead
O	warrior
O	,
O	his
O	once
O	dear
O	friend
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	other
O	knights
O	prayed
O	likewise
O	for
O	the
O	soul
O	of
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	gave
O	one
O	hundred
O	pounds
O	for
O	masses
O	to
O	be
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	others
O	gave
O	according
O	to
O	their
O	means
O	.
O	Then
O	word
O	was
O	brought
O	him
O	of
O	the
O	daylong
O	dreadful
O	battle
O	in
O	the
O	west
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	King
O	Arthur
O	was
O	gone
O	,
O	mortally
O	wounded
O	,
O	none
O	knew
O	whither
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	were
O	dead
O	.
O	Silent
O	was
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	at
O	this
O	news
O	,
O	but
O	men
O	saw
O	how
O	his
O	stern
O	face
O	paled;
O	and
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	he
O	walked
O	apart
O	and
O	would
O	suffer
O	none
O	to
O	speak
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	could
O	see
O	how
O	his
O	looks
O	had
O	changed
O	.
O	Grief
O	was
O	deeply
O	lined
O	upon
O	his
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	the
O	air
O	of
O	an
O	aged
O	and
O	weary
O	man
O	.
O	'
O	My
O	fair
O	lords
O	,

O	he
O	said
O	,

O	thank
O	you
O	all
O	for
O	your
O	coming
O	with
O	me
O	,

O	we
O	came
O	too
O	late
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	I
O	go
O	alone
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	my
O	dear
O	lord
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	I
O	may
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	see
O	my
O	lady
O	,
O	Queen
O	Gwenevere
O	.
O	And
O	do
O	ye
O	all
O	go
O	back
O	into
O	your
O	country
O	,
O	for
O	now
O	we
O	have
O	no
O	place
O	in
O	this
O	.
O	'
O	Thus
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	fared
O	forth
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	suffer
O	none
O	to
O	go
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	First
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	Amesbury
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	convent
O	there
O	he
O	saw
O	Queen
O	Gwenevere
O	.
O	Few
O	but
O	very
O	sad
O	were
O	the
O	words
O	they
O	spake
O	.
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	offered
O	to
O	give
O	her
O	a
O	home
O	in
O	Brittany
O	,
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	trouble
O	and
O	the
O	ruin
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	would
O	not
O	.
O	'
O	My
O	lord
O	is
O	dead
O	,
O	'
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	weeping
O	,
O	'
O	and
O	this
O	dear
O	kingdom
O	may
O	not
O	long
O	stand
O	,
O	but
O	while
O	I
O	live
O	I
O	will
O	stay
O	on
O	its
O	dear
O	soil
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	fared
O	far
O	west
O	through
O	the
O	wastelands
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	battlefield;
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	wept
O	sorely
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	long
O	lines
O	of
O	dead
O	.
O	Many
O	were
O	the
O	dead
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	whom
O	he
O	found
O	unburied
O	,
O	and
O	these
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	hands
O	he
O	laid
O	in
O	the
O	grave
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	procured
O	a
O	priest
O	to
O	say
O	prayers
O	over
O	them
O	.
O	Further
O	he
O	went
O	beside
O	the
O	shores
O	of
O	the
O	Endless
O	Waters
O	,
O	until
O	one
O	day
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	black
O	barge
O	,
O	and
O	stepping
O	therein
O	he
O	was
O	taken
O	without
O	sail
O	or
O	oars
O	far
O	over
O	the
O	wide
O	sea
O	,
O	until
O	the
O	twilight
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	raising
O	his
O	sorrowing
O	eyes
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	aware
O	of
O	a
O	fair
O	green
O	island
O	with
O	a
O	valley
O	between
O	two
O	sweet
O	hills
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	chapel
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	about
O	it
O	were
O	trees
O	all
O	laden
O	with
O	blossoms
O	.
O	A
O	little
O	bell
O	began
O	to
O	ring
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	barge
O	lightly
O	touched
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	stepping
O	therefrom
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	chapel
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	mass
O	.
O	Afterwards
O	a
O	bishop
O	came
O	unto
O	him
O	where
O	he
O	kneeled
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	hermit
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	latter
O	seized
O	his
O	hand;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	looked
O	up
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	knew
O	it
O	for
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	.
O	Neither
O	could
O	speak
O	for
O	the
O	great
O	tears
O	that
O	rolled
O	down
O	their
O	grim
O	faces
O	,
O	but
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	drew
O	him
O	forth
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	to
O	where
O	a
O	great
O	white
O	marble
O	slab
O	was
O	lying
O	,
O	freshly
O	cut
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	midmost
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	chapel
O	.
O	Thereon
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	saw
O	the
O	words
O	,
O	cut
O	deep
O	and
O	wide
O	,
O	in
O	black
O	letters
O	:
O	HIC
O	JACET
O	ARTHURUS
O	REX
O	QUONDAM
O	REX
O	QUE
O	FUTURUS
O	Then
O	did
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	almost
O	burst
O	with
O	sorrow;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	finished
O	praying
O	and
O	weeping
O	,
O	he
O	kneeled
O	unto
O	the
O	bishop
O	and
O	prayed
O	him
O	to
O	shrive
O	him
O	and
O	assoil
O	him
O	.
O	Afterwards
O	he
O	besought
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	live
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	holy
O	man
O	granted
O	his
O	request
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	ever
O	after
O	did
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	putting
O	off
O	all
O	the
O	fame
O	and
O	glory
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	gotten
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	pass
O	all
O	his
O	days
O	and
O	nights
O	,
O	serving
O	God
O	with
O	prayers
O	and
O	fastings
O	and
O	much
O	abstinence
O	.
O	When
O	,
O	within
O	a
O	year
O	,
O	Queen
O	Gwenevere
O	died
O	in
O	her
O	cell
O	at
O	Amesbury
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	having
O	been
O	advised
O	in
O	a
O	dream
O	of
O	her
O	death
O	,
O	braved
O	the
O	bands
O	of
O	lawless
O	men
O	that
O	now
O	ravaged
O	the
O	fair
O	land
O	of
O	Britain
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	her
O	body
O	to
O	the
O	isle
O	of
O	Glastonbury
O	.
O	He
O	laid
O	it
O	solemnly
O	beside
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	her
O	dear
O	lord
O	Arthur
O	,
O	and
O	thereafter

O	endured
O	greater
O	penance
O	.

O	For

O	,
O	'
O	by
O	my
O	stiffnecked

O	I
O	had
O	gone
O	straightway
O	to

O	myself
O	upon
O	his
O	love
O	and
O	justice
O	,
O	my
O	lady
O	the
O	queen
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	been
O	led
O	to
O	the
O	stake
O	,

O	I
O	should

O	never

O	forgive
O	me
O	.
O	'
O	Thus
O	evermore
O	he
O	prayed
O	and
O	mourned
O	,
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	,
O	but
O	sometimes
O	he
O	slumbered
O	a
O	broken
O	sleep
O	.
O	He
O	ate
O	but
O	little
O	,
O	and
O	neither
O	the
O	bishop
O	nor
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	could
O	make
O	him
O	take
O	comfort
O	.
O	And
O	if
O	you
O	would
O	know
O	the
O	time
O	and
O	place
O	where
O	Lancelot
O	was
O	happiest
O	,
O	it

O	on

O	morn
O	in

O	,
O	but
O	with
O	a
O	gentle
O	smile
O	upon

O	And
O	when
