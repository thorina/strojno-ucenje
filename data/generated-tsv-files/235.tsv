O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	country
O	of
O	mountains
O	which
O	bordered
O	upon
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	dwelt
O	a
O	rich
O	merchant
O	who
O	had
O	three
O	sons
O	.
O	The
O	eldest
O	and
O	the
O	second-born
O	were
O	his
O	joy
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	merchants
O	too
O	,
O	and
O	remained
O	at
O	his
O	side
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	youngest
O	often
O	caused
O	him
O	much
O	anxiety
O	.
O	Not
O	that
O	this
O	youngest
O	son
O	was
O	a
O	wild
O	or
O	a
O	bad
O	lad
O	;
O	but
O	love
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	desire
O	for
O	adventure
O	ran
O	like
O	fire
O	in
O	his
O	veins
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	bring
O	himself
O	to
O	sit
O	beside
O	his
O	father
O	and
O	his
O	brothers
O	in
O	the
O	counting-house
O	.
O	Weary
O	at
O	length
O	of
O	the
O	constant
O	reproaches
O	of
O	his
O	kinsmen
O	,
O	he
O	turned
O	away
O	one
O	night
O	from
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	and
O	joined
O	a
O	ship
O	as
O	a
O	common
O	sailor
O	.
O	Clad
O	in
O	sailor
O	blue
O	,
O	wearing
O	a
O	little
O	cap
O	,
O	a
O	blouse
O	open
O	at
O	the
O	throat
O	,
O	and
O	trousers
O	cut
O	wide
O	at
O	the
O	bottoms
O	,
O	the
O	runaway
O	lad
O	sailed
O	over
O	the
O	sea
O	to
O	foreign
O	lands
O	and
O	isles
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	the
O	years
O	passed
O	,
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	no
O	tidings
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	his
O	father
O	and
O	his
O	brothers
O	gave
O	him
O	up
O	for
O	lost
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	rich
O	merchant
O	and
O	his
O	son
O	dwelt
O	loved
O	rare
O	gems
O	and
O	precious
O	stones
O	more
O	than
O	anything
O	else
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	Hidden
O	secretly
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	deep
O	foundations
O	of
O	his
O	castle
O	lay
O	his
O	treasure-room
O	:

O	was
O	circular
O	in

O	and
O	built
O	of
O	black
O	marble
O	,

O	at

O	distance
O	one
O	from
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	along
O	the
O	curving
O	wall
O	,
O	stood
O	a
O	hundred
O	statues
O	of
O	armed
O	men
O	,
O	holding
O	ever-burning
O	lights
O	.
O	A
O	hundred
O	coffers
O	of
O	green
O	stone
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	one
O	at
O	the
O	base
O	of
O	each
O	statue
O	,
O	each
O	coffer
O	piled
O	high
O	with
O	gems
O	.
O	Night
O	after
O	night
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	was
O	still
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	would
O	descend
O	to
O	the
O	secret
O	chamber
O	,
O	and
O	throwing
O	open
O	the
O	covers
O	of
O	the
O	jewel-chests
O	,
O	would
O	gaze
O	long
O	and
O	silently
O	into
O	the
O	gleaming
O	mass
O	within
O	.
O	One
O	night
O	the
O	King
O	led
O	his
O	neighbor
O	,
O	the
O	Emperor
O	of
O	the
O	Seven
O	Isles
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	jewel-room
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	him
O	his

O	.
O	``

O	for
O	the

O	on
O	the
O	morning

O	Many

O	sailed
O	,
O	over

O	the

O	Ships

O	How
O	the
O	broad
O	sails
O	tugged
O	at
O	their

O	as
O	a
O	steady
O	wind

O	their
O	curving

O	the
O	great
O	,
O	still
O	mirror
O	of
O	the
O	summer
O	sea
O	,

O	vessel
O	,
O	with

O	as

O	The
O	merchant
O	anchored
O	his
O	ship
O	in
O	a
O	quiet
O	bay
O	,
O	and
O	hastened
O	ashore
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	Lord
O	Treasurer
O	of
O	the
O	Kingdom
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	this

O	a
O	balcony

O	Upon

O	story
O	,
O	the
O	nobleman
O	started
O	with

O	Dawn
O	,
O	I
O	sold
O	the

O	only
O	an
O	hour
O	ago
O	to
O	the
O	master
O	of
O	a
O	strange
O	vessel
O	.
O	See
O	,
O	there
O	she
O	is
O	now
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	the
O	Lord
O	Treasurer
O	pointed
O	out
O	over
O	the
O	sea
O	to
O	the
O	black
O	ship
O	with
O	the
O	red
O	sails
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	just
O	then
O	disappearing
O	over
O	the
O	horizon
O	.
O	Thankful
O	that
O	the
O	other
O	ship
O	was
O	still
O	in

O	,
O	the
O	merchant
O	hurried
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	vessel
O	and
O	gave
O	chase
O	.
O	Luckily
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	full
O	moon
O	that
O	night
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	the
O	shadowy
O	hulk
O	and
O	the
O	swaying
O	masts
O	of
O	the
O	mysterious
O	ship
O	could
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	they
O	sailed
O	,
O	but
O	never
O	an
O	inch
O	nearer
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	vessel
O	did
O	they
O	come
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	merchant
O	loaded
O	his
O	ship
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	canvas
O	she
O	could
O	bear
O	.
O	Another
O	night
O	and
O	another
O	day
O	found
O	them
O	no
O	nearer
O	.
O	Finally
O	,
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	of
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	storm
O	came
O	sailing
O	over
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	;
O	a
O	blast
O	of
O	wind
O	struck
O	the
O	merchant
O	'
O	s
O	ship
O	,
O	then
O	a
O	torrent
O	of
O	rain
O	,
O	and
O	night
O	came
O	on
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	storm
O	was
O	at
O	its
O	height
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	daylight
O	came
O	again
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	ship
O	had
O	completely
O	disappeared
O	;
O	and
O	though
O	the
O	worried
O	merchant
O	sailed
O	here
O	and
O	sailed
O	there
O	,
O	never
O	a
O	sign
O	of
O	the
O	stranger
O	could
O	he
O	find
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	heavy
O	heart
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	up
O	the
O	quest
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	King
O	with
O	the
O	evil
O	tidings
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	,
O	I
O	hardly
O	need
O	say
O	,
O	was
O	beside
O	himself
O	with
O	rage
O	and
O	disappointment
O	.
O	Scowling
O	so
O	terribly
O	that
O	his
O	eyebrows
O	almost
O	met
O	,
O	he
O	cried
O	to
O	the
O	merchant
O	:
O	--
O	``
O	Wretch

O	you

O	!
O	If

O	``
O	On
O	hearing
O	these
O	terrible
O	words
O	,
O	the
O	merchant
O	turned
O	pale
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	more
O	idea
O	where
O	the
O	Emerald
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	than
O	had
O	a
O	new-born
O	child
O	.
O	His
O	two
O	sons
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	heard
O	his
O	story
O	,
O	bade
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	despair
O	,
O	and
O	declared
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	that
O	very
O	night
O	go
O	forth
O	and
O	seek
O	the
O	emerald
O	through
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	poor
O	merchant
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	to
O	be
O	left
O	quite
O	alone
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	finally
O	agreed
O	that
O	only
O	the
O	eldest
O	son
O	should
O	go
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	the
O	jewel
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	second-born
O	should
O	remain
O	at
O	home
O	.
O	This
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	was
O	much
O	against
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	the
O	second
O	son
O	;
O	nevertheless
O	,
O	so
O	it
O	was
O	arranged
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	the
O	eldest
O	son
O	sailed
O	away
O	.
O	The
O	days
O	lengthened
O	into
O	weeks
O	,
O	the
O	weeks
O	into
O	months
O	,
O	the
O	months
O	into
O	a
O	year
O	,
O	yet
O	the
O	eldest
O	son
O	did
O	not
O	return
O	.
O	A
O	guard
O	of
O	soldiers
O	led
O	the
O	unhappy
O	merchant
O	before
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	``
O	Well
O	,
O	have
O	you
O	found
O	the
O	Emerald

O	``
O	said
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	``
O	No
O	,
O	``
O	replied
O	the
O	merchant
O	,
O	hopelessly
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	all
O	would
O	certainly
O	have
O	been
O	over
O	with
O	the
O	poor
O	merchant
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	his
O	second
O	son
O	begged
O	and
O	pleaded
O	with
O	the
O	King
O	for
O	a
O	year
O	of
O	respite
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	might
O	search
O	for
O	the
O	emerald
O	through
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	Though
O	at
O	first
O	unwilling
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	at
O	length
O	yielded
O	to
O	the
O	plea
O	,
O	but
O	exacted
O	one
O	half
O	of
O	the
O	merchant
O	'
O	s
O	possessions
O	as
O	a
O	forfeit
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	the
O	second
O	son
O	sailed
O	away
O	.
O	Days
O	lengthened
O	into
O	weeks
O	,
O	weeks
O	lengthened
O	into
O	months
O	,
O	the
O	months
O	into
O	a
O	year
O	,
O	yet
O	the
O	second
O	son
O	did
O	not
O	return
O	.
O	Cruel
O	storms
O	wrecked
O	so
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	merchant
O	'
O	s
O	ships
O	that
O	he
O	lost
O	the
O	other
O	half
O	of
O	his
O	possessions
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	take
O	refuge
O	in
O	a
O	miserable
O	cottage
O	by
O	the
O	marshes
O	beyond
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	last
O	night
O	of
O	the
O	year
O	granted
O	to
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	the
O	unhappy
O	man
O	sat
O	in
O	his
O	poor
O	house
O	by
O	a
O	crumbling
O	driftwood
O	fire
O	,
O	listening
O	to
O	the
O	surf
O	breaking
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	that
O	edged
O	the
O	marsh
O	.
O	Far
O	away
O	,
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	bells
O	of
O	the
O	royal
O	city
O	sound
O	the
O	midnight
O	hour
O	.
O	Neither
O	the
O	eldest
O	son
O	nor
O	the
O	second-born
O	had
O	returned
O	.
O	The
O	second
O	year
O	of
O	respite
O	was
O	at
O	an
O	end
O	;
O	nothing
O	now
O	could
O	stay
O	the
O	anger
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	vigorous
O	rat-tat-tat
O	on
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	lost
O	,
O	``
O	murmured
O	the
O	poor
O	merchant
O	to
O	himself
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	soldiers
O	are
O	already
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	advancing
O	unsteadily
O	across
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	he
O	threw
O	the
O	door
O	open
O	wide
O	.
O	A
O	gust
O	of
O	wind
O	from
O	the
O	sea
O	blew
O	in
O	,
O	which
O	bent
O	back
O	the
O	flame
O	of
O	the
O	taper
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	across
O	the
O	threshold
O	stepped
O	the
O	youngest
O	son
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	still
O	a
O	sailor
O	and
O	clad
O	in
O	sailor
O	blue
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	cutlass
O	in
O	his
O	belt
O	.
O	So
O	shaken
O	with
O	joy
O	was
O	the
O	merchant
O	that
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	utter
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	but
O	merely
O	clung
O	to
O	the
O	strong
O	shoulders
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	seaman
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	sailor
O	son
O	,
O	he
O	managed
O	to
O	let
O	his
O	father
O	know
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	returned
O	from
O	distant
O	lands
O	only
O	that
O	very
O	evening
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	just
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	disasters
O	which
O	had
O	overtaken
O	his
O	family
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	talked
O	,
O	steps
O	were
O	heard
O	outside
O	;
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	without
O	waiting
O	to
O	knock
O	,
O	a
O	sergeant
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	guard
O	forced
O	open
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	followed
O	by
O	a
O	handful
O	of
O	soldiers
O	,
O	entered
O	the
O	wretched
O	room
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	merchant
O	and
O	his
O	son
O	prisoners
O	.
O	They
O	spent
O	the
O	night
O	on
O	the
O	straw
O	in
O	the
O	royal
O	dungeons
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	were
O	led
O	before
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	On
O	seeing
O	the
O	merchant
O	,
O	the
O	irate
O	King
O	scowled
O	more
O	angrily
O	than
O	ever
O	,
O	--
O	for
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	the
O	Emerald
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	had
O	never
O	ceased
O	from
O	troubling
O	him
O	,
O	--
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	--
O	``
O	Well
O	,
O	have
O	you
O	found

O	Emerald
O	of

O	``
O	``
O	No

O	said
O	the
O	poor
O	merchant
O	.
O	``
O	Summon
O	the
O	executioner
O	!
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	the
O	poor
O	man
O	would
O	certainly
O	have
O	bade
O	farewell
O	to
O	earth
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	the
O	youngest
O	son
O	,
O	like
O	his
O	brothers
O	,
O	interceded
O	with
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	the
O	King
O	would
O	hear
O	not
O	a
O	word
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	to
O	his
O	guard
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	prisoners
O	instantly
O	away
O	;
O	but
O	it
O	being
O	whispered
O	that
O	the
O	sailor
O	,
O	although
O	not
O	much
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	lad
O	,
O	had
O	once
O	fought
O	bravely
O	and
O	been
O	sorely
O	wounded
O	in
O	the
O	royal
O	service
O	,
O	he
O	at
O	length
O	gave
O	ear
O	to
O	the
O	youngest
O	son
O	'
O	s
O	prayer
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	--
O	``
O	Yes
O	,
O	you
O	shall
O	have
O	another
O	year
O	.
O	But
O	know

O	this
O	year

O	within
O	a
O	twelvemonth
O	,
O	nothing
O	shall
O	save
O	you

O	I
O	have
O	spoken
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	thus
O	the
O	sailor
O	son
O	went
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	the
O	Emerald
O	.
O	What
O	happened
O	to
O	him
O	upon
O	his
O	search
O	,
O	in
O	what
O	situation
O	he
O	discovered

O	the
O	City
O	under
O	the
O	Sea
O	,
O	you
O	shall
O	shortly
O	hear
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	youngest
O	son
O	had
O	a
O	little
O	boat
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	so
O	small
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	wind
O	no
O	longer
O	filled
O	its
O	sails
O	,
O	it
O	could
O	be
O	rowed
O	along
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	this
O	boat
O	the
O	sailor
O	lad
O	began
O	his
O	voyage
O	.
O	From
O	harbor
O	to
O	harbor
O	,
O	from
O	nation
O	to
O	nation
O	,
O	he
O	sailed
O	,
O	but
O	never
O	a
O	soul
O	he
O	found
O	who
O	could
O	tell
O	him
O	aught
O	of
O	the
O	strange
O	black
O	ship
O	with
O	the
O	fiery
O	sails
O	or
O	the
O	lost
O	Emerald
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	.
O	Even
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	Land
O	of
O	the
O	Dawn
O	could
O	tell
O	him
O	only
O	that
O	the
O	gem
O	had
O	been
O	sold
O	to
O	an
O	unknown
O	prince
O	.
O	Presently
O	the
O	winter
O	of
O	the
O	year
O	overtook
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	sudden
O	storms
O	that
O	heralded
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	the
O	cold
O	,
O	his
O	little
O	boat
O	went
O	ashore
O	on
O	a
O	rocky
O	coast
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	soon
O	pounded
O	to
O	pieces
O	by
O	the
O	breakers
O	.
O	Thrown
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	during
O	the
O	wreck
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	was
O	himself
O	so
O	tossed
O	and
O	trampled
O	by
O	the
O	waves
O	that
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	shore
O	far
O	more
O	dead
O	than
O	alive
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	had
O	it
O	not
O	been
O	for
O	a
O	poor
O	fisherman
O	and
O	his

O	,
O	there
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	no
O	more
O	story
O	to
O	tell
O	.
O	These
O	good
O	people
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	glad
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	rescued
O	the
O	sailor
O	from
O	the
O	fury
O	of
O	the
O	waters
O	and
O	nursed
O	him
O	back
O	to
O	health
O	and
O	strength
O	again
O	.
O	When
O	his
O	strength
O	was
O	quite
O	restored
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	told
O	this
O	good
O	couple
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	how
O	he
O	had
O	gone
O	forth

O	starfish
O	or
O	great
O	snail
O	.
O	Down
O	and
O	down
O	and
O	down
O	went
O	the
O	sailor
O	.
O	Presently
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	lapping
O	of
O	wavelets
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	after
O	,
O	he
O	felt
O	himself
O	advancing
O	into
O	deepening
O	water
O	.
O	Stopping
O	for
O	an
O	instant
O	,
O	he
O	put
O	on
O	the
O	golden
O	ring
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	walking
O	on
O	again
O	,
O	he
O	felt
O	the
O	water
O	rise
O	from
O	his
O	ankles
O	to
O	his
O	waist
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	his
O	waist
O	to
O	his
O	throat
O	.
O	One
O	step
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	water
O	closed
O	over
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	Once
O	under
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	hesitated
O	,
O	uncertain
O	as
O	to
O	which
O	way
O	to
O	turn
O	.
O	Little
O	by
O	little
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	his
O	eyes
O	grew
O	accustomed
O	to
O	the
O	touch
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	,
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	bottom
O	a
O	few
O	feet
O	ahead
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	a
O	small
O	ball
O	glowing
O	with
O	a
O	pale
O	phosphorescent
O	light
O	.
O	Stooping
O	to
O	touch
O	this
O	strange
O	object
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	discovered
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	small
O	round
O	sea-plant
O	which
O	had
O	anchored
O	itself
O	to
O	a
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	he
O	discovered
O	that
O	this
O	light
O	was
O	but
O	one
O	of
O	thousands
O	which
O	together
O	formed
O	a
O	long
O	straight
O	line
O	across
O	the
O	level
O	floor
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Rightly
O	imagining
O	these
O	lights
O	to
O	be
O	signs
O	of
O	a
O	sea-world
O	road
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	advanced
O	along
O	them
O	.
O	A
O	slow
O	walk
O	of
O	ten
O	long
O	leagues
O	brought
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	City
O	under
O	the
O	Sea
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	very
O	little
O	light
O	there
O	,
O	save
O	for
O	that
O	which
O	came
O	through
O	the
O	waters
O	from
O	the
O	world
O	above
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	was
O	but
O	a
O	faint
O	,
O	pale
O	green
O	glow
O	,
O	which
O	lay
O	,
O	more
O	like
O	a
O	shadow
O	than
O	a
O	light
O	on
O	the
O	roofs
O	and
O	tower-tops
O	of
O	the
O	submerged
O	town
O	.
O	The
O	sailor
O	walked
O	unchallenged
O	through
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	street
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	Along
O	the
O	broad
O	avenue
O	grew
O	giant
O	sea-plants
O	with
O	brown
O	leaves
O	,
O	set
O	out
O	in
O	rows
O	like
O	trees
O	;
O	and
O	through
O	the
O	foliage
O	which
O	moved
O	heavily
O	in
O	the
O	currents
O	,
O	little
O	fish
O	darted
O	like
O	birds
O	.
O	Many
O	people
O	walked
O	slowly
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	--
O	strange
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	all
O	dressed
O	alike
O	in
O	tight-fitting
O	garments
O	of
O	shining
O	,
O	fish-like
O	scales
O	.
O	The
O	sailor
O	looked
O	into
O	their
O	faces
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	a
O	broad
O	golden
O	ring
O	encircled
O	the
O	pupils
O	of
O	their
O	eyes
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	two
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	distinguished
O	from
O	the
O	others
O	by
O	swords
O	of
O	red
O	stone
O	,
O	moved
O	through
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	seizing
O	the
O	sailor
O	in
O	their
O	webbed
O	hands
O	,
O	hurried
O	him
O	before
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	the
O	Under-Waters
O	.
O	On
O	a
O	coral
O	throne
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	hall
O	roofed
O	with
O	a
O	high
O	circular
O	dome
O	,
O	sat
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	The
O	flowing
O	waters
O	within
O	were
O	bright
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	queer
O	,
O	pale
O	green
O	light
O	pierced
O	through
O	the
O	hall
O	from
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	fountain
O	of
O	light
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	of
O	the
O	floor
O	under
O	the
O	dome
O	.
O	Approaching
O	this
O	shining
O	fountain
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	discovered
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	mass
O	of
O	glowing
O	sea-creatures
O	,
O	living
O	flowers
O	of
O	the
O	deep
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	even
O	as
O	he
O	looked
O	,
O	stirred
O	their
O	mysterious
O	petals
O	.
O	``
O	Welcome
O	,
O	Wearer
O	of
O	the
O	Enchanted
O	Ring
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	staring
O	hard
O	at
O	the
O	sailor
O	with
O	his
O	large
O	golden
O	eyes
O	.
O	``

O	At
O	this
O	command
O	,
O	two
O	youths
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	lifted
O	huge
O	conch-shells
O	to
O	their
O	mouths

O	Great
O	doors
O	instantly
O	opened
O	wide
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	gorgeous
O	procession
O	entered
O	.
O	First
O	,
O	appeared
O	a
O	dozen
O	pages
O	;
O	then
O	,
O	in
O	walked
O	the

O	King

O	a
O	merry
O	young

O	in
O	whom
O	the

O	recognized
O	his
O	second

O	the

O	The

O	leaned
O	over

O	And
O	in
O	the

O	their
O	father

O	away

O	The
O	conches
O	sounded
O	a

O	time
O	.
O	``

O	the
O	ball
O	which
O	followed
O	was
O	at
O	its
O	height
O	,
O	the
O	eldest
O	of
O	the
O	princesses
O	called
O	her
O	sister
O	,
O	the
O	bride
O	,
O	aside
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	:
O	--
O	``
O	We
O	must
O	rid
O	ourselves
O	at
O	once
O	of
O	this
O	newcomer

O	you
O	not
O	see
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	the
O	younger
O	brother
O	of
O	our
O	husbands
O	?
O	I
O	beheld
O	him
O	stretch
O	out
O	his
O	arms
O	to
O	them
O	as
O	they
O	passed
O	.
O	Who
O	can
O	tell
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	may
O	lead
O	them
O	away
O	from
O	us
O	?
O	Let
O	us
O	tell

O	``
O	So
O	said
O	the
O	eldest
O	sister
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	golden
O	eyes
O	.
O	Alas
O	,
O	I
O	fear
O	that
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	under-waters
O	are
O	sometimes
O	quite
O	as
O	shocking
O	as
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	above
O	.
O	Later
O	that
O	evening
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	poor
O	sailor
O	was
O	standing
O	by
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	doors
O	,
O	a
O	dozen
O	or
O	so
O	stout
O	rogues
O	in
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	the
O	eldest
O	sister
O	fell
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	bound
O	him
O	with
O	cords
O	,
O	and
O	dragged
O	him
O	through
O	the
O	water
O	to
O	the
O	royal
O	stables
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	under-waters
O	,
O	having
O	no
O	horses
O	,
O	--
O	for
O	sea
O	horses
O	are
O	but
O	tiny
O	creatures
O	,
O	--
O	had
O	tamed
O	great
O	dolphins
O	to
O	carry
O	them
O	about
O	.
O	A
O	hundred
O	of
O	these
O	monsters
O	,
O	each
O	with
O	a
O	bronze
O	ring
O	in
O	his
O	nose
O	,
O	were
O	ranged
O	along
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	stables
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	fiercest
O	and
O	angriest
O	of
O	them
O	all
O	,
O	the
O	Princess
O	'
O	s
O	servants
O	tied
O	the
O	sailor
O	.
O	How
O	the
O	great
O	fish
O	,
O	fastened
O	to
O	a
O	bar
O	by
O	a
O	chain
O	and
O	his
O	nose-ring
O	,
O	pulled
O	,
O	rolled
O	,
O	swerved
O	aside
O	,
O	and
O	thrashed
O	his
O	tail
O	!
O	But
O	all
O	his
O	twistings
O	were
O	of
O	no
O	avail
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	poor
O	sailor
O	lad
O	was
O	soon
O	fastened
O	to
O	his
O	back
O	with
O	a
O	rope
O	of
O	seaweed
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	creature
O	was
O	released
O	from
O	his
O	chain
O	,
O	given
O	a
O	blow
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	with
O	a
O	whip
O	of
O	shark-skin
O	,
O	and
O	turned
O	into
O	the
O	wilds
O	of
O	the
O	under-waters
O	.
O	For
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	,
O	the
O	fish
O	,
O	frightened
O	at
O	his
O	burden
O	,
O	fled
O	at
O	lightning
O	speed
O	over
O	the
O	roofs
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	and
O	sped
O	on
O	into
O	the
O	lonely
O	plain
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	ceasing
O	his
O	mad
O	flight
O	,
O	he
O	tried
O	again
O	to
O	shake
O	himself
O	free
O	of
O	the
O	sailor
O	.
O	He
O	turned
O	,
O	he
O	leaped
O	,
O	he
O	dived
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	in
O	vain
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	sailor
O	was
O	securely
O	fastened
O	to
O	his
O	back
O	.
O	Terrified
O	anew
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	swift
O	motion
O	of
O	his
O	great
O	fins
O	,
O	he
O	shot
O	violently
O	to
O	one
O	side
O	and
O	rushed
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	into
O	the
O	dark
O	.
O	All
O	that
O	long
O	night
O	he
O	fled
O	.
O	Toward
O	the
O	morning
O	of
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	managed
O	to
O	work
O	one
O	arm
O	free
O	,
O	and
O	draw
O	the
O	cutlass
O	from
O	his
O	waist
O	.
O	With
O	this
O	he
O	made
O	short
O	work
O	of
O	his
O	bonds
O	and
O	rolled
O	off
O	the
O	fish
O	'
O	s
O	back
O	.
O	The
O	great
O	animal
O	,
O	delivered
O	of
O	the
O	weight
O	which
O	had
O	lain
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	rose
O	on
O	the
O	tip
O	of
O	its
O	tail
O	and
O	shot
O	madly
O	toward
O	the
O	surface
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sailor
O	tumbled
O	through
O	the
O	waters
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	.
O	Weak
O	and
O	hungry
O	,
O	the
O	poor
O	young
O	seaman
O	gazed
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	half-gloom
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	himself
O	on
O	the
O	lower
O	slopes
O	of
O	a
O	sunken
O	mountain
O	rising
O	from
O	the
O	ocean
O	floor
O	.
O	In
O	no
O	direction
O	could
O	he
O	find
O	a
O	sign
O	of
O	the
O	City
O	under
O	the
O	Sea
O	.
O	Hoping
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	better
O	from
O	the
O	mountain
O	'
O	s
O	top
O	,
O	he
O	decided
O	to
O	climb
O	it
O	.
O	Strange
O	plants
O	and
O	shells
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	crevices
O	of
O	the
O	weedy
O	rocks
O	,
O	schools
O	of
O	bright
O	fish
O	fled
O	past
O	him
O	like
O	living
O	arrows
O	,
O	and
O	huge
O	crabs
O	scuttled
O	away
O	as
O	he
O	appeared
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	lying
O	on
O	her
O	side
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	ravine
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	ship
O	--
O	the
O	black
O	ship
O	of
O	the
O	Emerald
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	!
O	Weary
O	and
O	weak
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	it
O	took
O	the
O	sailor
O	but
O	a
O	moment
O	to
O	clamber
O	aboard
O	,
O	and
O	hurry
O	past
O	the
O	broken
O	masts
O	into
O	the
O	captain
O	'
O	s
O	cabin
O	.
O	A
O	steady
O	,
O	green
O	radiance
O	shone
O	in
O	one
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	weedy
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	hastening
O	toward
O	it
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	found
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	the
O	Emerald
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	.
O	The
O	box
O	which
O	had
O	enclosed
O	it
O	had
O	rotted
O	away
O	and
O	fallen
O	apart
O	.
O	``
O	Victory
O	!
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	sailor
O	,
O	``
O	victory
O	!
O	The
O	emerald
O	is
O	mine
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	shall
O	save
O	my
O	father
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	took
O	the
O	great
O	jewel
O	from
O	the
O	broken
O	box
O	and
O	rested
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	cup
O	of
O	his
O	two
O	hands
O	.
O	How
O	it
O	glowed
O	on
O	the
O	pale
O	flesh
O	!
O	Then
O	,
O	thrusting
O	it
O	into
O	a
O	pocket
O	and
O	holding
O	onto
O	it
O	with
O	one
O	hand
O	,
O	he
O	hurried
O	out
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	mountainside
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	world
O	above
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	high
O	noon
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	level
O	rays
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	beat
O	deep
O	into
O	the
O	green
O	waters
O	.
O	So
O	bright
O	had
O	the
O	slope
O	become
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	sailor
O	lad
O	felt
O	sure
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	if
O	the
O	mountain-top
O	rose
O	above
O	the
O	waters
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	form
O	an
O	island
O	in
O	the
O	upper
O	world
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	.
O	Climbing
O	on
O	toward
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	first
O	scaled
O	a
O	steep
O	cliff
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	this
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	gentle
O	slope
O	of
O	sand
O	.
O	The
O	sun
O	'
O	s
O	rays
O	now
O	illumined
O	the
O	water
O	so
O	brightly
O	that
O	the
O	air
O	seemed
O	only
O	a
O	little
O	distance
O	away
O	.
O	Presently
O	a
O	beach-crab
O	ran
O	nimbly
O	away
O	from
O	beneath
O	the
O	sailor
O	'
O	s
O	feet
O	.
O	The
O	water
O	grew
O	very
O	much
O	warmer
O	.
O	The
O	shore
O	was
O	at
O	hand
O	!
O	A
O	few
O	steps
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	youngest
O	son
O	emerged
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	of
O	a
O	beautiful
O	isle
O	.
O	Half-blinded
O	by
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	he
O	walked
O	toward
O	the
O	dry
O	land
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	found
O	some
O	delicious
O	fruits
O	growing
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	rippling
O	brook
O	of
O	crystal
O	water
O	.
O	He
O	ate
O	and
O	drank
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	strength
O	returned
O	.
O	Himself
O	again
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	took
O	the
O	Emerald
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	in
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	cried

O	Now

O	the
O	rivulet
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	drunk
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	both
O	the
O	brothers
O	became
O	pale
O	as
O	death
O	,
O	their
O	eyes
O	opened
O	wide
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	stared
O	as
O	strangely
O	as
O	men
O	suddenly
O	waked
O	from
O	sleep
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	seeing
O	their
O	younger
O	brother
O	,
O	they
O	ran
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	threw
O	their
O	arms
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	a
O	thousand
O	questions
O	about
O	their
O	father
O	and
O	the
O	quest
O	of
O	the
O	emerald
O	.
O	The
O	golden-eyed
O	brides
O	watched
O	them
O	with
O	sad
O	faces
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	broke
O	into
O	quiet
O	tears
O	.
O	Imagine
O	their
O	joy
O	,
O	when
O	their
O	husbands
O	returned
O	to
O	them
O	and
O	bade
O	them
O	be
O	of
O	good
O	cheer
O	.
O	Thus
O	was
O	true
O	love
O	found
O	to
O	be
O	mightier
O	than
O	the
O	mightiest
O	spell
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	princesses
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	had
O	dried
O	their
O	tears
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	and
O	his
O	brothers
O	took
O	counsel
O	as
O	to
O	how
O	the
O	Emerald
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	might
O	be
O	brought
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	in
O	time
O	to
O	save
O	their
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	life
O	.
O	You
O	may
O	judge
O	of
O	the
O	sailor
O	'
O	s
O	horror
O	when
O	he
O	discovered
O	that
O	because
O	of
O	a
O	bad
O	error
O	in
O	the
O	calendars
O	and
O	clocks
O	of
O	Sixes
O	and
O	Sevens
O	(
O	a
O	city
O	he
O	had
O	visited
O	in
O	his
O	search
O	for
O	the
O	emerald
O	)
O	,
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	had
O	been
O	forfeited
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	three
O	days
O	before
O	!
O	But
O	now
O	we
O	must
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	poor
O	merchant
O	himself
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	third
O	year
O	the
O	poor
O	man
O	had
O	lain
O	in
O	a
O	small
O	cell
O	in
O	the
O	royal
O	dungeons
O	,
O	waiting
O	anxiously
O	,
O	oh
O	,
O	so
O	anxiously
O	,
O	to
O	hear
O	the
O	quick
O	step
O	of
O	the
O	sailor
O	son
O	on
O	the
O	winding
O	stairs
O	just
O	outside
O	his
O	prison
O	door
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	year
O	came
O	to
O	an
O	end
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	know
O	,
O	without
O	his
O	return
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	third
O	and
O	last
O	time
O	,
O	the
O	castle
O	guards
O	led
O	the
O	poor
O	man
O	before
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	King
O	had
O	never
O	forgiven
O	the
O	merchant
O	for
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	the
O	jewel
O	;
O	his
O	chagrin
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	had
O	increased
O	with
O	the
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	glad
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	at
O	last
O	take
O	his
O	revenge
O	.
O	``
O	Have
O	you
O	found
O	the
O	Emerald
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	?
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	harshly
O	.
O	He
O	stood
O	erect
O	on
O	the
O	steps
O	of
O	his
O	judgment-seat
O	,
O	arms
O	folded
O	,
O	eyes
O	fixed
O	in
O	a
O	fierce
O	,
O	black
O	frown
O	.
O	``
O	No
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	merchant
O	quietly
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	you
O	shall
O	seek
O	for
O	it
O	yourself
O	,
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	gave
O	orders
O	that
O	the
O	merchant
O	be
O	tied
O	hand
O	and
O	foot
O	,
O	and
O	tossed
O	into
O	a
O	little
O	boat
O	without
O	food
O	or
O	drink
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	sent
O	adrift
O	to
O	die
O	helplessly
O	in
O	the
O	lonely
O	seas
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	this
O	awful
O	sentence
O	was
O	carried
O	out
O	.
O	Bound
O	hand
O	and
O	foot
O	,
O	scarce
O	able
O	to
O	roll
O	from
O	side
O	to
O	side
O	,
O	the
O	merchant
O	lay
O	motionless
O	in
O	his
O	little
O	craft
O	and
O	stared
O	up
O	at
O	the
O	blue
O	sky
O	.
O	Presently
O	a
O	merciful
O	sleep
O	overcame
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	while
O	he
O	slept
O	,
O	a
O	wind
O	arose
O	which
O	swept
O	the
O	little
O	boat
O	along
O	with
O	it
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	beautiful
O	island
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	and
O	his
O	companions
O	,
O	stunned
O	at
O	their
O	discovery
O	,
O	began
O	preparations
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	under-waters
O	.
O	Just
O	as
O	the
O	twilight
O	fell
O	,
O	all
O	walked
O	together
O	to
O	the
O	margin
O	of
O	the
O	darkening
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	advanced
O	into
O	the
O	waves
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	,
O	whose
O	eyes
O	were
O	the
O	keenest
O	,
O	saw
O	a
O	little
O	boat
O	rapidly
O	drifting
O	ashore
O	.
O	Now
O	caught
O	in
O	a
O	current
O	of
O	the
O	shallow
O	beach
O	,
O	it
O	drifted
O	sideways
O	;
O	now
O	propelled
O	by
O	the
O	rising
O	tide
O	,
O	it
O	floated
O	on
O	,
O	bow
O	pointed
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	The
O	sailor
O	hurried
O	toward
O	it
O	and
O	seized
O	it
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	he
O	uttered
O	a
O	ringing
O	cry
O	!
O	The
O	old
O	merchant
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	.
O	He
O	still
O	lived
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	could
O	see
O	him
O	gently
O	breathing
O	.
O	Lifting
O	him
O	up
O	tenderly
O	,
O	the
O	three
O	sons
O	carried
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	unloosed
O	his
O	bonds
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	him
O	back
O	to
O	life
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	the
O	merchant
O	was
O	himself
O	again
O	,
O	the
O	sailor
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	the
O	emerald
O	,
O	caused
O	the
O	waves
O	to
O	carry
O	a
O	great
O	ship
O	to
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	this
O	ship
O	the
O	three
O	sons
O	,
O	the
O	two
O	princesses
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	merchant
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	merchant
O	'
O	s
O	country
O	.
O	All
O	landed
O	secretly
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	angry
O	King
O	would
O	seize
O	them
O	if
O	he
O	knew
O	of
O	their
O	return
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	,
O	one
O	night
O	,
O	shortly
O	after
O	the
O	homecoming
O	,
O	word
O	was
O	brought
O	to
O	the
O	sailor
O	that
O	the
O	King
O	had
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	merchant
O	'
O	s
O	escape
O	and
O	was
O	sending
O	guards
O	to
O	arrest
O	the
O	merchant
O	and
O	his
O	companions
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	almost
O	midnight
O	when
O	the
O	sailor
O	lad
O	received
O	the
O	warning
O	.
O	Taking
O	the
O	emerald
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	advanced
O	to
O	a
O	window
O	by
O	the
O	ocean
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	out
O	over
O	the
O	moonlit
O	waters
O	,
O	--
O	``
O	Waters
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	,
O	rise
O	and
O	overwhelm
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	!
O	``
O	Now
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	palace
O	stood
O	apart
O	by
O	itself
O	on
O	a
O	tongue
O	of
O	land
O	running
O	far
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	tide
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	the
O	rising
O	waters
O	were
O	flowing
O	over
O	the
O	marble
O	floors
O	and
O	pouring
O	in
O	through
O	the
O	windows
O	.
O	One
O	by
O	one
O	,
O	the
O	lights
O	in
O	the
O	thousand
O	rooms
O	,
O	touched
O	by
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	hissed
O	,
O	sputtered
O	,
O	and
O	expired
O	.
O	The
O	servants
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	one
O	and
O	all
O	,
O	ran
O	away
O	pell-mell
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	dark
O	castle
O	to
O	its
O	fate
O	.
O	Little
O	by
O	little
O	the
O	advancing
O	water
O	crept
O	from
O	the
O	walls
O	to
O	the
O	balconies
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	balconies
O	to
O	the
O	towers
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	towers
O	to
O	their
O	very
O	tops
O	.
O	Finally
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	moon
O	could
O	see
O	as
O	it
O	shone
O	upon
O	the
O	flood
O	was
O	the
O	weather-vane
O	of
O	the
O	highest
O	turret
O	of
O	all
O	.
O	You
O	should
O	have
O	seen
O	the
O	little
O	waves
O	ripple
O	and
O	break
O	about
O	it
O	!
O	And
O	finally
O	,
O	even
O	the
O	weather-vane
O	disappeared
O	under
O	the
O	black
O	waves
O	.
O	Locked
O	in
O	his
O	secret
O	treasure-room
O	,
O	opening
O	the
O	jewel
O	coffers
O	one
O	after
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	remained
O	quite
O	ignorant
O	of
O	the
O	disaster
O	.
O	For
O	some
O	time
O	no
O	sound
O	reached
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	hidden
O	retreat
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	treasure-room
O	was
O	very
O	thick
O	and
O	strong
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	he
O	heard
O	behind
O	him
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	falling
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	turning
O	toward
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	beheld
O	streams
O	of
O	water
O	gushing
O	through
O	the
O	passages
O	between
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	its
O	frame
O	.
O	Horror-struck
O	,
O	he
O	watched
O	the
O	door
O	burst
O	from
O	its
O	locks
O	and
O	hinges
O	;
O	a
O	roaring
O	cascade
O	of
O	cold
O	sea-water
O	came
O	pouring
O	in
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	moment
O	later
O	the
O	whole
O	castle
O	crumbled
O	and
O	fell
O	to
O	pieces
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	King
O	had
O	met
O	his
O	deserts
O	,
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	who
O	greatly
O	respected
O	the
O	merchant
O	,
O	offered
O	him
O	the
O	crown
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	refused
O	it
O	and
O	conferred
O	it
O	on
O	his
O	two
O	elder
O	sons
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	the
O	country
O	had
O	two
O	kings
O	.
O	Each
O	brother
O	in
O	turn
O	reigned
O	for
O	six
O	months
O	of
O	every
O	year
O	,
O	and
O	spent
O	the
O	other
O	six
O	under
O	the
O	sea
O	with
O	the
O	golden-eyed
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	waters
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	sailor
O	lad
O	,
O	he
O	sailed
O	the
O	sea
O	for
O	many
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	married
O	a
O	pretty
O	niece
O	of
O	the
O	Witch
O	of
O	the
O	Sands
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	like
O	all
O	sailors
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	country
O	to
O	live
O	.
O	His
O	house
O	is
O	built
O	of
O	gray
O	stone
O	,
O	ivy
O	climbs
O	over
O	it

O	lie
O	beneath

O	.
O	And
O	the
O	all
O	lived
O	happily
