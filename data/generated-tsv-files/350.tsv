O	Long

O	,
O	there
O	ruled
O	over
O	Britain
O	a
O	king
O	called
O	Uther
O	Pendragon
O	.
O	A
O	mighty

O	was
O	he
O	,
O	and
O	feared
O	by
O	all
O	men;
O	yet
O	when

O	sought
O	the
O	love
O	of
O	the
O	fair
O	Igraine
O	of
O	Cornwall
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	naught
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	from
O	grief
O	and
O	disappointment
O	,
O	Uther
O	fell
O	sick
O	,
O	and
O	at

O	.
O	Now
O	in

O	lived
O	a
O	famous
O	magician
O	named
O	Merlin
O	,
O	so
O	powerful
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	change
O	his
O	form
O	at

O	,

O	and
O	failed
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	third
O	time
O	,
O	Arthur
O	drew
O	forth
O	the
O	sword
O	.
O	Immediately
O	there
O	arose
O	from
O	the
O	people
O	a
O	great
O	shout
O	:
O	""""
O	Arthur
O	is
O	King
O	!
O	Arthur
O	is
O	King
O	!
O	We
O	will
O	have
O	no
O	King
O	but
O	Arthur;
O	""""
O	and
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	great
O	barons
O	scowled
O	and
O	threatened
O	,
O	they
O	fell
O	on
O	their
O	knees
O	before
O	him
O	while
O	the
O	archbishop
O	placed
O	the
O	crown
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	swore
O	to
O	obey
O	him
O	faithfully
O	as
O	their
O	lord
O	and
O	sovereign
O	.
O	Thus
O	Arthur
O	was
O	made
O	King;
O	and
O	to
O	all
O	he
O	did
O	justice
O	,
O	righting
O	wrongs
O	and
O	giving
O	to
O	all
O	their
O	dues
O	.
O	Nor
O	was
O	he
O	forgetful
O	of
O	those
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	his
O	friends;
O	for
O	Kay
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	loved
O	as
O	a
O	brother
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	seneschal
O	and
O	chief
O	of
O	his
O	household
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	Sir
O	Ector
O	,
O	his
O	foster
O	father
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	broad
O	lands
O	.
