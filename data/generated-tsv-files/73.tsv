O	white
O	or

O	I

O	once
O	upon
O	a

O	Brazilian

O	Perhaps
O	the

O	not

O	the

O	?
O	``
O	I
O	begged

O	to
O	tell
O	me
O	the
O	story

O	this
O	is
O	the
O	tale
O	:
O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	who
O	lived
O	all
O	alone
O	with
O	her
O	little
O	black
O	son
O	who
O	was
O	just
O	as
O	black
O	as
O	black

O	.
O	The
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	had
O	not
O	always
O	lived
O	alone
O	with
O	the
O	little
O	black
O	boy
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	once
O	been
O	the
O	mother
O	of
O	three
O	beautiful
O	daughters
O	,
O	the
O	very
O	loveliest
O	maidens
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	country
O	round
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	so
O	handsome
O	that
O	they
O	attracted
O	the
O	attention
O	of
O	the
O	wicked
O	fairy
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	an
O	enchanted
O	castle
O	nearby
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	fairy
O	had
O	been
O	very
O	jealous
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	By
O	the
O	aid
O	of
O	magic
O	she
O	tied
O	them
O	up
O	in
O	sacks
O	which
O	could
O	be
O	opened
O	only
O	by
O	burning
O	the
O	sacks
O	over
O	a
O	fire
O	built
O	from
O	magic
O	wood
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	and
O	her
O	little
O	black
O	son
O	searched
O	long
O	and
O	diligently
O	for
O	magic
O	wood
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	never
O	able
O	to
O	find
O	any
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	terrible
O	thing
O	to
O	have
O	one
O	'
O	s
O	daughters
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	magic
O	sacks
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	had
O	grown
O	bent
O	and
O	weak
O	and
O	cross
O	in
O	her
O	search
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	magic
O	wood
O	.
O	If
O	it
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	for
O	the
O	little
O	black
O	boy
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	given
O	up
O	entirely
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	black
O	boy
O	was
O	always
O	gay
O	and
O	cheerful
O	and
O	always
O	sure
O	that
O	some
O	day
O	they
O	would
O	succeed
O	in
O	finding
O	the
O	magic
O	wood
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	took
O	her
O	big
O	water
O	jar
O	upon
O	her
O	head
O	and
O	carried
O	it
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	stream
O	to
O	fill
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	so
O	very
O	heavy
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	filled
O	it
O	with
O	water
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	lift
O	it
O	to
O	her
O	head
O	even
O	with
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	black
O	boy
O	.
O	Three
O	fine
O	looking
O	_cavalheiros_
O	happened
O	to
O	be
O	passing
O	on
O	horseback
O	.
O	She
O	sent
O	the
O	little
O	black
O	boy
O	to
O	ask
O	them
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	help
O	her
O	.
O	They
O	said
O	they
O	couldn
O	'
O	t
O	possibly
O	stop
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	was
O	very
O	angry
O	.
O	She
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	magic
O	castle
O	and
O	_couldn
O	'

O	stop
O	.
O	The
O	same
O	wicked
O	fairy
O	who
O	had
O	shut
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	'
O	s
O	beautiful
O	daughters
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	sacks
O	,
O	was
O	leading
O	them
O	on
O	.
O	If
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	had
O	known
O	all
O	about
O	the
O	three
O	_cavalheiros_
O	she
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	been
O	angry
O	.
O	She
O	would
O	have
O	wanted
O	to
O	help
O	them
O	instead
O	.
O	The
O	three
O	_cavalheiros_
O	were
O	very
O	good
O	and
O	very
O	wise
O	,
O	so
O	they
O	managed
O	to
O	get
O	along
O	very
O	well
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	enchanted
O	castle
O	the
O	fairy
O	showed
O	them
O	to
O	their
O	beds
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	marked
O	each
O	bed
O	with
O	a
O	candle
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	before
O	had
O	ever
O	been
O	wise
O	enough
O	to
O	blow
O	out
O	these
O	candles
O	.
O	These
O	_cavalheiros_
O	blew
O	out
O	the
O	candles
O	and
O	that
O	took
O	away
O	the
O	fairy
O	'
O	s
O	power
O	over
O	them
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	able
O	to
O	escape
O	from
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	wicked
O	fairy
O	came
O	to
O	put
O	them
O	in
O	her
O	magic
O	sacks
O	she
O	found
O	the
O	beds
O	empty
O	.
O	The
O	three
O	_cavalheiros_
O	took
O	their
O	horses
O	and
O	rode
O	back
O	by
O	the
O	same
O	road
O	by
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	.
O	They
O	stopped
O	at
O	a
O	little
O	shop
O	on
O	a
O	corner
O	which
O	was
O	kept
O	by
O	a
O	good
O	fairy
O	and
O	bought
O	one
O	_vintem
O	'
O	s_
O	worth
O	of
O	ashes
O	,
O	one
O	_vintem
O	'
O	s_
O	worth
O	of
O	salt
O	and
O	one
O	_vintem
O	'
O	s_
O	worth
O	of
O	pins
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	while
O	the
O	three
O	_cavalheiros_
O	approached
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	black
O	boy
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	was
O	still
O	angry
O	because
O	they
O	had
O	refused
O	to
O	stop
O	and
O	help
O	her
O	lift
O	her
O	water
O	jar
O	to
O	her
O	head
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	saw
O	them
O	coming
O	she
O	threw
O	stones
O	at
O	them
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	that
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	stupid
O	thing
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	three
O	_cavalheiros_
O	saw
O	what
O	was
O	happening
O	they
O	were
O	greatly
O	surprised
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	forgotten
O	all
O	about
O	the
O	little
O	black
O	boy
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	asked
O	them
O	to
O	help
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	saw
O	her
O	coming
O	with
O	the
O	stones
O	they
O	thought
O	that
O	she
O	must
O	be
O	a
O	wicked
O	fairy
O	in
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	.
O	The
O	_cavalheiro_
O	who
O	had
O	one
O	_vintem
O	'
O	s_
O	worth
O	of
O	ashes
O	in
O	his
O	pocket
O	threw
O	the
O	ashes
O	at
O	her
O	.
O	It
O	became
O	night
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	came
O	on
O	with
O	her
O	stones
O	just
O	the
O	same
O	.
O	The
O	_cavalheiro_
O	who
O	had
O	one
O	_vintem
O	'
O	s_
O	worth
O	of
O	salt
O	in
O	his
O	pocket
O	threw
O	the
O	salt
O	at
O	her
O	.
O	Immediately
O	a
O	sea
O	of
O	salt
O	water
O	appeared
O	between
O	the
O	three
O	_cavalheiros_
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	came
O	on
O	with
O	her
O	stones
O	just
O	the
O	same
O	.
O	The
O	_cavalheiro_
O	who
O	had
O	one
O	_vintem
O	'
O	s_
O	worth
O	of
O	pins
O	in
O	his
O	pocket
O	threw
O	the
O	pins
O	at
O	her
O	.
O	Immediately
O	a
O	high
O	,
O	thorny
O	hedge
O	sprang
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	ground
O	between
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	and
O	the
O	three
O	_cavalheiros_
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	was
O	too
O	angry
O	to
O	think
O	clearly
O	.
O	If
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	so
O	angry
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	known
O	at
O	once
O	that
O	this
O	must
O	be
O	magic
O	wood
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	black
O	boy
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	had
O	his
O	wits
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	hastened
O	to
O	gather
O	the
O	branches
O	even
O	though
O	the
O	thorns
O	tore
O	his
O	hands
O	.
O	Soon
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	together
O	a
O	great
O	pile
O	of
O	wood
O	like
O	the
O	piles
O	which
O	they
O	make
O	in
O	the
O	streets
O	to
O	burn
O	on
O	a
O	_festa_
O	night
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	saw
O	what
O	he
O	was
O	doing
O	and
O	ran
O	to
O	get
O	the
O	magic
O	sacks
O	in
O	which
O	her
O	daughters
O	were
O	imprisoned
O	.
O	They
O	laid
O	the
O	sacks
O	on
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	pile
O	of
O	magic
O	wood
O	and
O	lighted
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	like
O	thunder
O	.
O	Out
O	of
O	the
O	three
O	magic
O	sacks
O	there
O	sprang
O	three
O	beautiful
O	maidens
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	preserved
O	alive
O	in
O	the
O	sacks
O	by
O	a
O	miracle
O	of
O	_Nossa
O	Senhora_
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	and
O	her
O	three
O	beautiful
O	daughters
O	turned
O	to
O	thank
O	the
O	little
O	black
O	boy
O	for
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	black
O	boy
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	black
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	turned
O	white
O	.
O	The
O	three
O	_cavalheiros_
O	married
O	the
O	three
O	beautiful
O	maidens
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	boy
O	who
O	was
O	now
O	white
O	,
O	grew
O	up
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	greatest
O	_cavalheiro_
O	of
O	them
O	all
O	.
O	XVI
O	How
O	the
O	Pigeon
O	Became
O	a
O	Tame
O	Bird
O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	father
O	with
O	three
O	sons
O	who
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	age
O	when
O	they
O	must
O	go
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	world
O	to
O	earn
O	their
O	own
O	living
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	time
O	for
O	parting
O	came
O	he
O	gave
O	to
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	a
O	large
O	melon
O	with
O	the
O	advice
O	that
O	they
O	open
O	the
O	melons
O	only
O	at
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	water
O	nearby
O	.
O	The
O	three
O	brothers
O	set
O	out
O	from
O	their
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	,
O	each
O	taking
O	a
O	different
O	path
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	eldest
O	son
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	he
O	opened
O	his
O	melon
O	.
O	A
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	sprang
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	melon
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	Give
O	me
O	water
O	or
O	give
O	me
O	milk
O	.
O	``
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	water
O	nearby
O	and
O	neither
O	did
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	have
O	any
O	milk
O	to
O	give
O	her
O	.
O	She
O	fell
O	down
O	dead
O	.
O	The
O	second
O	son
O	left
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	by
O	a
O	path
O	which
O	led
O	over
O	a
O	steep
O	hill
O	.
O	The
O	large
O	melon
O	was
O	heavy
O	to
O	carry
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	he
O	became
O	very
O	tired
O	and
O	thirsty
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	no
O	water
O	nearby
O	and
O	feared
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	possibility
O	of
O	finding
O	any
O	soon
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	open
O	the
O	melon
O	and
O	use
O	it
O	to
O	quench
O	his
O	thirst
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	he
O	opened
O	his
O	melon
O	.
O	To
O	his
O	great
O	surprise
O	,
O	a
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	sprang
O	forth
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	Give
O	me
O	water
O	or
O	give
O	me
O	milk
O	.
O	``
O	Of
O	course
O	he
O	had
O	neither
O	to
O	give
O	her
O	and
O	she
O	fell
O	down
O	dead
O	.
O	The
O	third
O	son
O	also
O	travelled
O	by
O	a
O	path
O	which
O	led
O	over
O	a
O	steep
O	hill
O	.
O	He
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	became
O	very
O	tired
O	and
O	thirsty
O	and
O	he
O	often
O	thought
O	how
O	much
O	he
O	would
O	like
O	to
O	open
O	his
O	melon
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	he
O	remembered
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	advice
O	to
O	open
O	it
O	only
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	water
O	nearby
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	travelled
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	hoping
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	spring
O	of
O	water
O	on
O	the
O	hillside
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	have
O	the
O	good
O	fortune
O	to
O	pass
O	near
O	a
O	spring
O	either
O	going
O	up
O	the
O	hill
O	or
O	coming
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	opposite
O	side
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	hill
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	town
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	fountain
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	man
O	hurried
O	straight
O	to
O	the
O	fountain
O	and
O	took
O	a
O	long
O	refreshing
O	drink
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	opened
O	his
O	melon
O	.
O	A
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	sprang
O	forth
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	Give
O	me
O	water
O	or
O	give
O	me
O	milk
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	young
O	man
O	gave
O	her
O	a
O	drink
O	of
O	water
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	helped
O	her
O	to
O	a
O	hiding
O	place
O	among
O	the
O	thick
O	branches
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	which
O	grew
O	beside
O	the
O	fountain
O	and
O	went
O	away
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	food
O	.
O	Soon
O	a
O	little
O	black
O	servant
O	girl
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	fountain
O	to
O	fill
O	a
O	big
O	water
O	jar
O	which
O	she
O	carried
O	on
O	her
O	head
O	.
O	The
O	maiden
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	above
O	the
O	fountain
O	peeped
O	out
O	through
O	the
O	branches
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	little
O	black
O	servant
O	girl
O	bent
O	over
O	the
O	water
O	to
O	fill
O	her
O	jar
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	reflection
O	of
O	a
O	charming
O	face
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	``
O	How
O	beautiful
O	I
O	have
O	become
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	said
O	to
O	herself
O	.
O	``
O	How
O	ridiculous
O	that
O	any
O	one
O	as
O	beautiful
O	as
O	I
O	am
O	should
O	carry
O	water
O	on
O	her
O	head
O	.
O	``
O	She
O	threw
O	her
O	water
O	jar
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	in
O	disdain
O	and
O	it
O	broke
O	into
O	a
O	thousand
O	pieces
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	little
O	maid
O	reached
O	home
O	with
O	neither
O	water
O	nor
O	water
O	jar
O	her
O	mistress
O	punished
O	her
O	severely
O	and
O	sent
O	her
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	fountain
O	with
O	a
O	new
O	water
O	jar
O	to
O	fill
O	.
O	This
O	time
O	the
O	maiden
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	gave
O	a
O	little
O	silvery
O	laugh
O	when
O	the
O	black
O	servant
O	girl
O	bent
O	over
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	maid
O	looked
O	up
O	and
O	spied
O	her
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	.
O	``
O	O
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	you
O	,
O	is
O	it
O	,
O	who
O	are
O	responsible
O	for
O	my
O	beating
O	?
O	``
O	she
O	said
O	.
O	She
O	pulled
O	a
O	pin
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	camisa
O	and
O	,
O	reaching
O	up
O	,
O	she
O	stuck
O	it
O	savagely
O	into
O	the
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	.
O	Then
O	a
O	strange
O	thing
O	happened
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	any
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	just
O	a
O	pigeon
O	there
O	.
O	At
O	that
O	moment
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	tree
O	with
O	the
O	food
O	he
O	had
O	procured
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	little
O	black
O	maid
O	heard
O	his
O	footsteps
O	she
O	was
O	frightened
O	nearly
O	to
O	death
O	.
O	She
O	hid
O	herself
O	quickly
O	among
O	the
O	thick
O	branches
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	man
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	surprised
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	little
O	black
O	maid
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	the
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	there
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	has
O	happened
O	to
O	you
O	during
O	my
O	absence
O	``
O	he
O	asked
O	in
O	horror
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	her
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	sun
O	has
O	burned
O	my
O	complexion
O	.
O	That
O	is
O	all
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	nothing
O	.
O	I
O	shall
O	be
O	myself
O	again
O	when
O	I
O	get
O	away
O	from
O	this
O	hot
O	place
O	,
O	``
O	the
O	little
O	maid
O	replied
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	man
O	married
O	the
O	little
O	black
O	maid
O	and
O	took
O	her
O	away
O	out
O	of
O	sunny
O	places
O	hoping
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	soon
O	be
O	again
O	the
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	she
O	was
O	when
O	he
O	left
O	her
O	by
O	the
O	fountain
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	food
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	always
O	remained
O	black
O	.
O	Years
O	passed
O	and
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	became
O	very
O	rich
O	.
O	He
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	beautiful
O	mansion
O	.
O	All
O	around
O	the
O	house
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	wonderful
O	garden
O	full
O	of
O	lovely
O	flowers
O	and
O	splendid
O	trees
O	where
O	birds
O	loved
O	to
O	sing
O	sweet
O	songs
O	and
O	build
O	their
O	nests
O	.
O	In
O	spite
O	of
O	his
O	beautiful
O	home
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	was
O	not
O	very
O	happy
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	trial
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	wife
O	who
O	was
O	so
O	black
O	.
O	He
O	often
O	walked
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	paths
O	in
O	his
O	garden
O	at
O	the
O	close
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	and
O	thought
O	about
O	how
O	beautiful
O	his
O	wife
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	he
O	ever
O	saw
O	her
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	walked
O	in
O	the
O	garden
O	there
O	was
O	always
O	a
O	pigeon
O	which
O	followed
O	him
O	about
O	.
O	It
O	flew
O	about
O	his
O	head
O	in
O	a
O	way
O	that
O	annoyed
O	him
O	,
O	so
O	one
O	day
O	when
O	his
O	wife
O	was
O	sick
O	and
O	asked
O	for
O	a
O	pigeon
O	to
O	be
O	roasted
O	for
O	her
O	dinner
O	he
O	commanded
O	that
O	this
O	particular
O	pigeon
O	should
O	be
O	killed
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	cook
O	was
O	preparing
O	the
O	pigeon
O	for
O	her
O	mistress
O	to
O	eat
O	for
O	dinner
O	she
O	noticed
O	a
O	black
O	speck
O	on
O	the
O	pigeon
O	'
O	s
O	breast
O	.
O	She
O	thought
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	speck
O	of
O	dirt
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	brush
O	it
O	away
O	.
O	To
O	her
O	surprise
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	brush
O	it
O	off
O	easily
O	because
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	pin
O	firmly
O	embedded
O	in
O	the
O	pigeon
O	'
O	s
O	breast
O	.
O	She
O	pulled
O	and
O	pulled
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	pull
O	it
O	out
O	so
O	she
O	sent
O	for
O	her
O	master
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	see
O	what
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	to
O	remove
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	at
O	once
O	pulled
O	out
O	the
O	pin
O	and
O	then
O	a
O	wonderful
O	thing
O	happened
O	.
O	The
O	pigeon
O	was
O	transformed
O	into
O	a
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	.
O	He
O	at
O	once
O	recognised
O	her
O	as
O	the
O	same
O	lovely
O	maiden
O	who
O	had
O	sprung
O	forth
O	from
O	his
O	melon
O	by
O	the
O	fountain
O	and
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	hidden
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	black
O	wife
O	learned
O	that
O	her
O	husband
O	had
O	found
O	the
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	again
O	after
O	all
O	these
O	years
O	she
O	confessed
O	her
O	deceit
O	and
O	soon
O	died
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	man
O	married
O	the
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	who
O	was
O	still
O	just
O	as
O	beautiful
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	he
O	saw
O	her
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	very
O	happy
O	together
O	but
O	the
O	wife
O	never
O	forgot
O	about
O	the
O	time
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	pigeon
O	.
O	Up
O	to
O	that
O	time
O	pigeons
O	had
O	been
O	wild
O	birds
O	who
O	built
O	their
O	nests
O	in
O	the
O	deep
O	forest
O	.
O	The
O	wife
O	often
O	wished
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	build
O	their
O	nests
O	in
O	her
O	beautiful
O	garden
O	so
O	she
O	had
O	little
O	bird
O	houses
O	built
O	and
O	set
O	up
O	there
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	a
O	pigeon
O	,
O	bolder
O	than
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	flew
O	through
O	the
O	garden
O	and
O	spied
O	the
O	little
O	bird
O	houses
O	.
O	He
O	moved
O	his
O	family
O	there
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	told
O	the
O	other
O	pigeons
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	other
O	houses
O	there
O	for
O	them
O	too
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	pigeons
O	were
O	timid
O	and
O	so
O	they
O	waited
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	terrible
O	calamity
O	might
O	happen
O	to
O	the
O	bold
O	pigeon
O	and
O	his
O	family
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	a
O	single
O	unpleasant
O	thing
O	occurred
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	just
O	as
O	happy
O	as
O	happy
O	could
O	be
O	in
O	their
O	new
O	home
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	while
O	other
O	pigeon
O	families
O	moved
O	into
O	the
O	garden
O	and
O	were
O	happy
O	too
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	came
O	about
O	that
O	after
O	years
O	and
O	years
O	the
O	pigeons
O	no
O	longer
O	build
O	their
O	nests
O	in
O	the
O	deep
O	forest
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	always
O	make
O	their
O	homes
O	near
O	the
O	homes
O	of
O	men
O	.
O	The
O	pigeons
O	,
O	themselves
O	,
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	it
O	all
O	came
O	about
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	beautiful
O	woman
O	who
O	was
O	once
O	a
O	pigeon
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	children
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	,
O	told
O	them
O	about
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	told
O	their
O	children
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	happens
O	that
O	the
O	mothers
O	in
O	Brazil
O	tell
O	their
O	children
O	this
O	story
O	about
O	the
O	pigeon
O	.
