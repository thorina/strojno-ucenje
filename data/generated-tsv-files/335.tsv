O	Many
O	times
O	had
O	the
O	Feast
O	of
O	Pentecost
O	come
O	round
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	were
O	the
O	knights
O	that
O	Arthur
O	had
O	made
O	after
O	he
O	founded
O	the
O	Order
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	;
O	yet
O	no
O	knight
O	had
O	appeared
O	who
O	dared
O	claim
O	the
O	seat
O	named
O	by
O	Merlin
O	the
O	Siege
O	Perilous
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	one
O	vigil
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	feast
O	,
O	a
O	lady
O	came
O	to
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	court
O	at
O	Camelot
O	and
O	asked
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	to
O	ride
O	with
O	her
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	hard
O	by
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	purpose
O	not
O	then
O	to
O	be
O	revealed
O	.
O	Launcelot
O	consenting
O	,
O	they
O	rode
O	together
O	until
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	nunnery
O	hidden
O	deep
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	the
O	lady
O	bade
O	Launcelot
O	dismount
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	great
O	and
O	stately
O	room
O	.
O	Presently
O	there
O	entered
O	twelve
O	nuns
O	and
O	with
O	them
O	a
O	youth
O	,
O	the
O	fairest
O	that
O	Launcelot
O	had
O	ever
O	seen
O	.
O	``
O	Sir
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	nuns
O	,
O	``
O	we
O	have
O	brought
O	up
O	this
O	child
O	in

O	now
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	grown
O	to
O	manhood
O	,
O	we
O	pray
O	you
O	make
O	him
O	knight
O	,
O	for
O	of
O	none
O	worthier
O	could
O	he
O	receive
O	the
O	honour
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Is
O	this
O	thy
O	own
O	desire
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	Launcelot
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	squire
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	said
O	that
O	so
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	Launcelot
O	promised
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	knight
O	after
O	the
O	great
O	festival
O	had
O	been
O	celebrated
O	in
O	the
O	church
O	next
O	day
O	.
O	So
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	,
O	after
O	they
O	had
O	worshipped
O	,
O	Launcelot
O	knighted
O	Galahad
O	--
O	for
O	that
O	was
O	the
O	youth
O	'
O	s
O	name
O	--
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	ride
O	at
O	once
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	court
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	young
O	knight
O	excusing
O	himself
O	,
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	rode
O	back
O	alone
O	to
O	Camelot
O	,
O	where
O	all
O	rejoiced
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	returned
O	in
O	time
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	feast
O	with
O	the
O	whole
O	Order
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	his
O	custom
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	was
O	waiting
O	for
O	some
O	marvel
O	to
O	befall
O	before
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	knights
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	banquet
O	.
O	Presently
O	a
O	squire
O	entered
O	the
O	hall
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Sir
O	King
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	wonder
O	has
O	appeared
O	.
O	There
O	floats
O	on
O	the
O	river
O	a
O	mighty
O	stone
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	a
O	block
O	of
O	red
O	marble
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	thrust
O	through
O	by
O	a
O	sword
O	,
O	the
O	hilt
O	of
O	which
O	is
O	set
O	thick
O	with
O	precious
O	stones
O	.
O	``
O	On
O	hearing
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	knights
O	went
O	forth
O	to
O	view
O	the
O	stone
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	as
O	the
O	squire
O	had
O	said
O	;
O	moreover
O	,
O	looking
O	closer
O	,
O	they
O	read
O	these
O	words
O	:
O	``
O	None

O	``
O	Immediately
O	,
O	all
O	bade
O	Launcelot
O	draw
O	forth
O	the
O	sword
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	refused
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	the
O	sword
O	was
O	not
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	command
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gawain
O	made
O	the
O	attempt
O	and
O	failed
O	,
O	as
O	did
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	after
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	knights
O	knew
O	the
O	adventure
O	was
O	not
O	for
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	returning
O	to
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	took
O	their
O	places
O	about
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	.
O	No
O	sooner
O	were
O	they
O	seated
O	than
O	an
O	aged
O	man
O	,
O	clothed
O	all
O	in
O	white
O	,
O	entered
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	followed
O	by
O	a
O	young
O	knight
O	in
O	red
O	armour
O	,
O	by
O	whose
O	side
O	hung
O	an
O	empty
O	scabbard
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	man
O	approached
O	King
O	Arthur
O	and
O	bowing
O	low
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	said
O	:
O	``

O	to
O	hear
O	this
O	,
O	and

O	right
O	royally
O	.
O	Then
O	when
O	the
O	young
O	knight
O	had
O	saluted
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	led

O	to
O	the
O	Siege
O	Perilous
O	and
O	drew
O	off
O	its
O	silken
O	cover
O	;
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	were
O	amazed
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	saw
O	that
O	where
O	had
O	been
O	engraved
O	the
O	words
O	,
O	``
O	The

O	.
O	``
O	Straightway
O	the
O	young

O	seated
O	himself
O	there
O	where
O	none

O	without
O	danger
O	to
O	his

O	:
O	``
O	Surely

O	``
O	Now
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	was
O	the
O	blessed

O	Lord
O	had
O	eaten
O	the
O	Last

O	to
O	the

O	by
O	Joseph
O	of
O	Arimathea
O	;
O	but
O	because
O	of
O	men
O	'
O	s
O	sinfulness
O	,
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	withdrawn
O	from
O	human

O	,
O	only
O	that
O	,
O	from
O	time

O	to
O	time

O	When

O	had
O	partaken
O	of

O	the
O	floating
O	stone
O	with
O	the

O	thrust
O	through
O	it
O	,
O	told
O	him
O	how
O	his

O	failed
O	to
O	draw
O	forth
O	the
O	sword
O	.
O	``
O	Sir

O	``

O	``
O	So
O	saying
O	,
O	lightly
O	he
O	drew
O	the

O	from

O	,
O	and
O	lightly
O	he
O	slid
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	scabbard
O	at
O	his
O	side
O	.
O	While
O	all
O	yet
O	wondered
O	at
O	this
O	adventure
O	of
O	the

O	,
O	there
O	came

O	on
O	a

O	,
O	saluting
O	King

O	``
O	And
O	so
O	to
O	Launcelot
O	she
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Sir

O	whom
O	thou
O	must
O	yield
O	precedence
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	Launcelot
O	answered
O	humbly
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	know

O	``
O	``
O	Ay

O	rode
O	away
O	before
O	any
O	could
O	question
O	her
O	further
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	that
O	evening
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	were
O	gathered
O	about
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	,
O	each
O	knight
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	siege
O	,
O	suddenly
O	there
O	was
O	heard
O	a
O	crash
O	of
O	thunder
O	,
O	so
O	mighty
O	that
O	the
O	hall
O	trembled
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	flashed
O	into
O	the
O	hall
O	a
O	sunbeam
O	,
O	brighter
O	far
O	than
O	any
O	that
O	had
O	ever
O	before
O	been
O	seen
O	;
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	draped
O	all
O	in
O	white
O	samite
O	,
O	there
O	glided
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	what
O	none
O	might
O	see
O	,
O	yet
O	what
O	all
O	knew
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	the
O	air
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	sweet
O	odours
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	every
O	one
O	was
O	shed
O	a
O	light
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	looked
O	fairer
O	and
O	nobler
O	than
O	ever
O	before
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	sat
O	in
O	an
O	amazed
O	silence
O	,
O	till
O	presently
O	King
O	Arthur
O	rose
O	and
O	gave
O	thanks
O	to
O	God
O	for
O	the
O	grace
O	given
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	to
O	his
O	court
O	.
O	Then
O	up
O	sprang
O	Sir
O	Gawain
O	and
O	made
O	his
O	avow
O	to
O	follow
O	for
O	a
O	year
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	the
O	Quest
O	of
O	the
O	Holy

O	,
O	if
O	perchance
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	granted
O	the
O	vision
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	Immediately
O	other
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	followed
O	his

O	,
O	binding
O	themselves
O	to
O	the
O	Quest
O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	until
O	,
O	in

O	hundred
O	and
O	fifty
O	had
O	vowed
O	themselves

O	the

O	.
O	And
O	turning
O	to
O	Sir
O	Gawain
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	:

O	life
O	and
O	through
O	whom
O	I

O	won
O	peace
O	and
O	righteousness
O	for
O	all
O	my

O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	King
O	mourned
O	and
O	his
O	knights
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	their
O	oaths
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	recall
O	.
O	Great
O	woe
O	was
O	there
O	in
O	Camelot
O	next
O	day
O	when
O	,
O	after
O	worship
O	in
O	the
O	cathedral
O	,
O	the
O	knights
O	who
O	had
O	vowed
O	themselves
O	to
O	the
O	Quest
O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	got
O	to
O	horse
O	and
O	rode
O	away
O	.
O	A
O	goodly
O	company
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	passed
O	through
O	the
O	streets
O	,
O	the
O	townfolk
O	weeping
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	go
O	;
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	du
O	Lac
O	and
O	his
O	kin
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	of
O	whom
O	all
O	expected
O	great
O	deeds
O	,
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	and
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	another
O	scarcely
O	less
O	famed
O	than
O	they
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	rode
O	together
O	that
O	day
O	to
O	the
O	Castle
O	of
O	Vagon
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	were
O	entertained
O	right
O	hospitably
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	they
O	separated
O	,
O	each
O	to
O	ride
O	his
O	own
O	way
O	and
O	see
O	what
O	adventures
O	should
O	befall
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	,
O	after
O	four
O	days
O	'
O	ride
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	reached
O	an
O	abbey
O	.
O	Now
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	was
O	still
O	clothed
O	in
O	red
O	armour
O	as
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	hung
O	the
O	wondrous
O	sword
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	without
O	a
O	shield
O	.
O	They
O	of
O	the
O	abbey
O	received
O	him
O	right
O	heartily
O	,
O	as
O	also
O	did
O	the
O	brave
O	King
O	Bagdemagus
O	,
O	Knight
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	resting
O	there
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	greeted
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	asked
O	King
O	Bagdemagus
O	what
O	adventure
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	there
O	.
O	``
O	Sir
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Bagdemagus
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	was
O	told
O	that
O	in
O	this
O	abbey
O	was
O	preserved
O	a

O	shield
O	which
O	none
O	but
O	the
O	best
O	knight
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	might
O	bear
O	without
O	grievous
O	harm
O	to
O	himself
O	.
O	And
O	though
O	I
O	know
O	well
O	that
O	there
O	are
O	better
O	knights
O	than
O	I
O	,
O	to-morrow
O	I
O	purpose
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	attempt
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	I
O	pray
O	you
O	,
O	bide
O	at
O	this
O	monastery
O	a
O	while
O	until
O	you
O	hear
O	from
O	me
O	;
O	and
O	if
O	I
O	fail
O	,
O	do
O	ye
O	take
O	the
O	adventure
O	upon
O	you
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	So
O	be
O	it
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	at
O	their
O	request
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	and
O	King
O	Bagdemagus
O	were
O	led
O	into
O	the
O	church
O	by
O	a
O	monk
O	and
O	shown
O	where
O	,
O	behind
O	the
O	altar
O	,
O	hung
O	the
O	wondrous
O	shield
O	,
O	whiter
O	than
O	snow
O	save
O	for
O	the
O	blood-red
O	cross
O	in
O	its
O	midst
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	monk
O	warned
O	them
O	of
O	the
O	danger
O	to
O	any
O	who
O	,
O	being
O	unworthy
O	,
O	should
O	dare
O	to
O	bear
O	the
O	shield
O	.
O	But
O	King
O	Bagdemagus
O	made
O	answer
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	know
O	well
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	the
O	best

O	the
O	world
O	,
O	yet
O	will
O	I
O	try
O	if
O	I
O	may
O	bear
O	it
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	he
O	hung
O	it
O	about
O	his
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	bidding
O	farewell
O	,
O	rode
O	away
O	with
O	his
O	squire
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	had
O	not
O	journeyed
O	far
O	before
O	they
O	saw
O	a
O	knight
O	approach
O	,
O	armed
O	all
O	in
O	white
O	mail
O	and
O	mounted
O	upon
O	a
O	white
O	horse
O	.
O	Immediately
O	he
O	laid
O	his
O	spear
O	in
O	rest
O	and
O	,
O	charging
O	King
O	Bagdemagus
O	,
O	pierced
O	him
O	through
O	the
O	shoulder
O	and
O	bore
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	;
O	and
O	standing
O	over
O	the
O	wounded
O	knight
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	:
O	``

O	shield
O	save
O	the
O	peerless
O	knight
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	,
O	taking
O	the
O	shield
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	squire
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	``

O	well
O	from
O	me
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	What
O	is
O	your
O	name
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	the
O	squire
O	.
O	``
O	That

O	not
O	for
O	thee
O	or
O	any
O	other

O	``
O	``
O	One
O	thing
O	,
O	I
O	pray
O	you
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	squire
O	;
O	``
O	why
O	may
O	this
O	shield
O	be
O	borne
O	by
O	none
O	but
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	without
O	danger
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	Because
O	it
O	belongs
O	to
O	him
O	only
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	the
O	stranger
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	vanished
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	squire
O	took
O	the
O	shield
O	and
O	setting
O	King
O	Bagdemagus
O	on
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	bore
O	him
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	abbey
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	long
O	,
O	sick
O	unto
O	death
O	.
O	To
O	Galahad
O	the
O	squire
O	gave
O	the
O	shield
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	all

O	befallen
O	.
O	So
O	Galahad
O	hung
O	the
O	shield
O	about
O	his
O	neck
O	and
O	rode
O	the
O	way
O	that
O	Bagdemagus
O	had
O	gone
O	the
O	day
O	before
O	;
O	and
O	presently
O	he
O	met
O	the
O	White
O	Knight
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	greeted
O	courteously
O	,
O	begging
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	make
O	known
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	marvels
O	of
O	the
O	red-cross
O	shield
O	.
O	``
O	That
O	will
O	I
O	gladly
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	the
O	White
O	Knight
O	.
O	``
O	Ye
O	must
O	know
O	,
O	Sir
O	Knight
O	,
O	that
O	this
O	shield
O	was
O	made
O	and
O	given
O	by
O	Joseph
O	of
O	Arimathea
O	to
O	the
O	good
O	King
O	Evelake
O	of
O	Sarras
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	might
O	of
O	the
O	holy
O	symbol
O	,
O	he
O	should
O	overthrow
O	the
O	heathen
O	who
O	threatened
O	his
O	kingdom
O	.
O	But
O	afterwards
O	,
O	King
O	Evelake
O	followed
O	Joseph
O	to
O	this
O	land
O	of
O	Britain
O	where
O	they
O	taught
O	the
O	true
O	faith
O	unto
O	the
O	people
O	who
O	before
O	were
O	heathen
O	.
O	Then
O	when
O	Joseph
O	lay
O	dying
O	,
O	he
O	bade
O	King
O	Evelake
O	set
O	the
O	shield
O	in
O	the
O	monastery
O	where
O	ye
O	lay
O	last
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	foretold
O	that
O	none
O	should
O	wear
O	it
O	without
O	loss
O	until
O	that
O	day
O	when
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	taken
O	by
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	ninth
O	and
O	last
O	in
O	descent
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	who
O	should
O	come
O	to
O	that
O	place
O	the
O	fifteenth
O	day
O	after
O	receiving
O	the
O	degree
O	of
O	knighthood
O	.
O	Even
O	so
O	has
O	it
O	been
O	with
O	you
O	,
O	Sir
O	Knight
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	saying
O	,
O	the
O	unknown
O	knight
O	disappeared
O	and
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	rode
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	.
O	After
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	had
O	parted
O	from
O	his
O	fellows
O	at
O	the
O	Castle
O	of
O	Vagon
O	,
O	he
O	rode
O	many
O	days
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	without
O	adventure
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	chanced
O	upon
O	a
O	knight
O	close
O	by
O	a
O	little
O	hermitage
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	Immediately
O	,
O	as
O	was
O	the
O	wont
O	of
O	errant
O	knights
O	,
O	they
O	prepared
O	to
O	joust
O	,
O	and
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	whom
O	none
O	before
O	had
O	overthrown
O	,
O	was
O	borne
O	down
O	,
O	man
O	and
O	horse
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	stranger
O	knight
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	a
O	nun
O	,
O	who
O	dwelt
O	in
O	the
O	hermitage
O	,
O	cried
O	:
O	``
O	God
O	be
O	with
O	thee
O	,

O	,
O	``
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	the
O	victor
O	for
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	.
O	But
O	Galahad
O	,
O	not
O	wishing
O	to
O	be
O	known
O	,
O	rode
O	swiftly
O	away
O	;
O	and
O	presently
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	got
O	to
O	horse
O	again
O	and
O	rode
O	slowly
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	,
O	shamed
O	and
O	doubting
O	sorely
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	whether
O	this
O	quest
O	were
O	meant
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	Afterward
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	rescued
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	from
O	twenty
O	knights
O	who
O	beset
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	till
O	night-fall
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	sought
O	shelter
O	at
O	a
O	little
O	hermitage
O	.
O	Thither
O	there
O	came
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	a
O	damsel
O	who
O	desired
O	to
O	speak
O	with
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	;
O	so
O	he
O	arose
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	her
O	.
O	``
O	Galahad
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	arm
O	you

O	``
O	So
O	they
O	rode
O	together
O	until
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	and
O	there
O	the
O	damsel
O	showed
O	Galahad
O	a
O	great
O	ship
O	into
O	which
O	he
O	must
O	enter
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	bade
O	him
O	farewell
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	,
O	going
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	found
O	there
O	already
O	the
O	good
O	knights
O	Sir
O	Bors

O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	,
O	who
O	made
O	much
O	joy
O	of
O	the
O	meeting
O	.
O	They
O	abode
O	in
O	that
O	ship
O	until
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	King
O	Pelles
O	,
O	who
O	welcomed
O	them
O	right
O	gladly
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	all
O	sat
O	at
O	supper
O	that
O	night
O	,
O	suddenly
O	the

O	with
O	a

O	dwelt
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	Joseph
O	of
O	Arimathea
O	,
O	teaching
O	its
O	people
O	the
O	true
O	faith
O	,
O	before
O	ever
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	Britain
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	and
O	his
O	fellows
O	came
O	there
O	after
O	long
O	voyage
O	,
O	they
O	found
O	it
O	ruled
O	by
O	a
O	heathen
O	King
O	named
O	Estorause
O	,
O	who
O	cast
O	them
O	into
O	a
O	deep
O	dungeon
O	.
O	There
O	they
O	were
O	kept
O	a
O	year
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	the
O	tyrant
O	died
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	great
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	gathered
O	together
O	to
O	consider
O	who
O	should
O	be
O	their
O	King
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	while
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	council
O	,
O	came
O	a
O	voice
O	bidding
O	them
O	take
O	as
O	their
O	King
O	the
O	youngest
O	of
O	the
O	three
O	knights
O	whom
O	Estorause
O	had
O	thrown
O	into
O	prison
O	.
O	So
O	in
O	fear
O	and
O	wonder
O	they
O	hastened
O	to
O	the
O	prison
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	releasing
O	the
O	three
O	knights
O	,
O	made
O	Galahad
O	King
O	as
O	the
O	voice
O	had
O	bidden
O	them
O	.
O	Thus
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	became
O	King
O	of
O	the
O	famous
O	city
O	of
O	Sarras
O	,
O	in
O	far
O	Babylon
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	reigned
O	a
O	year
O	when
O	,
O	one
O	morning
O	early
O	,
O	he
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	knights
O	,
O	his
O	fellows
O	,
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	chapel
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	they
O	saw
O	,
O	kneeling
O	in
O	prayer
O	,
O	an
O	aged
O	man
O	,
O	robed
O	as
O	a
O	bishop
O	,
O	and
O	round
O	him
O	hovered
O	many
O	angels
O	.
O	The
O	knights
O	fell
O	on
O	their
O	knees
O	in
O	awe
O	and
O	reverence
O	,
O	whereupon
O	he
O	that
O	seemed
O	a
O	bishop
O	turned
O	to
O	them
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	Joseph
O	of
O	Arimathea
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	am
O	come
O	to
O	show
O	you
O	the
O	perfect
O	vision
O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	.
O	``
O	On
O	the
O	instant
O	there
O	appeared
O	before
O	them
O	,
O	without
O	veil
O	or
O	cover
O	,
O	the
O	holy
O	vessel
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	radiance
O	of
O	light
O	such
O	as
O	almost
O	blinded
O	them
O	.
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	and
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	,
O	when
O	at
O	length
O	they
O	were
O	recovered
O	from
O	the
O	brightness
O	of
O	that
O	glory
O	,
O	looked
O	up
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	the
O	holy
O	Joseph
O	and
O	the
O	wondrous
O	vessel
O	had
O	passed
O	from
O	their
O	sight
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	where
O	he
O	still
O	knelt
O	as
O	in
O	prayer
O	,
O	and
O	behold
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	dead
O	;
O	for
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	with
O	him
O	even
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	prayed
O	;
O	in
O	the
O	moment
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	vision
O	,
O	his
O	soul
O	had
O	gone
O	back
O	to
O	God
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	buried
O	him
O	in
O	that
O	far
O	city
O	,
O	themselves
O	mourning
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	immediately
O	after
O	,
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	put
O	off
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	a
O	monk
O	,
O	living
O	a
O	devout
O	and
O	holy
O	life
O	until
O	,
O	a
O	year
O	and
O	two
O	months
O	later
O	,
O	he
O	also
O	died
O	and
O	was
O	buried
O	near
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	armed
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	bidding
O	farewell
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	sailed
O	away
O	until
O	,
O	after
O	many
O	weeks
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	Britain
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	took
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	stayed
O	not
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	Camelot
O	.
O	Great
O	was
O	the
O	rejoicing
O	of
O	Arthur
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	knights
O	when
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	was
O	once
O	more
O	among
O	them
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	told
O	all
O	the
O	adventures
O	which
O	had
O	befallen
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	good
O	knights
O	,
O	his
O	companions
O	,
O	all
O	who
O	heard
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	amaze
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	King
O	he
O	caused
O	the
O	wisest
O	clerks
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	to
O	write
O	in
O	great
O	books
O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	fame
O	of
O	it
O	should
O	endure
O	unto
O	all
O	time
O	.
