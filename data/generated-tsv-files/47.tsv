O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	little
O	girl
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	so
O	sweet
O	and
O	pretty
O	and
O	good
O	that
O	everybody
O	loved
O	her
O	.
O	Her
O	old
O	grandmother
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	very
O	fond
O	of
O	her
O	,
O	made
O	her
O	a
O	little
O	red
O	cloak
O	and
O	hood
O	,
O	which
O	suited
O	her
O	so
O	well
O	that
O	everyone
O	called
O	her
O	``
O	Little
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	.
O	``
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	Little
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	'
O	s
O	mother
O	told
O	her
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	basket
O	with
O	some
O	butter
O	and
O	eggs
O	and
O	fresh-baked
O	cake
O	to
O	her
O	grandmother
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	ill
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	girl
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	always
O	willing
O	and
O	obliging
O	,
O	ran
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	fetch
O	her
O	red
O	cloak
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	taking
O	her
O	basket
O	,
O	set
O	out
O	on
O	her
O	journey
O	.
O	On
O	her
O	way
O	she
O	met
O	a
O	wolf
O	,
O	who
O	wished
O	very
O	much
O	to
O	eat
O	her
O	up
O	;
O	but
O	who
O	dared
O	not
O	do
O	so
O	because
O	some
O	wood-cutters
O	were
O	working
O	close
O	by
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	only
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Good-morning
O	,
O	Little
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	;
O	where
O	are
O	you
O	off
O	to
O	so
O	early
O	?
O	``
O	Little
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	,
O	who
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	dangerous
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	talk
O	to
O	a
O	wolf
O	,
O	replied
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	going
O	to
O	see
O	my
O	grandmother
O	,
O	who
O	is
O	ill
O	in
O	bed
O	,
O	to
O	take
O	her
O	some
O	butter
O	and
O	eggs
O	and
O	a
O	fresh-baked
O	cake
O	that
O	my
O	mother
O	has
O	made
O	for
O	her
O	!
O	``
O	``
O	Where
O	does
O	your
O	grandmother
O	live
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	the
O	wolf
O	.
O	``
O	In
O	the
O	little
O	white
O	cottage
O	at
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	.
O	``
O	Well
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	wolf
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	going
O	that
O	way
O	,
O	too
O	.
O	If
O	you
O	will
O	let
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	walk
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	with
O	you
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	Little
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	,
O	who
O	suspected
O	no
O	harm
O	,
O	set
O	off
O	with
O	the
O	wolf
O	for
O	her
O	companion
O	.
O	Presently
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	stopped
O	to
O	gather
O	a
O	nosegay
O	of
O	wild
O	flowers
O	for
O	her
O	grandmother
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wolf
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	thought
O	of
O	a
O	plan
O	to
O	get
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	for
O	his
O	dinner
O	,
O	said
O	``
O	Good
O	morning
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	trotted
O	away
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	run
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	grandmother
O	'
O	s
O	cottage
O	and
O	knocked
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	``
O	Who
O	is
O	there
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	the
O	old
O	grandmother
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	lay
O	in
O	bed
O	.
O	``
O	It
O	is
O	Little
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	the
O	wolf
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	have
O	brought
O	you
O	some
O	butter
O	and
O	eggs
O	and
O	a
O	fresh-baked
O	cake
O	which
O	mother
O	has
O	made
O	for
O	you
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Pull
O	the
O	bobbin
O	and
O	the
O	latch
O	will
O	go
O	up
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	old
O	grandmother
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	wolf
O	pulled
O	the
O	bobbin
O	and
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	sprang
O	upon
O	the
O	poor
O	old
O	grandmother
O	and
O	ate
O	her
O	all
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	twinkling
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	put
O	on
O	her
O	night-cap
O	and
O	got
O	into
O	bed
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	wait
O	for
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	.
O	Very
O	soon
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	little
O	soft
O	tap
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	``
O	Who
O	is
O	there
O	?
O	``
O	called
O	out
O	the
O	wolf
O	.
O	``
O	It
O	is
O	Little
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	,

O	fresh-baked

O	which
O	mother
O	has
O	made
O	for
O	you
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	wolf
O	called
O	out
O	,
O	disguising
O	his
O	voice
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	:
O	``
O	Pull
O	the
O	bobbin
O	and
O	the
O	latch
O	will
O	go
O	up
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	Little
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	pulled
O	the
O	bobbin
O	and
O	went
O	inside
O	.
O	``
O	Good
O	morning
O	,
O	dear
O	grandmother

O	``
O	she
O	said
O	.
O	``
O	How

O	you
O	feeling
O	today
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	Very
O	bad
O	indeed
O	,
O	my
O	dear
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	the
O	wolf
O	,
O	trying
O	to
O	hide
O	himself
O	under
O	the
O	bedclothes
O	.
O	``
O	How
O	strange
O	and
O	hoarse
O	your
O	voice
O	sounds

O	said
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	.
O	``
O	I

O	got
O	a
O	bad

O	on
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	,
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	strange
O	her
O	grandmother
O	looked
O	in
O	her
O	nightclothes
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	better
O	to

O	Red

O	.
O	``
O	The

O	``
O	roared
O	the
O	wolf
O	,
O	suddenly
O	jumping
O	out
O	of
O	bed
O	.
O	He
O	seized
O	hold
O	of
O	poor
O	Little
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	just
O	about
O	to
O	eat
O	her
O	up
O	,
O	when
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	outside
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	door
O	burst
O	open
O	and
O	in
O	rushed
O	the
O	wood-cutters
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	wolf
O	talking
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	,

O	came
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	mischief
O	he
O	was
O	up
O	to
O	.
O	They
O	killed
O	the
O	wicked

O	quite
O	dead
O	;
O	and
O	so
O	Little
O	Red
O	Riding-Hood
O	was
O	saved
O	,
