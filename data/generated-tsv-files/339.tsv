O	We
O	now
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	King
O	Alfred
O	,
O	the
O	best
O	and
O	greatest
O	of
O	all
O	English
O	Kings
O	.
O	We
O	know
O	quite
O	enough
O	of
O	his
O	history
O	to
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	he
O	really
O	deserves
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	called
O	,
O	though
O	I
O	must
O	warn
O	you
O	that
O	,
O	just
O	because
O	he
O	left
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	name
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	people
O	have
O	been
O	fond
O	of
O	attributing
O	to
O	him
O	things
O	which
O	really
O	belonged
O	to
O	others
O	.
O	Thus
O	you
O	may
O	sometimes
O	see
O	nearly
O	all
O	English
O	laws
O	and
O	customs
O	attributed
O	to
O	Alfred
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	invented
O	them
O	all
O	for
O	himself
O	.
O	You
O	will
O	sometimes
O	hear
O	that
O	Alfred
O	founded
O	Trial
O	by
O	Jury
O	,
O	divided
O	England
O	into
O	Counties
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	all
O	kinds
O	of
O	other
O	things
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	real
O	truth
O	is
O	that
O	the
O	roots
O	and
O	beginnings
O	of
O	most
O	of
O	these
O	things
O	are
O	very
O	much
O	older
O	than
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	Alfred
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	particular
O	forms
O	in
O	which
O	we
O	have
O	them
O	now
O	are
O	very
O	much
O	later
O	.
O	But
O	people
O	have
O	a
O	way
O	of
O	fancying
O	that
O	everything
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	invented
O	by
O	some
O	particular
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	Alfred
O	was
O	more
O	famous
O	than
O	anybody
O	else
O	,
O	they
O	hit
O	upon
O	Alfred
O	as
O	the
O	most
O	likely
O	person
O	to
O	have
O	invented
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	putting
O	aside
O	fables
O	,
O	there
O	is
O	quite
O	enough
O	to
O	show
O	that
O	there
O	have
O	been
O	very
O	few
O	Kings
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	few
O	men
O	of
O	any
O	sort
O	,
O	so
O	great
O	and
O	good
O	as
O	King
O	Alfred
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	the
O	only
O	equally
O	good
O	King
O	we
O	read
O	of
O	is
O	Saint
O	Louis
O	of
O	France
O	;
O	and
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	as
O	good
O	,
O	we
O	can
O	not
O	set
O	him
O	down
O	as
O	being
O	so
O	great
O	and
O	wise
O	as
O	Alfred
O	.
O	Certainly
O	no
O	King
O	ever
O	gave
O	himself
O	up
O	more
O	thoroughly
O	than
O	Alfred
O	did
O	fully
O	to
O	do
O	the
O	duties
O	of
O	his
O	office
O	.
O	His
O	whole
O	life
O	seems
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	spent
O	in
O	doing
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	for
O	the
O	good
O	of
O	his
O	people
O	in
O	every
O	way
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	is
O	wonderful
O	in
O	how
O	many
O	ways
O	his
O	powers
O	showed
O	themselves
O	.
O	That
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	brave
O	warrior
O	is
O	in
O	itself
O	no
O	particular
O	praise
O	in
O	an
O	age
O	when
O	almost
O	every
O	man
O	was
O	the
O	same
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	is
O	a
O	great
O	thing
O	for
O	a
O	prince
O	so
O	large
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	whose
O	time
O	was
O	spent
O	in
O	fighting
O	to
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	all
O	his
O	wars
O	were
O	waged
O	to
O	set
O	free
O	his
O	country
O	from
O	the
O	most
O	cruel
O	enemies
O	.
O	And
O	we
O	may
O	admire
O	too
O	the
O	wonderful
O	way
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	kept
O	his
O	mind
O	always
O	straight
O	and
O	firm
O	,
O	never
O	either
O	giving
O	way
O	to
O	bad
O	luck
O	or
O	being
O	puffed
O	up
O	by
O	good
O	luck
O	.
O	We
O	read
O	of
O	nothing
O	like
O	pride
O	or
O	cruelty
O	or
O	injustice
O	of
O	any
O	kind
O	either
O	towards
O	his
O	own
O	people
O	or
O	towards
O	his
O	enemies
O	.
O	And
O	if
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	brave
O	warrior
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	many
O	other
O	things
O	besides
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	lawgiver
O	;
O	at
O	least
O	he
O	collected
O	and
O	arranged
O	the
O	laws
O	,
O	and
O	caused
O	them
O	to
O	be
O	most
O	carefully
O	administered
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	scholar
O	,
O	and
O	wrote
O	and
O	translated
O	many
O	books
O	for
O	the
O	good
O	of
O	his
O	people
O	.
O	He
O	encouraged
O	trade
O	and
O	enterprise
O	of
O	all
O	kinds
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	men
O	to
O	visit
O	distant
O	parts
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	bring
O	home
O	accounts
O	of
O	what
O	they
O	saw
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	thoroughly
O	good
O	man
O	and
O	a
O	devout
O	Christian
O	in
O	all
O	relations
O	of
O	life
O	.
O	In
O	short
O	,
O	one
O	hardly
O	knows
O	any
O	other
O	character
O	in
O	all
O	history
O	so
O	perfect
O	;
O	there
O	is
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	is
O	good
O	in
O	so
O	many
O	different
O	ways
O	;
O	and
O	though
O	no
O	doubt
O	Alfred
O	had
O	his
O	faults
O	like
O	other
O	people
O	,
O	yet
O	he
O	clearly
O	had
O	none
O	,
O	at
O	any
O	rate
O	in
O	the
O	greater
O	part
O	of
O	his
O	life
O	,
O	which
O	took
O	away
O	at
O	all
O	seriously
O	from
O	his
O	general
O	goodness
O	.
O	One
O	wonders
O	that
O	such
O	a
O	man
O	was
O	never
O	canonized
O	as
O	a
O	Saint
O	;
O	most
O	certainly
O	many
O	people
O	have
O	received
O	that
O	name
O	who
O	did
O	not
O	deserve
O	it
O	nearly
O	so
O	well
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	.
O	Alfred
O	,
O	or
O	,
O	as
O	his
O	name
O	should
O	really
O	be
O	spelled
O	,
O	Aelfred
O	,
O	[
O	:
O	That
O	is
O	,
O	the
O	rede
O	or
O	councel
O	of
O	the
O	elves
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	many
O	Old-English
O	names
O	are
O	called
O	after
O	the
O	elves
O	or
O	fairies
O	.
O	]
O	was
O	the
O	youngest
O	son
O	of
O	King
O	Aethelwulf
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	born
O	at
O	Wantage
O	in
O	Berkshire
O	in
O	849
O	.
O	His
O	mother
O	was
O	Osburh
O	daughter
O	of
O	Oslac
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	cup-bearer
O	,
O	who
O	came
O	of
O	the
O	royal
O	house
O	of
O	the
O	Jutes
O	in
O	Wight
O	.
O	Up
O	to
O	the
O	age
O	of
O	twelve
O	years
O	Alfred
O	was
O	fond
O	of
O	hunting
O	and
O	other
O	sports
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	taught
O	any
O	sort
O	of
O	learning
O	,
O	not
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	to
O	read
O	his
O	own
O	tongue
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	loved
O	the
O	old
O	English
O	songs
O	;
O	and
O	one
O	day
O	his
O	mother
O	had
O	a
O	beautiful
O	book
O	of
O	songs
O	with
O	rich
O	pictures
O	and
O	fine
O	painted
O	initial
O	letters
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	you
O	may
O	often
O	see
O	in
O	ancient
O	books
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	children
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	this
O	beautiful
O	book
O	to
O	the
O	one
O	of
O	you
O	who
O	shall
O	first
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	read
O	it
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	Alfred
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Mother
O	,
O	will
O	you
O	really
O	give
O	me
O	the
O	book
O	when
O	I
O	have
O	learned
O	to
O	read
O	it
O	?
O	``
O	And
O	Osburh
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Yes
O	,
O	my
O	son
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	Alfred
O	went
O	and
O	found
O	a
O	master
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	learned
O	to
O	read
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	and
O	read
O	the
O	songs
O	in
O	the
O	beautiful
O	book
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	book
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	.
O	In
O	868
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	twentieth
O	year
O	,
O	while
O	his
O	brother
O	Aethelred
O	was
O	King
O	,
O	Alfred
O	married
O	.
O	His
O	wife
O	'
O	s
O	name
O	was
O	Ealhswyth
O	;
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	Aethelred
O	called
O	the
O	Mickle
O	or
O	Big
O	,
O	Alderman
O	of
O	the
O	Gainas
O	in
O	Lincolnshire
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	mother
O	Eadburh
O	was
O	of
O	the
O	royal
O	house
O	of
O	the
O	Mercians
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	said
O	that
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	day
O	of
O	his
O	marriage
O	he
O	was
O	smitten
O	with
O	a
O	strange
O	disease
O	,
O	which
O	for
O	twenty
O	years
O	never
O	quite
O	left
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	fits
O	of
O	which
O	might
O	come
O	on
O	at
O	any
O	time
O	.
O	If
O	this
O	be
O	true
O	,
O	it
O	makes
O	all
O	the
O	great
O	things
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	even
O	more
O	wonderful
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	the
O	great
O	Danish
O	invasion
O	had
O	begun
O	in
O	the
O	northern
O	parts
O	of
O	England
O	.
O	There
O	are
O	many
O	stories
O	told
O	in
O	the
O	old
O	Northern
O	Songs
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	Some
O	tell
O	how
O	Ragnar
O	Lodbrog
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	hero
O	of
O	these
O	Northern
O	tales
O	,
O	was
O	seized
O	by
O	Aella
O	,
O	King
O	of
O	the
O	Northumbrians
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	thrown
O	into
O	a
O	dungeon
O	full
O	of
O	serpents
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	dying
O	of
O	the
O	bites
O	of
O	the
O	serpents
O	,
O	he
O	sang
O	a
O	wonderful
O	death-song
O	,
O	telling
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	old
O	fights
O	,
O	and
O	calling
O	on
O	his
O	sons
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	avenge
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	year
O	871
O	the
O	Danes
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	entered
O	Wessex
O	.
O	Nine
O	great
O	battles
O	,
O	besides
O	smaller
O	skirmishes
O	,
O	were
O	fought
O	this
O	year
O	,
O	in
O	some
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	English
O	won
O	and
O	in
O	others
O	the
O	Danes
O	.
O	One
O	famous
O	battle
O	was
O	at
O	Ashdown
O	,
O	in
O	Berkshire
O	.
O	We
O	are
O	told
O	that
O	the
O	heathen
O	men
O	were
O	in
O	two
O	divisions
O	;
O	one
O	was
O	commanded
O	by
O	their
O	two
O	Kings
O	Bagsecg
O	and
O	Halfdene
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	by
O	five
O	Earls
O	,
O	Sidroc
O	the
O	Old
O	,
O	Sidroc
O	the
O	Young
O	,
O	Osbeorn
O	,
O	Fraena
O	,
O	and
O	Harold
O	.
O	And
O	King
O	Aethelred
O	was
O	set
O	against
O	the
O	Kings
O	and
O	Alfred
O	the
O	Aetheling
O	against
O	the
O	Earls
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	heathen
O	men
O	came
O	on
O	against
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	King
O	Aethelred
O	heard
O	mass
O	in
O	his
O	tent
O	.
O	And
O	men
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Come
O	forth
O	,
O	O
O	King
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	fight
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	heathen
O	men
O	press
O	hard
O	upon
O	us
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	King
O	Aethelred
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	serve
O	God
O	first
O	and
O	man
O	after
O	,
O	so
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	come
O	forth
O	till
O	all
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	the
O	mass
O	be
O	ended
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	King
O	Aethelred
O	abode
O	praying
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	heathen
O	men
O	fought
O	against
O	Alfred
O	the
O	Aetheling
O	.
O	And
O	Alfred
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	can
O	not
O	abide
O	till
O	the
O	King
O	my
O	brother
O	comes
O	forth
O	;
O	I
O	must
O	either
O	flee
O	,
O	or
O	fight
O	alone
O	with

O	men
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	Alfred
O	the
O	Aetheling
O	and
O	his
O	men
O	fought
O	against
O	the
O	five
O	Earls
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	heathen
O	men
O	stood
O	on
O	the
O	higher
O	ground
O	and
O	the
O	Christians
O	on
O	the
O	lower
O	.
O	Yet
O	did
O	Alfred
O	go
O	forth
O	trusting
O	in
O	God
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	made
O	his
O	men
O	hold
O	close
O	together
O	with
O	their
O	shields
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	went
O	forth
O	like
O	a
O	wild
O	boar
O	against
O	the
O	hounds
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	fought
O	against
O	the
O	heathen
O	men
O	and
O	smote
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	slew
O	the
O	five
O	Earls
O	,
O	Sidroc
O	the
O	Old
O	,
O	Sidroc
O	the
O	Young
O	,
O	Osbeorn
O	,
O	Fraena
O	,
O	and
O	Harold
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	mass
O	was
O	over
O	,
O	and
O	King
O	Aethelred
O	came
O	forth
O	and
O	fought
O	against
O	the
O	two
O	Kings
O	,
O	and
O	slew
O	Bagsecg
O	the
O	King
O	with
O	his

O	hand
O	and
O	smote
O	the
O	heathen
O	men
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	slaughter
O	and
O	chased
O	them
O	even
O	unto
O	Reading
O	.
O	In
O	871
O	,
O	on
O	Aethelred
O	'
O	s
O	death
O	,
O	Alfred
O	became
O	King
O	of
O	the
O	West-Saxons
O	and
O	Over-lord
O	of
O	all
O	England
O	,
O	as
O	his
O	father
O	had
O	appointed
O	so
O	long
O	before
O	with
O	the
O	consent
O	of
O	his
O	Wise
O	Men
O	.
O	The
O	Danes
O	did
O	not
O	come
O	again
O	into
O	Wessex
O	till
O	876
O	.
O	But
O	though
O	the
O	West-Saxons
O	had
O	no
O	fighting
O	by
O	land
O	during
O	these
O	years
O	,
O	things
O	were
O	not
O	quite
O	quiet
O	,
O	for
O	in
O	875
O	King
O	Alfred
O	had
O	a
O	fight
O	at
O	sea
O	against
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	Danish
O	pirates
O	.
O	This
O	sea-fight
O	is
O	worth
O	remembering
O	as
O	being
O	,
O	I
O	suppose
O	,
O	the
O	first
O	victory
O	won
O	by
O	the
O	Englishmen
O	at
O	sea
O	,
O	where
O	Englishmen
O	have
O	since
O	won
O	so
O	many
O	victories
O	.
O	King
O	Alfred
O	then
O	fought
O	against
O	seven
O	Danish
O	ships
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	took
O	one
O	and
O	put
O	the
O	rest
O	to
O	flight
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	somewhat
O	strange
O	that
O	we
O	do
O	not
O	hear
O	more
O	than
O	we
O	do
O	of
O	warfare
O	by
O	sea
O	in
O	these
O	times
O	,
O	especially
O	when
O	we
O	remember
O	how
O	in
O	earlier
O	times
O	the
O	Angles
O	and
O	Saxons
O	had
O	roved
O	about
O	in
O	their
O	ships
O	,
O	very
O	much
O	as
O	the
O	Danes
O	and
O	other
O	Northmen
O	were
O	doing
O	now
O	.
O	It
O	would
O	seem
O	that
O	the
O	English
O	,
O	after
O	they
O	settled
O	in
O	Britain
O	,
O	almost
O	left
O	off
O	being
O	a
O	seafaring
O	people
O	.
O	We
O	find
O	Alfred
O	and
O	other
O	Kings
O	doing
O	what
O	they
O	could
O	to
O	keep
O	up
O	a
O	fleet
O	and
O	to
O	stir
O	up
O	a
O	naval
O	spirit
O	among
O	their
O	people
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	some
O	degree
O	they
O	did
O	so
O	;
O	still
O	we
O	do
O	not
O	find
O	the
O	English
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	while
O	after
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	doing
O	nearly
O	so
O	much
O	by
O	sea
O	as
O	they
O	did
O	by
O	land
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	pity
O	;
O	for
O	ships
O	might
O	then
O	,
O	as
O	in
O	later
O	times
O	,
O	have
O	been
O	wooden
O	walls
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	much
O	better
O	to
O	meet
O	an
O	enemy
O	at
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	from
O	landing
O	in
O	your
O	country
O	,
O	than
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	land
O	,
O	even
O	if
O	you
O	can
O	beat
O	him
O	when
O	he
O	has
O	landed
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	876
O	the
O	Danes
O	came
O	again
O	into
O	Wessex
O	;
O	and
O	we
O	thus
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	part
O	of
O	Alfred
O	'
O	s
O	life
O	which
O	is
O	at
O	once
O	the
O	saddest
O	and
O	the
O	brightest
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	the
O	time
O	when
O	his
O	luck
O	was
O	lowest
O	and
O	when
O	his
O	spirit
O	was
O	highest
O	.
O	The
O	army
O	under
O	Guthorm
O	or
O	Guthrum
O	,
O	the
O	Danish
O	King
O	of
O	East-Anglia
O	,
O	came
O	suddenly
O	to
O	Wareham
O	in
O	Dorsetshire
O	.
O	The
O	Chronicle
O	says
O	that
O	they
O	``
O	bestole
O	``
O	--
O	that
O	is
O	,
O	came
O	secretly
O	or
O	escaped

O	from
O	the
O	West-Saxon
O	army
O	,
O	which
O	seems
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	waiting
O	for
O	them
O	.
O	This
O	time
O	Alfred
O	made
O	peace
O	with
O	the
O	Danes
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	gave
O	him
O	some
O	of
O	their
O	chief
O	men
O	for
O	hostages
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	swore
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	They
O	swore
O	this
O	on
O	the
O	holy
O	bracelet
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	solemn
O	oath
O	in
O	use
O	among
O	the
O	heathen
O	Northmen
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	never
O	before
O	sworn
O	at
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	times
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	made
O	peace
O	with
O	the
O	English
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	keep
O	their
O	oath
O	any
O	better
O	for
O	taking
O	it
O	in
O	this
O	more
O	solemn
O	way
O	.
O	The
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	host
O	which
O	had
O	horses
O	``
O	bestole

O	``
O	King
O	Alfred
O	rode
O	after
O	the
O	Danish
O	horse
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	Exeter
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	not

O	them
O	till
O	they
O	had
O	got
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	safe
O	in
O	the
O	stronghold
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	made
O	peace
O	,
O	swearing
O	oaths
O	,
O	and
O	giving
O	as
O	many

O	``
O	This

O	while
O	,
O	for
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	months
O	Alfred
O	was
O	again
O	at

O	an
O	army
O	and
O	able
O	to
O	fight
O	against

O	It
O	was
O	during
O	this
O	trouble

O	stayed

O	day
O	the

O	set
O	some

O	fire
O	mending
O	his
O	bow

O	have
O	wonderful
O	powers
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	tell
O	by
O	the
O	way
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	raven
O	held
O	his
O	wings
O	whether
O	they
O	would
O	win
O	or
O	not
O	in
O	battle
O	.
O	You
O	see
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	utter
O	distress
O	lasted
O	only
O	from
O	soon
O	after
O	Twelfth-night
O	to
O	Easter
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	during
O	that
O	time
O	the
O	taking
O	of
O	the
O	Raven
O	must
O	have
O	cheered
O	the
O	English
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	.
O	After
O	Easter
O	things
O	began
O	to
O	mend
O	,
O	when
O	Alfred
O	built
O	his
O	fort
O	at
O	Athelney
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	skirmish
O	with
O	the
O	Danes
O	,
O	and
O	seven
O	weeks
O	later
O	came
O	the
O	great
O	victory
O	at
O	Ethandun
O	,
O	which
O	set
O	Wessex
O	free
O	.
O	Some
O	say
O	that
O	the
O	white
O	horse
O	which
O	is
O	cut
O	in
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	chalk
O	hills
O	near
O	Edington
O	was
O	cut
O	then
O	,
O	that
O	men
O	might
O	remember
O	the
O	great
O	battle
O	of
O	Ethandun
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	has
O	been
O	altered
O	in
O	modern
O	times
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	look
O	more
O	like
O	a
O	real
O	horse
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	time
O	Alfred
O	seems
O	to
O	have
O	kept
O	his
O	headquarters
O	at
O	Athelney
O	.
O	Thence
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	Wedmore
O	.
O	There
O	the
O	Wise
O	Men
O	came
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	Alfred
O	and
O	Guthorm
O	(
O	or
O	,
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	name
O	by
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	baptised
O	,
O	Aethelstan
O	)
O	made
O	a
O	treaty
O	.
O	This
O	treaty
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	better
O	kept
O	than
O	any
O	treaty
O	with
O	the
O	Danes
O	had
O	ever
O	been
O	kept
O	before
O	.
O	The
O	Danes
O	got
O	much
O	the
O	larger
O	part
O	of
O	England
O	;
O	still
O	Alfred
O	contrived
O	to
O	keep
O	London
O	.
O	Some
O	accounts
O	say
O	that
O	only
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	Danes
O	stayed
O	in
O	England
O	who
O	chose
O	to
O	become
O	Christians
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	rest
O	went
O	away
O	into
O	Gaul
O	under
O	a
O	famous
O	leader
O	of
O	theirs
O	named
O	Hasting
O	.
O	Anyhow
O	,
O	in
O	880
O	they
O	went
O	quite
O	away
O	into
O	what
O	was
O	now
O	their
O	own
O	land
O	of
O	East-Anglia
O	,
O	and
O	divided
O	it
O	among
O	themselves
O	.
O	Thus
O	Alfred
O	had
O	quite
O	freed
O	his
O	own
O	Kingdom
O	from
O	the
O	Danes
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	leave
O	so
O	much
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	.
O	And
O	even
O	through
O	all
O	these
O	misfortunes
O	,
O	the
O	Kingdom
O	of
O	Wessex
O	did
O	in
O	some
O	sort
O	become
O	greater
O	.
O	Remember
O	that
O	in
O	880
O	,
O	when
O	Alfred
O	had
O	done
O	so
O	many
O	great
O	things
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	still
O	only
O	thirty-one
O	years
O	old
O	.
O	We
O	can
O	see
O	how
O	much
O	people
O	always
O	remembered
O	and
O	thought
O	of
O	Alfred
O	,
O	by
O	there
O	being
O	many
O	more
O	stories
O	told
O	of
O	him
O	than
O	of
O	almost
O	any
O	other
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	Kings
O	.
O	One
O	story
O	is
O	that
O	Alfred
O	,
O	wishing
O	to
O	know
O	what
O	the
O	Danes
O	were
O	about
O	and
O	how
O	strong
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	set
O	out
O	one
O	day
O	from
O	Athelney
O	in
O	the
O	disguise
O	of
O	a
O	minstrel
O	or
O	juggler
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	Danish
O	camp
O	,
O	and
O	stayed
O	there
O	several
O	days
O	,
O	amusing
O	the
O	Danes
O	with
O	his
O	playing
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	wanted
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	went
O	back
O	without
O	any
O	one
O	finding
O	him
O	out
O	.
O	This
O	is
O	what
O	you
O	may
O	call
O	a
O	soldier
O	'
O	s
O	story
O	,
O	while
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	others
O	are
O	rather
O	what
O	monks
O	and
O	clergymen
O	would
O	like
O	to
O	tell
O	.
O	Thus
O	there
O	is
O	a
O	tale
O	which
O	is
O	told
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	different
O	ways
O	,
O	but
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	following
O	is
O	the
O	oldest
O	shape
O	.
O	``
O	Now
O	King
O	Alfred
O	was
O	driven
O	from
O	his
O	Kingdom
O	by
O	the
O	Danes
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	lay
O	hid
O	for
O	three
O	years
O	in
O	the
O	isle
O	of
O	Glastonbury
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	on
O	a
O	day
O	that
O	all
O	his
O	folk
O	were
O	gone
O	out
O	to
O	fish
O	,
O	save
O	only
O	Alfred
O	himself
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	one
O	servant
O	whom
O	he
O	loved
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	pilgrim
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	and
O	begged
O	for
O	food
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	King
O	said
O	to
O	his
O	servant
O	,
O	'
O	What
O	food
O	have
O	we
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	?
O	'
O	And
O	his
O	servant
O	answered
O	,
O	'
O	My
O	Lord
O	,
O	we
O	have
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	but
O	one
O	loaf
O	and
O	a
O	little
O	wine
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	the
O	King
O	gave
O	thanks
O	to
O	God
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	Give
O	half
O	of
O	the
O	loaf
O	and
O	half
O	of
O	the
O	wine
O	to
O	this
O	poor
O	pilgrim
O	.
O	'
O	So
O	the
O	servant
O	did
O	as
O	his
O	lord
O	commanded
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	to
O	the
O	pilgrim
O	half
O	of
O	the
O	loaf
O	and
O	half
O	of
O	the
O	wine
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	pilgrim
O	gave
O	great
O	thanks
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	servant
O	returned
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	loaf
O	whole
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wine
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	there
O	had
O	been
O	aforetime
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	greatly
O	wondered
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	wondered
O	also
O	how
O	the
O	pilgrim
O	had
O	come
O	into
O	the
O	isle
O	,
O	for
O	that
O	no
O	man
O	could
O	come
O	there
O	save
O	by
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	pilgrim
O	had
O	no
O	boat
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	King
O	greatly
O	wondered
O	also
O	.
O	And
O	at
O	the
O	ninth
O	hour
O	came
O	back
O	the
O	folk
O	who
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	fish
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	had
O	three
O	boats
O	full
O	of
O	fish
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	Lo
O	,
O	we
O	have
O	caught
O	more
O	fish
O	this
O	day
O	than
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	three
O	years
O	that
O	we
O	have
O	tarried
O	in
O	this
O	island
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	the
O	King
O	was
O	glad
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	folk
O	were
O	merry
O	;
O	yet
O	he
O	pondered
O	much
O	upon
O	that
O	which
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	pass
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	night
O	came
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	bed
O	with
O	Ealhswyth
O	his
O	wife
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Lady
O	slept
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	King
O	lay
O	awake
O	and
O	thought
O	of
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	pass
O	by
O	day
O	.
O	And
O	presently
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	light
O	,
O	like
O	the
O	brightness
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	with
O	black
O	hair
O	,
O	clothed
O	in
O	priest
O	'
O	s
O	garments
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	mitre
O	on
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	holding
O	in
O	his
O	right
O	hand
O	a
O	book
O	of
O	the
O	Gospels
O	adorned
O	with
O	gold
O	and
O	gems
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	blessed
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	said
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	'
O	Who
O	art
O	thou
O	?
O	'
O	And
O	he
O	answered
O	,
O	'
O	Alfred
O	,
O	my
O	son
O	,
O	rejoice
O	;
O	for
O	I

O	thou
O	didst
O	this
O	day
O	give

O	and
O	I
O	am
O	called

O	the
O	soldier
O	of

O	.
O	Now
O	be

O	And
O	now
O	I
O	will

O	must

O	Then

O	hour
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	word
O	of
O	the
O	Lord
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	gathered
O	unto
O	him
O	five
O	hundred
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	bravest
O	and
O	dearest
O	of
O	his
O	friends
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	spake
O	unto
O	them
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	all
O	that
O	God
O	had
O	said
O	unto
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	his
O	servant
O	Cuthberht
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	told
O	them
O	that
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	gift
O	of
O	God
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	Saint
O	Cuthberht
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	overcome
O	their
O	enemies
O	and
O	win
O	back
O	their
O	own
O	land
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	bade
O	them
O	as
O	Saint
O	Cuthberht
O	had
O	taught
O	him
O	,
O	to
O	fear
O	God
O	alway
O	and
O	to
O	be
O	alway
O	righteous
O	toward
O	all
O	men
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	bade
O	his
O	son
O	Edward
O	who
O	was
O	by
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	faithful
O	to
O	God
O	and
O	Saint
O	Cuthberht
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	he
O	should
O	alway
O	have
O	the
O	victory
O	over
O	his
O	enemies
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	went
O	forth
O	to
O	battle
O	and
O	smote
O	their
O	enemies
O	and
O	overcame
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	King
O	Alfred
O	took
O	the
O	Kingdom
O	of
O	all
O	Britain
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	ruled
O	well
O	and
O	wisely
O	over
O	the
O	just
O	and
O	the
O	unjust
O	for
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	his
O	days
O	.
O	``
O	Now
O	is
O	there
O	any
O	truth
O	in
O	all
O	this
O	story
O	?
O	I
O	think
O	there
O	is
O	thus
O	much
O	,
O	that
O	Alfred
O	,
O	for
O	some
O	reason
O	or
O	other
O	,
O	thought
O	he
O	was
O	under
O	the
O	special
O	protection
O	of
O	Saint
O	Cuthberht
O	.
O	For
O	several
O	years
O	after
O	880
O	there
O	was
O	peace
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	a
O	good
O	many
O	more
O	years
O	still
O	there
O	was
O	much
O	less
O	fighting
O	than
O	there
O	had
O	been
O	before
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	no
O	doubt
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	that
O	Alfred
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	do
O	all
O	those
O	things
O	for
O	the
O	good
O	of
O	his
O	people
O	of
O	which
O	we
O	hear
O	so
O	much
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	now
O	more
O	time
O	than
O	either
O	before
O	or
O	after
O	for
O	making
O	his
O	laws
O	,
O	writing
O	his
O	books
O	,
O	founding
O	his
O	monasteries
O	,
O	and
O	doing
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	.
O	You
O	may
O	wonder
O	how
O	he
O	found
O	time
O	to
O	do
O	so
O	much
O	;
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	by
O	the
O	only
O	way
O	by
O	which
O	anybody
O	can
O	do
O	anything
O	,
O	namely
O	,
O	by
O	never
O	wasting
O	his
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	having
O	fixed
O	times
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	for
O	everything
O	.
O	Alfred
O	did
O	not
O	,
O	like
O	most
O	other
O	writers
O	of
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	write
O	in
O	Latin
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	hardly
O	anybody
O	but
O	the
O	clergy
O	could
O	read
O	or
O	understand
O	what
O	he
O	wrote
O	.
O	He
O	loved
O	our
O	own
O	tongue
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	especially
O	fond
O	of
O	the
O	Old-English
O	songs
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	wrote
O	he
O	wrote
O	in
O	English
O	that
O	all
O	his
O	people
O	might
O	understand
O	.
O	His
O	works
O	were
O	chiefly
O	translations
O	from
O	Latin
O	books
O	;
O	what
O	we
O	should
O	have
O	valued
O	most
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	his
O	notebook
O	or
O	handbook
O	,
O	containing
O	his
O	remarks
O	on
O	various
O	matters
O	,
O	is
O	lost
O	.
O	He
O	translated
O	into
O	English
O	the
O	History
O	of
O	Basda
O	,
O	the
O	History
O	of
O	Orosius
O	,
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	works
O	of
O	Pope
O	Gregory
O	the
O	Great
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Consolation
O	of
O	Philosophy
O	by
O	Boethius
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	you
O	will
O	ask
O	why
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	rather
O	translate
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	and
O	famous
O	Greek
O	and
O	Latin
O	writers
O	of
O	earlier
O	times
O	.
O	Now
O	we
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	that
O	King
O	Alfred
O	did
O	not
O	understand
O	Greek
O	at
O	all
O	;
O	very
O	few
O	people
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	in
O	the
O	West
O	of
O	Europe
O	knew
O	any
O	Greek
O	,
O	except
O	those
O	who
O	needed
O	to
O	use
O	the
O	language
O	for
O	dealing
O	with
O	the
O	men
O	in
O	the
O	Eastern
O	Empire
O	who
O	still
O	spoke
O	it
O	.
O	Indeed
O	Alfred
O	complains
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	Crown
O	,
O	very
O	few
O	people
O	,
O	even
O	among
O	the
O	clergy
O	,
O	understood
O	even
O	Latin
O	at
O	all
O	well
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	for
O	Latin
O	books
O	,
O	no
O	doubt
O	Alfred
O	thought
O	that
O	the
O	writings
O	of
O	Christians
O	would
O	be
O	more
O	edifying
O	to
O	his
O	people
O	than
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	heathens
O	.
O	He
O	chose
O	the
O	History
O	of
O	Orosius
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	general
O	history
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	of
O	Basda
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	particular
O	history
O	of
O	England
O	.
O	Boethius
O	was
O	a
O	Roman
O	Consul
O	in
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	the
O	sixth
O	century
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	put
O	to
O	death
O	by
O	the
O	great
O	Theodoric
O	,
O	King
O	of
O	the
O	East-Goths
O	,
O	who
O	then
O	ruled
O	over
O	Italy
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	prison
O	he
O	wrote
O	the
O	book
O	which
O	King
O	Alfred
O	translated
O	.
O	He
O	seems
O	not
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	Christian
O	;
O	at
O	least
O	there
O	is
O	not
O	a
O	single
O	Christian
O	expression
O	in
O	his
O	book
O	.
O	But
O	people
O	fancied
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	only
O	a
O	Christian
O	,
O	but
O	a
O	saint
O	and
O	a
O	martyr
O	,
O	most
O	likely
O	because
O	Theodoric
O	,
O	who
O	put
O	him
O	to
O	death
O	,
O	was
O	not
O	an
O	orthodox
O	Christian
O	,
O	but
O	an
O	Arian
O	.
O	Alfred
O	,
O	in
O	translating
O	his
O	books
O	,
O	did
O	not
O	always
O	care
O	to
O	translate
O	them
O	quite
O	exactly
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	often
O	altered
O	and
O	put
O	in
O	things
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	could
O	thus
O	make
O	them
O	more
O	improving
O	.
O	So
O	in
O	translating
O	Boethius
O	,
O	he
O	altered
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	wise
O	heathen
O	speak
O	like
O	a
O	Christian
O	.
O	So
O	in
O	translating
O	Orosius
O	,
O	where
O	Orosius
O	gives
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	Alfred
O	greatly
O	enlarged
O	the
O	account
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	northern
O	part
O	of
O	Europe
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	Alfred
O	naturally
O	knew
O	much
O	more
O	than
O	Orosius
O	did
O	.
O	Alfred
O	was
O	also
O	very
O	careful
O	in
O	the
O	government
O	of
O	his
O	Kingdom
O	,
O	especially
O	in
O	seeing
O	that
O	justice
O	was
O	properly
O	administered
O	.
O	So
O	men
O	said
O	of
O	him
O	in
O	their
O	songs
O	,
O	much
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	long
O	before
O	said
O	of
O	King
O	Edwin
O	in
O	Northumberland
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	hung
O	up
O	golden
O	bracelets
O	by
O	the
O	roadside
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	no
O	man
O	dared
O	to
O	steal
O	them
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	collection
O	of
O	laws
O	,
O	he
O	chiefly
O	put
O	in
O	order
O	the
O	laws
O	of
O	the
O	older
O	Kings
O	,
O	not
O	adding
O	many
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	those
O	who
O	came
O	after
O	him
O	might
O	like
O	them
O	.
O	King
O	Alfred
O	was
O	very
O	attentive
O	to
O	religious
O	matters
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	great
O	alms
O	to
O	the
O	poor
O	and
O	gifts
O	to
O	churches
O	.
O	He
O	also
O	founded
O	two
O	monasteries
O	;
O	one
O	was
O	for
O	nuns
O	,
O	at
O	Shaftesbury
O	in
O	Dorsetshire
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	made
O	his
O	own
O	daughter
O	,
O	Aethelgifu
O	,
O	abbess
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	was
O	for
O	monks
O	at
O	Athelney
O	;
O	you
O	can
O	easily
O	see
O	why
O	he
O	should
O	build
O	it
O	there
O	.
O	He
O	also
O	sent
O	several
O	embassies
O	to
O	Rome
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	got
O	Pope
O	Marinus
O	to
O	grant
O	certain
O	privileges
O	to
O	the
O	English
O	School
O	at
O	Rome
O	;
O	the
O	Pope
O	also
O	sent
O	him
O	what
O	was
O	thought
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	of
O	the
O	True
O	Cross
O	,
O	that
O	on
O	which
O	our
O	Lord
O	Jesus
O	Christ
O	died
O	.
O	He
O	also
O	sent
O	an
O	embassy
O	to
O	Jerusalem
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	letters
O	from
O	Abel
O	the
O	Patriarch
O	there
O	.
O	And
O	what
O	seems
O	stranger
O	than
O	all
O	,
O	he
O	sent
O	an
O	embassy
O	all
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	India
O	,
O	with
O	alms
O	for
O	the
O	Christians
O	there
O	,
O	called
O	the
O	Christians
O	of
O	Saint
O	Thomas
O	and
O	Saint
O	Bartholomew
O	.
O	Lastly
O	,
O	there
O	seems
O	some
O	reason
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	the
O	Chronicle
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	put
O	together
O	in
O	its
O	present
O	shape
O	in
O	Alfred
O	'
O	s
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	regularly
O	gone
O	on
O	with
O	afterward
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	from
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	Alfred
O	onward
O	we
O	have
O	a
O	history
O	which
O	was
O	regularly
O	written
O	down
O	as
O	things
O	happened
O	.
O	All
O	these
O	things
O	happened
O	mainly
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	years
O	of
O	the
O	reign
O	of
O	Alfred
O	,
O	when
O	there
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	less
O	fighting
O	than
O	there
O	was
O	before
O	and
O	after
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	some
O	years
O	seem
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	quite
O	peaceable
O	.
O	Guthorm
O	Aethelstan
O	and
O	his
O	Danes
O	in
O	East-Anglia
O	were
O	for
O	some
O	years
O	true
O	to
O	the
O	treaty
O	of
O	Wedmore
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	Danes
O	seem
O	just
O	now
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	busy
O	in
O	invading
O	Gaul
O	and
O	other
O	parts
O	of
O	the
O	continent
O	rather
O	than
O	England
O	.
O	Also
O	King
O	Alfred
O	had
O	now
O	got
O	a
O	fleet
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	often
O	met
O	them
O	at
O	sea
O	and
O	kept
O	them
O	from
O	landing
O	.
O	This
O	he
O	did
O	in
O	882
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	do
O	not
O	find
O	that
O	any
O	Danes
O	landed
O	again
O	in
O	England
O	till
O	885
O	.
O	In
O	that
O	year
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	army
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	plundering
O	along
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	Flanders
O	and
O	Holland
O	came
O	over
O	to
O	England
O	,
O	landed
O	in
O	Kent
O	,
O	and
O	besieged
O	Rochester
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	citizens
O	withstood
O	them
O	bravely
O	,
O	and
O	Alfred
O	gathered
O	an
O	army
O	and
O	drove
O	the
O	Danes
O	to
O	their
O	ships
O	.
O	They
O	seem
O	then
O	to
O	have
O	gone
O	to
O	Essex
O	and
O	to
O	have
O	plundered
O	there
O	with
O	their
O	ships
O	,
O	getting
O	help
O	from
O	the
O	Danes
O	who
O	were
O	settled
O	in
O	East-Anglia
O	,
O	or
O	at
O	least
O	from
O	such
O	of
O	them
O	as
O	still
O	were
O	heathens
O	.
O	Alfred
O	'
O	s
O	fleet
O	however
O	quite
O	overcame
O	them
O	and
O	took
O	away
O	their
O	treasure
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	fleet
O	was
O	again
O	attacked
O	and
O	defeated
O	by
O	the
O	East-Anglian
O	Danes
O	.
O	It
O	would
O	seem
O	that
O	in
O	some
O	part
O	of
O	this
O	war
O	Guthorm
O	Aethelstan
O	was
O	helped
O	by
O	Hrolf
O	,
O	otherwise
O	called
O	Rollo
O	,
O	the
O	great
O	Northern
O	chief
O	.
O	The
O	Danish
O	wars
O	began
O	again
O	in
O	893
O	.
O	For
O	years
O	now
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	fighting
O	.
O	Two
O	large
O	bodies
O	of
O	Danes
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	under
O	the
O	famous
O	chief
O	Hasting
O	,
O	landed
O	in
O	Kent
O	in
O	893
O	and
O	fixed
O	themselves
O	in
O	fortresses
O	which
O	they
O	built
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Danes
O	who
O	had
O	settled
O	in
O	Northumberland
O	and
O	East-Anglia
O	helped
O	them
O	,
O	though
O	they
O	had
O	all
O	sworn
O	oaths
O	to
O	King
O	Alfred
O	,
O	and
O	those
O	in
O	East-Anglia
O	had
O	also
O	given
O	hostages
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	fighting
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	south
O	of
O	England
O	throughout
O	894
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	had
O	to
O	go
O	constantly
O	backward
O	and
O	forward
O	to
O	keep
O	up
O	with
O	the
O	Danes
O	.
O	One
O	time
O	Alfred
O	took
O	a
O	fort
O	in
O	Kent
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	were
O	the
O	wife
O	and
O	two
O	sons
O	of
O	Hasting
O	.
O	Now
O	Hasting
O	had
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	given
O	oaths
O	and
O	hostages
O	to
O	Alfred
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	boys
O	had
O	been
O	baptised
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	being
O	godfather
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	and
O	Alderman
O	Aethelred
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	But
O	Hasting
O	did
O	not
O	at
O	all
O	keep
O	to
O	his
O	oath
O	,
O	but
O	went
O	on
O	plundering
O	all
O	the
O	same
O	.
O	Still
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	boys
O	and
O	their
O	mother
O	were
O	taken
O	,
O	Alfred
O	would
O	not
O	do
O	them
O	any
O	harm
O	,
O	but
O	gave
O	them
O	up
O	again
O	to
O	Hasting
O	.
O	In
O	897
O	we
O	read
O	that
O	Alfred
O	made
O	some
O	improvements
O	in
O	his
O	ships
O	.
O	``
O	They
O	were
O	full-nigh
O	twice
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	the
O	others
O	;
O	some
O	had
O	sixty
O	oars
O	,
O	some
O	more
O	;
O	they
O	were
O	both
O	swifter
O	and
O	steadier
O	and
O	eke
O	higher
O	than
O	the
O	others
O	;
O	they
O	were
O	neither
O	on
O	the
O	Frisian
O	shape
O	nor
O	on
O	the
O	Danish
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	himself
O	thought
O	that
O	they
O	useful
O	might
O	be
O	.
O	``
O	These
O	new
O	ships
O	seem
O	to
O	have
O	done
O	good
O	service
O	,
O	though
O	one
O	time
O	they
O	got
O	aground
O	,
O	seemingly
O	because
O	they
O	were
O	so
O	large
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Danes
O	were
O	therefore
O	able
O	to
O	sail
O	out
O	before
O	them
O	.
O	These
O	sea-fights
O	along
O	the
O	south
O	coast
O	were
O	nearly
O	the
O	last
O	things
O	that
O	we
O	hear
O	of
O	in
O	Alfred
O	'
O	s
O	reign
O	.
O	The
O	crews
O	of
O	two
O	Danish
O	ships
O	were
O	brought
O	to
O	Winchester
O	to
O	Alfred
O	and
O	there
O	hanged
O	.
O	One
O	can
O	not
O	blame
O	him
O	for
O	this
O	,
O	as
O	these
O	Danes
O	were
O	mere
O	pirates
O	,
O	not
O	engaged
O	in
O	any
O	lawful
O	war
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	been
O	spared
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	made
O	oaths
O	to
O	Alfred
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	broken
O	them
O	,
O	over
O	and
O	over
O	again
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	in
O	897
O	;
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	King
O	Alfred
O	'
O	s
O	reign
O	seems
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	spent
O	in
O	peace
O	.
O	In
O	901
O	the
O	great
O	King
O	died
O	himself
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	then
O	only
O	fifty-two
O	years
O	old
O	.
O	Alfred
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	,
O	the
O	Lady
O	Ealhswyth
O	,
O	lived
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	after
O	her
O	husband
O	,
O	till
O	903
O	or
O	905
O	.
O	King
O	Alfred
O	was
O	buried
O	at
O	Winchester
O	in
O	the
O	New
O	Minster
O	which
O	he
O	himself
O	began
O	to
O	found
O	and
O	which
O	was
O	finished
O	by
O	his
O	son
O	Edward
O	.
O	It
O	then
O	stood
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	Old
O	Minster
O	,
O	that
O	is
O	,
O	the
O	cathedral
O	church
O	.
O	Afterward
O	it
O	was
O	moved
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	and
O	was
O	called
O	Hyde
O	Abbey
O	.
O	But
O	you
O	can
O	not
O	see
O	King
O	Alfred
O	'
O	s
O	grave
O	there
O	now
O	,
O	because
O	everything
O	has
O	been
O	destroyed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bones
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	King
O	have
O	been
O	turned
O	out
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	room
O	for
O	a
O	prison
O	.
