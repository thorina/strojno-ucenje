O	The
O	young
O	Tamlane
O	had
O	lived
O	among
O	mortals
O	for
O	only
O	nine
O	short
O	years
O	ere
O	he
O	was
O	carried
O	away
O	by
O	the
O	Queen
O	of
O	the
O	Fairies
O	,
O	away
O	to
O	live
O	in
O	Fairyland
O	.
O	His
O	father
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	knight
O	of
O	great
O	renown
O	,
O	his
O	mother
O	a
O	lady
O	of
O	high
O	degree
O	,
O	and
O	sorry
O	indeed
O	were
O	they
O	to
O	lose
O	their
O	son
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	is
O	how
O	it
O	happened
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	soon
O	after
O	Tamlane
O	'
O	s
O	ninth
O	birthday
O	,
O	his
O	uncle
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	Tamlane
O	,
O	now
O	that
O	ye
O	are
O	nine
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	ye
O	shall
O	,
O	an
O	ye
O	like
O	it
O	,
O	ride
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	the
O	hunt
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	Tamlane
O	jumped
O	for
O	joy
O	,
O	and
O	clapped
O	his
O	hands
O	for
O	glee
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	rode
O	away
O	with
O	his
O	uncle
O	to
O	hunt
O	and
O	hawk
O	.
O	Over
O	the
O	moors
O	they
O	rode
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wind
O	it
O	blew
O	cold
O	from
O	the
O	north
O	.
O	Over
O	the
O	moors
O	they
O	rode
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	cold
O	north
O	wind
O	blew
O	upon
O	the
O	young
O	Tamlane
O	until
O	he
O	grew
O	cold
O	and
O	stiff
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	reins
O	they
O	fell
O	from
O	his
O	hands
O	and
O	down
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	slipped
O	Tamlane
O	,
O	and
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	to
O	rest
O	,
O	so
O	weary
O	,
O	so
O	cold
O	was
O	he
O	.
O	But
O	no
O	sooner
O	had
O	he
O	lain
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	bare
O	earth
O	than
O	he
O	closed
O	his
O	eyes
O	and
O	fell
O	fast
O	asleep
O	.
O	And
O	no
O	sooner
O	had
O	he
O	fallen
O	fast
O	asleep
O	than
O	the
O	Queen
O	of
O	the
O	Fairies
O	came
O	and
O	carried
O	Tamlane
O	off
O	to
O	Fairyland
O	.
O	For
O	long
O	years
O	Tamlane
O	dwelt
O	among
O	the
O	little
O	green
O	folk
O	,
O	yet
O	ofttimes
O	he
O	would
O	come
O	back
O	to
O	visit
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	his
O	birth
O	.
O	Now
O	many
O	were
O	the
O	hills
O	and
O	dells
O	haunted
O	by
O	the
O	fairy
O	folk
O	.
O	Yet
O	neither
O	hill
O	nor
O	dell
O	pleased
O	them
O	more
O	than
O	the
O	lone
O	plain
O	of
O	Carterhaugh
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	soft-flowing
O	rivers
O	of
O	Ettrick
O	and
O	Yarrow
O	met
O	and
O	mingled
O	.
O	Many
O	a
O	long
O	day
O	after
O	fairies
O	were
O	banished
O	from
O	the
O	plain
O	of
O	Carterhaugh
O	would
O	the
O	peasant
O	folk
O	come
O	to
O	gaze
O	at
O	the
O	circles
O	which
O	still
O	marked
O	the
O	green
O	grass
O	of
O	the
O	lone
O	moor
O	.
O	The
O	circles
O	had
O	been
O	made
O	,
O	so
O	they
O	said
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	tiny
O	feet
O	of
O	the
O	fairies
O	as
O	they
O	danced
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	in
O	a
O	ring
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	before
O	the
O	fairies
O	were
O	banished
O	from
O	the
O	plain
O	of
O	Carterhaugh
O	,
O	strange
O	sights
O	were
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	there
O	by
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	moon
O	.
O	Little
O	folk
O	,
O	dressed
O	all
O	in
O	green
O	,
O	would
O	flit
O	across
O	the
O	moor
O	.
O	They
O	would
O	form
O	tiny
O	rings
O	and
O	dance
O	on
O	their
O	tiny
O	toes
O	until
O	the
O	moonlight
O	failed
O	.
O	Little
O	horsemen
O	dressed
O	in
O	green
O	would
O	go
O	riding
O	by
O	,
O	the
O	bells
O	on
O	the
O	fairy
O	bridles
O	playing
O	magic
O	music
O	the
O	while
O	.
O	Sounds
O	too
O	,
O	unknown
O	to
O	mortals
O	,
O	would
O	tremble
O	on
O	the
O	still
O	night
O	air
O	.
O	Full
O	of
O	mischief
O	too
O	were
O	these
O	little
O	elfin
O	folk
O	,
O	and
O	wise
O	mortals
O	feared
O	to
O	tread
O	where
O	fairy
O	feet
O	were
O	tripping
O	.
O	Wise
O	mortals
O	would
O	warn
O	the
O	merry
O	children
O	and
O	the
O	winsome
O	maidens
O	lest
O	they
O	should
O	venture
O	too
O	near
O	the
O	favourite
O	haunts
O	of
O	fairydom
O	.
O	To
O	Carterhaugh
O	came
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	told
O	you
O	,
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	fairy
O	folk
O	;
O	but
O	more
O	often
O	than
O	any
O	other
O	came
O	a
O	little
O	elfin
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	young
O	Tamlane
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	carried
O	away
O	to
O	Fairyland
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	only
O	nine
O	years
O	old
O	.
O	Beyond
O	all
O	other
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	green
O	folk
O	was
O	the
O	elf
O	knight
O	feared
O	.
O	And
O	little
O	was
O	that
O	to
O	be
O	wondered
O	at
O	,
O	for
O	well
O	was
O	it
O	known
O	that
O	over
O	many
O	a
O	fair-haired
O	child
O	,
O	over
O	many
O	a
O	beauteous
O	maiden
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	used
O	his
O	magic
O	power
O	.
O	Nor
O	would
O	he
O	let
O	them
O	go
O	until
O	they
O	promised
O	to
O	come
O	back
O	another
O	moonlit
O	eve
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	a
O	pledge
O	of
O	their
O	promise
O	he
O	would
O	seize
O	from
O	the
O	children
O	a
O	toy
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	maidens
O	a
O	ring
O	,
O	or
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	their
O	mantle
O	of
O	green
O	.
O	Now
O	about
O	two
O	miles
O	from
O	the
O	plain
O	of
O	Carterhaugh
O	stood
O	a
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	fair
O	maiden
O	named
O	Janet
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	her
O	father
O	sent
O	for
O	his
O	daughter
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	Janet
O	,
O	ye
O	may
O	leave
O	the
O	castle
O	grounds
O	,
O	an
O	ye
O	please
O	,
O	but
O	never
O	may
O	ye
O	cross
O	the
O	plain
O	of
O	Carterhaugh
O	.
O	For
O	there
O	ye
O	may
O	be
O	found
O	by
O	young
O	Tamlane
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	it
O	is
O	who
O	ofttimes
O	casts
O	a
O	spell
O	o
O	'
O	er
O	bonny
O	maidens
O	.
O	'
O	Now
O	Janet
O	was
O	a
O	wilful
O	daughter
O	.
O	She
O	answered
O	her
O	father
O	never
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	left
O	his
O	presence
O	she
O	laughed
O	aloud
O	,
O	she
O	tossed
O	her
O	head
O	.
O	To
O	her
O	ladies
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	Go
O	to
O	Carterhaugh
O	will
O	I
O	an
O	I
O	list
O	,
O	and
O	come
O	from
O	Carterhaugh
O	will
O	I
O	an
O	I
O	please
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	will
O	I
O	ask
O	leave
O	of
O	any
O	one
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	when
O	the
O	moonbeams
O	peeped
O	in
O	at
O	her
O	lattice
O	window
O	,
O	the
O	lady
O	Janet
O	tucked
O	up
O	her
O	green
O	skirt
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	run
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	coiled
O	her
O	beautiful
O	yellow
O	hair
O	as
O	a
O	crown
O	above
O	her
O	brow
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	was
O	off
O	and
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	lone
O	plain
O	of
O	Carterhaugh
O	.
O	The
O	moonlight
O	stole
O	across
O	the
O	moor
O	,
O	and
O	Janet
O	laughed
O	aloud
O	in
O	her
O	glee
O	.
O	She
O	ran
O	across
O	to
O	the
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	standing
O	alone
O	,
O	riderless
O	,
O	stood
O	the
O	steed
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	elfin
O	knight
O	.
O	Janet
O	put
O	out
O	her
O	hand
O	to
O	the
O	rose-tree
O	that
O	grew
O	by
O	the
O	well
O	and
O	plucked
O	a
O	dark
O	red
O	rose
O	.
O	Sweet
O	was
O	its
O	scent
O	and
O	Janet
O	put
O	out
O	her
O	hand
O	and
O	plucked
O	another
O	rose

O	pulled
O	a
O	third
O	,
O	close
O	beside

O	stood
O	a
O	little
O	wee
O	man
O	.
O	He
O	reached
O	no

O	lady
O	Janet

O	yet
O	ye

O	The
O	lady
O	Janet
O	tossed

O	and
O	Janet
O	stamped

O	foot
O	.
O	'
O	My

O	But
O	the
O	young
O	Tamlane
O	took
O	the
O	white
O	hand
O	of
O	the
O	lady
O	Janet
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	gentle
O	were
O	his
O	words
O	,
O	so
O	kind
O	his
O	ways
O	,
O	that
O	soon
O	the
O	maiden
O	had
O	no
O	wish
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	little
O	wee
O	man
O	.
O	Hand
O	in
O	hand
O	they
O	wandered
O	through
O	the
O	red
O	rose-bushes
O	that
O	grew
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the

O	And
O	in
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	moon
O	the
O	elf
O	knight
O	wove
O	his
O	spell
O	and
O	made
O	the
O	lady
O	Janet
O	his
O	own
O	.
O	Back
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	sped
O	Janet
O	when
O	the
O	moonlight
O	failed
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	her
O	smiles
O	were
O	gone
O	.
O	Lone
O	and
O	sad
O	was
O	she
O	,
O	all
O	with
O	longing
O	for
O	her
O	little
O	elfin
O	knight
O	.
O	Little
O	food
O	would
O	Janet
O	eat
O	in
O	these
O	days
O	,
O	little
O	heed
O	would
O	she
O	take
O	of
O	the
O	gowns
O	she
O	wore
O	.
O	Her
O	yellow
O	hair
O	hung
O	down
O	uncombed
O	,
O	unbraided
O	around
O	her
O	sad
O	,
O	pale
O	face
O	.
O	Janet
O	had
O	been
O	used
O	to
O	join
O	in
O	the
O	games
O	her
O	four-and-twenty
O	maidens
O	played
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	run
O	the
O	quickest
O	,
O	tossed
O	the
O	ball
O	the
O	highest
O	,

O	Now
O	the
O	maidens
O	might
O	play
O	as
O	they
O	listed
O	,
O	little
O	did
O	the

O	Janet
O	care
O	.
O	When
O	evening
O	fell
O	,
O	her
O	four-and-twenty
O	ladies
O	would
O	play
O	their
O	games
O	of

O	Many
O	a
O	game
O	had
O	Janet
O	won
O	in
O	bygone
O	days
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	ladies
O	might
O	win
O	or

O	as

O	pleased
O	,

O	The
O	milk-white

O	Ah
O	,
O	Janet
O	had
O	seized
O	the

O	steed

O	pulled
O	the

O	cry

O	,
O	of
O	angry
O	little
O	elfs
O	,
O	rang
O	out

O	Then

O	lay
O	in

O	Then

O	now
O	the
O	lady
O	Janet
O	threw
O	him
O	from
O	her
O	,
O	far
O	into
O	the
O	clear
O	,
O	cold
O	well
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	little
O	angry
O	imps
O	were
O	soon
O	shrieking
O	in
O	dismay
O	.
O	No

O	fagot
O	in
O	the

O	form
O	.
O	Then
O	over
O	the
O	tall
O	,
O	strong
O	knight
O	Janet
O	threw
O	her

O	mantle

O	Their
O	spell
O	was
O	broken
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	the
O	Queen
O	of
O	the
O	Fairies
O	had
O	hidden
O	herself
O	in
O	a
O	bush
O	of
O	broom
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	would
O	happen
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	her
O	favourite
O	knight
O	change
O	into
O	his
O	own
O	true
O	mortal
O	shape
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	very
O	cross
O	,
O	very
O	cross
O	indeed
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	fairy
O	band
O	was
O	ordered
O	to
O	march
O	home
O	in
O	silence
O	,
O	their
O	pipes
O	thrust
O	into
O	their

O	green
O	girdles
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	more
O	revels
O	in
O	the

O	court
O	for
O	many
