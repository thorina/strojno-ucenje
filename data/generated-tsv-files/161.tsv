O	,
O	who
O	was
O	never
O	so
O	happy
O	as
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	doing
O	wrong
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	gods
O	went
O	on
O	a
O	journey
O	they
O	travelled
O	fast
O	and
O	hard
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	strong
O	,
O	active
O	spirits

O	,

O	blows
O	,

O	,

O	,
O	and
O	struggle
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	no
O	roads
O	through
O	the
O	country
O	over
O	which
O	they
O	made
O	their

O	,
O	only

O	to
O	be
O	climbed
O	by
O	rocky
O	paths
O	,
O	deep
O	valleys
O	into
O	which
O	the
O	sun
O	hardly
O	looked
O	during
O	half
O	the
O	year
O	,
O	and
O	swift-rushing
O	streams
O	,
O	cold
O	as
O	ice
O	,
O	and
O	treacherous
O	to
O	the
O	surest
O	foot
O	and
O	the
O	strongest
O	arm
O	.
O	Not
O	a
O	bird
O	flew
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	not
O	an
O	animal
O	sprang
O	through
O	the
O	trees
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	as
O	still
O	as
O	a
O	desert
O	.
O	The
O	gods
O	walked
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	,
O	getting
O	more
O	tired
O	and
O	hungry
O	at
O	every
O	step
O	.
O	The
O	sun
O	was
O	sinking
O	low
O	over
O	the
O	steep
O	,
O	pine-crested
O	mountains
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	travellers
O	had
O	neither
O	breakfasted
O	nor
O	dined
O	.
O	Even
O	Odin
O	was
O	beginning
O	to
O	feel
O	the
O	pangs
O	of
O	hunger
O	,
O	like
O	the
O	most
O	ordinary
O	mortal
O	,
O	when
O	suddenly
O	,
O	entering
O	a
O	little
O	valley
O	,
O	the
O	famished
O	gods
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	herd
O	of
O	cattle
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	work
O	of
O	a
O	minute
O	to
O	kill
O	a
O	great
O	ox
O	and
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	carcass
O	swinging
O	in
O	a
O	huge
O	pot
O	over
O	a
O	roaring
O	fire
O	.
O	But
O	never
O	were
O	gods
O	so
O	unlucky
O	before
O	!
O	In
O	spite
O	of
O	their
O	hunger
O	,
O	the
O	pot
O	would
O	not
O	boil
O	.
O	They
O	piled
O	on
O	the
O	wood
O	until
O	the
O	great
O	flames
O	crackled
O	and
O	licked
O	the
O	pot
O	with
O	their
O	fiery
O	tongues

O	but
O	every

O	The

O	into

O	tree
O	,

O	on

O	wanted
O	if

O	would

O	down
O	and
O	picked
O	out
O	both

O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	pretty

O	vainly
O	trying
O	to
O	persuade
O	her
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	eat
O	the
O	Apples
O	and
O	be
O	forever
O	young
O	like
O	the
O	gods
O	,
O	he
O	kept
O	her
O	a
O	lonely
O	prisoner
O	.
O	Loki
O	,
O	after
O	keeping
O	his
O	promise
O	and
O	delivering
O	Idun
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	giant
O	,
O	strayed
O	back
O	into
O	Asgard
O	as
O	if
O	nothing
O	had
O	happened
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	gods
O	assembled
O	for
O	their
O	feast
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	Idun
O	.
O	Day
O	after
O	day
O	went
O	past
O	,
O	and
O	still
O	the
O	beautiful
O	goddess
O	did
O	not
O	come
O	.
O	Little
O	by
O	little
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	youth
O	and
O	beauty
O	faded
O	from
O	the
O	home
O	of
O	the
O	gods
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	themselves
O	became
O	old
O	and
O	haggard
O	.
O	Their
O	strong
O	,
O	young
O	faces
O	were
O	lined
O	with
O	care
O	and
O	furrowed
O	by
O	age
O	,
O	their
O	raven
O	locks
O	passed
O	from
O	gray
O	to
O	white
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	flashing
O	eyes
O	became
O	dim
O	and
O	hollow
O	.
O	Brage
O	,
O	the
O	god
O	of
O	poetry
O	,
O	could
O	make
O	no
O	music
O	while
O	his
O	beautiful
O	wife
O	was
O	gone
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	whither
O	.
O	Morning
O	after
O	morning
O	the
O	faded
O	light
O	broke
O	on
O	paler
O	and
O	ever
O	paler
O	faces
O	,
O	until
O	even
O	in
O	heaven
O	the
O	eternal
O	light
O	of
O	youth
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	going
O	out
O	forever
O	.
O	Finally
O	the
O	gods
O	could
O	bear
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	power
O	and
O	joy
O	no
O	longer
O	.
O	They
O	made
O	rigorous
O	inquiry
O	.
O	They
O	tracked
O	Loki
O	on
O	that
O	fair
O	morning
O	when
O	he
O	led
O	Idun
O	beyond
O	the
O	gates;
O	they
O	seized
O	him
O	and
O	brought
O	him
O	into
O	solemn
O	council
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	read
O	in
O	their
O	haggard
O	faces
O	the
O	deadly
O	hate
O	which
O	flamed
O	in
O	all
O	their
O	hearts
O	against
O	his
O	treachery
O	,
O	his
O	courage
O	failed
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	promised
O	to
O	bring
O	Idun
O	back
O	to
O	Asgard
O	if
O	the
O	goddess
O	Freyja
O	would
O	lend
O	him
O	her
O	falcon
O	guise
O	.
O	No
O	sooner
O	said
O	than
O	done;
O	and
O	with
O	eager
O	gaze
O	the
O	gods
O	watched
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	flew
O	away
O	,
O	becoming
O	at
O	last
O	only
O	a
O	dark
O	moving
O	speck
O	against
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	After
O	long
O	and
O	weary
O	flight
O	Loki
O	came
O	to
O	Thrymheim
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	glad
O	enough
O	to
O	find
O	Thjasse
O	gone
O	to
O	sea
O	and
O	Idun
O	alone
O	in
O	his
O	dreary
O	house
O	.
O	He
O	changed
O	her
O	instantly
O	into
O	a
O	nut
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	her
O	thus
O	disguised
O	in
O	his
O	talons
O	,
O	flew
O	away
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	his
O	falcon
O	wings
O	could
O	carry
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	had
O	need
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	speed
O	,
O	for
O	Thjasse
O	,
O	coming
O	suddenly
O	home
O	and
O	finding
O	Idun
O	and
O	her
O	precious
O	fruit
O	gone
O	,
O	guessed
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	putting
O	on
O	his
O	eagle
O	plumage
O	,
O	flew
O	forth
O	in
O	a
O	mighty
O	rage
O	,
O	with
O	vengeance
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	Like
O	the
O	rushing
O	wings
O	of
O	a
O	tempest
O	,
O	his
O	mighty
O	pinions
O	beat
O	the
O	air
O	and
O	bore
O	him
O	swiftly
O	onward
O	.
O	From
O	mountain
O	peak
O	to
O	mountain
O	peak
O	he
O	measured
O	his
O	wide
O	course
O	,
O	almost
O	grazing
O	at
O	times
O	the
O	murmuring
O	pine
O	forests
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	sweeping
O	high
O	in
O	mid-air
O	with
O	nothing
O	above
O	but
O	the
O	arching
O	sky
O	,
O	and
O	nothing
O	beneath
O	but
O	the
O	tossing
O	sea
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	sees
O	the
O	falcon
O	far
O	ahead
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	his
O	flight
O	becomes
O	like
O	the
O	flash
O	of
O	the
O	lightning
O	for
O	swiftness
O	,
O	and
O	like
O	the
O	rushing
O	of
O	clouds
O	for
O	uproar
O	.
O	The
O	haggard
O	faces
O	of
O	the
O	gods
O	line
O	the
O	walls
O	of
O	Asgard
O	and
O	watch
O	the
O	race
O	with
O	tremulous
O	eagerness
O	.
O	Youth
O	and
O	immortality
O	are
O	staked
O	upon
O	the
O	winning
O	of
O	Loki
O	.
O	He
O	is
O	weary
O	enough
O	and
O	frightened
O	enough
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	eagle
O	sweeps
O	on
O	close
O	behind
O	him;
O	but
O	he
O	makes
O	desperate
O	efforts
O	to
O	widen
O	the
O	distance
O	between
O	them
O	.
O	Little
O	by
O	little
O	the
O	eagle
O	gains
O	on
O	the
O	falcon
O	.
O	The
O	gods
O	grow
O	white
O	with
O	fear;
O	they
O	rush
O	off
O	and
O	prepare
O	great
O	fires
O	upon
O	the
O	walls
O	.
O	With
O	fainting
O	,
O	drooping
O	wing
O	the
O	falcon
O	passes
O	over
O	and
O	drops
O	exhausted
O	by
O	the
O	wall
O	.
O	In
O	an
O	instant
O	the
O	fires
O	have
O	been
O	lighted
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	great
O	flames
O	roar
O	to
O	heaven
O	.
O	The
O	eagle
O	sweeps
O	across
O	the
O	fiery
O	line
O	a
O	second
O	later
O	,
O	and
O	falls
O	,
O	maimed
O	and
O	burned
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	where
O	a
O	dozen
O	fierce
O	hands
O	smite
O	the
O	life
O	out
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	great
O	giant
O	Thjasse
O	perishes
O	among
O	his
O	foes
O	.
O	Idun
O	resumes
O	her
O	natural
O	form
O	as
O	Brage
O	rushes
O	to
O	meet
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	gods
O	crowd
O	round
O	her
O	.
O	She
O	spreads
O	the
O	feast
O	,
O	the
O	golden
O	Apples
O	gleaming
O	with
O	unspeakable
O	lustre
O	in
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	the
O	gods
O	.
O	They
O	eat;
O	and
O	once
O	more
O	their
O	faces
O	glow
O	with
O	the
O	beauty
O	of
O	immortal
O	youth
O	,
O	their
O	eyes
O	flash
O	with
O	the
O	radiance
O	of
O	divine
O	power
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	while
O	Idun
O	stands
O	like
O	a
O	star
O	for
O	beauty
O	among
O	the
O	throng
O	,
O	the
O	song
O	of
O	Brage
O	is
O	heard
O	once
O	more;
O	for
O	poetry
O	and
O	immortality
O	are
O	wedded
O	again
O	.
