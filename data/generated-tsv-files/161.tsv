O	After
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	had
O	parted
O	from
O	his
O	fellows
O	at
O	the
O	Castle
O	of
O	Vagon
O	,
O	he
O	rode
O	many
O	days
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	without
O	adventure
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	chanced
O	upon
O	a
O	knight
O	close
O	by
O	a
O	little
O	hermitage
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	Immediately
O	,
O	as
O	was
O	the
O	wont
O	of
O	errant
O	knights
O	,
O	they
O	prepared
O	to
O	joust
O	,
O	and
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	whom
O	none
O	before
O	had
O	overthrown
O	,
O	was
O	borne
O	down
O	,
O	man
O	and
O	horse
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	stranger
O	knight
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	a
O	nun
O	,
O	who
O	dwelt
O	in
O	the
O	hermitage
O	,
O	cried
O	:
O	``
O	God
O	be
O	with
O	thee
O	,
O	best
O	knight
O	in
O	all
O	this
O	world
O	,
O	``
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	the
O	victor
O	for
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	.
O	But
O	Galahad
O	,
O	not
O	wishing
O	to
O	be
O	known
O	,
O	rode
O	swiftly
O	away
O	;
O	and
O	presently
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	got
O	to
O	horse
O	again
O	and
O	rode
O	slowly
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	,
O	shamed
O	and
O	doubting
O	sorely
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	whether
O	this
O	quest
O	was
O	meant
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	night
O	fell
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	cross
O	which
O	stood
O	at
O	the
O	parting
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	and
O	close
O	by
O	a
O	little
O	ruined
O	chapel
O	.
O	So
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	being
O	minded
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	night
O	there
O	,
O	alighted
O	,
O	fastened
O	his
O	horse
O	to
O	a
O	tree
O	and
O	hung
O	his
O	shield
O	on
O	a
O	bough
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	drew
O	near
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	chapel
O	,
O	and
O	wondered
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	,
O	all
O	ruinous
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	yet
O	within
O	was
O	an
O	altar
O	hung
O	with
O	silk
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	silver
O	candlestick
O	on
O	it
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	sought
O	entrance
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	none
O	and
O	,
O	much
O	troubled
O	in
O	his
O	mind
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	horse
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	unlacing
O	his
O	helm
O	and
O	ungirding
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	laid
O	him
O	down
O	to
O	rest
O	.
O	Then
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	that
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	lay
O	between
O	sleeping
O	and
O	waking
O	,
O	there
O	passed
O	him
O	two
O	white
O	palfreys
O	bearing
O	a
O	litter
O	wherein
O	was
O	a
O	sick
O	knight
O	,
O	who
O	cried
O	:
O	``
O	Sweet
O	Lord
O	,
O	when
O	shall
O	I
O	be
O	pardoned
O	all
O	my
O	transgressions
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	shall
O	the
O	holy
O	vessel
O	come
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	to
O	cure
O	me
O	of
O	my
O	sickness
O	?
O	``
O	And
O	instantly
O	it
O	seemed
O	that
O	the
O	great
O	candlestick
O	came
O	forth
O	of
O	itself
O	from
O	the
O	chapel
O	,
O	floating
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	before
O	a
O	table
O	of
O	silver
O	on
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	,
O	the
O	sick
O	knight
O	raised
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	his
O	bended
O	knees
O	he
O	approached
O	so
O	nigh
O	that
O	he
O	kissed
O	the
O	holy
O	vessel
O	;
O	and
O	immediately
O	he
O	cried
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	thank
O	Thee
O	,
O	sweet
O	Lord
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	healed
O	of
O	my
O	sickness
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	who
O	saw
O	this
O	wonder
O	,
O	felt
O	himself
O	held
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	move
O	.
O	Then
O	a
O	squire
O	brought
O	the
O	stranger
O	knight
O	his
O	weapons
O	,
O	in
O	much
O	joy
O	that
O	his
O	lord
O	was
O	cured
O	.
O	``
O	Who
O	think
O	ye
O	that
O	this
O	knight
O	may
O	be
O	who
O	remains
O	sleeping
O	when
O	the
O	holy
O	vessel
O	is
O	so
O	near
O	?
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	knight
O	.
O	``
O	In
O	truth
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	squire
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	must
O	be
O	one
O	that
O	is
O	held
O	by
O	the
O	bond
O	of
O	some
O	great
O	sin
O	.
O	I
O	will
O	take
O	his
O	helm
O	and
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	for
O	here
O	have
O	I
O	brought
O	you
O	all
O	your
O	armor
O	save
O	only
O	these
O	two
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	knight
O	armed
O	him
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	,
O	rode
O	away
O	with
O	his
O	squire
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	instant
O	,
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	awoke
O	amazed
O	,
O	not
O	knowing
O	whether
O	he
O	had
O	dreamed
O	or
O	not
O	;
O	but
O	while
O	he
O	wondered
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	terrible
O	voice
O	,
O	saying
O	:
O	``
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	arise
O	and
O	leave
O	this
O	holy
O	place
O	.
O	``
O	In
O	shame
O	,
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	turned
O	to
O	obey
O	,
O	only
O	to
O	find
O	horse
O	and
O	sword
O	and
O	shield
O	alike
O	vanished
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	he
O	knew
O	himself
O	dishonored
O	.
O	Weeping
O	bitterly
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	on
O	foot
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	cell
O	where
O	a
O	hermit
O	was
O	saying
O	prayer
O	.
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	knelt
O	too
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	was
O	ended
O	,
O	called
O	to
O	the
O	hermit
O	,
O	entreating
O	him
O	for
O	counsel
O	.
O	``
O	With
O	good
O	will
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	hermit
O	.
O	So
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	made
O	himself
O	known
O	and
O	told
O	the
O	hermit
O	all
O	,
O	lamenting
O	how
O	his
O	good
O	fortune
O	was
O	turned
O	to
O	wretchedness
O	and
O	his
O	glory
O	to
O	shame
O	;
O	and
O	truly
O	,
O	the
O	hermit
O	was
O	amazed
O	that
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	should
O	be
O	in
O	such
O	case
O	.
O	``
O	Sir
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	God
O	has
O	given
O	you
O	manhood
O	and
O	strength
O	beyond
O	all
O	other
O	knights
O	;
O	and
O	more
O	are
O	ye
O	bounden
O	to
O	his
O	service
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	I
O	have
O	sinned
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	;
O	``
O	for
O	in
O	all
O	these
O	years
O	of
O	my
O	knighthood
O	,
O	I
O	have
O	done
O	everything
O	for
O	the
O	honor
O	and
O	glory
O	of
O	my
O	lady
O	and
O	naught
O	for
O	my
O	Maker
O	;
O	and
O	little
O	thank
O	have
O	I
O	given
O	to
O	God
O	for
O	all
O	his
O	benefits
O	to
O	me
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	holy
O	man
O	gave
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	good
O	counsel
O	and
O	made
O	him
O	rest
O	there
O	that
O	night
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	he
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	horse
O	,
O	a
O	sword
O	and
O	a
O	helmet
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	go
O	forth
O	and
O	bear
O	himself
O	knightly
O	as
O	the
O	servant
O	of
O	God
O	.
