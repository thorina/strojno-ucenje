O	An
O	old
O	man
O	of
O	the
O	Iroquois
O	nation
O	once
O	wished
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	beautiful
O	Indian
O	maiden
O	his
O	wife
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	man
O	had
O	many
O	rare
O	furs
O	and
O	valued
O	strings
O	of
O	wampum
O	.
O	These
O	he
O	brought
O	and
O	laid
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	wigwam
O	where
O	the
O	maiden
O	lived
O	.
O	The
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	were
O	pleased
O	with
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	gifts
O	.
O	They
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	when
O	the
O	Planting
O	Moon
O	should
O	come
O	,
O	the
O	maiden
O	should
O	go
O	to
O	his
O	wigwam
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	maiden
O	did
O	not
O	love
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	.
O	She
O	did
O	not
O	wish
O	him
O	to
O	make
O	her
O	his
O	wife
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	never
O	sit
O	at
O	his
O	wigwam
O	door
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	said
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	midwinter
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	brought
O	the
O	gifts
O	,
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	the
O	pale
O	,
O	cold
O	moon
O	.
O	From
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	the
O	maiden
O	watched
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	heavy
O	heart
O	,
O	the
O	moons
O	wax
O	and
O	wane
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	snows
O	disappeared
O	.
O	No
O	more
O	was
O	the
O	North
O	Wind
O	heard
O	shrieking
O	about
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	The
O	gentle
O	South
O	Wind
O	had
O	come
O	,
O	bringing
O	with
O	him
O	the
O	singing
O	birds
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	brooks
O	awoke
O	and
O	sang
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	happy
O	that
O	spring
O	had
O	come
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	earth
O	children
O	were
O	glad
O	,
O	--
O	except
O	the
O	maiden
O	.
O	Her
O	heart
O	grew
O	more
O	heavy
O	and
O	sad
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	grew
O	brighter
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Planting
O	Moon
O	came
O	.
O	The
O	maiden
O	watched
O	the
O	moon
O	hang
O	her
O	horn
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	ran
O	swiftly
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	river
O	that
O	flowed
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	Lightly
O	she
O	sprang
O	into
O	her
O	canoe
O	.
O	A
O	few
O	quick
O	strokes
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	canoe
O	was
O	in
O	midstream
O	.
O	The
O	current
O	ran
O	swift
O	and
O	strong
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	craft
O	was
O	carried
O	swiftly
O	down
O	the
O	river
O	toward
O	the
O	great
O	falls
O	known
O	as
O	Niagara
O	Falls
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	canoe
O	neared
O	the
O	falls
O	,
O	the
O	maiden
O	was
O	seen
O	to
O	rise
O	and
O	stretch
O	out
O	her
O	arms
O	,
O	as
O	though
O	about
O	to
O	leap
O	.
O	A
O	smile
O	was
O	on
O	her
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	song
O	was
O	on
O	her
O	lips
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	canoe
O	shot
O	into
O	the
O	mist
O	that
O	overhung
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	caverns
O	below
O	a
O	dark
O	blanket
O	floated
O	upward
O	,
O	as
O	though
O	spread
O	to
O	catch
O	the
O	maiden
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	Heno
O	,
O	the
O	Thunder
O	Spirit
O	,
O	who
O	dwelt
O	behind
O	the
O	falls
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	caught
O	her
O	in
O	the
O	folds
O	of
O	his
O	blanket
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	saved
O	her
O	from
O	the
O	great
O	rocks
O	below
O	.
O	Heno
O	took
O	the
O	maiden
O	to
O	live
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	lodge
O	behind
O	the
O	falls
O	.
O	There
O	she
O	was
O	very
O	happy
O	,
O	so
O	happy
O	that
O	her
O	smile
O	shone
O	through
O	the
O	mist
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Indians
O	cried
O	,
O	``
O	See
O	!
O	A
O	rainbow
O	!
O	``
O	In
O	her
O	new
O	home
O	the
O	maiden
O	learned
O	many
O	wonderful
O	things
O	.
O	She
O	found
O	she
O	possessed
O	strange
O	powers
O	,
O	not
O	known
O	to
O	her
O	before
O	.
O	She
O	could
O	float
O	on
O	a
O	cloud
O	at
O	will
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	seemed
O	filled
O	with
O	a
O	strange
O	fire
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	woman
O	was
O	given
O	a
O	son
O	.
O	Heno
O	and
O	she
O	were
O	very
O	happy
O	.
O	Many
O	moons
O	the
O	mother
O	and
O	child
O	played
O	together
O	.
O	When
O	Heno
O	was
O	away
O	on
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	journeys
O	through
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	ride
O	the
O	great
O	bubbles
O	of
O	foam
O	that
O	went
O	dashing
O	through
O	the
O	rocks
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	they
O	would
O	catch
O	sunbeams
O	in
O	a
O	net
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	sat
O	on
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	a
O	cloud
O	and
O	fished
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	Heno
O	asked
O	the
O	young
O	woman
O	if
O	she
O	would
O	like
O	to
O	visit
O	her
O	people
O	.
O	``
O	If

O	he
O	said

O	our

O	But
O	remember
O	,
O	both
O	of
O	you
O	possess
O	powers
O	unknown
O	to
O	the
O	earth

O	Be
O	careful
O	how

O	use

O	Never
O	let
O	another
O	child
O	strike
O	the
O	boy
O	,
O	for

O	Never

O	``
O	The
O	woman
O	listened
O	to

O	s
O	words
O	.
O	Soon
O	they
O	were
O	wrapped
O	in
O	his
O	great
O	cloud
O	blanket
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	floating

O	the

O	and
O	went
O	on
O	further
O	to

O	The

O	glad

O	the
O	woman
O	,
O	whom
O	they

O	learned
O	in

O	freeing
O	their
O	land
O	of
O	a

O	causing
O	sickness

O	Always
O	,
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	Heno
O	carried
O	a
O	basket
O	of
O	great
O	rocks
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	hurled
O	at
O	the
O	monster
O	whenever
O	he
O	saw
O	him
O	.
O	Soon
O	he
O	would
O	kill
O	the
O	serpent
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	would
O	be
O	sick
O	no

O	During
O	many
O	days
O	,
O	the
O	mother
O	and
O	the

O	stayed

O	Sometimes
O	,
O	when

O	he
O	would

O	grew
O	angry

O	Instantly
O	these

O	fell
O	dead
O	to
