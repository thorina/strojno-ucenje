O	An
O	old
O	chieftain
O	sat
O	in
O	his
O	wigwam
O	,
O	quietly
O	smoking
O	his
O	favourite
O	pipe
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	crowd
O	of
O	Indian
O	boys
O	and
O	girls
O	suddenly
O	entered
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	numerous
O	offerings
O	of
O	tobacco
O	,
O	begged
O	him
O	to
O	tell
O	them
O	a
O	story
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	did
O	so
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	once
O	a
O	time
O	when
O	this
O	world
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	happy
O	people;
O	when
O	all
O	the
O	nations
O	were
O	as
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	crimson
O	tide
O	of
O	war
O	had
O	not
O	begun
O	to
O	roll
O	.
O	Plenty
O	of
O	game
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	plains
O	.
O	None
O	were
O	in
O	want
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	full
O	supply
O	was
O	at
O	hand
O	.
O	Sickness
O	was
O	unknown
O	.
O	The
O	beasts
O	of
O	the
O	field
O	were
O	tame;
O	they
O	came
O	and
O	went
O	at
O	the
O	bidding
O	of
O	man
O	.
O	One
O	unending
O	spring
O	gave
O	no
O	place
O	for
O	winter--for
O	its
O	cold
O	blasts
O	or
O	its
O	unhealthy
O	chills
O	.
O	Every
O	tree
O	and
O	bush
O	yielded
O	fruit
O	.
O	Flowers
O	carpeted
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	The
O	air
O	was
O	laden
O	with
O	their
O	fragrance
O	,
O	and
O	redolent
O	with
O	the
O	songs
O	of
O	wedded
O	warblers
O	that
O	flew
O	from
O	branch
O	to
O	branch
O	,
O	fearing
O	none
O	,
O	for
O	there
O	were
O	none
O	to
O	harm
O	them
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	birds
O	then
O	of
O	more
O	beautiful
O	song
O	and
O	plumage
O	than
O	now
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	at
O	such
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	when
O	earth
O	was
O	a
O	paradise
O	and
O	man
O	worthily
O	its
O	possessor
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	Indians
O	were
O	lone
O	inhabitants
O	of
O	the
O	American
O	wilderness
O	.
O	They
O	numbered
O	millions;
O	and
O	,
O	living
O	as
O	nature
O	designed
O	them
O	to
O	live
O	,
O	enjoyed
O	its
O	many
O	blessings
O	.
O	Instead
O	of
O	amusements
O	in
O	close
O	rooms
O	,
O	the
O	sport
O	of
O	the
O	field
O	was
O	theirs
O	.
O	At
O	night
O	they
O	met
O	on
O	the
O	wide
O	green
O	beneath
O	the
O	heavenly
O	worlds--the
O	_ah-nung-o-kah_
O	.
O	They
O	watched
O	the
O	stars;
O	they
O	loved
O	to
O	gaze
O	at
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	believed
O	them
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	residences
O	of
O	the
O	good
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	taken
O	home
O	by
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	.
O	One
O	night
O	they
O	saw
O	one
O	star
O	that
O	shone
O	brighter
O	than
O	all
O	others
O	.
O	Its
O	location
O	was
O	far
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	south
O	,
O	near
O	a
O	mountain
O	peak
O	.
O	For
O	many
O	nights
O	it
O	was
O	seen
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	length
O	it
O	was
O	doubted
O	by
O	many
O	that
O	the
O	star
O	was
O	as
O	far
O	distant
O	in
O	the
O	southern
O	skies
O	as
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	.
O	This
O	doubt
O	led
O	to
O	an
O	examination
O	,
O	which
O	proved
O	the
O	star
O	to
O	be
O	only
O	a
O	short
O	distance
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	near
O	the
O	tops
O	of
O	some
O	trees
O	.
O	A
O	number
O	of
O	warriors
O	were
O	deputed
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	see
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	.
O	They
O	went
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	their
O	return
O	said
O	it
O	appeared
O	strange
O	,
O	and
O	somewhat
O	like
O	a
O	bird
O	.
O	A
O	committee
O	of
O	the
O	wise
O	men
O	were
O	called
O	to
O	inquire
O	into
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	possible
O	to
O	ascertain
O	the
O	meaning
O	of
O	,
O	the
O	strange
O	phenomenon
O	.
O	They
O	feared
O	that
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	the
O	omen
O	of
O	some
O	disaster
O	.
O	Some
O	thought
O	it
O	a
O	precursor
O	of
O	good
O	,
O	others
O	of
O	evil;
O	and
O	some
O	supposed
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	star
O	spoken
O	of
O	by
O	their
O	forefathers
O	as
O	the
O	forerunner
O	of
O	a
O	dreadful
O	war

O	One

O	had
O	nearly
O	gone
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	the

O	unsolved
O	.
O	One
O	night
O	a
O	young

O	had
O	a
O	dream
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	a

O	came
O	and
O	stood
O	at

O	.
O	On
O	stepping
O	out

O	At
