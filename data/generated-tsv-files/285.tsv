O	In
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	King
O	Alfred
O	,
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	poor
O	woman
O	whose
O	cottage
O	was
O	situated
O	in
O	a
O	remote
O	country
O	village
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	miles
O	from
O	London
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	widow
O	some
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	an
O	only
O	child
O	named
O	Jack
O	,
O	whom
O	she
O	indulged
O	to
O	a
O	fault
O	.
O	The
O	consequence
O	of
O	her
O	blind
O	partiality
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	Jack
O	did
O	not
O	pay
O	the
O	least
O	attention
O	to
O	any
O	thing
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	indolent
O	,
O	careless
O	,
O	and
O	extravagant
O	.
O	His
O	follies
O	were
O	not
O	owing
O	to
O	a
O	bad
O	disposition
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	his
O	mother
O	had
O	never
O	checked
O	him
O	.
O	By
O	degrees
O	she
O	disposed
O	of
O	all
O	she
O	possessed
O	--
O	scarcely
O	any
O	thing
O	remained
O	but
O	a
O	cow
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	woman
O	one
O	day
O	met
O	Jack
O	with
O	tears
O	in
O	her
O	eyes
O	;
O	her
O	distress
O	was
O	great
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	in
O	her
O	life
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	reproaching
O	him
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	Oh
O	!
O	you
O	wicked
O	child
O	,
O	by
O	your
O	ungrateful
O	course
O	of
O	life
O	you
O	have
O	at
O	last
O	brought
O	me
O	to
O	beggary
O	and
O	ruin
O	.
O	Cruel
O	,
O	cruel
O	boy
O	!
O	I
O	have
O	not
O	money
O	enough
O	to
O	purchase
O	even
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	bread
O	for
O	another
O	day
O	--
O	nothing
O	now
O	remains
O	to
O	sell
O	but
O	my
O	poor
O	cow
O	!
O	I
O	am
O	sorry
O	to
O	part
O	with
O	her
O	;
O	it
O	grieves
O	me
O	sadly
O	,
O	but
O	we
O	must
O	not
O	starve
O	.
O	``
O	For
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	,
O	Jack
O	felt
O	a
O	degree
O	of
O	remorse
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	soon
O	over
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	began
O	teasing
O	his
O	mother
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	sell
O	the
O	cow
O	at
O	the
O	next
O	village
O	,
O	so
O	much
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	at
O	last
O	consented
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	along
O	,
O	he
O	met
O	a
O	butcher
O	,
O	who
O	inquired
O	why
O	he
O	was
O	driving
O	the
O	cow
O	from
O	home
O	?
O	Jack
O	replied
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	sell
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	butcher
O	held
O	some
O	curious
O	beans
O	in
O	his
O	hat
O	;
O	they
O	were
O	of
O	various
O	colours
O	,
O	and
O	attracted
O	Jack
O	'
O	s
O	attention
O	.
O	This
O	did
O	not
O	pass
O	unnoticed
O	by
O	the
O	butcher
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	knowing
O	Jack
O	'
O	s
O	easy
O	temper
O	,
O	thought
O	now
O	was
O	the
O	time
O	to
O	take
O	an
O	advantage
O	of
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	determined
O	not
O	to
O	let
O	slip
O	so
O	good
O	an
O	opportunity
O	,
O	asked
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	price
O	of
O	the
O	cow
O	,
O	offering
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	all
O	the
O	beans
O	in
O	his
O	hat
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	silly
O	boy
O	could
O	not
O	conceal
O	the
O	pleasure
O	he
O	felt
O	at
O	what
O	he
O	supposed
O	so
O	great
O	an
O	offer
O	,
O	the
O	bargain
O	was
O	struck
O	instantly
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	cow
O	exchanged
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	paltry
O	beans
O	.
O	Jack
O	made
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	home
O	,
O	calling
O	aloud
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	before
O	he
O	reached
O	home
O	,
O	thinking
O	to
O	surprise
O	her
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	beans
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	Jack
O	'
O	s
O	account
O	,
O	her
O	patience
O	quite
O	forsook
O	her
O	.
O	She
O	kicked
O	the
O	beans
O	away
O	in
O	a
O	passion
O	--
O	they
O	flew
O	in
O	all
O	directions
O	--
O	some
O	were
O	scattered
O	in
O	the
O	garden
O	.
O	Not
O	having
O	any
O	thing
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	they
O	both
O	went
O	supperless
O	to
O	bed
O	.
O	Jack
O	woke
O	early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	seeing
O	something
O	uncommon
O	from
O	the
O	window
O	of
O	his
O	bedchamber
O	,
O	ran
O	down
O	stairs
O	into
O	the
O	garden
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	soon
O	discovered
O	that
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	beans
O	had
O	taken
O	root
O	,
O	and
O	sprung
O	up
O	surprisingly
O	:
O	the
O	stalks
O	were
O	of
O	an
O	immense
O	thickness
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	so
O	entwined
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	formed
O	a
O	ladder
O	nearly
O	like
O	a
O	chain
O	in
O	appearance
O	.
O	Looking
O	upward
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	discern
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	it
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	lost
O	in
O	the
O	clouds
O	:
O	he
O	tried
O	it
O	,
O	found
O	it
O	firm
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	shaken
O	.
O	He
O	quickly
O	formed
O	the
O	resolution
O	of
O	endeavouring
O	to
O	climb
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	seek
O	his
O	fortune
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	to
O	communicate
O	his
O	intention
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	not
O	doubting
O	but
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	equally
O	pleased
O	with
O	himself
O	.
O	She
O	declared
O	he
O	should
O	not
O	go
O	;
O	said
O	it
O	would
O	break
O	her
O	heart
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	--
O	entreated
O	,
O	and
O	threatened
O	--
O	but
O	all
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	Jack
O	set
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	climbing
O	for
O	some
O	hours
O	,
O	reached
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	,
O	fatigued
O	and
O	quite
O	exhausted
O	.
O	Looking
O	around
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	strange
O	country
O	;
O	it
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	desert
O	,
O	quite
O	barren
O	,
O	not
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	shrub
O	,
O	house
O	,
O	or
O	living
O	creature
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	;
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	were
O	scattered
O	fragments
O	of
O	stone
O	;
O	and
O	at
O	unequal
O	distances
O	,
O	small
O	heaps
O	of
O	earth
O	were
O	loosely
O	thrown
O	together
O	.
O	Jack
O	seated
O	himself
O	pensively
O	upon
O	a
O	block
O	of
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	of
O	his
O	mother
O	--
O	he
O	reflected
O	with
O	sorrow
O	upon
O	his
O	disobedience
O	in
O	climbing
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	against
O	her
O	will
O	;
O	and
O	concluded
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	die
O	with
O	hunger
O	.
O	However
O	he
O	walked
O	on
O	,
O	hoping
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	house
O	where
O	he
O	might
O	beg
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	drink
O	;
O	presently
O	a
O	handsome
O	young
O	woman
O	appeared
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	:
O	as
O	she
O	approached
O	,
O	Jack
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	admiring
O	how
O	beautiful
O	and
O	lively
O	she
O	looked
O	;
O	she
O	was
O	dressed
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	elegant
O	manner
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	small
O	white
O	wand
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	peacock
O	of
O	pure
O	gold
O	.
O	While
O	Jack
O	was
O	looking
O	with
O	great
O	surprise
O	at
O	this
O	charming
O	female
O	,
O	she
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	smile
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	bewitching
O	sweetness
O	,
O	inquired
O	how
O	he
O	came
O	there
O	.
O	Jack
O	related
O	the
O	circumstance
O	of
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	.
O	She
O	asked
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	recollected
O	his
O	father
O	;
O	he
O	replied
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	;
O	and
O	added
O	,
O	there
O	must
O	be
O	some
O	mystery
O	relating
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	because
O	if
O	he
O	asked
O	his
O	mother
O	who
O	his
O	father
O	was
O	,
O	she
O	always
O	burst
O	into
O	tears
O	,
O	and
O	appeared
O	violently
O	agitated
O	,
O	nor
O	did
O	she
O	recover
O	herself
O	for
O	some
O	days
O	after
O	;
O	one
O	thing
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	avoid
O	observing
O	upon
O	these
O	occasions
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	that
O	she
O	always
O	carefully
O	avoided
O	answering
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	seemed
O	afraid
O	of
O	speaking
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	there
O	was
O	some
O	secret
O	connected
O	with
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	history
O	which
O	she
O	must
O	not
O	disclose
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	woman
O	replied
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	reveal
O	the
O	whole
O	story
O	;
O	your
O	mother
O	must
O	not
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	before
O	I
O	begin
O	,
O	I
O	require
O	a
O	solemn
O	promise
O	on
O	your
O	part
O	to
O	do
O	what
O	I
O	command
O	;
O	I
O	am
O	a
O	fairy
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	perform
O	exactly
O	what
O	I
O	desire
O	,
O	you
O	will
O	be
O	destroyed
O	,
O	``
O	Jack
O	was
O	frightened
O	at
O	her
O	menaces
O	,
O	but
O	promised
O	to
O	fulfil
O	her
O	injunctions
O	exactly
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fairy
O	thus
O	addressed
O	him
O	:
O	``
O	Your
O	father
O	was
O	a
O	rich
O	man
O	,
O	his
O	disposition
O	remarkably
O	benevolent
O	:
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	good
O	to
O	the
O	poor
O	,
O	and
O	constantly
O	relieving
O	them
O	.
O	He
O	made
O	it
O	a
O	rule
O	never
O	to
O	let
O	a
O	day
O	pass
O	without
O	doing
O	good
O	to
O	some
O	person
O	.
O	On
O	one
O	particular
O	day
O	in
O	the
O	week
O	,
O	he
O	kept
O	open
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	invited
O	only
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	reduced
O	and
O	had
O	lived
O	well
O	.
O	He
O	always
O	presided
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	all
O	in
O	his
O	power
O	to
O	render
O	his
O	guests
O	comfortable
O	;
O	the
O	rich
O	and
O	the
O	great
O	were
O	not
O	invited
O	.
O	The
O	servants
O	were
O	all
O	happy
O	,
O	and
O	greatly
O	attached
O	to
O	their
O	master
O	and
O	mistress
O	.
O	Your
O	father
O	,
O	though
O	only
O	a
O	private
O	gentleman
O	,
O	was
O	as
O	rich
O	as
O	a
O	prince
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	deserved
O	all
O	he
O	possessed
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	only
O	lived
O	to
O	do
O	good
O	.
O	Such
O	a
O	man
O	was
O	soon
O	known
O	and
O	talked
O	of
O	.
O	A
O	giant
O	lived
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	miles
O	off
O	:
O	this
O	man
O	was
O	altogether
O	as
O	wicked
O	as
O	your
O	father
O	was
O	good
O	;
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	envious
O	,
O	covetous
O	,
O	and
O	cruel
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	the
O	art
O	of
O	concealing
O	those
O	vices
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	poor
O	,
O	and
O	wished
O	to
O	enrich
O	himself
O	at
O	any
O	rate
O	.
O	Hearing
O	your
O	father
O	spoken
O	of
O	,
O	he
O	formed
O	the
O	design
O	of
O	becoming
O	acquainted
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	hoping
O	to
O	ingratiate
O	himself
O	into
O	your
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	favour
O	.
O	He
O	removed
O	quickly
O	into
O	your
O	neighbourhood
O	,
O	caused
O	to
O	be
O	reported
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	gentleman
O	who
O	had
O	just
O	lost
O	all
O	he
O	possessed
O	by
O	an
O	earth-quake
O	,
O	and

O	gave
O	him
O	handsome

O	to
O	be
O	treated
O	like
O	visitors
O	of
O	consequence
O	,
O	little
O	imagining

O	Things
O	went
O	on
O	in

O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	the
O	giant
O	becoming
O	daily
O	more
O	impatient
O	to
O	put
O	his
O	plan
O	into
O	execution
O	;
O	at
O	last
O	a
O	favourable
O	opportunity
O	presented
O	itself
O	.
O	Your
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	was
O	at
O	some

O	from
O	the

O	,
O	but
O	with
O	a
O	glass
O	the
O	coast
O	could
O	be
O	seen
O	distinctly
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	was
O	one
O	day
O	using
O	the
O	telescope
O	;
O	the
O	wind
O	was
O	very
O	high
O	;
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	fleet
O	of
O	ships
O	in
O	distress
O	off
O	the
O	rocks
O	;
O	he
O	hastened
O	to
O	your
O	father
O	,
O	mentioned
O	the
O	circumstance
O	,
O	and
O	eagerly
O	requested
O	he
O	would
O	send
O	all
O	the
O	servants
O	he
O	could
O	spare
O	to
O	relieve
O	the
O	sufferers
O	.
O	Every

O	was
O	instantly
O	despatched
O	,
O	except
O	the
O	porter
O	and
O	your
O	nurse
O	;
O	the
O	giant
O	then
O	joined
O	your
O	father
O	in
O	the
O	study
O	,
O	and
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	delighted
O	--
O	he
O	really
O	was
O	so
O	.
O	Your
O	father
O	recommended
O	a
O	favourite
O	book
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	handing
O	it
O	down
O	:
O	the
O	giant
O	took
O	the
O	opportunity
O	,
O	and
O	stabbed
O	him
O	;
O	he
O	instantly
O	fell
O	down

O	The
O	giant
O	left
O	the

O	,
O	found
O	the
O	porter
O	and
O	nurse
O	,

O	presently

O	them
O	;

O	determined
O	to

O	no

O	in
O	a
O	remote
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	,

O	was
O	ignorant
O	of
O	what
O	was
O	going
O	on
O	;
O	she
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	study

O	how
O	was
O	she
O	shocked
O	,
O	on
O	discovering
O	your
O	father
O	a
O	corpse
O	,
O	and
O	weltering
O	in

O	was
O	stupefied
O	with
O	horror

O	motionless
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	seeking
O	her
O	,
O	found
O	her
O	in
O	that
O	state

O	hastened
O	to
O	serve
O	her
O	and
O	you
O	as

O	her
O	husband
O	,

O	she
O	fell
O	at
O	his

O	in
O	a
O	pathetic

O	made

O	take
O	a
O	most
O	solemn
O	oath
O	,
O	never

O	inform

O	was
O	,
O	or
O	to

O	both
O	of

O	to
O	death
O	in
O	the

O	when

O	,
O	the

O	added
O	to

O	She
O	settled
O	in
O	the

O	where
O	you
O	were
O	brought
O	up

O	to
O	his
O	great
O	joy

O	espied
O	a

O	This
O	agreeable

O	a
O	human
O	being
O	near

O	for

O	well

O	This

O	in
O	for
O	one
O	night
O	only
O	,
O	and
O	hide
O	him
O	where
O	she

O	generous
O	disposition

O	and
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	First
O	,
O	they
O	entered
O	a
O	fine
O	large
O	hall
O	,
O	magnificently
O	furnished
O	;
O	they
O	then
O	passed
O	through
O	several

O	rooms
O	,
O	all
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	style
O	of
O	grandeur
O	;
O	but
O	they
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	quite
O	forsaken
O	and
O	desolate
O	.
O	A
O	long
O	gallery
O	was
O	next
O	;
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	dark
O	--
O	just
O	light
O	enough
O	to

O	that
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	a
O	wall
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	grating
O	of

O	,
O	which
O	parted
O	off
O	a
O	dismal

O	for

O	.
O	Poor
O	Jack
O	was
O	half
O	dead
O	with
O	fear
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	given
O	the
O	world
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	with
O	his
O	mother
O	again
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	fear
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	never
O	see
O	her
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	himself
O	up
O	for

O	;
O	he
O	even
O	mistrusted
O	the
O	good
O	woman
O	,

O	let

O	At
O	the

O	a
O	very
O	excellent
O	fire
O	was
O	burning
O	in
O	the
O	grate
O	.
O	The
O	good
O	woman
O	bid
O	Jack
O	sit
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	plenty
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	drink
O	.
O	Jack
O	,
O	not
O	seeing
O	any
O	thing
O	here
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	uncomfortable
O	,
O	soon
O	forgot
O	his
O	fear
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	just
O	beginning
O	to
O	enjoy
O	himself
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	aroused
O	by
O	a
O	loud
O	knocking
O	at
O	the
O	street-door
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	the
O	whole
O	house
O	shake
O	:
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	ran
O	to
O	secure
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	oven
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	went
O	to
O	let
O	her
O	husband
O	in
O	.
O	Jack
O	heard
O	him
O	accost
O	her
O	in
O	a
O	voice
O	like
O	thunder
O	,
O	saying
O	:
O	``
O	Wife
O	,
O	I
O	smell
O	fresh
O	meat
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Oh
O	!
O	my
O	dear
O	,
O	``
O	replied
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	it
O	is
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	people
O	in
O	the
O	dungeon
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	giant
O	appeared
O	to
O	believe
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	walked
O	into
O	the
O	very
O	kitchen
O	where
O	poor
O	Jack
O	was
O	concealed
O	,
O	who
O	shook
O	,
O	trembled
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	more
O	terrified
O	than
O	he
O	had
O	yet
O	been
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	the
O	monster
O	seated
O	himself
O	quietly
O	by
O	the
O	fire-side
O	,
O	whilst
O	his
O	wife
O	prepared
O	supper
O	.
O	By
O	degrees
O	Jack
O	recovered
O	himself
O	sufficiently
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	the
O	giant
O	through
O	a
O	small
O	crevice
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	quite
O	astonished
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	an
O	amazing
O	quantity
O	he
O	devoured
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	he
O	never
O	would
O	have
O	done
O	eating
O	and
O	drinking
O	.
O	When
O	supper
O	was
O	ended
O	,
O	the
O	giant
O	desired
O	his
O	wife
O	to
O	bring
O	him
O	his
O	hen
O	.
O	A
O	very
O	beautiful
O	hen
O	was
O	then
O	brought
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	Jack
O	'
O	s
O	curiosity
O	was
O	very
O	great
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	would
O	happen
O	:
O	he
O	observed
O	that
O	every
O	time
O	the
O	giant
O	said
O	``
O	Lay
O	!
O	``
O	the
O	hen
O	laid
O	an
O	egg
O	of
O	solid
O	gold
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	amused
O	himself
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	with
O	his
O	hen
O	;
O	meanwhile
O	his
O	wife
O	went
O	to
O	bed
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	the
O	giant
O	fell
O	asleep
O	by
O	the
O	fire-side
O	,
O	and
O	snored
O	like
O	the
O	roaring
O	of
O	a
O	cannon
O	.
O	At
O	daybreak
O	,
O	Jack
O	,
O	finding
O	the
O	giant
O	still
O	asleep
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	likely
O	to
O	awaken
O	soon
O	,
O	crept
O	softly
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	hiding-place
O	,
O	seized
O	the
O	hen
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	off
O	with
O	her
O	.
O	He
O	met
O	with
O	some
O	difficulty
O	in
O	finding
O	his
O	way
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	road
O	with
O	safety
O	.
O	He
O	easily
O	found
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	,
O	and
O	descended
O	it
O	better
O	and
O	quicker
O	than
O	he
O	expected
O	.
O	His
O	mother
O	was
O	overjoyed
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	;
O	he
O	found
O	her
O	crying
O	bitterly
O	,
O	and
O	lamenting
O	his
O	hard
O	fate
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	concluded
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	some
O	shocking
O	end
O	through
O	his
O	rashness
O	.
O	Jack
O	was
O	impatient
O	to
O	show
O	his
O	hen
O	,
O	and
O	inform
O	his
O	mother
O	how
O	valuable
O	it
O	was
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	now
O	,
O	mother
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Jack
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	have
O	brought
O	home
O	that
O	which
O	will
O	quickly

O	folly
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	hen
O	produced
O	as
O	many
O	golden
O	eggs
O	as
O	they
O	desired
O	:
O	they
O	sold
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	became
O	possessed
O	of
O	as
O	much
O	riches
O	as
O	they
O	wanted
O	.
O	For
O	some
O	months
O	Jack
O	and
O	his
O	mother
O	lived
O	very
O	happily
O	together
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	being
O	very
O	desirous
O	of
O	travelling
O	,
O	recollecting
O	the
O	fairy
O	'
O	s
O	commands
O	,
O	and
O	fearing
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	delayed
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	put
O	her
O	threats
O	into
O	execution
O	,
O	longed
O	to
O	climb
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	,
O	and
O	pay
O	the
O	giant
O	another
O	visit
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	carry
O	away
O	some
O	more
O	of
O	his
O	treasures
O	;
O	for
O	,
O	during
O	the
O	time
O	that
O	Jack
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	mansion
O	,
O	whilst
O	he
O	lay
O	concealed
O	in
O	the
O	oven
O	,
O	he
O	learned
O	from
O	the
O	conversation
O	that
O	took
O	place
O	between
O	the
O	giant
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	possessed
O	some
O	wonderful
O	curiosities
O	.
O	Jack
O	thought
O	of
O	his
O	journey
O	again
O	and
O	again
O	,
O	but
O	still
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	summon
O	resolution
O	enough
O	to
O	break
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	being
O	well
O	assured
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	endeavour
O	to
O	prevent
O	his
O	going
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	one
O	day
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	boldly
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	take
O	a
O	journey
O	up
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	;
O	she
O	begged
O	and
O	prayed
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	tried
O	all
O	in
O	her
O	power
O	to
O	dissuade
O	him
O	:
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	would
O	certainly
O	know
O	him
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	giant
O	would
O	desire
O	nothing
O	better
O	than
O	to
O	get
O	him
O	into
O	his
O	power
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	put
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	cruel
O	death
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	be
O	revenged
O	for
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	hen
O	.
O	Jack
O	,
O	finding
O	that
O	all
O	his
O	arguments
O	were
O	useless
O	,
O	pretended
O	to
O	give
O	up
O	the
O	point
O	,
O	though
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	at
O	all
O	events
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	a
O	dress
O	prepared
O	which
O	would
O	disguise
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	something
O	to
O	colour
O	his
O	skin
O	.
O	He
O	thought
O	it
O	impossible
O	for
O	any
O	one
O	to
O	recollect
O	him
O	in
O	this
O	dress
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	mornings
O	after
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	arose
O	very
O	early
O	,
O	changed
O	his
O	complexion
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	unperceived
O	by
O	any
O	one
O	,
O	climbed
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	greatly
O	fatigued
O	when
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	hungry
O	.
O	Having
O	rested
O	some
O	time
O	on
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	stones
O	,
O	he
O	pursued
O	his
O	journey
O	to
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	mansion
O	.
O	He
O	reached
O	it
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	:
O	the
O	woman
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	Jack
O	addressed
O	her
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	telling
O	her
O	a
O	pitiful
O	tale
O	,
O	and
O	requesting
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	some
O	victuals
O	and
O	drink
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	a
O	night
O	'
O	s
O	lodging
O	.
O	She
O	told
O	him
O	(
O	what
O	he
O	knew
O	before
O	very
O	well
O	)
O	about
O	her
O	husband
O	being
O	a
O	powerful
O	and
O	cruel
O	giant
O	;
O	and
O	also
O	that
O	she
O	one
O	night
O	admitted
O	a
O	poor
O	,
O	hungry
O	,
O	friendless
O	boy
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	half
O	dead
O	with
O	travelling
O	;
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	ungrateful
O	fellow
O	had
O	stolen
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	treasures
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	ever
O	since
O	that
O	,
O	her
O	husband
O	had
O	been
O	worse
O	than
O	before
O	,
O	used
O	her
O	very
O	cruelly
O	,
O	and
O	continually
O	upbraided
O	her
O	with
O	being
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	his
O	misfortune
O	.
O	Jack
O	was
O	at
O	no
O	loss
O	to
O	discover
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	attending
O	to
O	the
O	account
O	of
O	a
O	story
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	principal
O	actor
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	his
O	best
O	to
O	persuade
O	the
O	good
O	woman
O	to
O	admit
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	found
O	it
O	a
O	very
O	hard
O	task
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	consented
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	led
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	Jack
O	observed
O	that
O	every
O	thing
O	was
O	just
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	found
O	it
O	before
O	.
O	She
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	kitchen
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	eating
O	and
O	drinking
O	,
O	she
O	hid
O	him
O	in
O	an
O	old
O	lumber-closet
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	returned
O	at
O	the
O	usual
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	walked
O	in
O	so
O	heavily
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	house
O	was
O	shaken
O	to
O	its
O	foundation
O	.
O	He
O	seated
O	himself
O	by
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	after
O	exclaimed
O	:
O	``
O	Wife
O	!
O	I
O	smell
O	fresh
O	meat
O	!
O	``
O	The
O	wife
O	replied
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	crows
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	brought
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	raw
O	meat
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	Whilst
O	supper
O	was
O	preparing
O	,
O	the
O	giant
O	was
O	very
O	ill-tempered
O	and
O	impatient
O	,
O	frequently
O	lifting
O	up
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	strike
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	for
O	not
O	being
O	quick
O	enough
O	;
O	she
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	was
O	always
O	so
O	fortunate
O	as
O	to
O	elude
O	the
O	blow
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	also
O	continually
O	up-braiding
O	her
O	with
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	wonderful
O	hen
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	at
O	last
O	having
O	ended
O	his
O	voracious
O	supper
O	,
O	and
O	eaten
O	till
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	satisfied
O	,
O	said
O	to
O	his
O	wife
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	must
O	have
O	something
O	to
O	amuse
O	me
O	;
O	either
O	my
O	bags
O	of
O	money
O	or
O	my
O	harp
O	.
O	``
O	After
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	ill-humour
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	teased
O	his
O	wife
O	some
O	he
O	commanded
O	her
O	to
O	bring
O	down
O	his
O	bags
O	of
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	.
O	Jack
O	,
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	peeped
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	hiding-place
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	his
O	wife
O	brought
O	two
O	bags
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	:
O	they
O	were
O	of
O	a
O	very
O	large
O	size
O	;
O	one
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	new
O	guineas
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	with
O	new
O	shillings
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	both
O	placed
O	before
O	the
O	giant
O	,
O	who
O	began
O	reprimanding
O	his
O	poor
O	wife
O	most
O	severely
O	for
O	staying
O	so
O	long
O	;
O	she
O	replied
O	,
O	trembling
O	with
O	fear
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	so
O	heavy
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	scarcely
O	lift
O	them
O	;
O	and
O	concluded
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	never
O	again
O	bring
O	them
O	down
O	stairs
O	;
O	adding
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	nearly
O	fainted
O	,
O	owing
O	to
O	their
O	weight
O	This
O	so
O	exasperated
O	the
O	giant
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	raised
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	strike
O	her
O	;
O	she
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	escaped
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	bed
O	,
O	leaving
O	him
O	to
O	count
O	over
O	his
O	treasure
O	,
O	by
O	way
O	of
O	amusement
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	took
O	his
O	bags
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	turning
O	them
O	over
O	and
O	over
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	state
O	as
O	he
O	left
O	them
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	count
O	their
O	contents
O	.
O	First
O	,
O	the
O	bag
O	which
O	contained
O	the
O	silver
O	was
O	emptied
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	contents
O	placed
O	upon
O	the
O	table
O	.
O	Jack
O	viewed
O	the
O	glittering
O	heaps
O	with
O	delight
O	,
O	and
O	most
O	heartily
O	wished
O	them
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	possession
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	(
O	little
O	thinking
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	narrowly
O	watched
O	)
O	reckoned
O	the
O	silver
O	over
O	several
O	times
O	;
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	having
O	satisfied
O	himself
O	that
O	all
O	was
O	safe
O	,
O	put
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	bag
O	again
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	made
O	very
O	secure
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	bag
O	was
O	opened
O	next
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	guineas
O	placed
O	upon
O	the
O	table
O	.
O	If
O	Jack
O	was
O	pleased
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	silver
O	,
O	how
O	much
O	more
O	delighted
O	he
O	felt
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	such
O	a
O	heap
O	of
O	glittering
O	gold
O	!
O	He
O	even
O	had
O	the
O	boldness
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	gaming
O	both
O	bags
O	;
O	but
O	suddenly
O	recollecting
O	himself
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	fear
O	that
O	the
O	giant
O	would
O	sham
O	sleep
O	,
O	the
O	better
O	to
O	entrap
O	any
O	one
O	who
O	might
O	be
O	concealed
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	giant
O	had
O	counted
O	over
O	the
O	gold
O	till
O	he
O	was
O	tired
O	,
O	he
O	put
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	if
O	possible
O	,
O	more
O	secure
O	than
O	he
O	had
O	put
O	up
O	the
O	silver
O	before
O	;
O	he
O	then
O	fell
O	back
O	on
O	his
O	chair
O	by
O	the
O	fire-side
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	He
O	snored
O	so
O	loud
O	,
O	that
O	Jack
O	compared
O	his
O	noise
O	to
O	the
O	roaring
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	in
O	a
O	high
O	wind
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	tide
O	is
O	coming
O	in
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	Jack
O	concluded
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	asleep
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	secure
O	,
O	stole
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	hiding-place
O	,
O	and
O	approached
O	the
O	giant
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	carry
O	off
O	the
O	two
O	bags
O	of
O	money
O	;
O	but
O	just
O	as
O	he
O	laid
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	bags
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	dog
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	perceived
O	before
O	,
O	started
O	from
O	under
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	chair
O	,
O	and
O	barked
O	at
O	Jack
O	most
O	furiously
O	,
O	who
O	now
O	gave
O	himself
O	up
O	for
O	lost
O	.
O	Fear
O	riveted
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	spot
O	.
O	Instead
O	of
O	endeavouring
O	to
O	escape
O	,
O	he
O	stood
O	still
O	,
O	though
O	expecting
O	his
O	enemy
O	to
O	awake
O	every
O	instant
O	.
O	Contrary
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	expectation
O	,
O	the
O	giant
O	continued
O	in
O	a
O	sound
O	sleep
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dog
O	grew
O	weary
O	of
O	barking
O	.
O	Jack
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	recollect
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	looking
O	round
O	,
O	saw
O	a
O	large
O	piece
O	of
O	meat
O	;
O	this
O	he
O	threw
O	to
O	the
O	dog
O	,
O	who
O	instantly
O	seized
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	lumber-closet
O	,
O	which
O	Jack
O	had
O	just
O	left
O	.
O	Finding
O	himself
O	delivered
O	from
O	a
O	noisy
O	and
O	troublesome
O	enemy
O	,
O	and
O	seeing
O	the
O	giant
O	did
O	not
O	awake
O	,
O	Jack
O	boldly
O	seized
O	the
O	bags
O	,
O	and
O	throwing
O	them
O	over
O	his
O	shoulders
O	,
O	ran
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	kitchen
O	.
O	He
O	reached
O	the
O	street
O	door
O	in
O	safety
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	quite
O	daylight
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	greatly
O	incommoded
O	with
O	the
O	weight
O	of
O	the
O	money-bags
O	;
O	and
O	really
O	they
O	were
O	so
O	heavy
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	scarcely
O	carry
O	them
O	.
O	Jack
O	was
O	overjoyed
O	when
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	near
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	;
O	he
O	soon
O	reached
O	the
O	bottom
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	ran
O	to
O	seek
O	his
O	mother
O	;
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	surprise
O	,
O	the
O	cottage
O	was
O	deserted
O	;
O	he
O	ran
O	from
O	one
O	room
O	to
O	another
O	,
O	without
O	being
O	able
O	to
O	find
O	any
O	one
O	;
O	he
O	then
O	hastened
O	into
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	hoping
O	to
O	see
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	neighbours
O	,
O	who
O	could
O	inform
O	him
O	where
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	his
O	mother
O	.
O	An
O	old
O	woman
O	at
O	last
O	directed
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	house
O	,
O	where
O	she
O	was
O	ill
O	of
O	a
O	fever
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	greatly
O	shocked
O	on
O	finding
O	her
O	apparently
O	dying
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	scarcely
O	bear
O	his
O	own
O	reflections
O	,
O	on
O	knowing
O	himself
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	cause
O	.
O	On
O	being
O	informed
O	of
O	our
O	hero
O	'
O	s
O	safe
O	return
O	,
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	by
O	degrees
O	,
O	revived
O	,
O	and
O	gradually
O	recovered
O	.
O	Jack
O	presented
O	her
O	with
O	his
O	two
O	valuable
O	bags
O	.
O	They
O	lived
O	happily
O	and
O	comfortably
O	;
O	the
O	cottage
O	was
O	rebuilt
O	,
O	and
O	well
O	furnished
O	.
O	For
O	three
O	years
O	Jack
O	heard
O	no
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	forget
O	it
O	;
O	though
O	he
O	feared
O	making
O	his
O	mother
O	unhappy
O	.
O	She
O	would
O	not
O	mention
O	the
O	hated
O	bean-stalk
O	,
O	lest
O	it
O	should
O	remind
O	him
O	of
O	taking
O	another
O	journey
O	.
O	Notwithstanding
O	the
O	comforts
O	Jack
O	enjoyed
O	at
O	home
O	,
O	his
O	mind
O	dwelt
O	continually
O	upon
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	fairy
O	'
O	s
O	menaces
O	,
O	in
O	case
O	of
O	his
O	disobedience
O	,
O	were
O	ever
O	present
O	to
O	his
O	mind
O	,
O	and
O	prevented
O	him
O	from
O	being
O	happy
O	;
O	he
O	could
O	think
O	of
O	nothing
O	else
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	endeavouring
O	to
O	amuse
O	himself
O	;
O	he
O	became
O	thoughtful
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	arise
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	dawn
O	of
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	view
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	for
O	hours
O	together
O	.
O	His
O	mother
O	saw
O	that
O	something
O	preyed
O	heavily
O	upon
O	his
O	mind
O	,
O	and
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	discover
O	the
O	cause
O	;
O	but
O	Jack
O	knew
O	too
O	well
O	what
O	the
O	consequence
O	would
O	be
O	,
O	should
O	she
O	succeed
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	his
O	utmost
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	to
O	conquer
O	the
O	great
O	desire
O	he
O	had
O	for
O	another
O	journey
O	up
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	.
O	Finding
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	his
O	inclination
O	grew
O	too
O	powerful
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	make
O	secret
O	preparations
O	for
O	his
O	journey
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	longest
O	day
O	,
O	arose
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	light
O	,
O	ascended
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	,
O	and
O	reached
O	the
O	top
O	with
O	some
O	little
O	trouble
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	the
O	road
O	,
O	journey
O	,
O	etc
O	.
O	,
O	much
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	two
O	former
O	times
O	;
O	he
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	mansion
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	his
O	wife
O	standing
O	,
O	as
O	usual
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	Jack
O	had
O	disguised
O	himself
O	so
O	completely
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	least
O	recollection
O	of
O	him
O	;
O	however
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	pleaded
O	hunger
O	and
O	poverty
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	gain
O	admittance
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	it
O	very
O	difficult
O	to
O	persuade
O	her
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	prevailed
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	concealed
O	in
O	the
O	copper
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	giant
O	returned
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	smell
O	fresh
O	meat
O	!
O	``
O	But
O	Jack
O	felt
O	quite
O	composed
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	said
O	so
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	been
O	soon
O	satisfied
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	the
O	giant
O	started
O	up
O	suddenly
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	notwithstanding
O	all
O	his
O	wife
O	could
O	say
O	,
O	he
O	searched
O	all
O	round
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	Whilst
O	this
O	was
O	going
O	forward
O	,
O	Jack
O	was
O	exceedingly
O	terrified
O	,
O	and
O	ready
O	to
O	die
O	with
O	fear
O	,
O	wishing
O	himself
O	at
O	home
O	a
O	thousand
O	times
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	giant
O	approached
O	the
O	copper
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	the
O	lid
O	,
O	Jack
O	thought
O	his
O	death
O	was
O	certain
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	ended
O	his
O	search
O	there
O	,
O	without
O	moving
O	the
O	lid
O	,
O	and
O	seated
O	himself
O	quietly
O	by
O	the
O	fire-side
O	.
O	This
O	fright
O	nearly
O	overcame
O	poor
O	Jack
O	;
O	he
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	moving
O	or
O	even
O	breathing
O	,
O	lest
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	discovered
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	at
O	last
O	ate
O	a
O	hearty
O	supper
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	finished
O	,
O	he
O	commanded
O	his
O	wife
O	to
O	fetch
O	down
O	his
O	harp
O	.
O	Jack
O	peeped
O	under
O	the
O	copper-lid
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	saw
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	harp
O	that
O	could
O	be
O	imagined
O	:
O	it
O	was
O	placed
O	by
O	the
O	giant
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	,
O	who
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Play
O	!
O	``
O	and
O	it
O	instantly
O	played
O	of
O	its
O	own
O	accord
O	,
O	without
O	being
O	touched
O	.
O	The
O	music
O	was
O	uncommonly
O	fine
O	.
O	Jack
O	was
O	delighted
O	,
O	and
O	felt
O	more
O	anxious
O	to
O	get
O	the
O	harp
O	into
O	his
O	possession
O	,
O	than
O	either
O	of
O	the
O	former
O	treasures
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	soul
O	was
O	not
O	attuned
O	to
O	harmony
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	music
O	soon
O	lulled
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	sound
O	sleep
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	time
O	to
O	carry
O	off
O	the
O	harp
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	giant
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	in
O	a
O	more
O	profound
O	sleep
O	than
O	usual
O	Jack
O	soon
O	determined
O	,
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	copper
O	,
O	and
O	seized
O	the
O	harp
O	,
O	The
O	harp
O	was
O	enchanted
O	by
O	a
O	fairy
O	:
O	it
O	called
O	out
O	loudly
O	:
O	``
O	Master
O	!
O	master
O	!
O	``
O	The
O	giant
O	awoke
O	,
O	stood
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	pursue
O	Jack
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	drank
O	so
O	much
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	hardly
O	stand
O	.
O	Poor
O	Jack
O	ran
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	the
O	giant
O	recovered
O	sufficiently
O	to
O	walk
O	slowly
O	,
O	or
O	rather
O	,
O	to
O	reel
O	after
O	him
O	.
O	Had
O	he
O	been
O	sober
O	,
O	he
O	must
O	have
O	overtaken
O	Jack
O	instantly
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	then
O	was
O	,
O	Jack
O	contrived
O	to
O	be
O	first
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	called
O	after
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	voice
O	like
O	thunder
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	was
O	very
O	near
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	moment
O	Jack
O	got
O	down
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	he
O	called
O	out
O	for
O	a
O	hatchet
O	;
O	one
O	was
O	brought
O	him
O	directly
O	;
O	just
O	at
O	that
O	instant
O	,
O	the
O	giant
O	was
O	beginning
O	to
O	descend
O	;
O	but
O	Jack
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	hatchet
O	,
O	cut
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	close
O	off
O	at
O	the
O	root
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	the
O	giant
O	fall
O	headlong
O	into
O	the
O	garden
O	:
O	the
O	fall
O	killed
O	him
O	,
O	thereby
O	releasing
O	the
O	world
O	from
O	a
O	barbarous
O	enemy
O	.
O	Jack
O	'
O	s
O	mother
O	was
O	delighted
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	destroyed
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	instant
O	the
O	fairy
O	appeared
O	:
O	she
O	first
O	addressed
O	Jack
O	'
O	s
O	mother
O	and
O	explained
O	every
O	circumstance
O	relating
O	to
O	the
O	journeys
O	up
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	.
O	The
O	fairy
O	charged
O	Jack
O	to
O	be
O	dutiful
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	follow
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	good
O	example
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	way
O	to
O	be
O	happy
O	.
O	She
O	then
O	disappeared
O	.
O	Jack
O	heartily
O	begged
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	pardon
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	sorrow
O	and
O	affliction
O	he
O	had
O	caused
O	her
O	,
O	promising
O	most
O	faithfully
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	dutiful
O	and
O	obedient
O	to
O	her
O	for
O	the
O	future
O	.
