O	Towards
O	morning
O	,
O	the
O	bear
O	felt
O	that

O	getting

O	alas
O	!
O	his
O	tail
O	was
O	frozen
O	fast
O	in
O	the
O	ice
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	fox
O	came
O	along
O	.
O	He
O	laughed
O	long
O	and
O	loudly
O	at
O	the
O	bear
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	if
O	the
O	fishing
O	was
O	good
O	.
O	Some
O	dogs
O	heard
O	the
O	fox
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	tearing
O	through
O	the
O	thick
O	underbrush
O	.
O	They
O	saw
O	the
O	fox

O	started

O	The
O	fox
O	slyly
O	led
O	them
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	frozen
O	river
O	toward
O	the
O	bear
O	.
O	The

O	saw
O	them
O	coming

O	called
O	to
O	the
O	fox
O	to
O	go
O	around
O	some

O	way
O	.
O	The

O	upon

O	bear
O	struggled
O	.
O	He
O	gave
O	one
O	great
O	pull
O	,
O	and
O	freed
O	himself
O	from
O	the
O	ice
O	.
O	He
O	struck
O	at
O	the
O	dogs
O	so
O	fiercely
O	with
O	his
O	great
O	paws
O	,
O	that

O	soon
O	left
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	after

O	fox
O	.
O	Dogs
O	have
O	been
O	running
O	after
O	foxes
O	ever
O	since
O	.
O	When
O	the

O	got
O	his
O	breath

O	he
O	stood
O	up
O	and
O	looked
O	around
O	at
O	his
O	tail
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	he

O	only
O	a
O	small
O	piece
O	left
O	.
O	Most
O	of
O	his
O	tail
O	had
O	been
O	left
O	in
O	the
O	ice
O	.
O	This
O	is
O	why
O	bears
O	have
O	short
O	tails

O	and
O	down
O	,
O	he
O	floated
O	,
O	through
O	clouds
O	and
O	storms
O	and
O	sunshine
O	,
O	back
O	to
O	Mother
O	Earth
O	.
O	Very
O	happy
O	,
O	he
O	flew
O	toward
O	the
O	council
O	wood
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	full
O	of
O	his
O	beautiful
O	song
O	and
O	the
O	wonderful
O	Sky
O	Trail
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	must
O	pour
O	out
O	his
O	song
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	council
O	wood
O	,
O	he
O	dared
O	not
O	open
O	his
O	mouth
O	!
O	He
O	remembered
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	stolen
O	his
O	ride
O	part
O	way
O	to
O	heaven
O	,
O	--
O	and
O	he
O	knew
O	the
O	other
O	birds
O	knew
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	that
O	song
O	!
O	he
O	must
O	sing
O	it
O	!
O	He
O	thought
O	his
O	throat
O	would
O	burst
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	sing
O	!
O	So
O	the
O	little
O	brown
O	thrush
O	flew
O	off
O	by
O	himself
O	,
O	into
O	a
O	deep
O	,
O	dark
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	There
O	,
O	hidden
O	by
O	the
O	brush
O	and
O	the
O	bushes
O	,
O	he
O	poured
O	forth
O	the
O	song
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	on
O	the
O	Great
O	Sky
O	Trail
O	.
O	Men
O	hearing
O	it
O	to-day
O	,
O	say
O	,
O	``
O	Listen
O	,
O	a
O	hermit
O	thrush
O	!
O	What
O	a
O	beautiful
O	song
O	!
O	But
O	he
O	is
O	such
O	a
O	shy
O	bird
O	,
O	one
O	seldom
O	can
O	catch
O	a
O	glimpse
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	``
O	They
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	why
O	he
O	keeps
O	so
O	close
O	under
O	cover
O	.
