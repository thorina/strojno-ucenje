O	Almost
O	every
O	one
O	has
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	famous
O	battles
O	of
O	Crecy
O	and
O	Poitiers
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	so
O	much
O	alike
O	in
O	all
O	that
O	made
O	them
O	remarkable
O	that
O	they
O	are
O	generally
O	coupled
O	together
O	,
O	--
O	one
O	always
O	reminding
O	us
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	Yet
O	there
O	is
O	one
O	point
O	they
O	had
O	in
O	common
O	which
O	has
O	not
O	been
O	especially
O	remarked
O	,
O	but
O	which
O	ought
O	to
O	link
O	them
O	memorably
O	together
O	in
O	the
O	imagination
O	of
O	young
O	people
O	.
O	These
O	two
O	great
O	battles
O	really
O	took
O	place
O	ten
O	years
O	apart
O	;
O	for
O	one
O	was
O	fought
O	in
O	1346
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	in
O	1356
O	.
O	The
O	battle-fields
O	also
O	were
O	wide
O	apart
O	;
O	for
O	Crecy
O	was
O	far
O	in
O	the
O	north
O	of
O	France
O	,
O	near
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	the
O	English
O	Channel
O	,
O	and
O	Poitiers
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	south
O	,
O	deep
O	in
O	the
O	interior
O	,
O	nearly
O	three
O	hundred
O	miles
O	from
O	Crecy
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	have
O	drawn
O	near
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	in
O	the
O	mind
O	of
O	students
O	of
O	history
O	,
O	because
O	in
O	both
O	cases
O	the
O	French
O	largely
O	outnumbered
O	the
O	English
O	;
O	in
O	both
O	cases
O	the
O	English
O	had
O	gone
O	so
O	far
O	into
O	the
O	country
O	that
O	their
O	retreat
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	cut
O	off
O	;
O	in
O	both
O	cases
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	most
O	surprising
O	and
O	unexpected
O	result
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	French
O	were
O	terribly
O	defeated
O	;
O	and
O	in
O	both
O	cases
O	this
O	happened
O	because
O	they
O	made
O	the
O	same
O	mistake
O	:
O	they
O	trusted
O	so
O	much
O	to
O	their
O	overwhelming
O	numbers
O	,
O	to
O	their
O	courage
O	and
O	their
O	valor
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	forgot
O	to
O	be
O	careful
O	about
O	anything
O	else
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	English
O	made
O	up
O	for
O	their
O	small
O	numbers
O	by
O	prudence
O	,
O	discipline
O	,
O	and
O	skill
O	,
O	without
O	which
O	courage
O	and
O	valor
O	are
O	often
O	of
O	no
O	avail
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	quite
O	exciting
O	to
O	read
O	the
O	description
O	of
O	these
O	battles
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	archery
O	fights
O	,
O	the
O	clashing
O	together
O	of
O	furious
O	knights
O	,
O	the
O	first
O	brave
O	advance
O	and
O	the
O	final
O	running
O	away
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	the
O	battles
O	at
O	large
O	seem
O	to
O	fade
O	out
O	in
O	the
O	greater
O	interest
O	which
O	surrounds
O	the
O	figures
O	of
O	two
O	youngsters
O	,
O	--
O	one
O	hardly
O	more
O	than
O	fifteen
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	scarcely
O	fourteen
O	,
O	--
O	for
O	one
O	carried
O	off
O	all
O	the
O	honors
O	of
O	the
O	victory
O	of
O	Crecy
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	redeemed
O	from
O	total
O	dishonor
O	the
O	defeat
O	of
O	Poitiers
O	.
O	Let
O	us
O	now
O	take
O	up
O	the
O	romantic
O	story
O	of
O	the
O	English
O	lad
O	in
O	the
O	former
O	battle
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	French
O	lad
O	in
O	the
O	latter
O	.
O	When
O	,
O	in
O	1346
O	,
O	Edward
O	III
O	of
O	England
O	had
O	determined
O	upon
O	an
O	invasion
O	of
O	France
O	,
O	he
O	brought
O	over
O	his
O	army
O	in
O	a
O	fleet
O	of
O	nearly
O	a
O	thousand
O	sail
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	with
O	him
O	not
O	only
O	the
O	larger
O	portion
O	of
O	his
O	great
O	nobles
O	,
O	but
O	also
O	his
O	eldest
O	son
O	,
O	Edward
O	Plantagenet
O	,
O	the
O	Prince
O	of
O	Wales
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	good
O	reasons
O	for
O	taking
O	the
O	boy
O	.
O	The
O	prince
O	was
O	expected
O	to
O	become
O	the
O	next
O	King
O	of
O	England
O	.
O	His
O	father
O	evidently
O	thought
O	him
O	able
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	very
O	important
O	part
O	in
O	becoming
O	also
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	France
O	.
O	If
O	all
O	the
O	accounts
O	of
O	him
O	are
O	true
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	remarkable
O	youth
O	;
O	wonderfully
O	strong
O	and
O	courageous
O	,
O	and
O	wonderfully
O	discreet
O	for
O	his
O	years
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	only
O	one
O	road
O	to
O	success
O	or
O	fame
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	was
O	the
O	profession
O	of
O	arms
O	.
O	The
O	ambition
O	of
O	every
O	high-born
O	young
O	fellow
O	was
O	to
O	become
O	a
O	knight
O	.
O	Knighthood
O	was
O	something
O	that
O	both
O	king
O	and
O	nobles
O	regarded
O	as
O	higher
O	in
O	some
O	respects
O	than
O	even
O	the
O	royalty
O	or
O	nobility
O	to
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	born
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	could
O	be
O	admitted
O	into
O	an
O	order
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	brotherhood
O	of
O	knights
O	,
O	which
O	extended
O	all
O	over
O	Europe
O	and
O	formed
O	an
O	independent
O	society
O	,
O	unless
O	he
O	had
O	gone
O	through
O	severe
O	discipline
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	performed
O	some
O	distinguished
O	deed
O	of
O	valor
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	could
O	wear
O	the
O	golden
O	spurs
O	;
O	for
O	knighthood
O	had
O	its
O	earliest
O	origin
O	in
O	the
O	distinction
O	of
O	fighting
O	on
O	horseback
O	,
O	while
O	ordinary
O	soldiers
O	fought
O	on
O	foot
O	.
O	Although
O	knighthood
O	changed
O	afterward
O	,
O	the
O	word
O	``
O	chivalry
O	``
O	always
O	expressed
O	it
O	,
O	from
O	_cheval_
O	,
O	a
O	horse
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	addition
O	to
O	valor
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	result
O	of
O	physical
O	strength
O	and
O	courage
O	,
O	the
O	knight
O	was
O	expected
O	to
O	be
O	generous
O	,
O	courteous
O	,
O	faithful
O	,
O	devout
O	,
O	truthful
O	,
O	high-souled
O	,
O	high-principled
O	.
O	Hence
O	the
O	epithet
O	,
O	``
O	chivalrous
O	,
O	``
O	which
O	,
O	even
O	to-day
O	,
O	is
O	so
O	often
O	heard
O	applied
O	to
O	men
O	of
O	especially
O	fine
O	spirit
O	.
O	``
O	Honor
O	``
O	was
O	the
O	great
O	word
O	which
O	included
O	all
O	these
O	qualities
O	then
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	does
O	in
O	some
O	measure
O	now
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	only
O	time
O	to
O	give
O	you
O	the
O	standard
O	,
O	and
O	can
O	not
O	pause
O	to
O	tell
O	you
O	how
O	well
O	or
O	ill
O	it
O	was
O	lived
O	up
O	to
O	generally
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	taken
O	this
O	story
O	in
O	hand
O	if
O	chivalry
O	had
O	to
O	be
O	left
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	account
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	chivalry
O	that
O	made
O	my
O	two
O	boys
O	the
O	heroes
O	they
O	were
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	King
O	Edward
O	landed
O	at
O	La
O	Hague
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	very
O	clear
O	evidence
O	of
O	the
O	serious
O	work
O	he
O	had
O	cut
O	out
O	for
O	his
O	son
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	his
O	confidence
O	that
O	the
O	youngster
O	would
O	be
O	equal
O	to
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	publicly
O	pledged
O	his
O	boy
O	,
O	beforehand
O	,
O	to
O	some
O	great
O	deed
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	a
O	life
O	of
O	valor
O	and
O	honor
O	.
O	In
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	whole
O	army
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	through
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	making
O	him
O	a
O	knight
O	.
O	Young
O	Edward
O	,
O	clad
O	in
O	armor
O	,
O	kneeled
O	down
O	before
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	wet
O	sand
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	king
O	touched
O	his
O	shoulder
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	saying
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	dub
O	thee
O	knight
O	.
O	Be
O	brave
O	,
O	bold
O	,
O	and
O	loyal
O	!
O	``
O	You
O	may
O	imagine
O	how
O	proudly
O	then
O	the
O	young
O	fellow
O	seized
O	lance
O	and
O	sword
O	and
O	shield
O	,
O	and
O	sprang
O	into
O	his
O	saddle
O	at
O	a
O	leap
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	what
O	high
O	resolve
O	he
O	rode
O	on
O	beside
O	his
O	mailed
O	and
O	gallant
O	father
O	to
O	deserve
O	the
O	name
O	which
O	that
O	impressive
O	ceremony
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	army
O	moved
O	rapidly
O	forward
O	and
O	northward
O	toward
O	Calais
O	,
O	conquering
O	everything
O	on
O	its
O	way
O	,
O	till
O	when
O	in
O	the
O	neighborhood
O	of
O	Crecy
O	,
O	the
O	intelligence
O	came
O	that
O	the
O	French
O	king
O	,
O	Philip
O	,
O	with
O	an
O	army
O	of
O	one
O	hundred
O	and
O	twenty
O	thousand
O	men
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	chivalry
O	of
O	France
O	,
O	had
O	come
O	in
O	between
O	it
O	and
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	retreat
O	possible
O	.
O	Edward
O	had
O	but
O	thirty
O	thousand
O	to
O	oppose
O	this
O	great
O	host
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	four
O	to
O	one
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	dangerous
O	spot
O	also
O	;
O	but
O	after
O	a
O	time
O	he
O	succeeded
O	in
O	getting
O	away
O	to
O	a
O	good
O	position
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	awaited
O	the
O	onset
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	will
O	doubt
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	anxious
O	enough
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	what
O	did
O	he
O	do
O	?
O	After
O	arranging
O	his
O	troops
O	in
O	battle
O	order
O	,
O	three
O	battalions
O	deep
O	,
O	he
O	sent
O	young
O	Edward
O	to
O	the
O	very
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	brilliant
O	group
O	of
O	his
O	finest
O	barons
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	brunt
O	of
O	the
O	terrible
O	charge
O	that
O	was
O	now
O	to
O	come
O	!
O	It
O	shows
O	of
O	what
O	stern
O	material
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	that
O	time
O	were
O	made
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	his
O	present
O	love
O	,
O	all
O	his
O	future
O	hope
O	,
O	lay
O	around
O	that
O	gallant
O	boy
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	the
O	glory
O	which
O	might
O	be
O	earned
O	was
O	worth
O	all
O	the
O	risk
O	.
O	Besides
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	much
O	under
O	chivalrous
O	necessity
O	to
O	send
O	him
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	lad
O	was
O	under
O	to
O	go
O	.
O	That
O	pledge
O	to
O	knighthood
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	sea-shore
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	either
O	lightly
O	taken
O	or
O	lightly
O	given
O	.
O	If
O	chivalry
O	was
O	not
O	equal
O	to
O	sacrifice
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	equal
O	to
O	nothing
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	keen
O	wisdom
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	act
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	could
O	count
O	all
O	the
O	more
O	on
O	the
O	enthusiasm
O	,
O	self-devotion
O	and
O	valor
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	and
O	men-at-arms
O	,
O	in
O	whose
O	keeping
O	he
O	had
O	placed
O	so
O	precious
O	a
O	charge
O	.
O	That
O	whole
O	first
O	battalion
O	would
O	be
O	nerved
O	to
O	tenfold
O	effort
O	because
O	the
O	prince
O	was
O	among
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	every
O	one
O	would
O	be
O	as
O	deeply
O	concerned
O	as
O	the
O	father
O	in
O	the
O	boy
O	'
O	s
O	success
O	.
O	Edward
O	carried
O	his
O	feeling
O	of
O	devotion
O	to
O	his
O	son
O	'
O	s
O	best
O	interests
O	to
O	such
O	a
O	chivalrous
O	extent
O	that
O	he
O	made
O	it
O	a
O	point
O	of
O	duty
O	to
O	keep
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	battle
O	altogether
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	nowhere
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	into
O	a
O	windmill
O	on
O	a
O	height
O	nearby
O	,
O	and
O	watched
O	the
O	fight
O	through
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	narrow
O	windows
O	in
O	its
O	upper
O	story
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	not
O	even
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	helmet
O	.
O	That
O	was
O	the
O	way
O	the
O	father
O	stood
O	by
O	his
O	son
O	--
O	by
O	showing
O	absolute
O	confidence
O	in
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	denying
O	himself
O	all
O	the
O	glory
O	that
O	might
O	come
O	from
O	a
O	great
O	and
O	important
O	battle
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	young
O	fellow
O	was
O	a
O	thousandfold
O	nerved
O	and
O	strengthened
O	by
O	knowing
O	that
O	his
O	father
O	fully
O	trusted
O	in
O	him
O	.
O	I
O	need
O	not
O	give
O	the
O	details
O	of
O	the
O	battle
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	sufficient
O	to
O	know
O	that
O	the
O	first
O	line
O	of
O	the
O	French
O	chivalry
O	charged
O	with
O	the
O	utmost
O	fury
O	.
O	Among
O	these
O	was
O	an
O	ally
O	of
O	note
O	,
O	John
O	,
O	King
O	of
O	Bohemia
O	,
O	who
O	with
O	his
O	barons
O	and
O	knights
O	was
O	not
O	behindhand
O	in
O	the
O	deadly
O	onset
O	;
O	and
O	yet
O	this
O	king
O	was
O	old
O	and
O	blind
O	!
O	His
O	was
O	chivalry
O	in
O	another
O	form
O	!
O	He
O	would
O	have
O	his
O	stroke
O	in
O	the
O	battle
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	plunged
O	into
O	it
O	with
O	his
O	horse
O	tied
O	by
O	its
O	reins
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	knights
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	.
O	A
O	plume
O	of
O	three
O	ostrich
O	feathers
O	waved
O	from
O	his
O	helmet
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	chroniclers
O	say
O	he
O	laid
O	about
O	him
O	well
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	battle
O	,
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	two
O	companions
O	were
O	found
O	dead
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	horses
O	tied
O	together
O	.
O	But
O	although
O	the
O	French
O	were
O	brave
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	wise
O	.
O	For
O	not
O	only
O	had
O	they
O	brought
O	on
O	the
O	fight
O	with
O	headlong
O	energy
O	before
O	they
O	were
O	prepared
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	had
O	allowed
O	Edward
O	to
O	place
O	himself
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	afternoon
O	sun
O	,
O	then
O	near
O	its
O	setting
O	,
O	blazed
O	full
O	in
O	their
O	eyes
O	and
O	faces
O	.
O	Edward
O	'
O	s
O	army
O	fought
O	in
O	the
O	shadow
O	.
O	The
O	terrible
O	English
O	bowmen
O	sent
O	their
O	deadly
O	cloth-yard
O	arrows
O	so
O	thick
O	and
O	fast
O	into
O	the
O	dazzled
O	and
O	crowded
O	ranks
O	of
O	fifteen
O	thousand
O	Genoese
O	archers
O	and
O	the
O	intermingled
O	men-at-arms
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	missiles
O	filled
O	the
O	air
O	like
O	snow
O	.
O	The
O	Genoese
O	were
O	thrown
O	into
O	confusion
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	spread
O	throughout
O	the
O	whole
O	French
O	army
O	.
O	The
O	French
O	king
O	,
O	with
O	some
O	of
O	his
O	dukes
O	,
O	flew
O	foaming
O	over
O	the
O	field
O	in
O	the
O	rear
O	,
O	trying
O	in
O	vain
O	to
O	get
O	up
O	in
O	time
O	to
O	swell
O	the
O	onset
O	upon
O	the
O	English
O	front
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	onset
O	had
O	proved
O	bad
O	enough
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	.
O	The
O	knights
O	around
O	the
O	young
O	prince
O	were
O	frightened
O	for
O	his
O	safety
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	Sir
O	Thomas
O	of
O	Norwich
O	,
O	was
O	sent
O	hack
O	to
O	Edward
O	to
O	ask
O	him
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	assistance
O	of
O	the
O	prince
O	.
O	``
O	Sir
O	Thomas
O	,

O	stayed
O	in
O	the
O	windmill
O	till
O	the
O	battle
O	was
O	over
O	.
O	Soon
O	the
O	cry
O	of
O	victory
O	reached
O	him
O	as
O	the
O	French
O	fled
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
O	,
O	leaving
O	their
O	dead
O	strewn
O	upon
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	young
O	prince
O	appeared
O	covered
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	glory
O	that
O	his
O	father
O	had
O	coveted
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	bearing
O	the
O	ostrich
O	plume
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	from
O	the
O	dead
O	King
O	of
O	Bohemia
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	rode
O	up
O	with
O	his
O	visor
O	raised
O	,
O	--
O	his
O	face
O	was
O	as
O	fair
O	as
O	a
O	girl

O	s
O	,
O	and
O	glowed
O	under
O	a
O	crown
O	of

O	placed
O	as
O	a
O	knightly
O	decoration
O	above
O	the
O	crest
O	of
O	his
O	helmet
O	,
O	he
O	little
O	thought
O	that
O	the

O	of
O	Wales
O	,
O	when
O	still
O	in
O	his
O	teens

O	won

O	Crecy
O	.
O	We
O	will
O	leave
O	him
O	there
O	,
O	and

O	on
O	ten

O	Philip

O	such
O	a
O	trying

O	He
O	was
O	always
O	plunging
O	himself
O	into
O	difficulties
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	often
O	guilty
O	of
O	cruelty
O	;
O	and
O	yet
O	was
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	free
O	,
O	generous
O	nature
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	so
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	virtues
O	of
O	chivalry
O	in
O	that
O	day

O	as
O	``
O	John
O	the
O	Good

O	Edward

O	Nine
O	years
O	of

O	twenty-five

O	.
O	He
O	had
O	,

O	was

O	``
O	the
O	Black

O	youngest
O	fourteen
O	.
O	The
O	three
O	former
O	were
O	put
O	under
O	good
O	guardianship
O	in
O	different
O	portions
O	of
O	the
O	field
O	;
O	but
O	why
O	the
O	hair-brained
O	monarch
O	took
O	the
O	youngest
O	boy
O	with
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	very
O	front
O	and
O	thickest
O	of
O	the
O	fight
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	hard
O	to
O	guess
O	,
O	unless
O	it
O	was
O	another
O	imitation
O	of
O	Edward
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	also
O	good
O	reason
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	the
O	lad
O	was
O	unusually
O	well
O	able
O	to
O	take
O	care
O	of
O	himself
O	,
O	having
O	been
O	trained
O	at
O	arms
O	and
O	pledged
O	to
O	knighthood
O	.
O	But
O	young
O	``
O	Sir
O	Philip
O	,
O	``
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	called
O	,
O	proved
O	quite
O	equal
O	to
O	the
O	occasion
O	.
O	King
O	John
O	himself
O	led
O	the
O	van
O	,
O	moving
O	down
O	through
O	a
O	defile
O	,
O	into
O	which
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	his
O	whole
O	army
O	found
O	themselves
O	crowded
O	.
O	Meantime
O	,
O	the
O	Prince
O	of
O	Wales
O	had
O	planted
O	his
O	army
O	just
O	where
O	he
O	would
O	tempt
O	John
O	into
O	that
O	trap
O	and
O	had
O	set
O	his
O	archers
O	in
O	good
O	position
O	.
O	These
O	men
O	were
O	clad
O	in
O	green
O	,
O	like
O	Robin
O	Hood
O	'
O	s
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	bows
O	seven
O	feet
O	long
O	and
O	so
O	thick
O	that
O	few
O	men
O	of
O	modern
O	days
O	could
O	bend
O	them
O	.
O	A
O	cloth-yard
O	shaft
O	from
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	would
O	fly
O	with
O	tremendous
O	force
O	.
O	Edward
O	had
O	placed
O	these
O	archers
O	in
O	ambush
O	,
O	behind
O	green
O	hedges
O	,
O	and
O	crouching
O	in
O	the
O	green
O	of
O	the
O	vineyards
O	.
O	Just
O	as
O	the
O	French
O	king
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	new
O	chivalry
O	around
O	him
O	,
O	dashed
O	down
O	the
O	narrow
O	valley
O	--
O	the
O	white
O	standard
O	of
O	France
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	his
O	keen-eyed
O	little
O	son
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	--
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	deploy
O	the
O	whole
O	advance
O	battalion
O	,
O	preliminary
O	to
O	a
O	grand

O	!
O	whir
O	!
O	whir
O	!
O	from

O	the
O	arrows
O	,
O	as
O	thick
O	as
O	hail
O	and
O	as
O	terrible
O	as
O	javelins
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	hidden
O	archers
O	.
O	The
O	astonished
O	Frenchmen
O	fell
O	back
O	.
O	That
O	crowded
O	still
O	more
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	yet
O	wedged
O	in
O	the
O	narrow
O	space

O	Now
O	came
O	the
O	English
O	onset
O	.
O	Then
O	a
O	panic
O	.
O	Then
O	a
O	rout
O	.
O	Then
O	a
O	general
O	flight
O	.
O	Dukes
O	,
O	barons
O	,
O	knights
O	of
O	all
O	sorts
O	fled
O	with
O	the

O	Charles
O	,

O	,
O	John
O	,
O	the
O	three
O	elder
O	sons
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	was
O	in
O	great
O	danger
O	of
O	being
O	slain
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	move
O	,
O	and
O	Philip
O	stood
O	fighting
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	.
O	The
O	standard-bearer
O	fell
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	white
O	ensign
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	dust
O	.
O	Many
O	a
O	faithful
O	knight
O	was
O	cut
O	down
O	,
O	or
O	swept
O	away
O	a
O	prisoner
O	.
O	But
O	Philip
O	flinched
O	not
O	.
O	The
O	assailants
O	--
O	some
O	of
O	whom
O	knew
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	while
O	others
O	were
O	wondering
O	who
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	--
O	pressed
O	them
O	fiercely
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	,
O	striking
O	at
O	them
O	,
O	but
O	more
O	anxious
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	captives
O	than
O	to
O	kill
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	worth
O	a
O	heavy
O	ransom
O	.
O	The
O	Englishmen
O	shouted
O	all
O	together
O	,
O	``
O	Yield
O	you

O	Little

O	a
