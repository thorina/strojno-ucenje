O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	so
O	long
O	ago
O	that
O	I
O	have
O	quite
O	forgotten
O	the
O	date
O	,
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	who
O	had
O	no
O	children
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	said
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	``
O	All
O	the
O	queens
O	of
O	my
O	acquaintance
O	have
O	children
O	,
O	some
O	three
O	,
O	some
O	seven
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	as
O	many
O	as
O	twelve
O	;
O	and
O	my
O	queen
O	has
O	not
O	one
O	.
O	I
O	feel
O	ill-used
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	he
O	made
O	up
O	his
O	mind
O	to
O	be
O	cross
O	with
O	his
O	wife
O	about
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	bore
O	it
O	all
O	like
O	a
O	good
O	patient
O	queen
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	king
O	grew
O	very
O	cross
O	indeed
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	queen
O	pretended
O	to
O	take
O	it
O	all
O	as
O	a
O	joke
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	one
O	too
O	.
O	``
O	Why
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	you
O	have
O	any
O	daughters
O	,
O	at
O	least
O	?
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	say
O	_sons_
O	;
O	that
O	might
O	be
O	too
O	much
O	to
O	expect
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	sure
O	,
O	dear
O	king
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	very
O	sorry
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	queen
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	you
O	ought
O	to
O	be
O	,
O	``
O	retorted
O	the
O	king
O	;
O	``
O	you
O	are
O	not
O	going
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	virtue
O	of
O	_that_
O	,
O	surely
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	an
O	ill-tempered
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	any
O	matter
O	of
O	less
O	moment
O	would
O	have
O	let
O	the
O	queen
O	have
O	her
O	own
O	way
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	This
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	was
O	an
O	affair
O	of
O	State
O	.
O	The
O	queen
O	smiled
O	.
O	``
O	You
O	must
O	have
O	patience
O	with
O	a
O	lady
O	,
O	you
O	know
O	,
O	dear
O	king
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	she
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	a
O	very
O	nice
O	queen
O	,
O	and
O	heartily
O	sorry
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	oblige
O	the
O	king
O	immediately
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	tried
O	to
O	have
O	patience
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	succeeded
O	very
O	badly
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	more
O	than
O	he
O	deserved
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	the
O	queen
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	daughter
O	--
O	as
O	lovely
O	a
O	little
O	princess
O	as
O	ever
O	cried
O	.
O	The
O	day
O	drew
O	near
O	when
O	the
O	infant
O	must
O	be
O	christened
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	wrote
O	all
O	the
O	invitations
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	hand
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	somebody
O	was
O	forgotten
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	does
O	not
O	generally
O	matter
O	if
O	somebody
O	_is_
O	forgotten
O	,
O	only
O	you
O	must
O	mind
O	who
O	.
O	Unfortunately
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	forgot
O	without
O	intending
O	to
O	forget
O	;
O	and
O	so
O	the
O	chance
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	Princess
O	Makemnoit
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	awkward
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	own
O	sister
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	ought
O	not
O	to
O	have
O	forgotten
O	her
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	had
O	made
O	herself
O	so
O	disagreeable
O	to
O	the
O	old
O	king
O	,
O	their
O	father
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	forgotten
O	her
O	in
O	making
O	his
O	will
O	;
O	and
O	so
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	wonder
O	that
O	her
O	brother
O	forgot
O	her
O	in
O	writing
O	his
O	invitations
O	.
O	But
O	poor
O	relations
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	do
O	anything
O	to
O	keep
O	you
O	in
O	mind
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	Why
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	they
O	?
O	The
O	king
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	into
O	the
O	garret
O	she
O	lived
O	in
O	,
O	could
O	he
O	?
O	She
O	was
O	a
O	sour
O	,
O	spiteful
O	creature
O	.
O	The
O	wrinkles
O	of
O	contempt
O	crossed
O	the
O	wrinkles
O	of
O	peevishness
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	her
O	face
O	as
O	full
O	of
O	wrinkles
O	as
O	a
O	pat
O	of
O	butter
O	.
O	If
O	ever
O	a
O	king
O	could
O	be
O	justified
O	in
O	forgetting
O	anybody
O	,
O	this
O	king
O	was
O	justified
O	in
O	forgetting
O	his
O	sister
O	,
O	even
O	at
O	a
O	christening
O	.
O	She
O	looked
O	very
O	odd
O	,
O	too
O	.
O	Her
O	forehead
O	was
O	as
O	large
O	as
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	her
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	projected
O	over
O	it
O	like
O	a
O	precipice
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	was
O	angry
O	,
O	her
O	little
O	eyes
O	flashed
O	blue
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	hated
O	anybody
O	,
O	they
O	shone
O	yellow
O	and
O	green
O	.
O	What
O	they
O	looked
O	like
O	when
O	she
O	loved
O	anybody
O	,
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	;
O	for
O	I
O	never
O	heard
O	of
O	her
O	loving
O	anybody
O	but
O	herself
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	think
O	she
O	could
O	have
O	managed
O	that
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	somehow
O	got
O	used
O	to
O	herself
O	.
O	But
O	what
O	made
O	it
O	highly
O	imprudent
O	in
O	the
O	king
O	to
O	forget
O	her
O	was
O	--
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	awfully
O	clever
O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	witch
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	bewitched
O	anybody
O	,
O	he
O	very
O	soon
O	had
O	enough
O	of
O	it
O	;
O	for
O	she
O	beat
O	all
O	the
O	wicked
O	fairies
O	in
O	wickedness
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	clever
O	ones
O	in
O	cleverness
O	.
O	She
O	despised
O	all
O	the
O	modes
O	we
O	read
O	of
O	in
O	history
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	offended
O	fairies
O	and
O	witches
O	have
O	taken
O	their
O	revenges
O	;
O	and
O	therefore
O	,
O	after
O	waiting
O	and
O	waiting
O	in
O	vain
O	for
O	an
O	invitation
O	,
O	she
O	made
O	up
O	her
O	mind
O	at
O	last
O	to
O	go
O	without
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	make
O	the
O	whole
O	family
O	miserable
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	princess
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	.
O	So
O	she
O	put
O	on
O	her
O	best
O	gown
O	,
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	was
O	kindly
O	received
O	by
O	the
O	happy
O	monarch
O	,
O	who
O	forgot
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	forgotten
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	her
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	procession
O	to
O	the
O	royal
O	chapel
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	gathered
O	about
O	the
O	font
O	,
O	she
O	contrived
O	to
O	get
O	next
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	throw
O	something
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	;
O	after
O	which
O	she
O	maintained
O	a
O	very
O	respectful
O	demeanour
O	till
O	the
O	water
O	was
O	applied
O	to
O	the
O	child
O	'
O	s
O	face
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	that
O	moment
O	she
O	turned
O	round
O	in
O	her
O	place
O	three
O	times
O	,
O	and
O	muttered
O	the
O	following
O	words
O	,
O	loud
O	enough
O	for
O	those
O	beside
O	her
O	to
O	hear
O	:
O	``
O	Light
O	of
O	spirit
O	,
O	by
O	my
O	charms
O	,
O	Light
O	of
O	body
O	,
O	every
O	part
O	,
O	Never
O	weary
O	human
O	arms
O	--
O	Only
O	crush
O	thy
O	parents
O	'
O	heart
O	!
O	``
O	They
O	all
O	thought
O	she
O	had
O	lost
O	her
O	wits
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	repeating
O	some
O	foolish
O	nursery
O	rhyme
O	;
O	but
O	a
O	shudder
O	went
O	through
O	the
O	whole
O	of
O	them
O	notwithstanding
O	.
O	The
O	baby
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	contrary
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	laugh
O	and
O	crow
O	;
O	while
O	the
O	nurse
O	gave
O	a
O	start
O	and
O	a
O	smothered
O	cry
O	,
O	for
O	,
O	she
O	thought
O	she
O	was
O	struck
O	with
O	paralysis
O	:
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	feel
O	the
O	baby
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	clasped
O	it
O	tight
O	and
O	said
O	nothing
O	.
O	The
O	mischief
O	was
O	done
O	.
O	Her
O	atrocious
O	aunt
O	had
O	deprived
O	the
O	child
O	of
O	all
O	her
O	gravity
O	.
O	If
O	you
O	ask
O	me
O	how
O	this
O	was
O	effected
O	,
O	I
O	answer
O	,
O	``
O	In
O	the
O	easiest
O	way
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	only
O	to
O	destroy
O	gravitation
O	.
O	``
O	For
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	a
O	philosopher
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	all
O	the
O	ins
O	and
O	outs
O	of
O	the
O	laws
O	of
O	gravitation
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	ins
O	and
O	outs
O	of
O	her
O	boot-lace
O	.
O	And
O	being
O	a
O	witch
O	as
O	well
O	,
O	she
O	could
O	abrogate
O	those
O	laws
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	;
O	or
O	at
O	least
O	so
O	clog
O	their
O	wheels
O	and
O	rust
O	their
O	bearings
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	work
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	But
O	we
O	have
O	more
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	what
O	followed
O	than
O	with
O	how
O	it
O	was
O	done
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	awkwardness
O	that
O	resulted
O	from
O	this
O	unhappy
O	privation
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	moment
O	the
O	nurse
O	began
O	to
O	float
O	the
O	baby
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	,
O	she
O	flew
O	from
O	her
O	arms
O	towards
O	the
O	ceiling
O	.
O	Happily
O	,
O	the
O	resistance
O	of
O	the
O	air
O	brought
O	her
O	ascending
O	career
O	to
O	a
O	close
O	within
O	a
O	foot
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	There
O	she
O	remained
O	,
O	horizontal
O	as
O	when
O	she
O	left
O	her
O	nurse
O	'
O	s
O	arms
O	,
O	kicking
O	and
O	laughing
O	amazingly
O	.
O	The
O	nurse
O	in
O	terror
O	flew
O	to
O	the
O	bell
O	,
O	and
O	begged
O	the
O	footman
O	,
O	who
O	answered
O	it
O	,
O	to
O	bring
O	up
O	the
O	house-steps
O	directly
O	.
O	Trembling
O	in
O	every
O	limb
O	,
O	she
O	climbed
O	upon
O	the
O	steps
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	to
O	stand
O	upon
O	the
O	very
O	top
O	,
O	and
O	reach
O	up
O	,
O	before
O	she
O	could
O	catch
O	the
O	floating
O	tail
O	of
O	the
O	baby
O	'
O	s
O	long
O	clothes
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	strange
O	fact
O	came
O	to
O	be
O	known
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	terrible
O	commotion
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	The
O	occasion
O	of
O	its
O	discovery
O	by
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	naturally
O	a
O	repetition
O	of
O	the
O	nurse
O	'
O	s
O	experience
O	.
O	Astonished
O	that
O	he
O	felt
O	no
O	weight
O	when
O	the
O	child
O	was
O	laid
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	wave
O	her
O	up
O	and
O	--
O	not
O	down
O	;
O	for
O	she
O	slowly
O	ascended
O	to
O	the
O	ceiling
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	remained
O	floating
O	in
O	perfect
O	comfort
O	and
O	satisfaction
O	,
O	as
O	was
O	testified
O	by
O	her
O	peals
O	of
O	tiny
O	laughter
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	stood
O	staring
O	up
O	in
O	speechless
O	amazement
O	,
O	and
O	trembled
O	so
O	that
O	his
O	beard
O	shook
O	like
O	grass

O	noon

O	that
O	the

O	was
O	wrapped
O	in
O	nothing

O	The

O	not

O	A

O	a

O	through
O	the
O	opposite

O	away
O	.
O	The

O	went
O	down-stairs

O	quite
O	ignorant

O	.
O	When
O	the

O	exclaimed
O	the

O	.
O	The

O	saw
O	that
O	something

O	amiss
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	down
O	in
O	a
O	faint
O	.
O	The
O	nurse
O	rushed
O	about
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	screaming
O	,
O	``
O	My

O	Every

O	.
O	But
O	the
O	queen
O	could
O	give
O	no
O	orders
O	.
O	They
O	soon
O	found
O	out
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	missing
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	the
O	palace
O	was
O	like
O	a
O	beehive
O	in
O	a
O	garden
O	;
O	and
O	in
O	one
O	minute
O	more
O	the
O	queen
O	was
O	brought
O	to
O	herself
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	shout
O	and
O	a
O	clapping
O	of
O	hands
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	found
O	the
O	princess
O	fast
O	asleep
O	under
O	a
O	rose-bush
O	,
O	to
O	which
O	the
O	elfish
O	little
O	wind-puff
O	had
O	carried
O	her
O	,
O	finishing
O	its
O	mischief
O	by
O	shaking
O	a
O	shower
O	of
O	red
O	rose-leaves
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	little
O	white
O	sleeper
O	.
O	Startled
O	by
O	the
O	noise
O	the
O	servants
O	made
O	,
O	she
O	woke
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	furious
O	with
O	glee
O	,
O	scattered
O	the
O	rose-leaves
O	in
O	all
O	directions
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	shower
O	of
O	spray
O	in
O	the
O	sunset
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	watched
O	more
O	carefully
O	after
O	this
O	,
O	no
O	doubt
O	;
O	yet
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	endless
O	to
O	relate
O	all
O	the
O	odd
O	incidents
O	resulting
O	from
O	this
O	peculiarity
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	princess
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	never
O	was
O	a
O	baby
O	in
O	a
O	house
O	,
O	not
O	to
O	say
O	a
O	palace
O	,
O	that
O	kept
O	the
O	household
O	in
O	such
O	constant
O	good
O	humour
O	,
O	at
O	least
O	below-stairs
O	.
O	If
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	easy
O	for
O	her
O	nurses
O	to
O	hold
O	her
O	,
O	at
O	least
O	she
O	made
O	neither
O	their
O	arms
O	nor
O	their
O	hearts
O	ache
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	nice
O	to
O	play
O	at
O	ball
O	with
O	!
O	There
O	was
O	positively
O	no
O	danger
O	of
O	letting
O	her
O	fall
O	.
O	They
O	might
O	throw
O	her
O	down
O	,
O	or
O	knock
O	her
O	down
O	,
O	or
O	push

O	down

O	but
O	they

O	down
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	true
O	,
O	they

O	let
O	her
O	fly
O	into
O	the
O	fire
O	or
O	the
O	coal-hole
O	,
O	or
O	through
O	the
O	window
O	;
O	but
O	none
O	of
O	these
O	accidents
O	had
O	happened
O	as
O	yet
O	.
O	If
O	you
O	heard
O	peals
O	of
O	laughter
O	resounding
O	from
O	some
O	unknown
O	region
O	,
O	you
O	might
O	be
O	sure
O	enough
O	of
O	the
O	cause
O	.
O	Going
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	kitchen
O	,
O	or
O	_the
O	room_
O	,
O	you
O	would
O	find
O	Jane
O	and
O	Thomas
O	,
O	and
O	Robert
O	and
O	Susan
O	,
O	all
O	and
O	sum
O	,
O	playing
O	at
O	ball
O	with
O	the
O	little
O	princess
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	the
O	ball
O	herself
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	enjoy
O	it
O	the
O	less
O	for
O	that
O	.
O	Away
O	she
O	went
O	,
O	flying
O	from
O	one
O	to
O	another
O	,
O	screeching
O	with
O	laughter
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	servants
O	loved
O	the
O	ball
O	itself
O	better
O	even
O	than
O	the
O	game
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	take
O	some
O	care
O	how
O	they
O	threw
O	her
O	,
O	for
O	if
O	she
O	received
O	an
O	upward
O	direction
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	never
O	come
O	down
O	again
O	without
O	being
O	fetched
O	.
O	But
O	above-stairs
O	it
O	was
O	different
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	for
O	instance
O	,
O	after
O	breakfast
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	went
O	into
O	his
O	counting-house
O	,
O	and
O	counted
O	out
O	his
O	money
O	.
O	The
O	operation
O	gave
O	him
O	no
O	pleasure
O	.
O	``
O	To
O	think
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	``
O	that
O	every

O	of
O	these
O	gold

O	,

O	with

O	broad
O	smile

O	self-satisfaction
O	all
O	over

O	yellow
O	faces
O	.
O	The
O	queen
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	parlour
O	,
O	eating
O	bread
O	and
O	honey
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	the
O	second
O	mouthful
O	she
O	burst
O	out
O	crying
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	swallow
O	it

O	The
O	king
O	heard
O	her
O	sobbing
O	.
O	Glad
O	of
O	anybody
O	,
O	but
O	especially
O	of
O	his
O	queen
O	,
O	to
O	quarrel
O	with
O	,
O	he
O	clashed
O	his
O	gold
O	sovereigns
O	into
O	his
O	money-box
O	,
O	clapped
O	his
O	crown
O	on
O	his

O	,
O	and
O	rushed
O	into

O	.
O	With
O	one
O	push

O	floating
O	in
O	the

O	holding
O	a
O	consultation
O	about

O	in

O	,
O	that

O	laughter
O	over
O	their
O	heads
O	;
O	and
O	looking
O	up
O	with
O	indignation
O	,
O	saw
O	her
O	floating
O	at
O	full
O	length
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	above
O	them
O	,
O	whence
O	she
O	regarded
O	them
O	with
O	the

O	appreciation

O	the
O	position
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	an
O	awkward
O	accident
O	happened
O	.
O	The
O	princess
O	had
O	come
O	out
O	upon
O	the
O	lawn

O	of

O	attendants
O	,
O	who
O	held
O	her
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	.
O	Spying
O	her
O	father
O	at
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	lawn
O	,
O	she
O	snatched
O	her
O	hand
O	from
O	the
O	maid
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	and
O	sped
O	across
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	she
O	wanted
O	to
O	run
O	alone
O	,
O	her
O	custom
O	was
O	to
O	catch
O	up
O	a
O	stone
O	in
O	each
O	hand
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	come
O	down
O	again
O	after
O	a
O	bound
O	.
O	Whatever
O	she
O	wore
O	as
O	part

O	no

O	.
O	Even
O	gold
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	thus
O	became
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	herself
O	,
O	lost
O	all
O	its
O	weight
O	for
O	the
O	time
O	.
O	But
O	whatever
O	she
O	only
O	held
O	in
O	her
O	hands
O	retained
O	its
O	downward
O	tendency
O	.
O	On
O	this
O	occasion
O	she
O	could
O	see
O	nothing
O	to
O	catch
O	up
O	but
O	a
O	huge
O	toad
O	,
O	that
O	was
O	walking
O	across
O	the
O	lawn
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	to
O	do
O	it
O	in
O	.
O	Not
O	knowing
O	what
O	disgust
O	meant
O	,
O	for
O	this
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	peculiarities
O	,
O	she
O	snatched
O	up
O	the
O	toad
O	and
O	bounded
O	away
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	almost
O	reached
O	her
O	father
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	holding
O	out
O	his
O	arms
O	to
O	receive
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	take
O	from
O	her
O	lips
O	the
O	kiss
O	which
O	hovered
O	on
O	them
O	like
O	a
O	butterfly
O	on
O	a
O	rosebud
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	puff
O	of
O	wind
O	blew
O	her
O	aside
O	into
O	the
O	arms
O	of
O	a
O	young
O	page
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	just
O	been
O	receiving
O	a
O	message
O	from
O	his
O	Majesty
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	great
O	peculiarity
O	in
O	the
O	princess
O	that
O	,
O	once
O	she
O	was
O	set
O	agoing
O	,
O	it
O	always
O	cost
O	her
O	time
O	and
O	trouble
O	to
O	check
O	herself
O	.
O	On
O	this
O	occasion
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	time
O	.
O	She
O	_must_
O	kiss
O	--
O	and
O	she
O	kissed
O	the
O	page
O	.
O	She
O	did
O	not
O	mind
O	it
O	much
O	;
O	for
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	shyness
O	in
O	her
O	composition
O	;
O	and
O	she
O	knew
O	,
O	besides
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	it
O	.
O	So
O	she
O	only
O	laughed
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	musical
O	box
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	page
O	fared
O	the
O	worst
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	princess
O	,
O	trying
O	to
O	correct
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	tendency
O	of
O	the
O	kiss
O	,
O	put
O	out
O	her
O	hands
O	to
O	keep
O	off
O	the
O	page
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	along
O	with
O	the
O	kiss
O	,
O	he
O	received
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	cheek
O	,
O	a
O	slap
O	with
O	the
O	huge
O	black
O	toad
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	poked
O	right
O	into
O	his
O	eye
O	.
O	He
O	tried
O	to
O	laugh
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	attempt
O	resulted
O	in
O	such
O	an
O	odd
O	contortion
O	of
O	countenance
O	,
O	as
O	showed
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	danger
O	of
O	his
O	pluming
O	himself
O	on
O	the
O	kiss
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	his
O	dignity
O	was
O	greatly
O	hurt
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	speak
O	to
O	the
O	page
O	for
O	a
O	whole
O	month
O	.
O	I
O	may
O	here
O	remark
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	amusing
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	run
O	,
O	if
O	her
O	mode
O	of
O	progression
O	could
O	properly
O	be
O	called
O	running
O	.
O	For
O	first
O	she
O	would
O	make
O	a
O	bound
O	;
O	then
O	,
O	having
O	alighted
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	run
O	a
O	few
O	steps
O	,
O	and
O	make
O	another
O	bound
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	she
O	would
O	fancy
O	she
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	ground
O	before
O	she
O	actually
O	had
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	feet
O	would
O	go
O	backwards
O	and
O	forwards
O	,
O	running
O	upon
O	nothing
O	at
O	all
O	,
O	like
O	those
O	of
O	a
O	chicken
O	on
O	its
O	back
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	would
O	laugh
O	like
O	the
O	very
O	spirit
O	of
O	fun
O	;
O	only
O	in
O	her
O	laugh
O	there
O	was
O	something
O	missing
O	.
O	What
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	I
O	find
O	myself
O	unable
O	to
O	describe
O	.
O	I
O	think
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	certain
O	tone
O	,
O	depending
O	upon
O	the
O	possibility
O	of
O	sorrow
O	--
O	_morbidezza_
O	,
O	perhaps
O	.
O	She
O	never
O	smiled
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	long
O	avoidance
O	of
O	the
O	painful
O	subject
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	resolved
O	to
O	hold
O	a
O	council
O	of
O	three
O	upon
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	so
O	they
O	sent
O	for
O	the
O	princess
O	.
O	In
O	she
O	came
O	,
O	sliding
O	and
O	flitting
O	and
O	gliding
O	from
O	one
O	piece
O	of
O	furniture
O	to
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	herself
O	at
O	last
O	in
O	an
O	arm-chair
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	sitting
O	posture
O	.
O	Whether
O	she
O	could
O	be
O	said
O	_to
O	sit_
O	,
O	seeing
O	she
O	received
O	no
O	support
O	from
O	the
O	seat
O	of
O	the
O	chair
O	,
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	pretend
O	to
O	determine
O	.
O	``

O	the
O	laws
O	of
O	nature
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	unserviceable

O	case

O	for
O	it
O	was
O	impossible

O	body
O	,
O	sharing
O	all
O	the
O	other
O	properties
O	of
O	the

O	Perhaps
O	the
O	best
O	thing
O	for
O	the
O	princess
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	to
O	fall
O	in
O	love
O	.
O	But
O	how
O	a
O	princess
O	who
O	had
O	no
O	gravity
O	could
O	fall
O	into
O	anything

O	perhaps
O	_the_
O	difficulty
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	her
O	own
O	feelings
O	on
O	the
O	subject
O	,
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	even
O	know
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	beehive
O	of
O	honey
O	and
O	stings
O	to
O	be
O	fallen
O	into
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	I
O	come
O	to
O	mention
O	another
O	curious
O	fact
O	about
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	palace
O	was
O	built
O	on
O	the
O	shores
O	of
O	the
O	loveliest
O	lake
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	princess
O	loved
O	this
O	lake
O	more
O	than
O	father
O	or
O	mother
O	.
O	The
O	root
O	of
O	this
O	preference
O	no
O	doubt
O	,
O	although
O	the
O	princess
O	did
O	not
O	recognise
O	it
O	as
O	such
O	,
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	moment
O	she
O	got
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	she
O	recovered
O	the
O	natural
O	right
O	of
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	wickedly
O	deprived
O	--
O	namely
O	,
O	gravity
O	.
O	Whether
O	this
O	was
O	owing
O	to
O	the
O	fact
O	that
O	water
O	had
O	been
O	employed
O	as
O	the
O	means
O	of
O	conveying
O	the
O	injury
O	,
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	is
O	certain
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	swim
O	and
O	dive
O	like
O	the
O	duck
O	that
O	her
O	old
O	nurse
O	said
O	she
O	was
O	.
O	The
O	manner
O	in
O	which
O	this
O	alleviation
O	of
O	her
O	misfortune
O	was
O	discovered
O	was
O	as
O	follows
O	:
O	One
O	summer
O	evening
O	,
O	during
O	the
O	carnival
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	taken
O	upon
O	the
O	lake
O	by
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	royal
O	barge
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	accompanied
O	by
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	courtiers
O	in
O	a
O	fleet
O	of
O	little
O	boats
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	she
O	wanted
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	the
O	lord
O	chancellor
O	'
O	s
O	barge
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	daughter
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	favourite
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	was
O	in
O	it
O	with
O	her
O	father
O	.
O	Now
O	though
O	the
O	old
O	king
O	rarely
O	condescended
O	to
O	make
O	light
O	of
O	his
O	misfortune
O	,
O	yet
O	,
O	happening
O	on
O	this
O	occasion
O	to
O	be
O	in
O	a
O	particularly
O	good
O	humour
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	barges
O	approached
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	he
O	caught
O	up
O	the
O	princess
O	to
O	throw
O	her
O	into
O	the
O	chancellor
O	'
O	s
O	barge
O	.
O	He
O	lost
O	his
O	balance
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	dropping
O	into
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	barge
O	,
O	lost
O	his
O	hold
O	of
O	his
O	daughter
O	;
O	not
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	before
O	imparting
O	to
O	her
O	the
O	downward
O	tendency
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	person
O	,
O	though
O	in
O	a
O	somewhat
O	different
O	direction
O	,
O	for
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	king
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	she
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	burst
O	of
O	delighted
O	laughter
O	she
O	disappeared
O	into
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	A
O	cry
O	of
O	horror
O	ascended
O	from
O	the
O	boats
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	the
O	princess
O	go
O	down
O	before
O	.
O	Half
O	the
O	men
O	were
O	under
O	water
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	;
O	but
O	they
O	had
O	all
O	,
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	,
O	come
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	surface
O	again
O	for
O	breath
O	,
O	when
O	--
O	tinkle
O	,
O	tinkle
O	,
O	babble
O	,
O	and
O	gush
O	!
O	came
O	the
O	princess
O	'
O	s
O	laugh
O	over
O	the
O	water
O	from
O	far
O	away
O	.
O	There
O	she
O	was
O	,
O	swimming
O	like
O	a
O	swan
O	.
O	Nor
O	would
O	she
O	come
O	out
O	for
O	king
O	or
O	queen
O	,
O	chancellor
O	or
O	daughter
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	perfectly
O	obstinate
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	she
O	seemed
O	more
O	sedate
O	than
O	usual
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	that
O	was
O	because
O	a
O	great
O	pleasure
O	spoils
O	laughing
O	.
O	At
O	all
O	events
O	,
O	after
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	passion
O	of
O	her
O	life
O	was
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	always
O	the
O	better
O	behaved
O	and
O	the
O	more
O	beautiful
O	the
O	more
O	she
O	had
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	Summer
O	and
O	winter
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	the
O	same
O	;
O	only
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	stay
O	so
O	long
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	break
O	the
O	ice
O	to
O	let
O	her
O	in
O	.
O	Any
O	day
O	,
O	from
O	morning
O	to
O	evening
O	in
O	summer
O	,
O	she
O	might
O	be
O	descried
O	--
O	a
O	streak
O	of
O	white
O	in
O	the
O	blue
O	water
O	--
O	lying
O	as
O	still
O	as
O	the
O	shadow
O	of
O	a
O	cloud
O	,
O	or
O	shooting
O	along
O	like
O	a
O	dolphin
O	;
O	disappearing
O	,
O	and
O	coming
O	up
O	again
O	far
O	off
O	,
O	just
O	where
O	one
O	did
O	not
O	expect
O	her
O	.
O	She
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	in
O	the
O	lake
O	of
O	a
O	night
O	too
O	,
O	if
O	she
O	could
O	have
O	had
O	her
O	way
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	balcony
O	of
O	her
O	window
O	overhung
O	a
O	deep
O	pool
O	in
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	through
O	a
O	shallow
O	reedy
O	passage
O	she
O	could
O	have
O	swum
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	wide
O	wet
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	one
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	any
O	the
O	wiser
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	happened
O	to
O	wake
O	in
O	the
O	moonlight
O	she
O	could
O	hardly
O	resist
O	the
O	temptation
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	the
O	sad
O	difficulty
O	of
O	getting
O	into
O	it
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	as
O	great
O	a
O	dread
O	of
O	the
O	air
O	as
O	some
O	children
O	have
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	slightest
O	gust
O	of
O	wind
O	would
O	blow
O	her
O	away
O	;
O	and
O	a
O	gust
O	might
O	arise
O	in
O	the
O	stillest
O	moment
O	.
O	And
O	if
O	she
O	gave
O	herself
O	a
O	push
O	towards
O	the
O	water
O	and
O	just
O	failed
O	of
O	reaching
O	it
O	,
O	her
O	situation
O	would
O	be
O	dreadfully
O	awkward
O	,
O	irrespective
O	of
O	the
O	wind
O	;
O	for
O	at
O	best
O	there
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	remain
O	,
O	suspended
O	in
O	her
O	night-gown
O	,
O	till
O	she
O	was
O	seen
O	and
O	angled
O	for
O	by
O	somebody
O	from
O	the
O	window
O	.
O	``
O	Oh
O	!
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	my
O	gravity
O	,
O	``
O	thought
O	she
O	,
O	contemplating
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	would
O	flash
O	off
O	this
O	balcony
O	like
O	a
O	long
O	white
O	sea-bird
O	,
O	headlong
O	into
O	the
O	darling
O	wetness
O	.
O	Heigh-ho
O	!
O	``
O	This
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	consideration
O	that
O	made
O	her
O	wish
O	to
O	be
O	like
O	other
O	people
O	.
O	Another
O	reason
O	for
O	her
O	being
O	fond
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	was
O	that
O	in
O	it
O	alone
O	she
O	enjoyed
O	any
O	freedom
O	.
O	For
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	walk
O	without
O	a
O	_cortège_
O	,
O	consisting
O	in
O	part
O	of
O	a
O	troop
O	of
O	light-horse
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	the
O	liberties
O	which
O	the
O	wind
O	might
O	take
O	with
O	her
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	grew
O	more
O	apprehensive
O	with
O	increasing
O	years
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	allow
O	her
O	to
O	walk
O	abroad
O	at
O	all
O	without
O	some
O	twenty
O	silken
O	cords
O	fastened
O	to
O	as
O	many
O	parts
O	of
O	her
O	dress
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	by
O	twenty
O	noblemen
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	horseback
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	question
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	bade
O	good-bye
O	to
O	all
O	this
O	ceremony
O	when
O	she
O	got
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	remarkable
O	were
O	its
O	effects
O	upon
O	her
O	,
O	especially
O	in
O	restoring
O	her
O	for
O	the
O	time
O	to
O	the
O	ordinary
O	human
O	gravity
O	,
O	that
O	Hum-Drum
O	and
O	Kopy-Keck
O	agreed
O	in
O	recommending
O	the
O	king
O	to
O	bury
O	her
O	alive
O	for
O	three
O	years
O	;
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	that
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	water
O	did
O	her
O	so
O	much
O	good
O	,
O	the
O	earth
O	would
O	do
O	her
O	yet
O	more
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	some
O	vulgar
O	prejudices
O	against
O	the
O	experiment
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	give
O	his
O	consent
O	.
O	Foiled
O	in
O	this
O	,
O	they
O	yet
O	agreed
O	in
O	another
O	recommendation
O	;
O	which
O	,
O	seeing
O	that
O	one
O	imported
O	his
O	opinions
O	from
O	China
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	from
O	Thibet
O	,
O	was
O	very
O	remarkable
O	indeed
O	.
O	They
O	argued
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	water
O	of
O	external
O	origin
O	and
O	application
O	could
O	be
O	so
O	efficacious
O	,
O	water
O	from
O	a
O	deeper
O	source
O	might
O	work
O	a
O	perfect
O	cure
O	;
O	in
O	short
O	,
O	that
O	if
O	the
O	poor
O	afflicted
O	princess
O	could
O	by
O	any
O	means
O	be
O	made
O	to
O	cry
O	,
O	she
O	might
O	recover
O	her
O	lost
O	gravity
O	.
O	But
O	how
O	was
O	this
O	to
O	be
O	brought
O	about
O	?
O	Therein
O	lay
O	all
O	the
O	difficulty
O	--
O	to
O	meet
O	which
O	the
O	philosophers
O	were
O	not
O	wise
O	enough
O	.
O	To
O	make
O	the
O	princess
O	cry
O	was
O	as
O	impossible
O	as
O	to
O	make
O	her
O	weigh
O	.
O	They
O	sent
O	for
O	a
O	professional
O	beggar
O	,
O	commanded
O	him
O	to
O	prepare
O	his
O	most
O	touching
O	oracle
O	of
O	woe
O	,
O	helped
O	him
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	charade
O	box
O	to
O	whatever
O	he
O	wanted
O	for
O	dressing
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	promised
O	great
O	rewards
O	in
O	the
O	event
O	of
O	his
O	success
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	She
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	mendicant
O	artist
O	'
O	s
O	story
O	,
O	and
O	gazed
O	at
O	his
O	marvellous
O	make
O	up
O	,
O	till
O	she
O	could
O	contain
O	herself
O	no
O	longer
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	most
O	undignified
O	contortions
O	for
O	relief
O	,
O	shrieking
O	,
O	positively
O	screeching
O	with
O	laughter
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	little
O	recovered
O	herself
O	,
O	she
O	ordered
O	her
O	attendants
O	to
O	drive
O	him
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	give
O	him
O	a
O	single
O	copper
O	;
O	whereupon
O	his
O	look
O	of
O	mortified
O	discomfiture
O	wrought
O	her
O	punishment
O	and
O	his
O	revenge
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	sent
O	her
O	into
O	violent
O	hysterics
O	,
O	from
O	which
O	she
O	was
O	with
O	difficulty
O	recovered
O	.
O	But
O	so
O	anxious
O	was
O	the
O	king
O	that
O	the
O	suggestion
O	should
O	have
O	a
O	fair
O	trial
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	put
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	rage
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	rushing
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	room
O	,
O	gave
O	her
O	an
O	awful
O	whipping
O	.
O	Yet
O	not
O	a
O	tear
O	would
O	flow
O	.
O	She
O	looked
O	grave
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	laughing
O	sounded
O	uncommonly
O	like
O	screaming
O	--
O	that
O	was
O	all
O	.
O	The
O	good
O	old
O	tyrant
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	best
O	gold
O	spectacles
O	to
O	look
O	,
O	could
O	not
O	discover
O	the
O	smallest
O	cloud
O	in
O	the
O	serene
O	blue
O	of
O	her
O	eyes
O	.
O	It
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	about
O	this
O	time
O	that
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	a
O	king
O	,
O	who
O	lived
O	a
O	thousand
O	miles
O	from
O	Lagobel
O	,
O	set
O	out
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	a
O	queen
O	.
O	He
O	travelled
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	sure
O	as
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	princess
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	some
O	fault
O	with
O	her
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	marry
O	a
O	mere
O	woman
O	,
O	however
O	beautiful
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	princess
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	worthy
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	Whether
O	the
O	prince
O	was
O	so
O	near
O	perfection
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	right
O	to
O	demand
O	perfection
O	itself
O	,
O	I
O	can
O	not
O	pretend
O	to
O	say
O	.
O	All
O	I
O	know
O	is
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	fine
O	,
O	handsome
O	,
O	brave
O	,
O	generous
O	,
O	well-bred
O	,
O	and
O	well-behaved
O	youth
O	,
O	as
O	all
O	princes
O	are
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	wanderings
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	across
O	some
O	reports
O	about
O	our
O	princess
O	;
O	but
O	as
O	everybody
O	said
O	she
O	was
O	bewitched
O	,
O	he
O	never
O	dreamed
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	bewitch
O	him
O	.
O	For
O	what
O	indeed
O	could
O	a
O	prince
O	do
O	with
O	a
O	princess
O	that
O	had
O	lost
O	her
O	gravity
O	?
O	Who
O	could
O	tell
O	what
O	she
O	might
O	not
O	lose
O	next
O	?
O	She
O	might
O	lose
O	her
O	visibility
O	,
O	or
O	her
O	tangibility
O	;
O	or
O	,
O	in
O	short
O	,
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	making
O	impressions
O	upon
O	the
O	radical
O	sensorium
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	never
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	tell
O	whether
O	she
O	was
O	dead
O	or
O	alive
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	he
O	made
O	no
O	further
O	inquiries
O	about
O	her
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	he
O	lost
O	sight
O	of
O	his
O	retinue
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	forest
O	.
O	These
O	forests
O	are
O	very
O	useful
O	in
O	delivering
O	princes
O	from
O	their
O	courtiers
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	sieve
O	that
O	keeps
O	back
O	the
O	bran
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	princes
O	get
O	away
O	to
O	follow
O	their
O	fortunes
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	way
O	they
O	have
O	the
O	advantage
O	of
O	the
O	princesses
O	,
O	who
O	are
O	forced
O	to
O	marry
O	before
O	they
O	have
O	had
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	fun
O	.
O	I
O	wish
O	our
O	princesses
O	got
O	lost
O	in
O	a
O	forest
O	sometimes
O	.
O	One
O	lovely
O	evening
O	,
O	after
O	wandering
O	about
O	for
O	many
O	days
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	approaching
O	the
O	outskirts
O	of
O	this
O	forest
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	trees
O	had
O	got
O	so
O	thin
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	the
O	sunset
O	through
O	them
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	soon
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	heath
O	.
O	Next
O	he
O	came
O	upon
O	signs
O	of
O	human
O	neighbourhood
O	;
O	but
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	it
O	was
O	getting
O	late
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	nobody
O	in
O	the
O	fields
O	to
O	direct
O	him
O	.
O	After
O	travelling
O	for
O	another
O	hour
O	,
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	quite
O	worn
O	out
O	with
O	long
O	labour
O	and
O	lack
O	of
O	food
O	,
O	fell
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	unable
O	to
O	rise
O	again
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	continued
O	his
O	journey
O	on
O	foot
O	.
O	A
O	length
O	he
O	entered
O	another
O	wood
O	--
O	not
O	a
O	wild
O	forest
O	,
O	but
O	a
O	civilised
O	wood
O	,
O	through
O	which
O	a
O	footpath
O	led
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	a
O	lake
O	.
O	Along
O	this
O	path
O	the
O	prince
O	pursued
O	his
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	gathering
O	darkness
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	he
O	paused
O	,
O	and
O	listened
O	.
O	Strange
O	sounds
O	came
O	across
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	the
O	princess
O	laughing
O	.
O	Now
O	there
O	was
O	something
O	odd
O	in
O	her
O	laugh
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	already
O	hinted
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	hatching
O	of
O	a
O	real
O	hearty
O	laugh
O	requires
O	the
O	incubation
O	of
O	gravity
O	;
O	and
O	perhaps
O	this
O	was
O	how
O	the
O	prince
O	mistook
O	the
O	laughter
O	for
O	screaming
O	.
O	Looking
O	over
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	something
O	white
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	an
O	instant
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	torn
O	off
O	his
O	tunic
O	,
O	kicked
O	off
O	his
O	sandals
O	,
O	and
O	plunged
O	in
O	.
O	He
O	soon
O	reached
O	the
O	white
O	object
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	woman
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	not
O	light
O	enough
O	to
O	show
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	princess
O	,
O	but
O	quite
O	enough
O	to
O	show
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	lady
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	does
O	not
O	want
O	much
O	light
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	.
O	Now
O	I
O	can
O	not
O	tell
O	how
O	it
O	came
O	about
O	--
O	whether
O	she
O	pretended
O	to
O	be
O	drowning
O	,
O	or
O	whether
O	he
O	frightened
O	her
O	,
O	or
O	caught
O	her
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	embarrass
O	her
O	--
O	but
O	certainly
O	he
O	brought
O	her
O	to
O	shore
O	in
O	a
O	fashion
O	ignominious
O	to
O	a
O	swimmer
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	nearly
O	drowned
O	than
O	she
O	had
O	ever
O	expected
O	to
O	be
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	water
O	had
O	got
O	into
O	her
O	throat
O	as
O	often
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	tried
O	to
O	speak
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	place
O	to
O	which
O	he
O	bore
O	her
O	,
O	the
O	bank
O	was
O	only
O	a
O	foot
O	or
O	two
O	above
O	the
O	water
O	;
O	so
O	he
O	gave
O	her
O	a
O	strong
O	lift
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	to
O	lay
O	her
O	on
O	the
O	bank
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	her
O	gravitation
O	ceasing
O	the
O	moment
O	she
O	left
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	away
O	she
O	went
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	scolding
O	and
O	screaming
O	.
O	``
O	You
O	naughty
O	,
O	_naughty_
O	,
O	Naughty
O	,
O	NAUGHTY
O	man
O	!
O	``
O	she
O	cried
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	had
O	ever
O	succeeded
O	in
O	putting
O	her
O	into
O	a
O	passion
O	before
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	prince
O	saw
O	her
O	ascend
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	bewitched
O	,
O	and
O	have
O	mistaken
O	a
O	great
O	swan
O	for
O	a
O	lady
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	princess
O	caught
O	hold
O	of
O	the
O	topmost
O	cone
O	upon
O	a
O	lofty
O	fir
O	.
O	This
O	came
O	off
O	;
O	but
O	she
O	caught
O	at
O	another
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	stopped
O	herself
O	by
O	gathering
O	cones
O	,
O	dropping
O	them
O	as
O	the
O	stalks
O	gave
O	way
O	.
O	The
O	prince
O	,
O	meantime
O	,
O	stood
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	staring
O	,
O	and
O	forgetting
O	to
O	get
O	out
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	princess
O	disappearing
O	,
O	he
O	scrambled
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	found
O	her
O	climbing
O	down
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	branches
O	towards
O	the
O	stem
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	the
O	prince
O	continued
O	in
O	some
O	bewilderment
O	as
O	to
O	what

O	phenomenon
O	could
O	be
O	;
O	until

O	reaching
O	the

O	He
O	turned

O	But
O	he

O	So
O	he
O	swam
O	away
O	quietly

O	roving
O	about

O	shore
O	for
O	hours
O	after
O	the

O	in

O	chamber
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	disappeared
O	,
O	he
O	landed
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	his
O	tunic
O	and
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	some
O	trouble
O	,
O	found
O	them
O	again
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	made
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	round
O	the
O	lake
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	.
O	There
O	the
O	wood
O	was
O	wilder
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	shore
O	steeper
O	--
O	rising
O	more
O	immediately
O	towards
O	the
O	mountains
O	which
O	surrounded
O	the
O	lake
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	,
O	and
O	kept
O	sending
O	it
O	messages
O	of
O	silvery
O	streams
O	from
O	morning
O	to
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	night
O	long
O	.
O	He
O	soon
O	found
O	a
O	spot
O	where
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	the
O	green
O	light
O	in
O	the
O	princess
O	'
O	s
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	,
O	even
O	in
O	the
O	broad
O	daylight
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	in
O	no
O	danger
O	of
O	being
O	discovered
O	from
O	the
O	opposite
O	shore
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	cave
O	in
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	provided
O	himself
O	a
O	bed
O	of
O	withered
O	leaves
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	down
O	too
O	tired
O	for
O	hunger
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	awake
O	.
O	All
O	night
O	long
O	he
O	dreamed
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	swimming
O	with
O	the
O	princess
O	.
O	Early
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	the
O	prince
O	set
O	out
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	soon
O	found
O	at
O	a
O	forester
O	'
O	s
O	hut
O	,
O	where
O	for
O	many
O	following
O	days
O	he
O	was
O	supplied
O	with
O	all
O	that
O	a
O	brave
O	prince
O	could
O	consider
O	necessary
O	.
O	And
O	having
O	plenty
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	alive
O	for
O	the
O	present
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	think
O	of
O	wants
O	not
O	yet
O	in
O	existence
O	.
O	Whenever
O	Care
O	intruded
O	,
O	this
O	prince
O	always
O	bowed
O	him
O	out
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	princely
O	manner
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	returned
O	from
O	his
O	breakfast
O	to
O	his
O	watch-cave
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	princess
O	already
O	floating
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	attended
O	by
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	--
O	whom
O	he
O	knew
O	by
O	their
O	crowns
O	--
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	company
O	in
O	lovely
O	little
O	boats
O	,
O	with
O	canopies
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	colours
O	of
O	the
O	rainbow
O	,
O	and
O	flags
O	and
O	streamers
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	more
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	bright
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	prince
O	,
O	burned
O	up
O	with
O	the
O	heat
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	long
O	for
O	the
O	cold
O	water
O	and
O	the
O	cool
O	princess
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	endure
O	till
O	twilight
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	boats
O	had
O	provisions
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	till
O	the
O	sun
O	went
O	down
O	that
O	the
O	gay
O	party
O	began
O	to
O	vanish
O	.
O	Boat
O	after
O	boat
O	drew
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	following
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	,
O	till
O	only
O	one
O	,
O	apparently
O	the
O	princess
O	'
O	s
O	own
O	boat
O	,
O	remained
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	want
O	to
O	go
O	home
O	even
O	yet
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	prince
O	thought
O	he
O	saw
O	her
O	order
O	the
O	boat
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	without
O	her
O	.
O	At
O	all
O	events
O	it
O	rowed
O	away
O	;
O	and
O	now
O	,
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	radiant
O	company
O	,
O	only
O	one
O	white
O	speck
O	remained
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	prince
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	is
O	what
O	he
O	sung
O	:

O	look
O	up
O	through
O	it
O	at
O	the
O	great
O	blot
O	of
O	light
O	close
O	above
O	them
O	,
O	shimmering
O	and
O	trembling
O	and
O	wavering
O	,
O	spreading
O	and
O	contracting
O	,
O	seeming
O	to
O	melt
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	grow
O	solid
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	would
O	shoot
O	up
O	through
O	the
O	blot
O	,
O	and
O	lo
O	!
O	there
O	was
O	the
O	moon
O	,
O	far
O	off
O	,
O	clear
O	and
O	steady
O	and
O	cold
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	lovely
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	a
O	deeper
O	and
O	bluer
O	lake
O	than
O	theirs
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	princess
O	said
O	.
O	The
O	prince
O	soon
O	found
O	out
O	that
O	while
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	very
O	like
O	other
O	people
O	.
O	And
O	besides
O	this
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	forward
O	in
O	her
O	questions
O	or
O	pert
O	in
O	her
O	replies
O	at
O	sea
O	as
O	on
O	shore
O	.
O	Neither
O	did
O	she
O	laugh
O	so
O	much
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	did
O	laugh
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	more
O	gently
O	.
O	She
O	seemed
O	altogether
O	more
O	modest
O	and
O	maidenly
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	than
O	out
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	prince
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	really
O	fallen
O	in
O	love
O	when
O	he
O	fell
O	in
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	talk
O	to
O	her
O	about
O	love
O	,
O	she
O	always
O	turned
O	her
O	head
O	towards
O	him
O	and
O	laughed
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	while
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	look
O	puzzled
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	trying
O	to
O	understand
O	what
O	he
O	meant
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	--
O	revealing
O	a
O	notion
O	that
O	he
O	meant
O	something
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	ever
O	she
O	left
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	altered
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	prince
O	said
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	``
O	If
O	I
O	marry
O	her
O	,
O	I
O	see
O	no
O	help
O	for
O	it
O	:
O	we
O	must
O	turn
O	merman
O	and
O	mermaid
O	,
O	and
O	go
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	``
O	The
O	princess
O	'
O	s
O	pleasure
O	in
O	the
O	lake
O	had
O	grown
O	to
O	a
O	passion
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	could
O	scarcely
O	bear
O	to
O	be
O	out
O	of
O	it
O	for
O	an
O	hour
O	.
O	Imagine
O	then
O	her
O	consternation
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	diving
O	with
O	the
O	prince
O	one
O	night
O	,
O	a
O	sudden
O	suspicion
O	seized
O	her
O	that
O	the
O	lake
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	deep
O	as
O	it
O	used
O	to
O	be
O	.
O	The
O	prince
O	could
O	not
O	imagine
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	.
O	She
O	shot
O	to
O	the
O	surface
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	without
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	swam
O	at
O	full
O	speed
O	towards
O	the
O	higher
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	He
O	followed
O	,
O	begging
O	to
O	know
O	if
O	she
O	was
O	ill
O	,
O	or
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter
O	.
O	She
O	never
O	turned
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	or
O	took
O	the
O	smallest
O	notice
O	of
O	his
O	question
O	.
O	Arrived
O	at
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	she
O	coasted
O	the
O	rocks
O	with
O	minute
O	inspection
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	was
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	a
O	conclusion
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	moon
O	was
O	very
O	small
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	well
O	.
O	She
O	turned
O	therefore
O	and
O	swam
O	home
O	,
O	without
O	saying
O	a
O	word
O	to
O	explain
O	her
O	conduct
O	to
O	the
O	prince
O	,
O	of
O	whose
O	presence
O	she
O	seemed
O	no
O	longer
O	conscious
O	.
O	He
O	withdrew
O	to
O	his
O	cave
O	,
O	in
O	great
O	perplexity
O	and
O	distress
O	.
O	Next
O	day
O	she
O	made
O	many
O	observations
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	alas
O	!
O	strengthened
O	her
O	fears
O	.
O	She
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	banks
O	were
O	too
O	dry
O	;
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	grass
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	trailing
O	plants
O	on
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	were
O	withering
O	away
O	.
O	She
O	caused
O	marks
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	along
O	the
O	borders
O	,
O	and
O	examined
O	them
O	,
O	day
O	after
O	day
O	,
O	in
O	all
O	directions
O	of
O	the
O	wind
O	;
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	horrible
O	idea
O	became
O	a
O	certain
O	fact
O	--
O	that
O	the
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	was
O	slowly
O	sinking
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	princess
O	nearly
O	went
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	mind
O	she
O	had
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	awful
O	to
O	her
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	loved
O	more
O	than
O	any
O	living
O	thing
O	,
O	lie
O	dying
O	before
O	her
O	eyes
O	.
O	It
O	sank
O	away
O	,
O	slowly
O	vanishing
O	.
O	The
O	tops
O	of
O	rocks
O	that
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	seen
O	till
O	now
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	appear
O	far
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	clear
O	water
O	.
O	Before
O	long
O	they
O	were
O	dry
O	in
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	fearful
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	the
O	mud
O	that
O	would
O	soon
O	lie
O	there
O	baking
O	and
O	festering
O	,
O	full
O	of
O	lovely
O	creatures
O	dying
O	,
O	and
O	ugly
O	creatures
O	coming
O	to
O	life
O	,
O	like
O	the
O	unmaking
O	of
O	a
O	world
O	.
O	And
O	how
O	hot
O	the
O	sun
O	would
O	be
O	without
O	any
O	lake
O	!
O	She
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	to
O	swim
O	in
O	it
O	any
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	pine
O	away
O	.
O	Her
O	life
O	seemed
O	bound
O	up
O	with
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	ever
O	as
O	the
O	lake
O	sank
O	,
O	she
O	pined
O	.
O	People
O	said
O	she
O	would
O	not
O	live
O	an
O	hour
O	after
O	the
O	lake
O	was
O	gone
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	never
O	cried
O	.
O	Proclamation
O	was
O	made
O	to
O	all
O	the
O	kingdom
O	,
O	that
O	whosoever
O	should
O	discover
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	'
O	s
O	decrease
O	,
O	would
O	be
O	rewarded
O	after
O	a
O	princely
O	fashion
O	.
O	Hum-Drum
O	and
O	Kopy-Keck
O	applied
O	themselves
O	to
O	their
O	physics
O	and
O	metaphysics
O	;
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	Not
O	even
O	they
O	could
O	suggest
O	a
O	cause
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	fact
O	was
O	that
O	the
O	old
O	princess
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	root
O	of
O	the
O	mischief
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	heard
O	that
O	her
O	niece
O	found
O	more
O	pleasure
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	than
O	any
O	one
O	else
O	had
O	out
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	she
O	went
O	into
O	a
O	rage
O	,
O	and
O	cursed
O	herself
O	for
O	her
O	want
O	of
O	foresight
O	,
O	``
O	But
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	soon
O	set
O	all
O	right
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	shall
O	die
O	of
O	thirst
O	;
O	their
O	brains
O	shall
O	boil
O	and
O	frizzle
O	in
O	their
O	skulls
O	before
O	I
O	will
O	lose
O	my
O	revenge
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	she
O	laughed
O	a
O	ferocious
O	laugh
O	,
O	that
O	made
O	the
O	hairs
O	on
O	the
O	back
O	of
O	her
O	black
O	cat
O	stand
O	erect
O	with
O	terror
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	an
O	old
O	chest
O	in
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	opening
O	it
O	,
O	took
O	out
O	what
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	dried
O	seaweed
O	.
O	This
O	she
O	threw
O	into
O	a
O	tub
O	of
O	water
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	threw
O	some
O	powder
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	stirred
O	it
O	with
O	her
O	bare
O	arm
O	,
O	muttering
O	over
O	it
O	words
O	of
O	hideous
O	sound
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	more
O	hideous
O	import
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	set
O	the
O	tub
O	aside
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	from
O	the
O	chest
O	a
O	huge
O	bunch
O	of
O	a
O	hundred
O	rusty
O	keys
O	,
O	that
O	clattered
O	in
O	her
O	shaking
O	hands
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	sat
O	down
O	and
O	proceeded
O	to
O	oil
O	them
O	all
O	.
O	Before
O	she
O	had
O	finished
O	,
O	out
O	from
O	the
O	tub
O	,
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	which
O	had
O	kept
O	on
O	a
O	slow
O	motion
O	ever
O	since
O	she
O	had
O	ceased
O	stirring
O	it
O	,
O	came
O	the
O	head
O	and
O	half
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	a
O	huge
O	gray
O	snake
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	witch
O	did
O	not
O	look
O	round
O	.
O	It
O	grew
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	tub
O	,
O	waving
O	itself
O	backwards
O	and
O	forwards
O	with
O	a
O	slow
O	horizontal
O	motion
O	,
O	till
O	it
O	reached
O	the
O	princess
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	laid
O	its
O	head
O	upon
O	her
O	shoulder
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	a
O	low
O	hiss
O	in
O	her
O	ear
O	.
O	She
O	started
O	--
O	but
O	with
O	joy
O	;
O	and
O	seeing
O	the
O	head
O	resting
O	on
O	her
O	shoulder
O	,
O	drew
O	it
O	towards
O	her
O	and
O	kissed
O	it
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	drew
O	it
O	all
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	tub
O	,
O	and
O	wound
O	it
O	round
O	her
O	body
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	those
O	dreadful
O	creatures
O	which
O	few
O	have
O	ever
O	beheld
O	--
O	the
O	White
O	Snakes
O	of
O	Darkness
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	took
O	the
O	keys
O	and
O	went
O	down
O	to
O	her
O	cellar
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	unlocked
O	the
O	door
O	she
O	said
O	to
O	herself
O	:
O	``
O	This
O	_is_
O	worth
O	living
O	for
O	!
O	``
O	Locking
O	the
O	door
O	behind
O	her
O	,
O	she
O	descended
O	a
O	few
O	steps
O	into
O	the
O	cellar
O	,
O	and
O	crossing
O	it
O	,
O	unlocked
O	another
O	door
O	into
O	a
O	dark
O	,
O	narrow
O	passage
O	.
O	She
O	locked
O	this
O	also
O	behind
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	descended
O	a
O	few
O	more
O	steps
O	.
O	If
O	any
O	one
O	had
O	followed
O	the
O	witch-princess
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	heard
O	her
O	unlock
O	exactly
O	one
O	hundred
O	doors
O	,
O	and
O	descend
O	a
O	few
O	steps
O	after
O	unlocking
O	each
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	had
O	unlocked
O	the
O	last
O	,
O	she
O	entered
O	a
O	vast
O	cave
O	,
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	supported
O	by
O	huge
O	natural
O	pillars
O	of
O	rock
O	.
O	Now
O	this
O	roof
O	was
O	the
O	under
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	She
O	then
O	untwined
O	the
O	snake
O	from
O	her
O	body
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	it
O	by
O	the
O	tail
O	high
O	above
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	hideous
O	creature
O	stretched
O	up
O	its
O	head
O	towards
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	the
O	cavern
O	,
O	which
O	it
O	was
O	just
O	able
O	to
O	reach
O	.
O	It
O	then
O	began
O	to
O	move
O	its
O	head
O	backwards
O	and
O	forwards
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	slow
O	oscillating
O	motion
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	looking
O	for
O	something
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	same
O	moment
O	the
O	witch
O	began
O	to
O	walk
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	the
O	cavern
O	,
O	coming
O	nearer
O	to
O	the
O	centre
O	every
O	circuit
O	;
O	while
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	snake
O	described
O	the
O	same
O	path
O	over
O	the
O	roof
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	over
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	kept
O	holding
O	it
O	up
O	.
O	And
O	still
O	it
O	kept
O	slowly
O	osculating
O	.
O	Round
O	and
O	round
O	the
O	cavern
O	they
O	went
O	,
O	ever
O	lessening
O	the
O	circuit
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	snake
O	made
O	a
O	sudden
O	dart
O	,
O	and
O	clung
O	to
O	the
O	roof
O	with
O	its
O	mouth
O	.
O	``
O	That
O	'
O	s
O	right
O	,
O	my
O	beauty
O	!
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	princess
O	;
O	``
O	drain
O	it
O	dry
O	.
O	``
O	She
O	let
O	it
O	go
O	,
O	left
O	it
O	hanging
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	black
O	cat
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	followed
O	her
O	all
O	round
O	the
O	cave
O	,
O	by
O	her
O	side
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	knit
O	and
O	mutter
O	awful
O	words
O	.
O	The
O	snake
O	hung
O	like
O	a
O	huge
O	leech
O	,
O	sucking
O	at
O	the
O	stone
O	;
O	the
O	cat
O	stood
O	with
O	his
O	back
O	arched
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	tail
O	like
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	cable
O	,
O	looking
O	up
O	at
O	the
O	snake
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	sat
O	and
O	knitted
O	and
O	muttered
O	.
O	Seven
O	days
O	and
O	seven
O	nights
O	they
O	remained
O	thus
O	;
O	when
O	suddenly
O	the
O	serpent
O	dropped
O	from
O	the
O	roof
O	as
O	if
O	exhausted
O	,
O	and
O	shrivelled
O	up
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	again
O	like
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	dried
O	seaweed
O	.
O	The
O	witch
O	started
O	to
O	her
O	feet
O	,
O	picked
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	put
O	it
O	in
O	her
O	pocket
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	up
O	at
O	the
O	roof
O	.
O	One
O	drop
O	of
O	water
O	was
O	trembling
O	on
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	the
O	snake
O	had
O	been
O	sucking
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	she
O	saw
O	that
O	,
O	she
O	turned
O	and
O	fled
O	,
O	followed
O	by
O	her
O	cat
O	.
O	Shutting
O	the
O	door
O	in
O	a
O	terrible
O	hurry
O	,
O	she
O	locked
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	muttered
O	some
O	frightful
O	words
O	,
O	sped
O	to
O	the
O	next
O	,
O	which
O	also
O	she
O	locked
O	and
O	muttered
O	over
O	;
O	and
O	so
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	hundred
O	doors
O	,
O	till
O	she
O	arrived
O	in
O	her
O	own
O	cellar
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	ready
O	to
O	faint
O	,
O	but
O	listening
O	with
O	malicious
O	delight
O	to
O	the
O	rushing
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	could
O	hear
O	distinctly
O	through
O	all
O	the
O	hundred
O	doors
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	was
O	not
O	enough
O	.
O	Now
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	tasted
O	revenge
O	,
O	she
O	lost
O	her
O	patience
O	.
O	Without
O	further
O	measures
O	,
O	the
O	lake
O	would
O	be
O	too
O	long
O	in
O	disappearing
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	next
O	night
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	last
O	shred
O	of
O	the
O	dying
O	old
O	moon
O	rising
O	,
O	she
O	took
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	in
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	revived
O	the
O	snake
O	,
O	put
O	it
O	in
O	a
O	bottle
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	,
O	accompanied
O	by
O	her
O	cat
O	.
O	Before
O	morning
O	she
O	had
O	made
O	the
O	entire
O	circuit
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	muttering
O	fearful
O	words
O	as
O	she
O	crossed
O	every
O	stream
O	,
O	and
O	casting
O	into
O	it
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	bottle
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	had
O	finished
O	the
O	circuit
O	she
O	muttered
O	yet
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	flung
O	a
O	handful
O	of
O	water
O	towards
O	the
O	moon
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	every
O	spring
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	ceased
O	to
O	throb
O	and
O	bubble
O	,
O	dying
O	away
O	like
O	the
O	pulse
O	of
O	a
O	dying
O	man
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	sound
O	of
O	falling
O	water
O	to
O	be
O	heard
O	along
O	the
O	borders
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	The
O	very
O	courses
O	were
O	dry
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	mountains
O	showed
O	no
O	silvery
O	streaks
O	down
O	their
O	dark
O	sides
O	.
O	And
O	not
O	alone
O	had
O	the
O	fountains
O	of
O	mother
O	Earth
O	ceased
O	to
O	flow
O	;
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	babies
O	throughout
O	the
O	country
O	were
O	crying
O	dreadfully
O	--
O	only
O	without
O	tears
O	.
O	Never
O	since
O	the
O	night
O	when
O	the
O	princess
O	left
O	him
O	so
O	abruptly
O	had
O	the
O	prince
O	had
O	a
O	single
O	interview
O	with
O	her
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	seen
O	her
O	once
O	or
O	twice
O	in
O	the
O	lake
O	;
O	but
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	discover
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	in
O	it
O	any
O	more
O	at
O	night
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	sat
O	and
O	sung
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	in
O	vain
O	for
O	his
O	Nereid
O	,
O	while
O	she
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	true
O	Nereid
O	,
O	was
O	wasting
O	away
O	with
O	her
O	lake
O	,
O	sinking
O	as
O	it
O	sank
O	,
O	withering
O	as
O	it
O	dried
O	.
O	When
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	discovered
O	the
O	change
O	that
O	was
O	taking
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	level
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	great
O	alarm
O	and
O	perplexity
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	whether
O	the
O	lake
O	was
O	dying
O	because
O	the
O	lady
O	had
O	forsaken
O	it
O	;
O	or
O	whether
O	the
O	lady
O	would
O	not
O	come
O	because
O	the
O	lake
O	had
O	begun
O	to
O	sink
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	know
O	so
O	much
O	at
O	least
O	.
O	He
O	disguised
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	going
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	requested
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	lord
O	chamberlain
O	.
O	His
O	appearance
O	at
O	once
O	gained
O	his
O	request
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	lord
O	chamberlain
O	,
O	being
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	some
O	insight
O	,
O	perceived
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	more
O	in
O	the
O	prince
O	'
O	s
O	solicitation
O	than
O	met
O	the
O	ear
O	.
O	He
O	felt
O	likewise
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	could
O	tell
O	whence
O	a
O	solution
O	of
O	the
O	present
O	difficulties
O	might
O	arise
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	granted
O	the
O	prince
O	'
O	s
O	prayer
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	shoeblack
O	to
O	the
O	princess
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	rather
O	cunning
O	in
O	the
O	prince
O	to
O	request
O	such
O	an
O	easy
O	post
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	princess
O	could
O	not
O	possibly
O	soil
O	as
O	many
O	shoes
O	as
O	other
O	princesses
O	.
O	He
O	soon
O	learned
O	all
O	that
O	could
O	be
O	told
O	about
O	the
O	princess
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	nearly
O	distracted
O	;
O	but
O	after
O	roaming
O	about
O	the
O	lake
O	for
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	diving
O	in
O	every
O	depth
O	that
O	remained
O	,
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	was
O	to
O	put
O	an
O	extra
O	polish
O	on
O	the
O	dainty
O	pair
O	of
O	boots
O	that
O	was
O	never
O	called
O	for
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	princess
O	kept
O	her
O	room
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	curtains
O	drawn
O	to
O	shut
O	out
O	the
O	dying
O	lake
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	shut
O	it
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	mind
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	.
O	It
O	haunted
O	her
O	imagination
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	felt
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	lake
O	were
O	her
O	soul
O	,
O	drying
O	up
O	within
O	her
O	,
O	first
O	to
O	mud
O	,
O	then
O	to
O	madness
O	and
O	death
O	.
O	She
O	thus
O	brooded
O	over
O	the
O	change
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	its
O	dreadful
O	accompaniments
O	,
O	till
O	she
O	was
O	nearly
O	distracted
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	prince
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	forgotten
O	him
O	.
O	However
O	much
O	she
O	had
O	enjoyed
O	his
O	company
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	care
O	for
O	him
O	without
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	seemed
O	to
O	have
O	forgotten
O	her
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	too
O	.
O	The
O	lake
O	went
O	on
O	sinking
O	.
O	Small
O	slimy
O	spots
O	began
O	to
O	appear
O	,
O	which
O	glittered
O	steadily
O	amidst
O	the
O	changeful
O	shine
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	These
O	grew
O	to
O	broad
O	patches
O	of
O	mud
O	,
O	which
O	widened
O	and
O	spread
O	,
O	with
O	rocks
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	floundering
O	fishes
O	and
O	crawling
O	eels
O	swarming
O	.
O	The
O	people
O	went
O	everywhere
O	catching
O	these
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	for
O	anything
O	that
O	might
O	have
O	dropped
O	from
O	the
O	royal
O	boats
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	the
O	lake
O	was
O	all
O	but
O	gone
O	,
O	only
O	a
O	few
O	of
O	the
O	deepest
O	pools
O	remaining
O	unexhausted
O	.
O	It
O	happened
O	one
O	day
O	that
O	a
O	party
O	of
O	youngsters
O	found
O	themselves
O	on
O	the
O	brink
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	pools
O	in
O	the
O	very
O	centre
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	rocky
O	basin
O	of
O	considerable
O	depth
O	.
O	Looking
O	in
O	,
O	they
O	saw
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	something
O	that
O	shone
O	yellow
O	in
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	A
O	little
O	boy
O	jumped
O	in
O	and
O	dived
O	for
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	plate
O	of
O	gold
O	covered
O	with
O	writing
O	.
O	They
O	carried
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	On
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	it
O	stood
O	these
O	words
O	:
O	``
O	Death
O	alone
O	from
O	death
O	can
O	save
O	.
O	Love
O	is
O	death
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	is
O	brave
O	.
O	Love
O	can
O	fill
O	the
O	deepest
O	grave
O	.
O	Love
O	loves
O	on
O	beneath
O	the
O	wave
O	.
O	``
O	Now
O	this
O	was
O	enigmatical
O	enough
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	courtiers
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	reverse
O	of
O	the
O	plate
O	explained
O	it
O	a
O	little
O	.
O	Its
O	writing
O	amounted
O	to
O	this
O	:
O	``
O	If
O	the
O	lake
O	should
O	disappear
O	,
O	they
O	must
O	find
O	the
O	hole
O	through
O	which
O	the
O	water
O	ran
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	useless
O	to
O	try
O	to
O	stop
O	it
O	by
O	any
O	ordinary
O	means
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	but
O	one
O	effectual
O	mode
O	.
O	The
O	body
O	of
O	a
O	living
O	man
O	could
O	alone
O	staunch
O	the
O	flow
O	.
O	The
O	man
O	must
O	give
O	himself
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	will
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	lake
O	must
O	take
O	his
O	life
O	as
O	it
O	filled
O	.
O	Otherwise
O	the
O	offering
O	would
O	be
O	of
O	no

O	room
O	for
O	joy
O	.
O	She
O	did
O	not
O	care
O	who
O	the
O	man
O	was
O	;
O	that
O	was
O	nothing
O	to
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	hole
O	wanted
O	stopping
O	;
O	and
O	if
O	only
O	a
O	man
O	would
O	do
O	,
O	why
O	,
O	take
O	one
O	.
O	In
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	two
O	more
O	everything
O	was
O	ready
O	.
O	Her
O	maid
O	dressed
O	her
O	in
O	haste
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	carried
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	saw
O	it
O	she
O	shrieked
O	,
O	and
O	covered
O	her
O	face
O	with
O	her
O	hands
O	.
O	They
O	bore
O	her
O	across
O	to
O	the
O	stone
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	had
O	already
O	placed
O	a
O	little
O	boat
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	water
O	was
O	not
O	deep
O	enough
O	to
O	float
O	in
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	hoped
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	,
O	before
O	long
O	.
O	They
O	laid
O	her
O	on
O	cushions
O	,
O	placed
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	wines
O	and
O	fruits
O	and
O	other
O	nice
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	stretched
O	a
O	canopy
O	over
O	all
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	the
O	prince
O	appeared
O	.
O	The
O	princess
O	recognised
O	him
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	but
O	did
O	not
O	think
O	it
O	worth
O	while
O	to
O	acknowledge
O	him
O	.
O	``
O	Here
O	I
O	am
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	prince
O	.
O	``
O	Put
O	me
O	in
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	They
O	told
O	me
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	shoeblack
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	princess
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	I
O	am
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	prince
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	blacked
O	your
O	little
O	boots
O	three
O	times
O	a

O	they
O	were
O	all

O	``
O	The
O	courtiers
O	did
O	not
O	resent
O	his
O	bluntness
O	,
O	except
O	by
O	saying
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	taking
O	it
O	out
O	in
O	impudence
O	.
O	But
O	how
O	was
O	he
O	to

O	in
O	?
O	The
O	golden
O	plate
O	contained
O	no
O	instructions
O	on
O	this
O	point
O	.
O	The
O	prince
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	hole
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	but
O	one
O	way
O	.
O	He
O	put
O	both
O	his
O	legs
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	sitting
O	on
O	the
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	stooping
O	forward
O	,
O	covered
O	the
O	corner
O	that
O	remained
O	open
O	with
O	his
O	two
O	hands
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	uncomfortable
O	position
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	abide
O	his
O	fate
O	,
O	and
O	turning
O	to
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Now
O	you
O	can
O	go
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	king
O	had
O	already

O	to

O	``

O	repeated
O	the
O	princess
O	after
O	him
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	parrot
O	.
O	The
O	people
O	obeyed
O	her
O	and
O	went
O	.
O	Presently
O	a
O	little
O	wave
O	flowed
O	over
O	the
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	wetted
O	one

O	But
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	mind

O	much

O	He
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	song
O	he
O	sang
O	was

O	the
O	princess
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	silent
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	water
O	grew
O	and
O	grew
O	,
O	and
O	rose
O	up
O	and
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	prince
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	princess
O	sat
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	She
O	fed
O	him
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	.
O	The
O	night
O	wore
O	on
O	.
O	The
O	waters
O	rose
O	and
O	rose
O	.
O	The
O	moon
O	rose
O	likewise
O	higher
O	and
O	higher
O	,
O	and
O	shone
O	full
O	on
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	dying
O	prince
O	.
O	The
O	water
O	was
O	up
O	to
O	his
O	neck
O	.
O	``
O	Will
O	you
O	kiss
O	me
O	,
O	princess
O	?
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	feebly
O	.
O	The
O	nonchalance
O	was
O	all
O	gone
O	now
O	.
O	``
O	Yes
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	the
O	princess
O	,
O	and
O	kissed
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	long
O	,
O	sweet
O	,
O	cold
O	kiss
O	.
O	``
O	Now
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	sigh
O	of
O	content
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	die
O	happy
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	speak
O	again
O	.
O	The
O	princess
O	gave
O	him
O	some
O	wine
O	for
O	the
O	last
O	time
O	:
O	he
O	was
O	past
O	eating
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	sat
O	down
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	water
O	rose
O	and
O	rose
O	.
O	It
O	touched
O	his
O	chin
O	.
O	It
O	touched
O	his
O	lower
O	lip
O	.
O	It
O	touched
O	between
O	his
O	lips
O	.
O	He
O	shut
O	them
O	hard
O	to
O	keep
O	it
O	out
O	.
O	The
O	princess
O	began
O	to
O	feel
O	strange
O	.
O	It
O	touched
O	his
O	upper
O	lip
O	.
O	He
O	breathed
O	through
O	his
O	nostrils
O	.
O	The
O	princess
O	looked
O	wild
O	.
O	It
O	covered
O	his
O	nostrils
O	.
O	Her
O	eyes
O	looked
O	scared
O	,
O	and
O	shone
O	strange
O	in
O	the
O	moonlight
O	.
O	His
O	head
O	fell
O	back
O	;
O	the
O	water
O	closed
O	over
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bubbles
O	of
O	his
O	last
O	breath
O	bubbled
O	up
O	through
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	The
O	princess
O	gave
O	a
O	shriek
O	,
O	and
O	sprang
O	into
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	She
O	laid
O	hold
O	first
O	of
O	one
O	leg
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	pulled
O	and
O	tugged
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	move
O	either
O	.
O	She
O	stopped
O	to
O	take
O	breath
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	made
O	her
O	think
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	any
O	breath
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	frantic
O	.
O	She
O	got
O	hold
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	his
O	head
O	above
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	possible
O	now
O	his
O	hands
O	were
O	no
O	longer
O	on
O	the
O	hole
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	of
O	no
O	use
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	past
O	breathing
O	.
O	Love
O	and
O	water
O	brought
O	back
O	all
O	her
O	strength
O	.
O	She
O	got
O	under
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	pulled
O	and
O	pulled
O	with
O	her
O	whole
O	might
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	got
O	one
O	leg
O	out
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	easily
O	followed
O	.
O	How
O	she
O	got
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	she
O	never
O	could
O	tell
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	she
O	did
O	,
O	she
O	fainted
O	away
O	.
O	Coming
O	to
O	herself
O	,
O	she
O	seized
O	the
O	oars
O	,
O	kept
O	herself
O	steady
O	as
O	best
O	she
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	rowed
O	and
O	rowed
O	,
O	though
O	she
O	had
O	never
O	rowed
O	before
O	.
O	Round
O	rocks
O	,
O	and
O	over
O	shallows
O	,
O	and
O	through
O	mud
O	she
O	rowed
O	,
O	till
O	she
O	got
O	to
O	the
O	landing-stairs
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	her
O	people
O	were
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	had
O	heard
O	her
O	shriek
O	.
O	She
O	made
O	them
O	carry
O	the
O	prince
O	to
O	her
O	own
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	him
O	in
O	her
O	bed
O	,
O	and
O	light
O	a
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	send
O	for
O	the
O	doctors
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	your
O	highness
O	!
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	chamberlain
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	roused
O	by
O	the
O	noise
O	,
O	came
O	in
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	nightcap
O	.
O	``
O	Go
O	and
O	drown
O	yourself
O	in
O	it
O	!
O	``
O	she
O	said
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	the
O	last
O	rudeness
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	ever
O	guilty
O	;
O	and
O	one
O	must
O	allow
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	good
O	cause
O	to
O	feel
O	provoked
O	with
O	the
O	lord
O	chamberlain
O	.
O	Had
O	it
O	been
O	the
O	king
O	himself
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	fared
O	no
O	better
O	.
O	But
O	both
O	he
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	were
O	fast
O	asleep
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	chamberlain
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	bed
O	.
O	Somehow
O	,
O	the
O	doctors
O	never
O	came
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	princess
O	and
O	her
O	old
O	nurse
O	were
O	left
O	with
O	the
O	prince
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	old
O	nurse
O	was
O	a
O	wise
O	woman
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	They
O	tried
O	everything
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	without
O	success
O	.
O	The
O	princess
O	was
O	nearly
O	distracted
O	between
O	hope
O	and
O	fear
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	tried
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	,
O	one
O	thing
O	after
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	everything
O	over
O	and
O	over
O	again
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	all
O	but
O	given
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	sun
O	rose
O	,
O	the
O	prince
O	opened
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	The
O	princess
O	burst
O	into
O	a
O	passion
O	of
O	tears
O	and
O	_fell_
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	.
O	There
O	she
O	lay
O	for
O	an
O	hour
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	tears
O	never
O	ceased
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	pent-up
O	crying
O	of
O	her
O	life
O	was
O	spent
O	now
O	.
O	And
O	a
O	rain
O	came
O	on
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	seen
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	.
O	The
O	sun
O	shone
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	great
O	drops
O	,
O	which
O	fell
O	straight
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	shone
O	likewise
O	.
O	The
O	palace
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	a
O	rainbow
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	rain
O	of
O	rubies
O	,
O	and
O	sapphires
O	,
O	and
O	emeralds
O	,
O	and
O	topazes
O	.
O	The
O	torrents
O	poured
O	from
O	the
O	mountains
O	like
O	molten
O	gold
O	;
O	and
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	for
O	its
O	subterraneous
O	outlet
O	,
O	the
O	lake
O	would
O	have
O	overflowed
O	and
O	inundated
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	full
O	from
O	shore
O	to
O	shore
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	princess
O	did
O	not
O	heed
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	She
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	and
O	wept
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	rain
O	within
O	doors
O	was
O	far
O	more
O	wonderful
O	than
O	the
O	rain
O	out
O	of
O	doors
O	.
O	For
O	when
O	it
O	abated
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	proceeded
O	to
O	rise
O	,
O	she
O	found
O	,
O	to
O	her
O	astonishment
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	after
O	many
O	efforts
O	,
O	she
O	succeeded
O	in
O	getting
O	upon
O	her
O	feet
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	tumbled
O	down
O	again
O	directly
O	.
O	Hearing
O	her
O	fall
O	,
O	her
O	old
O	nurse
O	uttered
O	a
O	yell
O	of
O	delight
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	screaming
O	:
O	``
O	My
O	darling
O	child
O	!
O	she
O	'
O	s
O	found
O	her
O	gravity
O	!
O	``
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	that

O	it
O	!

O	``
O	said
O	the
O	princess
O	,
O	rubbing
O	her
O	shoulder
O	and
O	her
O	knee
O	alternately
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	consider
O	it
O	very
O	unpleasant
O	.
O	I
O	feel

O	should
O	be
O	crushed
O	to
O	pieces
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Hurrah
O	!
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	prince
O	from
O	the
O	bed
O	.
O	``
O	If

O	s
O	the
O	lake
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	Brimful
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	the
O	nurse
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	we
O	'
O	re
O	all
O	happy
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	That
O	we
O	are
O	indeed
O	!
O	``
O	answered
O	the
O	princess
O	,
O	sobbing
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	was
O	rejoicing
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	country
O	that
O	rainy
O	day
O	.
O	Even
O	the
O	babies
O	forgot
O	their
O	past
O	troubles
O	,
O	and
O	danced
O	and
O	crowed
O	amazingly
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	told
O	stories
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	listened
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	divided
O	the
O	money
O	in
O	his
O	box
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	the
O	honey
O	in
O	her
O	pot
O	,
O	among
O	all
O	the
O	children
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	was
O	such
O	jubilation
O	as
O	was
O	never
O	heard
O	of
O	before
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	the
O	prince
O	and
O	princess
O	were
O	betrothed
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	princess
O	had
O	to
O	learn
O	to
O	walk
O	,
O	before
O	they
O	could
O	be
O	married
O	with
O	any
O	propriety
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	easy
O	at
O	her
O	time
O	of
O	life
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	could
O	walk
O	no
O	more
O	than
O	a

O	She

O	.
O	``

O	gravity
O	more
O	than
O	once
O	after
O	this
O	,
O	notwithstanding
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	before
O	she
O	got
O	reconciled
O	to
O	walking
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	pain
O	of
O	learning
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	counterbalanced
O	by
O	two
O	things
O	,
O	either
O	of
O	which
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	sufficient
O	consolation
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	prince
O	himself
O	was
O	her
O	teacher
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	second
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	tumble
O	into
O	the
O	lake
O	as
O	often
O	as
O	she
O	pleased
O	.
O	Still
O	,
O	she
O	preferred
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	prince
O	jump
O	in
O	with
O	her
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	splash
O	they
O	made
O	before
O	was
O	nothing
O	to
O	the
O	splash
O	they
O	made
O	now
O	.
O	The
O	lake
O	never
O	sank
O	again
O	.
O	In
O	process
O	of
O	time
O	it
O	wore
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	the
O	cavern
O	quite
O	through
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	twice
O	as
O	deep
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	The
O	only
O	revenge
O	the
O	princess
O	took
O	upon
O	her
O	aunt
O	was
O	to
O	tread
O	pretty
O	hard
O	on
O	her
O	gouty
O	toe
O	the
O	next
O	time
O	she
O	saw
O	her
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	was
O	sorry
O	for
O	it
O	the
O	very
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	heard
O	that
O	the
O	water
O	had
O	undermined
O	her
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	fallen
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	burying
O	her
O	in
O	its
O	ruins
O	;
O	whence
O	no
O	one
O	ever
O	ventured
O	to
O	dig
O	up
O	her
O	body
O	.
O	There
O	she
O	lies
O	to
O	this
O	day
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	prince
O	and
O	princess
O	lived
O	and
O	were
O	happy
O	;
O	and
O	had
O	crowns
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	and
O	clothes
O	of
O	cloth
O	,
O	and
O	shoes
O	of
O	leather
O	,
O	and
O	children
O	of
O	boys
O	and
O	girls
O	,
O	not
O	one
O	of
O	whom
O	was
O	ever
O	known
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	most
O	critical
O	occasion
O	,
O	to
O	lose
O	the
O	smallest
O	atom
O	of
O	his
O	or
O	her
O	due
O	proportion
O	of
O	gravity
O	.
