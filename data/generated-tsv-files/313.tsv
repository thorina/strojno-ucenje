O	THERE
O	AMONG
O	THE
O	HEATHER
O	NOT
O	long
O	after
O	Callum
O	Beg
O	had
O	been
O	left
O	behind
O	,
O	and
O	indeed
O	almost
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	innkeeper
O	and
O	Edward
O	were
O	fairly
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	,
O	the
O	former
O	suddenly
O	announced
O	that
O	his
O	horse
O	had
O	fallen
O	lame
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	must
O	turn
O	aside
O	to
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	smithy
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	matter
O	attended
O	to
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	as
O	it
O	is
O	the
O	Fast
O	Day
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	smith
O	a
O	religious
O	man
O	,
O	it
O	may
O	cost
O	your
O	Honour
O	as
O	muckle
O	as
O	sixpence
O	a
O	shoe
O	!
O	``
O	suggested
O	the
O	wily
O	innkeeper
O	,
O	watching
O	Edward
O	'
O	s
O	face
O	as
O	he
O	spoke
O	.
O	For
O	this
O	announcement
O	Edward
O	cared
O	nothing
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	gladly
O	have
O	paid
O	a
O	shilling
O	a
O	nail
O	to
O	be
O	allowed
O	to
O	push
O	forward
O	on
O	his
O	journey
O	with
O	all
O	speed
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	to
O	the
O	smithy
O	of
O	Cairnvreckan
O	they
O	went
O	.
O	The
O	village
O	was
O	in
O	an
O	uproar
O	.
O	The
O	smith
O	,
O	a
O	fierce-looking
O	man
O	,
O	was
O	busy
O	hammering
O	``
O	dogs
O	'
O	heads
O	``
O	for
O	musket-locks
O	,
O	while
O	among
O	the
O	surrounding
O	crowd
O	the
O	names
O	of
O	great
O	Highland
O	chiefs
O	--
O	Clanronald
O	,
O	Glengarry
O	,
O	Lochiel
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	of
O	Vich
O	Ian
O	Vohr
O	himself
O	,
O	were
O	being
O	bandied
O	from
O	mouth
O	to
O	mouth
O	.
O	Edward
O	soon
O	found
O	himself
O	surrounded
O	by
O	an
O	excited
O	mob
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	smith
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	,
O	a
O	wild
O	witchlike
O	woman
O	,
O	was
O	dancing
O	,
O	every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	casting
O	her
O	child
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	as
O	high
O	as
O	her
O	arms
O	would
O	reach
O	,
O	singing
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	,
O	and
O	trying
O	to
O	anger
O	the
O	crowd
O	,
O	and
O	especially
O	to
O	infuriate
O	her
O	husband
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	Jacobite
O	songs
O	which
O	she
O	chanted
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	smith
O	could
O	stand
O	this
O	provocation
O	no
O	longer
O	.
O	He
O	snatched
O	a
O	red-hot
O	bar
O	of
O	iron
O	from
O	the
O	forge
O	,
O	and
O	rushed
O	at
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	crying
O	out
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	``
O	thrust
O	it
O	down
O	her
O	throat
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	,
O	finding
O	himself
O	held
O	back
O	by
O	the
O	crowd
O	from
O	executing
O	vengeance
O	on
O	the
O	woman
O	,
O	all
O	his
O	anger
O	turned
O	upon
O	Edward
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	took
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	Jacobite
O	emissary
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	news
O	which
O	had
O	caused
O	all
O	this
O	stir
O	was
O	that
O	Prince
O	Charles
O	had
O	landed
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	whole
O	Highlands
O	was
O	rallying
O	to
O	his
O	banner
O	.
O	So
O	fierce
O	and
O	determined
O	was
O	the
O	attack
O	which
O	the
O	angry
O	smith
O	of
O	Cairnvreckan
O	made
O	on
O	Edward
O	that
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	was
O	compelled
O	to
O	draw
O	his
O	pistol
O	in
O	self-defence
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	the
O	crowd
O	threatened
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	smith
O	continued
O	furiously
O	to
O	attack
O	with
O	the
O	red-hot
O	iron
O	,
O	almost
O	unconsciously
O	his
O	finger
O	pressed
O	the
O	trigger
O	.
O	The
O	shot
O	went
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	the
O	smith
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Then
O	Edward
O	,
O	borne
O	down
O	by
O	the
O	mob
O	,
O	was
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	great
O	danger
O	of
O	his
O	life
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	saved
O	at
O	last
O	by
O	the
O	interference
O	of
O	the
O	minister
O	of
O	the
O	parish
O	,
O	a
O	kind
O	and
O	gentle
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	caused
O	Edward
O	'
O	s
O	captors
O	to
O	treat
O	him
O	more
O	tenderly
O	.
O	So
O	that
O	instead
O	of
O	executing
O	vengeance
O	upon
O	the
O	spot
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	proposed
O	,
O	they
O	brought
O	him
O	before
O	the
O	nearest
O	magistrate
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	an
O	old
O	military
O	officer
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	addition
O	,
O	the
O	Laird
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	of
O	Cairnvreckan
O	,
O	one
O	Major
O	Melville
O	by
O	name
O	.
O	The
O	latter
O	proved
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	stern
O	soldier
O	,
O	so
O	severe
O	in
O	manner
O	that
O	he
O	often
O	became
O	unintentionally
O	unjust
O	.
O	Major
O	Melville
O	found
O	that
O	though
O	the
O	blacksmith
O	'
O	s
O	wound
O	proved
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	mere
O	scratch
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	own
O	that
O	the
O	provocation
O	given
O	was
O	a
O	sufficient
O	excuse
O	for
O	Edward
O	'
O	s
O	hasty
O	action
O	,
O	yet
O	he
O	must
O	detain
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	prisoner
O	upon
O	the
O	warrant
O	issued
O	against
O	Edward
O	Waverley
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	out
O	by
O	the
O	Supreme
O	Court
O	of
O	Scotland
O	.
O	Edward
O	,
O	who
O	at
O	once
O	owned
O	to
O	his
O	name
O	,
O	was
O	astonished
O	beyond
O	words
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	not
O	only
O	was
O	he
O	charged
O	with
O	being
O	in
O	the
O	company
O	of
O	actual
O	rebels
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	the
O	Baron
O	of
O	Bradwardine
O	and
O	Vich
O	Ian
O	Vohr
O	,
O	but
O	also
O	with
O	trying
O	to
O	induce
O	his
O	troop
O	of
O	horse
O	to
O	revolt
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	private
O	letters
O	addressed
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	Sergeant
O	Houghton
O	,
O	in
O	their
O	barracks
O	at
O	Dundee
O	.
O	Captain
O	Waverley
O	was
O	asserted
O	to
O	have
O	effected
O	this
O	through
O	the
O	medium
O	of
O	a
O	pedlar
O	named
O	Will
O	Ruthven
O	,
O	or
O	Wily
O	Will
O	--
O	whose
O	very
O	name
O	Edward
O	had
O	never
O	heard
O	up
O	to
O	that
O	moment
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	magistrate
O	'
O	s
O	examination
O	proceeded
O	,
O	Waverley
O	was
O	astonished
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	clearing
O	himself
O	,
O	everything
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	every
O	article
O	he
O	carried
O	about
O	his
O	person
O	,
O	was
O	set
O	down
O	by
O	Major
O	Melville
O	as
O	an
O	additional
O	proof
O	of
O	his
O	complicity
O	with
O	treason
O	.
O	Among
O	these
O	figured
O	Flora
O	'
O	s
O	verses
O	,
O	his
O	own
O	presence
O	at
O	the
O	great
O	hunting
O	match
O	among
O	the
O	mountains
O	,
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	and
O	Sir
O	Everard
O	'
O	s
O	letters
O	,
O	even
O	the
O	huge
O	manuscripts
O	written
O	by
O	his
O	tutor
O	(
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	read
O	six
O	pages
O	)
O	--
O	all
O	were
O	brought
O	forward
O	as
O	so
O	many
O	evidences
O	of
O	his
O	guilt
O	.
O	Finally
O	,
O	the
O	magistrate
O	informed
O	Edward
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	compelled
O	to
O	detain
O	him
O	a
O	prisoner
O	in
O	his
O	house
O	of
O	Cairnvreckan
O	.
O	But
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	furnish
O	such
O	information
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	doubtless
O	in
O	his
O	power
O	to
O	give
O	concerning
O	the
O	forces
O	and
O	plans
O	of
O	Vich
O	Ian
O	Vohr
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	Highland
O	chiefs
O	,
O	he
O	might
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	brief
O	detention
O	,
O	be
O	allowed
O	to
O	go
O	free
O	.
O	Edward
O	fiercely
O	exclaimed
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	die
O	rather
O	than
O	turn
O	informer
O	against
O	those
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	his
O	friends
O	and
O	hosts
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	,
O	having
O	refused
O	all
O	hospitality
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	conducted
O	to
O	a
O	small
O	room
O	,
O	there
O	to
O	be
O	guarded
O	till
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	chance
O	of
O	sending
O	him
O	under
O	escort
O	to
O	the
O	Castle
O	of
O	Stirling
O	.
O	Here
O	he
O	was
O	visited
O	by
O	Mr
O	.
O	Morton
O	,
O	the
O	minister
O	who
O	had
O	saved
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	clutches
O	of
O	the
O	mob
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	sympathetically
O	and
O	kindly
O	did
O	he
O	speak
O	,
O	that
O	Edward
O	told
O	him
O	his
O	whole
O	story
O	from
O	the
O	moment
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	first
O	left
O	Waverley-Honour
O	.
O	And
O	though
O	the
O	minister
O	'
O	s
O	favourable
O	report
O	did
O	not
O	alter
O	the
O	opinion
O	Major
O	Melville
O	had
O	formed
O	of
O	Edward
O	'
O	s
O	treason
O	,
O	it
O	softened
O	his
O	feelings
O	toward
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	invited
O	him
O	to
O	dinner
O	,
O	and
O	afterwards
O	did
O	his
O	best
O	to
O	procure
O	him
O	favourable
O	treatment
O	from
O	the
O	Westland
O	Whig
O	captain
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	Gifted
O	Gilfillan
O	,
O	who
O	commanded
O	the
O	party
O	which
O	was
O	to
O	convoy
O	him
O	to
O	Stirling
O	Castle
O	.
O	The
O	escort
O	which
O	was
O	to
O	take
O	Edward
O	southward
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	strong
O	as
O	it
O	might
O	have
O	been
O	.
O	Part
O	of
O	Captain
O	Gifted
O	Gilfillan
O	'
O	s
O	command
O	had
O	stayed
O	behind
O	to
O	hear
O	a
O	favourite
O	preacher
O	upon
O	the
O	occasion
O	of
O	the
O	afternoon
O	Fast
O	Day
O	service
O	at
O	Cairnvreckan
O	.
O	Others
O	straggled
O	for
O	purposes
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	,
O	while
O	as
O	they
O	went
O	along
O	,
O	their
O	leader
O	lectured
O	Edward
O	upon
O	the
O	fewness
O	of
O	those
O	that
O	should
O	be
O	saved
O	.
O	Heaven
O	,
O	he
O	informed
O	Edward
O	,
O	would
O	be
O	peopled
O	exclusively
O	by
O	the
O	members
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	denomination
O	.
O	Captain
O	Gifted
O	was
O	still
O	engaged
O	in
O	condemning
O	all
O	and
O	sundry
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
O	Churches
O	of
O	England
O	and
O	Scotland
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	stray
O	pedlar
O	joined
O	his
O	party
O	and
O	asked
O	of
O	``
O	his
O	Honour
O	``
O	the
O	favour
O	of
O	his
O	protection
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	Stirling
O	,
O	urging
O	as
O	a
O	reason
O	the
O	uncertainty
O	of
O	the
O	times
O	and
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	the
O	property
O	he
O	carried
O	in
O	his
O	pack
O	.
O	The
O	pedlar
O	,
O	by
O	agreeing
O	with
O	all
O	that
O	was
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	desiring
O	further
O	information
O	upon
O	spiritual
O	matters
O	,
O	soon
O	took
O	the
O	attention
O	of
O	Captain
O	Gifted
O	Gilfillan
O	from
O	his
O	prisoner
O	.
O	He
O	declared
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	even
O	visited
O	,
O	near
O	Mauchline
O	,
O	the
O	very
O	farm
O	of
O	the
O	Whig
O	leader
O	.
O	He
O	congratulated
O	him
O	upon
O	the
O	fine
O	breed
O	of
O	cattle
O	he
O	possessed
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	to
O	speak
O	of
O	the
O	many
O	evil
O	,
O	popish
O	,
O	and
O	unchristian
O	things
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	in
O	his
O	travels
O	as
O	a
O	pedlar
O	over
O	the
O	benighted
O	countries
O	of
O	Europe
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	Gifted
O	Gilfillan
O	became
O	so
O	pleased
O	with
O	his
O	companion
O	and
O	so
O	enraptured
O	with
O	his
O	subject
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	allowed
O	his
O	party
O	to
O	string
O	itself
O	out
O	along
O	the
O	route
O	without
O	an
O	attempt
O	at
O	discipline
O	,
O	or
O	even
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	supporting
O	each
O	other
O	in
O	case
O	of
O	attack
O	.
O	The
O	leaders
O	were
O	ascending
O	a
O	little
O	hill
O	covered
O	with
O	whin
O	bushes
O	and
O	crowned
O	with
O	low
O	brushwood
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	after
O	looking
O	about
O	him
O	quickly
O	to
O	note
O	some
O	landmarks
O	,
O	the
O	pedlar
O	put
O	his
O	fingers
O	to
O	his
O	mouth
O	and
O	whistled
O	.
O	He
O	explained
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	whistling
O	on
O	a
O	favourite
O	dog
O	,
O	named
O	Bawty
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	lost
O	.
O	The
O	Covenanter
O	reproved
O	him
O	severely
O	for
O	thinking
O	of
O	a
O	useless
O	dog
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	such
O	precious
O	and
O	improving
O	conversation
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	holding
O	together
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	his
O	protests
O	the
O	pedlar
O	persisted
O	in
O	his
O	whistling
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	copse
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	path
O	,
O	six
O	or
O	eight
O	stout
O	Highlanders
O	sprang
O	upon
O	them
O	brandishing
O	their
O	claymores
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	Sword
O	of
O	the
O	Lord
O	and
O	of
O	Gideon
O	!
O	``
O	shouted
O	Gifted
O	Gilfillan
O	,
O	nothing
O	daunted
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	was
O	proceeding
O	to
O	lay
O	about
O	him
O	stoutly
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	pedlar
O	,
O	snatching
O	a
O	musket
O	,
O	felled
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	with
O	the
O	butt
O	.
O	The
O	scattered
O	Whig
O	party
O	hurried
O	up
O	to
O	support
O	their
O	leader
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	scuffle
O	,
O	Edward
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	was
O	shot
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	himself
O	somewhat
O	bruised
O	in
O	falling
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	Highlanders
O	took
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	half-supported
O	,
O	half-carried
O	him
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	highroad
O	,
O	leaving
O	the
O	unconscious
O	Gifted
O	still
O	stretched
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	The
O	Westlanders
O	,
O	thus
O	deprived
O	of
O	a
O	leader
O	,
O	did
O	not
O	even
O	attempt
O	a
O	pursuit
O	,
O	but
O	contented
O	themselves
O	with
O	sending
O	a
O	few
O	dropping
O	shots
O	after
O	the
O	Highlanders
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	did
O	nobody
O	any
O	harm
O	.
O	They
O	carried
O	Edward
O	fully
O	two
O	miles
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	till
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	deep
O	covert
O	of
O	a
O	distant
O	glen
O	that
O	they
O	stopped
O	with
O	their
O	burden
O	.
O	Edward
O	spoke
O	to
O	them
O	repeatedly
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	only
O	answer
O	he
O	got
O	was
O	that
O	they
O	``
O	had
O	no
O	English
O	.
O	``
O	Even
O	the
O	mention
O	of
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Vich
O	Ian
O	Vohr
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	hitherto
O	regarded
O	as
O	a
O	talisman
O	,
O	produced
O	no
O	response
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	Edward
O	could
O	see
O	from
O	the
O	tartans
O	of
O	his
O	captors
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	of
O	the
O	Clan
O	Ivor
O	.
O	Nor
O	did
O	the
O	hut
O	,
O	into

O	they
O	presently
O	conveyed
O	our
O	hero
O	,
O	reveal
O	any
O	more
O	.
O	Edward
O	was
O	placed
O	in
O	a
O	large
O	bed
O	,
O	planked
O	all
O	round
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	his
O	bruises
O	were
O	attended
O	to
O	by
O	an
O	old
O	woman
O	,
O	the
O	sliding
O	panel
O	was
O	shut
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	A
O	kind
O	of
O	fever
O	set
O	his
O	ideas
O	wandering
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	he
O	fancied
O	that
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	Flora
O	Mac-Ivor
O	speaking
O	in
O	the
O	hut
O	without
O	.
O	He
O	tried
O	to
O	push
O	back
O	the
O	panel
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	inmates
O	had
O	secured
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	outside
O	with
O	a
O	large
O	nail
O	.
O	Waverley
O	remained
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	these
O	narrow
O	quarters
O	,
O	ministered
O	to
O	by
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	and
O	at
O	intervals
O	hearing
O	the
O	same
O	gentle
O	girlish
O	voice
O	speaking
O	outside
O	,
O	without
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	ever
O	being
O	able
O	to
O	see
O	its
O	owner
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	after
O	several
O	days
O	,
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	Highlanders
O	who
O	had
O	first
O	captured
O	him
O	returned
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	signs
O	informed
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	get
O	ready
O	to
O	follow
O	them
O	immediately
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	news
O	Edward
O	,
O	thoroughly
O	tired
O	of
O	his
O	confinement
O	,
O	rejoiced
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	upon
O	rising
O	,
O	found
O	himself
O	sufficiently
O	well
O	to
O	travel
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	seated
O	in
O	the
O	smoky
O	cottage
O	quietly
O	waiting
O	the
O	signal
O	for
O	departure
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	felt
O	a
O	touch
O	on
O	his
O	arm
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	turning
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	face
O	to
O	face
O	with
O	Alice
O	,
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	Donald
O	Bean
O	Lean
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	quick
O	movement
O	she
O	showed
O	him
O	the
O	edges
O	of
O	a
O	bundle
O	of
O	papers
O	which
O	she
O	as
O	swiftly
O	concealed
O	.
O	She
O	then
O	laid
O	her
O	finger
O	on
O	her
O	lips
O	,
O	and
O	glided
O	away
O	to
O	assist
O	old
O	Janet
O	,
O	his
O	nurse
O	,
O	in
O	packing
O	his
O	saddle-bags
O	.
O	With
O	the
O	tail
O	of
O	his
O	eye
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	Edward
O	saw
O	the
O	girl
O	fold
O	the
O	papers
O	among
O	his
O	linen
O	without
O	being
O	observed
O	by
O	the
O	others
O	.
O	This
O	being
O	done
O	,
O	she
O	took
O	no
O	further
O	notice
O	of
O	him
O	whatever
O	,
O	except
O	that
O	just
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	leaving
O	the
O	cottage
O	,
O	she
O	turned
O	round
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	smile
O	and
O	nod
O	of
O	farewell
O	.
O	The
O	tall
O	Highlander
O	who
O	was
O	to
O	lead
O	the
O	party
O	now
O	made
O	Edward
O	understand
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	considerable
O	danger
O	on
O	the
O	way
O	.
O	He
O	must
O	follow
O	without
O	noise
O	,
O	and
O	do
O	exactly
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	bidden
O	.
O	A
O	steel
O	pistol
O	and
O	a
O	broadsword
O	were
O	given
O	him
O	for
O	use
O	in
O	case
O	of
O	attack
O	.
O	The
O	party
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	long
O	upon
O	its
O	night
O	journeying
O	,
O	moving
O	silently
O	along
O	through
O	the
O	woods
O	and
O	copses
O	in
O	Indian
O	file
O	,
O	before
O	Edward
O	found
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	good
O	reason
O	for
O	this
O	precaution
O	.
O	At
O	no
O	great
O	distance
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	cry
O	of
O	an
O	English
O	sentinel
O	,
O	``
O	All
O	'
O	s
O	well
O	!
O	``
O	Again
O	and
O	again
O	the
O	cry
O	was
O	taken
O	up
O	by
O	other
O	sentries
O	till
O	the
O	sound
O	was
O	lost
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	.
O	The
O	enemy
O	was
O	very
O	near
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	trained
O	senses
O	of
O	the
O	Highlanders
O	in
O	their
O	own
O	rugged
O	country
O	were
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	match
O	for
O	the
O	discipline
O	of
O	the
O	regulars
O	.
O	A
O	little
O	farther
O	on
O	they
O	passed
O	a
O	large
O	building
O	,
O	with
O	lights
O	still
O	twinkling
O	in
O	the
O	windows
O	.
O	Presently
O	the
O	tall
O	Highlander
O	stood
O	up
O	and
O	sniffed
O	.
O	Then
O	motioning
O	Waverley
O	to
O	do
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	crawl
O	on
O	all
O	fours
O	toward
O	a
O	low
O	and
O	ruinous
O	sheep-fold
O	.
O	With
O	some
O	difficulty
O	Edward
O	obeyed
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	care
O	was
O	the
O	stalk
O	conducted
O	,
O	that
O	presently
O	,
O	looking
O	over
O	a
O	stone
O	wall
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	an
O	outpost
O	of
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	soldiers
O	lying
O	round
O	their
O	camp-fire
O	,
O	while
O	in
O	front
O	a
O	sentinel
O	paced
O	backward
O	and
O	forward
O	,
O	regarding
O	the
O	heavens
O	and
O	whistling
O	_Nancy
O	Dawson_
O	as
O	placidly
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	a
O	hundred
O	miles
O	from
O	any
O	wild
O	rebel
O	Highlandmen
O	.
O	At
O	that
O	moment
O	the
O	moon
O	,
O	which
O	up
O	to
O	this
O	time
O	had
O	been
O	hidden
O	behind
O	clouds
O	,
O	shone
O	out
O	clear
O	and
O	bright
O	.
O	So
O	Edward
O	and
O	his
O	Highland
O	guide
O	had
O	perforce
O	to
O	remain
O	where
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	stuck
O	up
O	against
O	the
O	dike
O	,
O	not
O	daring
O	to
O	continue
O	their
O	journey
O	in
O	the
O	full
O	glare
O	of
O	light
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	Highlander
O	muttered
O	curses
O	on
O	``
O	MacFarlane
O	'
O	s
O	lanthorn
O	,
O	``
O	as
O	he
O	called
O	the
O	moon
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	Highlander
O	,
O	motioning
O	Edward
O	to
O	stay
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	began
O	with
O	infinite
O	pains
O	to
O	worm
O	his
O	way
O	backward
O	on
O	all
O	fours
O	,
O	taking
O	advantage
O	of
O	every
O	bit
O	of
O	cover
O	,
O	lying
O	stock-still
O	behind
O	a
O	boulder
O	while
O	the
O	sentry
O	was
O	looking
O	in
O	his
O	direction
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	crawling
O	swiftly
O	to
O	a
O	more
O	distant
O	bush
O	as
O	often
O	as
O	he
O	turned
O	his
O	back
O	or
O	marched
O	the
O	other
O	way
O	.
O	Presently
O	Edward
O	lost
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	Highlander
O	,
O	but
O	before
O	long
O	he
O	came
O	out
O	again
O	at
O	an
O	altogether
O	different
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	thicket
O	,
O	in
O	full
O	view
O	of
O	the
O	sentinel
O	,
O	at
O	whom
O	he
O	immediately
O	fired
O	a
O	shot
O	--
O	the
O	bullet
O	wounding
O	the
O	soldier
O	on
O	the
O	arm
O	,
O	stopping
O	once
O	and
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	whistling
O	of
O	_Nancy
O	Dawson_
O	.
O	Then
O	all
O	the
O	soldiers
O	,
O	awakened
O	by
O	the
O	shot
O	and
O	their
O	comrade
O	'
O	s
O	cry
O	,
O	advanced
O	alertly
O	toward
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	the
O	tall
O	man
O	had
O	been
O	seen
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	retired
O	,
O	but
O	continued
O	to
O	give
O	them
O	occasionally
O	such
O	a
O	view
O	of
O	his
O	figure
O	in
O	the
O	open
O	moonlight
O	,
O	as
O	to
O	lead
O	them
O	yet
O	farther
O	from

O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	taking

O	their
O	leader
O	'
O	s
O	ruse
O	,
O	Waverley
O	and

O	over
O	the
O	heather
O	till
O	they
O	got
O	behind
O	a
O	rising
O	ground
O	,
O	from
O	which
O	,

O	far
O	before
O	they
O	came
O	upon
O	an
O	encampment
O	in
O	a
O	hollow
O	.
O	Here
O	several
O	Highlanders
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	horse
O	or
O	two
O	,
O	lay
O	concealed
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	not
O	arrived
O	very
O	long
O	before
O	the
O	tall
O	Highlander
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	led
O	the
O	soldiers
O	such
O	a
O	dance
O	,
O	made
O	his
O	appearance
O	quite
O	out
O	of
O	breath
O	,
O	but
O	laughing
O	gayly
O	at
O	the
O	ease
O	with
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	tricked
O	his
O	pursuers
O	.
O	Edward
O	was
O	now
O	mounted
O	on
O	a
O	stout
O	pony
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	whole
O	party
O	set
O	forward
O	at
O	a
O	good
O	round
O	pace
O	,
O	accompanied
O	by
O	the
O	Highlanders
O	as
O	an
O	escort
O	.
O	They
O	continued
O	without
O	molestation
O	all
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	till
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	light
O	,
O	they
O	saw
O	a
O	tall
O	old
O	castle
O	on
O	the
O	opposite
O	bank
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	battlements
O	of
O	which
O	they
O	could
O	see
O	the
O	plaid
O	and
O	targe
O	of
O	a
O	Highland
O	sentry
O	,
O	and
O	over
O	which
O	floated
O	the
O	white
O	banner
O	of
O	the
O	exiled
O	Stuarts
O	.
O	They
O	passed
O	through
O	a
O	small
O	town
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	were
O	admitted
O	into
O	the
O	courtyard
O	of
O	the
O	ancient
O	fortress
O	,
O	where
O	Edward
O	was
O	courteously
O	received
O	by
O	a
O	chief
O	in
O	full
O	dress
O	and
O	wearing
O	a
O	white
O	cockade
O	.
O	He
O	showed
O	Waverley
O	directly
O	to
O	a
O	half-ruinous
O	apartment
O	where
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	small
O	camp
O	bed
O	.
O	Here
O	he
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	leave
O	him
O	,
O	after
O	asking
O	him
O	what
O	refreshment
O	he
O	would
O	take
O	,
O	when
O	Edward
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	had
O	enough
O	of
O	mysteries
O	,
O	requested
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	told
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	.
O	``
O	You
O	are
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	Doune
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	district
O	of
O	Menteith
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	governor
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	you
O	are
O	in
O	no
O	danger
O	whatever
O	.
O	I
O	command
O	here
O	for
O	his
O	Royal
O	Highness
O	Prince
O	Charles
O	.
O	``
O	At
O	last
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	Waverley
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	reached
O	a
O	place
O	of
O	rest
O	and
O	safety
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	very
O	next
O	day
O	he
O	was
O	put
O	in
O	charge
O	of
O	a
O	detachment
O	of
O	irregular
O	horsemen
O	who
O	were
O	making
O	their
O	way
O	eastward
O	to
O	join
O	the
O	forces
O	of
O	the
O	Prince
O	.
O	The
O	leader
O	of
O	this
O	band
O	was
O	no
O	other
O	than
O	the
O	Laird
O	of
O	Balmawhapple
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	backing
O	words
O	by
O	deeds
O	,
O	had
O	mustered
O	his
O	grooms
O	and
O	huntsmen
O	in
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	the
O	Stuarts
O	.
O	Edward
O	attempted
O	to
O	speak
O	civilly
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	found
O	himself
O	brutally
O	repulsed
O	.
O	Captain
O	Falconer
O	of
O	Balmawhapple
O	had
O	noways
O	forgotten
O	the
O	shrewd
O	pinch
O	in
O	the
O	sword-arm
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	received
O	from
O	the
O	Baron
O	of
O	Bradwardine
O	in
O	Waverley
O	'
O	s
O	quarrel
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	Edward
O	had
O	better
O	luck
O	with
O	his
O	Lieutenant
O	,
O	a
O	certain
O	horse-coper
O	or
O	dealer
O	.
O	This
O	man
O	had
O	sold
O	Balmawhapple
O	the
O	chargers
O	upon
O	which
O	to
O	mount
O	his
O	motley
O	array
O	,
O	and
O	seeing
O	no
O	chance
O	of
O	getting
O	his
O	money
O	except
O	by
O	``
O	going
O	out
O	``
O	himself
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	accepted
O	the
O	post
O	of
O	Lieutenant
O	in
O	the
O	Chevalier
O	'
O	s
O	army
O	.
O	So
O	far
O	good
O	.
O	But
O	just
O	at
O	the
O	moment
O	when
O	it
O	seemed
O	that
O	our
O	hero
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	get
O	some
O	information
O	of
O	a
O	useful
O	sort
O	,
O	Balmawhapple
O	rode
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	demanded
O	of
O	his
O	Lieutenant
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	heard
O	his
O	orders
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	should
O	speak
O	to
O	the
O	prisoner
O	.
O	After
O	that
O	they
O	marched
O	in
O	silence
O	,
O	till
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	little
O	company
O	of
O	adventurers
O	was
O	passing
O	Stirling
O	Castle
O	,
O	Balmawhapple
O	must
O	needs
O	sound
O	his
O	trumpet
O	and
O	display
O	his
O	white
O	banner
O	.
O	This
O	bravado
O	,
O	considerably
O	to
O	that
O	gentleman
O	'
O	s
O	discomfiture
O	,
O	was
O	answered
O	at
O	once
O	by
O	a
O	burst
O	of
O	smoke
O	from
O	the
O	Castle
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	moment
O	a
O	cannon-ball
O	knocked
O	up
O	the
O	earth
O	a
O	few
O	feet
O	from
O	the
O	Captain
O	'
O	s
O	charger
O	,
O	and
O	covered
O	Balmawhapple
O	himself
O	with
O	dirt
O	and
O	stones
O	.
O	An
O	immediate
O	retreat
O	of
O	the
O	command
O	took
O	place
O	without
O	having
O	been
O	specially
O	ordered
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	approached
O	Edinburgh
O	,
O	they
O	could
O	see
O	that
O	white
O	wreaths
O	of
O	smoke
O	circled
O	the
O	Castle
O	.
O	The
O	cannonade
O	rolled
O	continuously
O	.
O	Balmawhapple
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	warned
O	by
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	at
O	Stirling
O	,
O	gave
O	the
O	Castle
O	a
O	wide
O	berth
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	,
O	without
O	having
O	entered
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	he
O	delivered
O	up
O	his
O	prisoner
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	ancient
O	palace
O	of
O	Holyrood
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	time
O	being
O	,
O	Edward
O	'
O	s
O	adventures
O	in
O	the
O	wild
O	Highlands
O	were
O	ended
O	.
O	INTERLUDE
O	OF
O	STICKING-PLASTER
O	This
O	time
O	the
O	children
O	were
O	frankly
