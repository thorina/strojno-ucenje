O	Charlemagne
O	was
O	overwhelmed
O	with
O	grief
O	at
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	so
O	many
O	of
O	his
O	bravest
O	warriors
O	at
O	the
O	disaster
O	of
O	Roncesvalles
O	,
O	and
O	bitterly
O	reproached
O	himself
O	for
O	his
O	credulity
O	in
O	resigning
O	himself
O	so
O	completely
O	to
O	the
O	counsels
O	of
O	the
O	treacherous
O	Count
O	Ganelon
O	.
O	Yet
O	he
O	soon
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	similar
O	snare
O	when
O	he
O	suffered
O	his
O	unworthy
O	son
O	Charlot
O	to
O	acquire
O	such
O	an
O	influence
O	over
O	him
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	constantly
O	led
O	him
O	into
O	acts
O	of
O	cruelty
O	and
O	injustice
O	that
O	in
O	his
O	right
O	mind
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	scorned
O	to
O	commit
O	.
O	Rinaldo
O	and
O	his
O	brothers
O	,
O	for
O	some
O	slight
O	offence
O	to
O	the
O	imperious
O	young
O	prince
O	,
O	were
O	forced
O	to
O	fly
O	from
O	Paris
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	take
O	shelter
O	in
O	their
O	castle
O	of
O	Montalban
O	;
O	for
O	Charles
O	had
O	publicly
O	said
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	take
O	them
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	hang
O	them
O	all
O	.
O	He
O	sent
O	numbers
O	of
O	his
O	bravest
O	knights
O	to
O	arrest
O	them
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	without
O	success
O	.
O	Either
O	Rinaldo
O	foiled
O	their
O	efforts
O	and
O	sent
O	them
O	back
O	,
O	stripped
O	of
O	their
O	armor
O	and
O	of
O	their
O	glory
O	,
O	or
O	,
O	after
O	meeting
O	and
O	conferring
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	they
O	came
O	back
O	and
O	told
O	the
O	king
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	his
O	instruments
O	for
O	such
O	a
O	work
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	Charles
O	himself
O	raised
O	a
O	great
O	army
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	in
O	person
O	to
O	compel
O	the
O	paladin
O	to
O	submit
O	.
O	He
O	ravaged
O	all
O	the
O	country
O	round
O	about
O	Montalban
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	supplies
O	of
O	food
O	should
O	be
O	cut
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	threatened
O	death
O	to
O	any
O	who
O	should
O	attempt
O	to
O	issue
O	forth
O	,
O	hoping
O	to
O	compel
O	the
O	garrison
O	to
O	submit
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	food
O	.
O	Rinaldo
O	'
O	s
O	resources
O	had
O	been
O	brought
O	so
O	low
O	that
O	it
O	seemed
O	useless
O	to
O	contend
O	any
O	longer
O	.
O	His
O	brothers
O	had
O	been
O	taken
O	prisoners
O	in
O	a
O	skirmish
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	only
O	hope
O	of
O	saving
O	their
O	lives
O	was
O	in
O	making
O	terms
O	with
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	sent
O	a
O	messenger
O	,
O	offering
O	to
O	yield
O	himself
O	and
O	his
O	castle
O	if
O	the
O	king
O	would
O	spare
O	his
O	and
O	his
O	brothers
O	'
O	lives
O	.
O	While
O	the
O	messenger
O	was
O	gone
O	,
O	Rinaldo
O	,
O	impatient
O	to
O	learn
O	what
O	tidings
O	he
O	might
O	bring
O	,
O	rode
O	out
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	ridden
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	he
O	thought
O	prudent
O	he
O	stopped
O	in
O	a
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	alighting
O	,
O	tied
O	Bayard
O	to
O	a
O	tree
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	sat
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	waited
O	,
O	he
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	Bayard
O	meanwhile
O	got
O	loose
O	,
O	and
O	strayed
O	away
O	where
O	the
O	grass
O	tempted
O	him
O	.
O	Just
O	then
O	came
O	along
O	some
O	country
O	people
O	,
O	who
O	said
O	to
O	one
O	another
O	,
O	``
O	Look
O	,
O	is
O	not
O	that
O	the
O	great
O	horse
O	Bayard
O	that
O	Rinaldo
O	rides
O	?
O	Let
O	us
O	take
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	carry
O	him
O	to
O	King
O	Charles
O	,
O	who
O	will
O	pay
O	us
O	well
O	for
O	our
O	trouble
O	.
O	``
O	They
O	did
O	so
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	delighted
O	with
O	his
O	prize
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	them
O	a
O	present
O	that
O	made
O	them
O	rich
O	to
O	their
O	dying
O	day
O	.
O	When
O	Rinaldo
O	woke
O	he
O	looked
O	round
O	for
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	finding
O	him
O	not
O	,
O	he
O	groaned
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	O
O	unlucky
O	hour
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	born
O	!
O	how
O	fortune
O	persecutes
O	me
O	!
O	``
O	So
O	desperate
O	was
O	he
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	took
O	off
O	his
O	armor
O	and
O	his
O	spurs
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	What
O	need
O	have
O	I
O	of
O	these
O	,
O	since
O	Bayard

O	?
O	``
O	While
O	he
O	stood
O	thus
O	lamenting
O	,
O	a
O	man
O	came
O	from
O	the
O	thicket
O	,
O	seemingly
O	bent
O	with
O	age
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	a
O	long
O	beard
O	hanging
O	over
O	his
O	breast
O	,
O	and
O	eyebrows
O	that
O	almost
O	covered
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	He
O	bade
O	Rinaldo
O	good
O	day
O	.
O	Rinaldo
O	thanked
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	A
O	good
O	day
O	I
O	have
O	hardly
O	had
O	since
O	I

O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	said
O	the

O	,
O	``

O	Rinaldo
O	answered

O	My

O	then

O	``
O	``
O	Yes

O	``
O	Then
O	Malagigi
O	asked
O	alms

O	the
O	monks
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	none

O	till
O	he
O	threw
O	aside

O	pilgrim

O	let
O	them
O	see

O	,
O	partly
O	for
O	charity

O	partly
O	for

O	gave
O	him
O	a

O	cup
O	,
O	adorned
O	with
O	precious

O	that
O	sparkled
O	in
O	the

O	Malagigi
O	then
O	hastened
O	back
O	to
O	Rinaldo
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	what

O	.
O	The
O	morning
O	of
O	the

O	Rinaldo

O	to

O	Malagigi

O	Yet
O	he

O	as

O	directed
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	two
O	had
O	taken
O	their
O	stand
O	on
O	the

O	the
O	crowd
O	,
O	the

O	The
O	king
O	,
O	looking
O	round
O	on

O	and
O	observed
O	the

O	that

O	,
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	Chariot

O	``

O	pilgrims
O	have
O	got
O	.
O	It

O	``
O	That

O	,
O	and

O	The

O	The
O	king
O	said
O	to

O	,
O	``

O	in
O	a
O	few

O	.
O	When
O	King
O	Lisuarte
O	heard
O	this
O	embassage
O	he
O	set
O	sail
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	fleet
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	they
O	put
O	into
O	Scotland
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	honorably
O	received
O	by
O	King
O	Languines
O	.
O	Brisena
O	,
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	was
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	daughter
O	Oriana
O	,
O	born
O	in
O	Denmark
O	and
O	then
O	about
O	ten
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	the
O	fairest
O	creature
O	that
O	ever
O	was
O	seen
O	,
O	wherefore
O	she
O	was
O	called
O	the
O	one
O	without
O	a
O	peer
O	.
O	And
O	because
O	she
O	suffered
O	much
O	at
O	sea
O	it
O	was
O	determined
O	to
O	leave
O	her
O	there
O	.
O	Right
O	gladly
O	did
O	King
O	Languines
O	accept
O	this
O	charge
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	queen
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Believe

O	take

O	So
O	Lisuarte
O	proceeded
O	.

O	*
O	*
O	The
O	Child
O	of
O	the

O	was
O	now
O	twelve

O	old
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	stature
O	and
O	size
O	he
O	seemed
O	fifteen
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	served
O	the
O	queen
O	;
O	but
O	now
O	that
O	Oriana
O	was
O	there
O	the
O	queen
O	gave
O	her
O	the
O	Child

O	the
O	Sea
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	serve
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	Oriana
O	said
O	that
O	it
O	pleased
O	her
O	;
O	and
O	that
O	word
O	which
O	she
O	said
O	the
O	child
O	kept
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	never
O	lost
O	it
O	from
O	his
O	memory
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	all
O	his
O	life
O	he
O	was
O	never
O	weary
O	of
O	serving
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	heart
O	was
O	surrendered
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	love
O	lasted
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	they
O	lasted
O	,
O	for
O	as

O	as
O	he
O	loved
O	her
O	did
O	she
O	also
O	love
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	Child
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	,
O	who
O	knew
O	nothing
O	of
O	her
O	love
O	,
O	thought
O	himself
O	presumptuous
O	to
O	have
O	placed
O	his
O	thoughts
O	on
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	dared
O	not

O	her
O	;
O	and
O	she
O	who
O	loved

O	in

O	heart
O	was
O	careful
O	riot
O	to
O	speak
O	more
O	with
O	him
O	than
O	with
O	another
O	;
O	but
O	their
O	eyes
O	delighted
O	to
O	reveal
O	to
O	the
O	heart
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	thing
O	on
O	earth
O	that
O	they
O	loved
O	best
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	the
O	time
O	came
O	that
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	could
O	take
O	arms
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	knighted

O	this
