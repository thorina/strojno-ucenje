O	Sindbad
O	the
O	sailor
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	his
O	adventures
O	and
O	wanderings
O	,
O	settled
O	down
O	in
O	happiness
O	and
O	prosperity
O	in
O	Bagdad
O	.
O	Here
O	are
O	the
O	stories
O	which
O	he
O	told
O	to
O	his
O	friends
O	of
O	his
O	seven
O	marvelous
O	voyages
O	.
O	THE
O	FIRST
O	VOYAGE
O	My
O	father
O	died
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	young
O	and
O	left
O	me
O	a
O	fortune
O	.
O	Having
O	no
O	one
O	to
O	restrain
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	fell
O	into
O	bad
O	ways
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	I
O	not
O	only
O	wasted
O	my
O	time
O	,
O	but
O	injured
O	my
O	health
O	,
O	and
O	destroyed
O	my
O	property
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	recovered
O	,
O	I
O	collected
O	together
O	what
O	was
O	left
O	of
O	my
O	fortune
O	,
O	and
O	bought
O	merchandise
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	loaded
O	on
O	board
O	a
O	vessel
O	for
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	Balsora
O	.
O	During
O	the
O	voyage
O	we
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	islands
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	sold
O	or
O	exchanged
O	our
O	goods
O	.
O	We
O	were
O	one
O	day
O	becalmed
O	near
O	a
O	small
O	island
O	.
O	As
O	its
O	appearance
O	was
O	inviting
O	,
O	we
O	determined
O	to
O	dine
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	while
O	we
O	were
O	laughing
O	and
O	preparing
O	for
O	dinner
O	,
O	the
O	island
O	began
O	to
O	move
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	moment
O	the
O	people
O	in
O	the
O	ship
O	called
O	out
O	that
O	we
O	were
O	on
O	the
O	back
O	of
O	a
O	monstrous
O	whale
O	.
O	Some
O	jumped
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	others
O	swam
O	to
O	the
O	ship
O	;
O	but
O	before
O	I
O	could
O	get
O	off
O	the
O	animal
O	dived
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	only
O	time
O	to
O	catch
O	hold
O	of
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	wood
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	brought
O	from
O	the
O	ship
O	to
O	serve
O	as
O	a
O	table
O	.
O	Upon
O	this
O	piece
O	of
O	timber
O	I
O	was
O	carried
O	away
O	by
O	the
O	current
O	.
O	The
O	others
O	reached
O	the
O	vessel
O	,
O	but
O	a
O	gale
O	sprang
O	up
O	and
O	the
O	ship
O	sailed
O	without
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	floated
O	during
O	that
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	night
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	following
O	morning
O	was
O	thrown
O	on
O	a
O	small
O	island
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	fresh
O	water
O	and
O	fruit
O	.
O	I
O	looked
O	about
O	for
O	some
O	house
O	,
O	but
O	found
O	none
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	colts
O	grazing
O	together
O	,
O	but
O	no
O	traces
O	of
O	other
O	animals
O	.
O	When
O	evening
O	approached
O	I
O	took
O	some
O	more
O	fruit
O	and
O	climbed
O	in
O	a
O	tree
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	About
O	midnight
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	trumpets
O	and
O	drums
O	seemed
O	to
O	pass
O	around
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	which
O	continued
O	until
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	again
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	uninhabited
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	small
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	no
O	other
O	land
O	was
O	in
O	sight
O	.
O	I
O	therefore
O	gave
O	myself
O	up
O	as
O	lost
O	.
O	Nor
O	were
O	my
O	fears
O	lessened
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	shore
O	abounded
O	with
O	enormous
O	serpents
O	and
O	other
O	sea
O	monsters
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	timid
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	rattling
O	of
O	sticks
O	would
O	make
O	them
O	dive
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	I
O	climbed
O	the
O	tree
O	next
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	drums
O	and
O	trumpets
O	returned
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	satisfaction
O	of
O	seeing
O	a
O	body
O	of
O	men
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	on
O	landing
O	,
O	were
O	astonished
O	to
O	see
O	me
O	there
O	.
O	Having
O	related
O	to
O	them
O	how
O	I
O	came
O	hither
O	,
O	they
O	told
O	me
O	they
O	were
O	grooms
O	of
O	King
O	Mihrage
O	;
O	that
O	the
O	island
O	belonged
O	to
O	genii
O	,
O	who
O	visited
O	it
O	every
O	night
O	with
O	drums
O	and
O	trumpets
O	;
O	that
O	the
O	genii
O	had
O	allowed
O	their
O	sovereign
O	to
O	train
O	his
O	colts
O	upon
O	the
O	island
O	;
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	,
O	being
O	sent
O	every
O	six
O	months
O	to
O	select
O	some
O	,
O	had
O	arrived
O	for
O	that
O	purpose
O	.
O	The
O	grooms
O	carried
O	me
O	to
O	King
O	Mihrage
O	,
O	who
O	allowed
O	me
O	apartments
O	in
O	his
O	palace
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	I
O	saw
O	men
O	unloading
O	a
O	ship
O	in
O	the
O	harbor
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	bales
O	were
O	those
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	sent
O	to
O	Balsora
O	.
O	Going
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	I
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Captain
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	Sindbad
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Surely
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	and
O	the
O	passengers
O	saw
O	Sindbad
O	swallowed
O	in
O	the
O	waves
O	many
O	hundred
O	miles
O	away
O	.
O	``
O	Some
O	others
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	coming
O	up
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	recognized
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	then
O	restored
O	me
O	the
O	bales
O	,
O	with
O	many
O	congratulations
O	.
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	valuable
O	present
O	to
O	King
O	Mihrage
O	,
O	who
O	bestowed
O	a
O	rich
O	gift
O	on
O	me
O	in
O	return
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	made
O	some
O	advantageous
O	purchases
O	,
O	I
O	arrived
O	at
O	Balsora
O	,
O	where
O	,
O	after
O	I
O	had
O	sold
O	my
O	goods
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	possessed
O	of
O	a
O	hundred
O	thousand
O	sequins
O	.
O	THE
O	SECOND
O	VOYAGE
O	Becoming
O	weary
O	of
O	a
O	quiet
O	life
O	in
O	Balsora
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	bought
O	trading
O	goods
O	,
O	I
O	again
O	went
O	to
O	sea
O	with
O	some
O	merchants
O	.
O	After
O	touching
O	at
O	several
O	places
O	,
O	we
O	landed
O	at
O	an
O	uninhabited
O	island
O	.
O	We
O	amused
O	ourselves
O	in
O	different
O	ways
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	,
O	having
O	taken
O	my
O	wine
O	and
O	provisions
O	,
O	sat
O	down
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	awoke
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	my
O	companions
O	were
O	gone
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	ship
O	had
O	sailed
O	.
O	I
O	climbed
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	very
O	high
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	perceived
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	an
O	object
O	that
O	was
O	very
O	large
O	and
O	white
O	.
O	I
O	descended
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	toward
O	this
O	strange-looking
O	object
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	approached
O	it
O	I
O	found
O	it
O	was
O	about
O	fifty
O	paces
O	in
O	circumference
O	,
O	quite
O	round
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	smooth
O	as
O	ivory
O	,
O	but
O	had
O	no
O	sort
O	of
O	opening
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	now
O	almost
O	sunset
O	,
O	and
O	suddenly
O	the
O	sky
O	became
O	darkened
O	.
O	I
O	looked
O	up
O	and
O	beheld
O	a
O	bird
O	of
O	enormous
O	size
O	,
O	moving
O	like
O	a
O	prodigious
O	cloud
O	toward
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	recollected
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	heard
O	of
O	a
O	bird
O	called
O	the
O	roc
O	,
O	so
O	large
O	that
O	it
O	could
O	carry
O	away
O	young
O	elephants
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	therefore
O	conjectured
O	that
O	the
O	large
O	object
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	looking
O	at
O	was
O	the
O	egg
O	of
O	this
O	bird
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	bird
O	approached
O	I
O	crept
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	egg
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	legs
O	of
O	this
O	winged
O	animal
O	before
O	me
O	when
O	it
O	alighted
O	.
O	This
O	limb
O	being
O	as
O	large
O	as
O	the
O	trunk
O	of
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	I
O	tied
O	myself
O	firmly
O	to
O	it
O	with
O	my
O	turban
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	the
O	bird
O	flew
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	me
O	from
O	this
O	desert
O	island
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	borne
O	so
O	high
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	carried
O	downward
O	so
O	swiftly
O	that
O	I
O	lost
O	my
O	senses
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	recovered
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	I
O	quickly
O	untied
O	the
O	cloth
O	that
O	bound
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	scarcely
O	was
O	I
O	free
O	when
O	the
O	bird
O	,
O	having
O	taken
O	up
O	a
O	large
O	serpent
O	,
O	again
O	flew
O	away
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	in
O	a
O	deep
O	valley
O	,
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	which
O	were
O	too
O	steep
O	to
O	be
O	climbed
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	walked
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	in
O	despair
O	I
O	noticed
O	that
O	the
O	valley
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	diamonds
O	of
O	enormous
O	size
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	soon
O	saw
O	other
O	objects
O	of
O	much
O	less
O	agreeable
O	appearance
O	.
O	Immense
O	serpents
O	were
O	peeping
O	out
O	of
O	holes
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	.
O	When
O	night
O	came
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	shelter
O	in
O	a
O	cave
O	,
O	the
O	entrance
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	guarded
O	with
O	the
O	largest
O	stones
O	I
O	could
O	find
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	hissing
O	of
O	the
O	serpents
O	entirely
O	deprived
O	me
O	of
O	sleep
O	.
O	When
O	day
O	returned
O	,
O	the
O	serpents
O	retired
O	to
O	their
O	holes
O	;
O	and
O	I
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	cave
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	extreme
O	fear
O	.
O	I
O	walked
O	heedless
O	of
O	the
O	serpents
O	until
O	I
O	became
O	weary
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	sat
O	down
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	awakened
O	by
O	something
O	which
O	fell
O	near
O	me
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	large
O	piece
O	of
O	fresh
O	meat
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	I
O	saw
O	several
O	other
O	pieces
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	now
O	convinced
O	that
O	I
O	must
O	be
O	in
O	the
O	famous
O	valley
O	of
O	diamonds
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	pieces
O	of
O	meat
O	were
O	thrown
O	in
O	by
O	merchants
O	,
O	who
O	expected
O	eagles
O	to
O	pounce
O	upon
O	the
O	flesh
O	,
O	to
O	which
O	diamonds
O	were
O	almost
O	sure
O	to
O	adhere
O	.
O	I
O	hastened
O	to
O	pick
O	up
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	largest
O	diamonds
O	I
O	could
O	find
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	put
O	into
O	a
O	little
O	bag
O	,
O	and
O	fastened
O	it
O	to
O	my
O	girdle
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	selected
O	the
O	largest
O	piece
O	of
O	flesh
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	tied
O	to
O	my
O	waist
O	with
O	the
O	cloth
O	of
O	my
O	turban
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	lay
O	down
O	upon
O	my
O	face
O	to
O	wait
O	for
O	the
O	eagles
O	.
O	Very
O	soon
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	strongest
O	pounced
O	upon
O	the
O	meat
O	on
O	my
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	flew
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	its
O	nest
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	.
O	The
O	merchants
O	began
O	shouting
O	to
O	frighten
O	the
O	eagles
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	forced
O	the
O	birds
O	to
O	quit
O	their
O	prey
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	nest
O	where
O	I
O	was
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	the
O	man
O	was
O	frightened
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	me
O	there
O	,
O	but
O	after
O	recovering
O	himself
O	,
O	asked
O	me
O	how
O	I
O	got
O	there
O	.
O	I
O	told
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	merchants
O	my
O	story
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	opened
O	my
O	bag
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	declared
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	diamonds
O	of
O	equal
O	luster
O	and
O	size
O	with
O	mine
O	.
O	The
O	merchants
O	having
O	gathered
O	their
O	diamonds
O	together
O	,
O	we
O	left
O	the
O	place
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	crossed
O	the
O	mountains
O	until
O	we
O	reached
O	a
O	port
O	.
O	We
O	there
O	took
O	ship
O	and
O	proceeded
O	to
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	Roha
O	.
O	At
O	that
O	place
O	I
O	exchanged
O	some
O	of
O	my
O	diamonds
O	for
O	other
O	merchandise
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	went
O	on
O	to
O	Balsora
O	.
O	From
O	Balsora
O	I
O	reached
O	my
O	native
O	city
O	,
O	Bagdad
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	lived
O	easily
O	upon
O	the
O	vast
O	riches
O	I
O	had
O	won
O	.
O	THE
O	THIRD
O	VOYAGE
O	I
O	soon
O	resolved
O	upon
O	a
O	third
O	voyage
O	,
O	and
O	once
O	more
O	took
O	ship
O	at
O	Balsora
O	.
O	After
O	we
O	had
O	been
O	at
O	sea
O	a
O	few
O	weeks
O	,
O	we
O	were
O	overtaken
O	by
O	a
O	dreadful
O	storm
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	obliged
O	to
O	cast
O	anchor
O	near
O	an
O	island
O	which
O	the
O	captain
O	had
O	endeavored
O	to
O	avoid
O	;
O	for
O	he
O	assured
O	us
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	inhabited
O	by
O	pigmy
O	savages
O	,
O	covered
O	with
O	hair
O	,
O	who
O	would
O	speedily
O	attack
O	us
O	in
O	great
O	numbers
O	.
O	Soon
O	an
O	innumerable
O	multitude
O	of
O	frightful
O	savages
O	,
O	about
O	two
O	feet
O	high
O	,
O	boarded
O	the
O	ship
O	.
O	Resistance
O	was
O	useless
O	.
O	They
O	took
O	down
O	our
O	sails
O	,
O	cut
O	our
O	cable
O	,
O	towed
O	the
O	ship
O	to
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	us
O	all
O	go
O	on
O	shore
O	.
O	We
O	went
O	towards
O	the
O	interior
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	and
O	discovered
O	a
O	large
O	building
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	lofty
O	palace
O	,
O	having
O	a
O	gate
O	of
O	ebony
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	pushed
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	discovered
O	a
O	room
O	in
O	which
O	were
O	human
O	bones
O	and
O	roasting
O	spits
O	.
O	Presently
O	there
O	appeared
O	a
O	hideous
O	black
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	as
O	tall
O	as
O	a
O	palm
O	tree
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	but
O	one
O	eye
O	,
O	his
O	teeth
O	were
O	long
O	and
O	sharp
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	nails
O	like
O	the
O	talons
O	of
O	a
O	bird
O	.
O	He
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	as
O	I
O	would
O	a
O	kitten
O	,
O	but
O	finding
O	I
O	was
O	little
O	better
O	than
O	skin
O	and
O	bone
O	,
O	put
O	me
O	down
O	with
O	contempt
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	,
O	being
O	the
O	fattest
O	of
O	the
O	party
O	,
O	was
O	sacrificed
O	to
O	his
O	appetite
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	monster
O	had
O	finished
O	his
O	meal
O	he
O	stretched
O	himself
O	upon
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	bench
O	in
O	the
O	portico
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	,
O	snoring
O	louder
O	than
O	thunder
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	manner
O	he
O	slept
O	till
O	morning
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	he
O	went
O	out
O	.
O	I
O	said
O	to
O	my
O	companions
O	:
O	``
O	Do
O	not
O	waste
O	time
O	in
O	useless
O	sorrow
O	;
O	let
O	us
O	hurry
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	timber
O	to
O	make
O	rafts
O	.
O	``
O	We
O	found
O	some
O	timber
O	on
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	and
O	labored
O	hard
O	;
O	but
O	having
O	no
O	tools
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	evening
O	before
O	we
O	had
O	finished
O	;
O	and
O	while
O	we
O	were
O	on
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	pushing
O	the
O	raft
O	off
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	our
O	hideous
O	tyrant
O	returned
O	and
O	drove
O	us
O	to
O	his
O	palace
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	we
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	flock
O	of
O	sheep
O	.
O	We
O	saw
O	another
O	of
O	our
O	companions
O	sacrificed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	giant
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	sleep
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	Our
O	desperate
O	condition
O	gave
O	us
O	courage
O	;
O	nine
O	of
O	us
O	got
O	up
O	very
O	softly
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	the
O	points
O	of
O	the
O	roasting
O	spits
O	in
O	the
O	fire
O	until
O	we
O	made
O	them
O	red-hot
O	;
O	we
O	then
O	thrust
O	them
O	at
O	once
O	into
O	the
O	monster
O	'
O	s
O	eye
O	.
O	He
O	uttered
O	a
O	frightful
O	scream
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	tried
O	in
O	vain
O	to
O	find
O	us
O	,
O	opened
O	the
O	ebony
O	gate
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	We
O	did
O	not
O	stay
O	long
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	ran
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	got
O	our
O	rafts
O	ready
O	,
O	and
O	waited
O	for
O	daylight
O	to
O	embark
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	dawn
O	we
O	beheld
O	our
O	monstrous
O	enemy
O	,
O	led
O	by
O	two
O	giants
O	of
O	equal
O	size
O	,
O	and
O	followed
O	by
O	many
O	others
O	.
O	We
O	jumped
O	upon
O	our
O	rafts
O	,
O	and
O	pushed
O	them
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	the
O	tide
O	helping
O	us
O	.
O	The
O	giants
O	seeing
O	us
O	likely
O	to
O	escape
O	,
O	tore
O	great
O	pieces
O	of
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	wading
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	up
O	to
O	their
O	waists
O	,
O	hurled
O	them
O	at
O	us
O	with
O	all
O	their
O	might
O	.
O	They
O	sank
O	every
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	rafts
O	but
O	that
O	on
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	;
O	thus
O	all
O	my
O	companions
O	,
O	except
O	two
O	,
O	were
O	drowned
O	.
O	We
O	rowed
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	we
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	reach
O	of
O	these
O	monsters
O	.
O	We
O	were
O	at
O	sea
O	two
O	days
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	found
O	a
O	pleasant
O	island
O	.
O	After
O	eating
O	some
O	fruit
O	,
O	we
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	sleep
O	,
O	but
O	were
O	soon
O	awakened
O	by
O	the
O	hissing
O	of
O	an
O	enormous
O	serpent
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	my
O	comrades
O	was
O	instantly
O	devoured
O	by
O	this
O	terrific
O	creature
O	.
O	I
O	climbed
O	up
O	a
O	tree
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	reached
O	the
O	topmost
O	branches
O	;
O	my
O	remaining
O	companion
O	was
O	following
O	me
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	dreadful
O	reptile
O	entwined
O	itself
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	caught
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	serpent
O	then
O	went
O	down
O	and
O	glided
O	away
O	.
O	I
O	waited
O	until
O	late
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	before
O	I
O	ventured
O	to
O	descend
O	.
O	Evening
O	again
O	approached
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	gathered
O	together
O	a
O	great
O	quantity
O	of
O	small
O	wood
O	,
O	brambles
O	,
O	and
O	thorns
O	.
O	Having
O	made
O	them
O	into
O	fagots
O	,
O	I
O	formed
O	a
O	circle
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	fastened
O	the
O	uppermost
O	to
O	the
O	branches
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	climbed
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	highest
O	branches
O	.
O	At
O	night
O	the
O	serpent
O	came
O	again
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	reach
O	the
O	tree
O	;
O	and
O	crawling
O	vainly
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	my
O	little
O	fortification
O	until
O	daylight
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	away
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	I
O	spied
O	a
O	ship
O	in
O	full
O	sail
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	off
O	.
O	With
O	the
O	linen
O	of
O	my
O	turban
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	signal
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	perceived
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	taken
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	ship
O	and
O	there
O	told
O	my
O	adventures
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	was
O	very
O	kind
O	to
O	me
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	some
O	bales
O	of
O	goods
O	which
O	had
O	belonged
O	to
O	a
O	merchant
O	who
O	had
O	unintentionally
O	left
O	him
O	some
O	time
O	ago
O	on
O	an
O	uninhabited
O	island
O	.
O	As
O	this
O	man
O	was
O	undoubtedly
O	dead
O	,
O	he
O	intended
O	to
O	sell
O	the
O	goods
O	for
O	the
O	benefit
O	of
O	his
O	relatives
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	the
O	profit
O	of
O	selling
O	them
O	.
O	I
O	now
O	recollected
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	captain
O	with
O	whom
O	I
O	sailed
O	on
O	my
O	second
O	voyage
O	.
O	I
O	soon
O	convinced
O	him
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	really
O	Sindbad
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	supposed
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	lost
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	delighted
O	at
O	the
O	discovery
O	,
O	and
O	eagerly
O	acknowledged
O	that
O	the
O	property
O	was
O	mine
O	.
O	I
O	continued
O	my
O	voyage
O	,
O	sold
O	my
O	goods
O	to
O	great
O	advantage
O	,
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	Bagdad
O	.
O	MY
O	FOURTH
O	VOYAGE
O	My
O	desire
O	of
O	seeing
O	foreign
O	countries
O	rendered
O	my
O	pleasures
O	at
O	home
O	unsatisfactory
O	.
O	I
O	therefore
O	arranged
O	my
O	affairs
O	,
O	commenced
O	a
O	voyage
O	to
O	Persia
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	bought
O	a
O	large
O	stock
O	of
O	goods
O	loaded
O	a
O	ship
O	and
O	again
O	embarked
O	.
O	The
O	ship
O	struck
O	upon
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	cargo
O	was
O	lost
O	.
O	A
O	few
O	others
O	and
O	myself
O	were
O	borne
O	by
O	the
O	current
O	to
O	an
O	island
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	we
O	were
O	surrounded
O	by
O	black
O	savages
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	to
O	their
O	huts
O	.
O	The
O	savages
O	offered
O	us
O	herbs
O	;
O	my
O	companions
O	eagerly
O	took
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	hungry
O	.
O	Grief
O	would
O	not
O	allow
O	me
O	to
O	eat
O	;
O	and
O	presently
O	I
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	herbs
O	had
O	made
O	my
O	comrades
O	senseless
O	.
O	Rice
O	,
O	mixed
O	with
O	oil
O	of
O	cocoanuts
O	,
O	was
O	then
O	offered
O	to
O	us
O	,
O	which
O	my
O	companions
O	ate
O	greedily
O	and
O	grew
O	fat
O	.
O	My
O	unhappy
O	friends
O	were
O	then
O	devoured
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	,
O	having
O	become
O	appetizing
O	to
O	the
O	cannibals
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	languished
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	think
O	me
O	fit
O	to
O	eat
O	.
O	They
O	left
O	me
O	to
O	the
O	care
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	from
O	whom
O	I
O	managed
O	to
O	escape
O	;
O	and
O	taking
O	care
O	to
O	go
O	a
O	contrary
O	way
O	from
O	that
O	which
O	the
O	savages
O	had
O	taken
O	I
O	never
O	stopped
O	till
O	night
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	seven
O	days
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	seashore
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	white
O	persons
O	gathering
O	pepper
O	.
O	They
O	asked
O	me
O	in
O	Arabic
O	who
O	I
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	whence
O	I
O	came
O	;
O	and
O	I
O	gave
O	them
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	shipwreck
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	my
O	escape
O	.
O	They
O	treated
O	me
O	kindly
O	and
O	presented
O	me
O	to
O	their
O	King
O	,
O	who
O	treated
O	me
O	with
O	great
O	liberality
O	.
O	During
O	my
O	stay
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	I
O	observed
O	that
O	when
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	his
O	nobles
O	went
O	hunting
O	,
O	they
O	rode
O	their
O	horses
O	without
O	bridle
O	or
O	saddle
O	.
O	With
O	the
O	assistance
O	of
O	some
O	workmen
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	bridle
O	and
O	saddle
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	put
O	them
O	upon
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	horses
O	,
O	presented
O	the
O	animal
O	,
O	thus
O	equipped
O	,
O	to
O	His
O	Majesty
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	delighted
O	that
O	he
O	instantly
O	mounted
O	and
O	rode
O	about
O	the
O	grounds
O	almost
O	the
O	whole
O	day
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	ministers
O	of
O	state
O	and
O	the
O	nobility
O	induced
O	me
O	to
O	make
O	saddles
O	and
O	bridles
O	for
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	which
O	they
O	made
O	me
O	such
O	magnificent
O	presents
O	that
O	I
O	soon
O	became
O	very
O	rich
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	at
O	last
O	requested
O	that
O	I
O	would
O	marry
O	,
O	and
O	become
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	nation
O	.
O	From
O	a
O	variety
O	of
O	circumstances
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	refuse
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	therefore
O	gave
O	me
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	ladies
O	of
O	his
O	Court
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	young
O	,
O	rich
O	,
O	beautiful
O	,
O	and
O	virtuous
O	.
O	We
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	greatest
O	harmony
O	in
O	a
O	palace
O	belonging
O	to
O	my
O	wife
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	made
O	a
O	good
O	friend
O	of
O	a
O	very
O	worthy
O	man
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	this
O	place
O	.
O	Hearing
O	one
O	day
O	that
O	his
O	wife
O	had
O	just
O	died
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	condole
O	with
O	him
O	on
O	this
O	unexpected
O	calamity
O	.
O	We
O	were
O	alone
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	in
O	the
O	deepest
O	grief
O	.
O	After
O	I
O	had
O	talked
O	with
O	him
O	some
O	time
O	on
O	the
O	uselessness
O	of
O	so
O	much
O	sorrow
O	,
O	he
O	told
O	me
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	an
O	established
O	law
O	that
O	the
O	living
O	husband
O	should
O	be
O	buried
O	with
O	the
O	deceased
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	within
O	an
O	hour
O	he
O	must
O	submit
O	.
O	I
O	shuddered
O	at
O	the
O	dreadful
O	custom
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	the
O	woman
O	was
O	attired
O	in
O	her
O	most
O	costly
O	dress
O	and
O	jewels
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	in
O	an
O	open
O	coffin
O	.
O	The
O	procession
O	then
O	began
O	,
O	the
O	husband
O	following
O	the
O	corpse
O	.
O	They
O	ascended
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	an
O	exceedingly
O	high
O	mountain
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	was
O	removed
O	,
O	which
O	covered
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	a
O	deep
O	pit
O	.
O	The
O	corpse
O	was
O	let
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	husband
O	,
O	having
O	taken
O	leave
O	of
O	his
O	friends
O	,
O	was
O	put
O	into
O	another
O	open
O	coffin
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	pot
O	of
O	water
O	and
O	seven
O	small
O	loaves
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	let
O	down
O	.
O	The
O	stone
O	was
O	replaced
O	and
O	they
O	all
O	returned
O	.
O	The
O	horror
O	of
O	this
O	was
O	still
O	fresh
O	upon
O	my
O	mind
O	,
O	when
O	my
O	wife
O	fell
O	sick
O	and
O	died
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	and
O	the
O	whole
O	Court
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	respect
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	instantly
O	prepared
O	to
O	assist
O	at
O	a
O	similar
O	ceremony
O	with
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	restrained
O	the
O	feeling
O	of
O	despair
O	until
O	we
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	fell
O	at
O	the
O	feet
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	begged
O	him
O	to
O	spare
O	my
O	life
O	.
O	All
O	I
O	said
O	was
O	ineffectual
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	my
O	wife
O	was
O	let
O	down
O	,
O	I
O	also
O	was
O	put
O	into
O	the
O	deep
O	pit
O	,
O	everyone
O	being
O	totally
O	indifferent
O	to
O	my
O	cries
O	and
O	lamentations
O	.
O	I
O	made
O	the
O	cave
O	echo
O	with
O	my
O	vain
O	complaints
O	.
O	I
O	lived
O	some
O	days
O	on
O	the
O	bread
O	and
O	water
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	put
O	into
O	my
O	coffin
O	,
O	but
O	this
O	supply
O	was
O	at
O	length
O	exhausted
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	wandered
O	to
O	a
O	remote
O	part
O	of
O	this
O	frightful
O	cave
O	and
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	prepare
O	for
O	death
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	thus
O	wishing
O	only
O	for
O	a
O	speedy
O	termination
O	of
O	my
O	misery
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	heard
O	something
O	walking
O	and
O	panting
O	.
O	I
O	started
O	up
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	the
O	thing
O	panted
O	still
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	ran
O	away
O	.
O	I
O	pursued
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	stop
O	,
O	but
O	on
O	my
O	approach
O	continued
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	before
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	pursued
O	it
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	last
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	glimmering
O	light
O	like
O	a
O	star
O	.
O	This
O	redoubled
O	my
O	eagerness
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	last
O	I
O	discovered
O	a
O	hole
O	large
O	enough
O	to
O	allow
O	my
O	escape
O	.
O	I
O	crept
O	through
O	the
O	aperture
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	myself
O	on
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	and
O	discovered
O	that
O	the
O	creature
O	was
O	a
O	sea
O	monster
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	accustomed
O	to
O	enter
O	at
O	that
O	hole
O	to
O	feed
O	upon
O	the
O	dead
O	bodies
O	.
O	Having
O	eaten
O	some
O	shellfish
O	,
O	I
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	cave
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	collected
O	all
O	the
O	jewels
O	I
O	could
O	find
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	.
O	These
O	I
O	carried
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	and
O	tied
O	them
O	up
O	very
O	neatly
O	into
O	bales
O	with
O	the
O	cords
O	that
O	let
O	down
O	the
O	coffins
O	.
O	I
O	laid
O	them
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	waiting
O	till
O	some
O	ship
O	should
O	pass
O	.
O	In
O	two
O	days
O	a
O	ship
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	harbor
O	,
O	and
O	passed
O	by
O	that
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	coast
O	.
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	signal
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	boat
O	took
O	me
O	on
O	board
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	wrecked
O	;
O	for
O	,
O	had
O	they
O	known
O	my
O	real
O	story
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	carried
O	back
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	captain
O	was
O	a
O	native
O	of
O	this
O	country
O	.
O	We
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	islands
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	Kela
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	ship
O	ready
O	to
O	sail
O	for
O	Balsora
O	;
O	and
O	having
O	presented
O	some
O	jewels
O	to
O	the
O	captain
O	who
O	had
O	brought
O	me
O	to
O	Kela
O	,
O	I
O	sailed
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	arrived
O	at
O	Bagdad
O	.
O	THE
O	FIFTH
O	VOYAGE
O	Having
O	forgotten
O	my
O	former
O	perils
O	,
O	I
O	built
O	a
O	ship
O	at
O	my
O	own
O	expense
O	,
O	loaded
O	it
O	with
O	a
O	rich
O	cargo
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	taking
O	with
O	me
O	other
O	merchants
O	,
O	once
O	more
O	set
O	sail
O	.
O	We
O	were
O	much
O	driven
O	about
O	by
O	a
O	storm
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	landed
O	upon
O	a
O	desert
O	island
O	to
O	search
O	for
O	fresh
O	water
O	.
O	There
O	we
O	found
O	a
O	roc
O	'
O	s
O	egg
O	,
O	equal
O	in
O	size
O	to
O	the
O	one
O	I
O	had
O	seen
O	before
O	.
O	The
O	merchants
O	and
O	sailors
O	gathered
O	round
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	I
O	advised
O	them
O	not
O	to
O	meddle
O	with
O	it
O	,
O	they
O	nevertheless
O	made
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	it
O	with
O	their
O	hatchets
O	,
O	and
O	picked
O	out
O	the
O	young
O	roc
O	,
O	piece
O	after
O	piece
O	,
O	and
O	roasted
O	it
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	scarcely
O	finished
O	when
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	birds
O	appeared
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	.
O	We
O	hurried
O	on
O	board
O	ship
O	and
O	set
O	sail
O	,
O	but
O	had
O	not
O	gone
O	far
O	before
O	we
O	saw
O	the
O	immense
O	birds
O	approaching
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	after
O	they
O	hovered
O	over
O	the
O	ship
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	let
O	fall
O	an
O	enormous
O	fragment
O	of
O	stone
O	,
O	which
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	close
O	beside
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	other
O	let
O	fall
O	a
O	piece
O	which
O	split
O	our
O	ship
O	.
O	I
O	caught
O	hold
O	of
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	the
O	wreck
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	borne
O	by
O	the
O	wind
O	and
O	tide
O	to
O	an
O	island
O	,
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	very
O	steep
O	.
O	I
O	reached
O	the
O	dry
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	most
O	delicious
O	fruits
O	and
O	excellent
O	water
O	,
O	which
O	refreshed
O	me
O	.
O	Farther
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	feeble
O	old
O	man
O	sitting
O	near
O	a
O	rivulet
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	enquired
O	of
O	him
O	how
O	he
O	came
O	there
O	,
O	he
O	only
O	answered
O	by
O	signs
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	carry
O	him
O	over
O	the
O	rivulet
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	eat
O	some
O	fruit
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	him
O	on
O	my
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	crossed
O	the
O	brook
O	,
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	getting
O	down
O	,
O	he
O	clasped
O	his
O	legs
O	so
O	firmly
O	round
O	my
O	throat
O	that
O	I
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	strangle
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	soon
O	fainted
O	with
O	pain
O	and
O	fright
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	recovered
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	fellow
O	was
O	still
O	sitting
O	on
O	my
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	quickly
O	made
O	me
O	rise
O	up
O	and
O	walk
O	under
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	gathered
O	the
O	fruit
O	at
O	his
O	ease
O	.
O	This
O	lasted
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	while
O	carrying
O	him
O	about
O	,
O	I
O	picked
O	up
O	a
O	large
O	gourd
O	called
O	a
O	calabash
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	cleared
O	out
O	the
O	inside
O	,
O	I
O	pressed
O	into
O	it
O	the
O	juice
O	of
O	grapes
O	.
O	Having
O	filled
O	it
O	,
O	I
O	left
O	it
O	for
O	several
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	found
O	that
O	it
O	became
O	excellent
O	wine
O	.
O	I
O	drank
O	of
O	this
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	a
O	while
O	forgot
O	my
O	sorrows
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	with
O	cheerfulness
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	man
O	made
O	me
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	calabash
O	,
O	and
O	liking
O	the
O	flavor
O	of
O	the
O	wine
O	,
O	he
O	drank
O	it
O	off
O	,
O	soon
O	became
O	intoxicated
O	,
O	fell
O	from
O	my
O	shoulders
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	died
O	in
O	convulsions
O	.
O	I
O	hastened
O	to
O	the
O	seaside
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	found
O	the
O	crew
O	of
O	a
O	ship
O	.
O	They
O	told
O	me
O	I
O	had
O	fallen
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	Old
O	Man
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	person
O	that
O	had
O	ever
O	escaped
O	.
O	I
O	sailed
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	when
O	we
O	landed
O	,
O	took
O	me
O	to
O	some
O	persons
O	whose
O	employment
O	was
O	to
O	gather
O	cocoanuts
O	.
O	We
O	all
O	took
O	up
O	stones
O	and
O	pelted
O	the
O	monkeys
O	that
O	were
O	at
O	the
O	very
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	cocoanut
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	these
O	animals
O	in
O	return
O	pelted
O	us
O	with
O	cocoanuts
O	.
O	When
O	we
O	had
O	obtained
O	as
O	many
O	as
O	we
O	could
O	carry
O	,
O	we
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	I
O	soon
O	obtained
O	a
O	considerable
O	sum
O	by
O	the
O	cocoanuts
O	I
O	thus
O	gathered
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	sailed
O	for
O	my
O	native
O	land
O	.
O	THE
O	SIXTH
O	VOYAGE
O	At
O	the
O	expiration
O	of
O	another
O	year
O	,
O	I
O	prepared
O	for
O	a
O	sixth
O	voyage
O	.
O	This
O	proved
O	very
O	long
O	and
O	unfortunate
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	pilot
O	lost
O	his
O	course
O	and
O	knew
O	not
O	where
O	to
O	steer
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	he
O	told
O	us
O	we
O	must
O	inevitably
O	be
O	dashed
O	to
O	pieces
O	against
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	were
O	fast
O	approaching
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	the
O	vessel
O	was
O	a
O	complete
O	wreck
O	.
O	We
O	saved
O	our
O	lives
O	,
O	our
O	provisions
O	,
O	and
O	our
O	goods
O	.
O	The
O	shore
O	on
O	which
O	we
O	were
O	cast
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	a
O	mountain
O	which
O	it
O	was
O	impossible
O	to
O	climb
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	shortly
O	beheld
O	my
O	companions
O	die
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	frightful
O	cavern
O	in
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	through
O	which
O	flowed
O	a
O	river
O	.
O	To
O	this
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	fit
O	of
O	desperation
O	,
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	trust
O	myself
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	work
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	long
O	raft
O	.
O	I
O	loaded
O	it
O	with
O	bales
O	of
O	rich
O	stuffs
O	,
O	and
O	large
O	pieces
O	of
O	rock
O	crystal
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	mountain
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	measure
O	formed
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	raft
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	current
O	carried
O	me
O	along
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	carried
O	in
O	darkness
O	during
O	many
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	awoke
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	in
O	a
O	pleasant
O	country
O	.
O	My
O	raft
O	was
O	tied
O	up
O	and
O	some
O	blacks
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	near
O	me
O	,
O	said
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	found
O	me
O	floating
O	in
O	the
O	river
O	which
O	waters
O	their
O	land
O	.
O	They
O	took
O	me
O	to
O	their
O	King
O	,
O	and
O	carefully
O	conducted
O	my
O	cargo
O	with
O	me
O	.
O	When
O	we
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Serindib
O	,
O	I
O	related
O	my
O	story
O	to
O	the
O	monarch
O	,
O	who
O	ordered
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	written
O	in
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	.
O	I
O	presented
O	the
O	King
O	with
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	pieces
O	of
O	rock
O	crystal
O	,
O	and
O	entreated
O	him
O	to
O	let
O	me
O	return
O	to
O	my
O	own
O	country
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	readily
O	agreed
O	to
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	letter
O	and
O	a
O	present
O	to
O	my
O	sovereign
O	,
O	the
O	Caliph
O	Haroun
O	Alrashid
O	.
O	The
O	present
O	consisted
O	of
O	a
O	ruby
O	made
O	into
O	a
O	cup
O	,
O	and
O	decorated
O	with
O	pearls
O	;
O	the
O	skin
O	of
O	a
O	serpent
O	,
O	which
O	appeared
O	like
O	burnished
O	gold
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	could
O	repel
O	disease
O	;
O	some
O	aloe-wood
O	,
O	camphire
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	beautiful
O	female
O	slave
O	.
O	I
O	returned
O	to
O	my
O	native
O	country
O	,
O	delivered
O	the
O	present
O	to
O	the
O	Caliph
O	,
O	and
O	received
O	his
O	thanks
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	reward
O	.
O	THE
O	SEVENTH
O	AND
O	LAST
O	VOYAGE
O	The
O	Caliph
O	Haroun
O	Alrashid
O	one
O	day
O	sent
O	for
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	me
O	I
O	must
O	bear
O	a
O	present
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Serindib
O	.
O	I
O	ventured
O	to
O	protest
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	my
O	age
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	persuade
O	him
O	to
O	give
O	up
O	his
O	plan
O	.
O	I
O	arrived
O	at
O	Serindib
O	,
O	and
O	prayed
O	an
O	audience
O	with
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	conducted
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	with
O	great
O	respect
O	,
O	and
O	delivered
O	to
O	the
O	monarch
O	the
O	Caliph
O	'
O	s
O	letter
O	and
O	present
O	.
O	The
O	present
O	consisted
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	ingenious
O	and
O	valuable
O	works
O	of
O	art
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	the
O	King
O	was
O	exceedingly
O	delighted
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	also
O	pleased
O	to
O	acknowledge
O	how
O	much
O	he
O	esteemed
O	my
O	services
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	departed
O	,
O	the
O	monarch
O	bestowed
O	on
O	me
O	some
O	rich
O	gifts
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	ship
O	had
O	not
O	long
O	been
O	at
O	sea
O	,
O	before
O	it
O	was
O	attacked
O	by
O	pirates
O	,
O	who
O	seized
O	the
O	vessel
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	us
O	away
O	as
O	slaves
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	sold
O	to
O	a
O	merchant
O	.
O	When
O	my
O	master
O	found
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	use
O	the
O	bow
O	and
O	arrow
O	with
O	skill
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	me
O	upon
O	an
O	elephant
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	me
O	to
O	a
O	vast
O	forest
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	My
O	master
O	ordered
O	me
O	to
O	climb
O	a
O	high
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	wait
O	there
O	until
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	troop
O	of
O	elephants
O	pass
O	by
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	then
O	to
O	shoot
O	at
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	fell
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	and
O	give
O	the
O	merchant
O	notice
O	.
O	Having
O	given
O	me
O	these
O	directions
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	bag
O	of
O	provisions
O	,
O	he
O	left
O	me
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morning
O	of
O	the
O	second
O	day
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	elephants
O	.
O	I
O	succeeded
O	in
O	shooting
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	the
O	others
O	went
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	and
O	told
O	my
O	employer
O	,
O	who
O	praised
O	my
O	work
O	.
O	We
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	dug
O	a
O	hole
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	elephant
O	was
O	to
O	remain
O	until
O	it
O	decayed
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	teeth
O	free
O	.
O	I
O	continued
O	this
O	trade
O	nearly
O	two
O	months
O	,
O	and
O	killed
O	an
O	elephant
O	almost
O	every
O	day
O	.
O	One
O	morning
O	all
O	the
O	elephants
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	tree
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	and
O	trumpeted
O	dreadfully
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	fastened
O	his
O	trunk
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	tore
O	it
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	roots
O	.
O	I
O	fell
O	with
O	the
O	tree
O	;
O	the
O	animal
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	with
O	his
O	trunk
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	me
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	his
O	troop
O	,
O	he
O	brought
O	me
O	to
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	he
O	gently
O	laid
O	me
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	all
O	went
O	away
O	.
O	I
O	discovered
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	upon
O	a
O	large
O	broad
O	hill
O	,
O	covered
O	all
O	over
O	with
O	the
O	bones
O	and
O	teeth
O	of
O	elephants
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	soon
O	convinced
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	their
O	burying-place
O	.
O	I
O	reached
O	the
O	city
O	once
O	more
O	;
O	my
O	master
O	thought
O	I
O	was
O	lost
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	torn
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	my
O	bow
O	and
O	arrows
O	.
O	I
O	told
O	him
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	hill
O	.
O	We
O	loaded
O	the
O	elephant
O	on
O	which
O	we
O	had
O	come
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	collected
O	more
O	teeth
O	than
O	a
O	man
O	could
O	have
O	obtained
O	in
O	his
O	whole
O	life
O	.
O	The
O	merchant
O	told
O	me
O	that
O	not
O	only
O	he
O	himself
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	whole
O	city
O	,
O	was
O	indebted
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	return
O	to
O	my
O	own
O	country
O	with
O	sufficient
O	wealth
O	to
O	make
O	me
O	happy
O	.
O	My
O	patron
O	loaded
O	a
O	ship
O	with
O	ivory
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	merchants
O	made
O	me
O	valuable
O	presents
O	.
O	I
O	reached
O	Balsora
O	and
O	landed
O	my
O	ivory
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	to
O	be
O	more
O	valuable
O	than
O	I
O	had
O	expected
O	.
O	I
O	set
O	out
O	with
O	caravans
O	to
O	travel
O	overland
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	reached
O	Bagdad
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	presented
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	Caliph
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	my
O	embassy
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	astonished
O	at
O	my
O	adventure
O	with
O	the
O	elephants
O	that
O	he
O	ordered
O	the
O	narrative
O	of
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	written
O	in
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	and
O	to
O	be
O	deposited
O	in
O	his
O	treasury
O	.
