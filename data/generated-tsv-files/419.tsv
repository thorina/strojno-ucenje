O	It
O	was
O	some
O	moons
O	after
O	the
O	coon
O	outwitted
O	the
O	fox
O	,
O	before
O	they
O	again
O	met
O	.
O	The
O	coon
O	was
O	hurrying
O	by
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	fox
O	saw
O	him
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	fox
O	had
O	not
O	forgotten
O	the
O	trick
O	the
O	coon
O	had
O	played
O	on
O	him
O	.
O	His
O	head
O	was
O	still
O	sore
O	from
O	that
O	great
O	thump
O	against
O	the
O	apple
O	tree
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	fox
O	started
O	after
O	the
O	coon
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	gaining
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	caught
O	him
O	,
O	had
O	they
O	not
O	come
O	to
O	a
O	tall
O	pine
O	tree
O	.
O	The
O	coon
O	ran
O	to
O	the
O	very
O	tiptop
O	of
O	the
O	pine
O	tree
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	was
O	safe
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	fox
O	could
O	not
O	climb
O	.
O	The
O	fox
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	soft
O	pine
O	needles
O	and
O	waited
O	for
O	the
O	coon
O	to
O	come
O	down
O	.
O	The
O	coon
O	stayed
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	pine
O	tree
O	so
O	long
O	that
O	the
O	fox
O	grew
O	tired
O	and
O	sleepy
O	.
O	He
O	closed
O	his
O	eyes
O	and
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	take
O	a
O	short
O	nap
O	.
O	The
O	coon
O	watched
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	fox
O	was
O	sound
O	asleep
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	took
O	in
O	his
O	mouth
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	pitch
O	from
O	the
O	pine
O	tree
O	.
O	He
O	ran
O	down
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	rubbed
O	the
O	pitch
O	over
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	the
O	sleeping
O	fox
O	.
O	The
O	fox
O	awoke
O	.
O	He
O	sprang
O	up
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	seize
O	the
O	coon
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	alas
O	!
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	what
O	he
O	was
O	doing
O	.
O	The
O	lids
O	of
O	his
O	eyes
O	were
O	held
O	fast
O	with
O	the
O	pine
O	gum
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	open
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	coon
O	laughed
O	at
O	the
O	fox
O	'
O	s
O	plight
O	,
O	then
O	ran
O	and
O	left
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	fox
O	lay
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	under
O	the
O	tree
O	.
O	The
O	pine
O	gum
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	dried
O	,
O	held
O	the
O	lids
O	of
O	his
O	eyes
O	closer
O	and
O	closer
O	shut
O	.
O	He
O	thought
O	he
O	should
O	never
O	again
O	see
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	Some
O	birds
O	were
O	singing
O	near
O	by
O	.
O	He
O	called
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	of
O	his
O	plight
O	.
O	He
O	asked
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	be
O	so
O	kind
O	as
O	to
O	pick
O	open
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	The
O	birds
O	flew
O	off
O	and
O	told
O	the
O	other
O	birds
O	.
O	Soon
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	dark
O	songsters
O	flew
O	back
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	fox
O	lay
O	.
O	Then
O	peck
O	,
O	peck
O	,
O	peck
O	,
O	went
O	the
O	little
O	bills
O	on
O	the
O	eyelids
O	of
O	the
O	fox
O	.
O	Bit
O	by
O	bit
O	they
O	carefully
O	pecked
O	away
O	the
O	pine
O	gum
O	.
O	If
O	one
O	grew
O	tired
O	,
O	another
O	bird
O	would
O	take
O	its
O	place
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	fox
O	saw
O	a
O	streak
O	of
O	light
O	.
O	Soon
O	the
O	lid
O	of
O	one
O	eye
O	flew
O	open
O	,
O	then
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	The
O	sun
O	was
O	shining
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	world
O	looked
O	very
O	beautiful
O	to
O	the
O	fox
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	opened
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	very
O	grateful
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	birds
O	for
O	bringing
O	him
O	light
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	them
O	to
O	ask
O	what
O	they
O	would
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	would
O	give
O	it
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	birds
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	We
O	do
O	not
O	like
O	the
O	plain
O	,
O	dark
O	suits
O	which
O	the
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	brought
O	us
O	.
O	Make
O	us
O	look
O	like
O	the
O	sun
O	we
O	have
O	brought
O	to
O	you
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	fox
O	looked
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	Beautiful
O	yellow
O	flowers
O	were
O	growing
O	near
O	.
O	He
O	pressed
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	color
O	from
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	tip
O	of
O	his
O	tail
O	as
O	a
O	brush
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	paint
O	the
O	dark
O	little
O	birds
O	like
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	The
O	birds
O	fluttered
O	so
O	with
O	joy
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	paint
O	the
O	bodies
O	first
O	.
O	Before
O	he
O	could
O	brush
O	the
O	wings
O	and
O	tails
O	with
O	the
O	sun
O	paint
O	,
O	each
O	little
O	bird
O	had
O	darted
O	away
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	streak
O	of
O	sunshine
O	.
O	So
O	happy
O	and
O	light
O	of
O	heart
O	were
O	the
O	birds
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	wait
O	for
O	the
O	fox
O	to
O	finish
O	the
O	painting
O	.
O	This
O	is
O	why
O	goldfinches
O	are
O	yellow
O	like
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	why
O	they
O	have
O	black
O	wings
O	and
O	tails
O	,
O	why
O	they
O	flutter
O	so
O	with
O	joy
O	,
O	and
O	why
O	they
O	never
O	finish
O	their
O	song
O	.
