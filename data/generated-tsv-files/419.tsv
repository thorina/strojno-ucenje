O	Therefore
O	they
O	determined
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	night
O	there
O	.
O	And
O	though
O	Sancho

O	s

O	was
O	great
O	to
O	lie
O	out
O	of

O	,
O	yet
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	was
O	more
O	joyful
O	than
O	ever
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	as
O	often
O	as
O	he
O	slept
O	under
O	the

O	,
O	so
O	often
O	did
O	he
O	perform
O	an
O	act
O	worthy
O	of
O	a
O	true
O	knight-errant
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	welcomed
O	by
O	the
O	goatherds
O	very
O	cordially
O	,
O	and
O	Sancho
O	,
O	having
O	put
O	up
O	Rozinante
O	and
O	his
O	ass
O	the
O	best
O	way
O	he
O	could
O	,
O	made
O	his
O	way

O	given
O	out
O	by
O	certain
O	pieces
O	of

O	which
O	were
O	boiling
O	in
O	a
O	pot
O	on
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	And
O	though
O	he
O	longed
O	that
O	very
O	instant
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	ready
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not

O	so
O	,
O	for

O	Then
O	with
O	many

O	they
O	invited
O	the
O	two
O	to
