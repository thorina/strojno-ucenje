O	.
O	They
O	killed
O	enough
O	in
O	one
O	day
O	to
O	last
O	the
O	whole
O	company
O	almost
O	a
O	week
O	.
O	Massasoit
O	helped
O	the
O	feast
O	along
O	by
O	sending
O	some
O	of
O	his
O	best
O	hunters
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	.
O	They
O	killed
O	five
O	deer
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	gave
O	to
O	their
O	paleface
O	friends
O	,
O	that
O	all
O	might
O	have
O	enough
O	to
O	eat
O	.
O	Under
O	the
O	trees
O	were
O	built
O	long
O	,
O	rude
O	tables
O	on
O	which
O	were
O	piled
O	baked
O	clams
O	,
O	broiled
O	fish
O	,
O	roast
O	turkey
O	,
O	and
O	deer
O	meat
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	Pilgrim
O	women
O	helped
O	serve
O	the
O	food
O	to
O	the
O	hungry
O	redskins
O	.
O	Let
O	us
O	remember
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	fair
O	girls
O	who
O	waited
O	on
O	the
O	tables
O	.
O	One
O	was
O	Mary
O	Chilton
O	,
O	who
O	leaped
O	from
O	the
O	boat
O	at
O	Plymouth
O	Rock;
O	the
O	other
O	was
O	Mary
O	Allerton
O	.
O	She
O	lived
O	for
O	seventy-eight
O	years
O	after
O	this
O	first
O	Thanksgiving
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	came
O	over
O	in
O	the
O	_Mayflower_
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	last
O	to
O	die
O	.
O	What
O	a
O	merry
O	time
O	everybody
O	had
O	during
O	that
O	week
O	!
O	It
O	may
O	be
O	they
O	joked
O	Governor
O	Bradford
O	about
O	stepping
O	into
O	a
O	deer
O	trap
O	set
O	by
O	the
O	Indians
O	and
O	being
O	jerked
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	leg
O	.
O	How
O	the
O	women
O	must
O	have
O	laughed
O	as
O	they
O	told
O	about
O	the
O	first
O	Monday
O	morning
O	at
O	Cape
O	Cod
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	all
O	went
O	ashore
O	to
O	wash
O	their
O	clothes
O	!
O	It
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	big
O	washing
O	,
O	for
O	there
O	had
O	been
O	no
O	chance
O	to
O	do
O	it
O	at
O	sea
O	,
O	so
O	stormy
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	long
O	voyage
O	of
O	sixty-three
O	days
O	.
O	They
O	little
O	thought
O	that
O	Monday
O	would
O	afterward
O	be
O	kept
O	as
O	washday
O	.
O	Then
O	there
O	was
O	young
O	John
O	Howland
O	,
O	who
O	in
O	mid-ocean
O	fell
O	overboard
O	but
O	was
O	quick
O	enough
O	to
O	catch
O	hold
O	of
O	a
O	trailing
O	rope
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	after
O	dinner
O	he
O	invited
O	Elizabeth
O	Tilley
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	afterward
O	married
O	,
O	to
O	sail
O	over
O	to
O	Clarke
O	'
O	s
O	Island
O	and
O	return
O	by
O	moonlight
O	.
O	With
O	them
O	,
O	it
O	may
O	be
O	,
O	went
O	John
O	Alden
O	and
O	Priscilla
O	Mullins
O	,
O	whose
O	love
O	story
O	is
O	so
O	sweetly
O	told
O	by
O	Longfellow
O	.
O	One
O	proud
O	mother
O	,
O	we
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	,
O	showed
O	her
O	bright-eyed
O	boy
O	,
O	Peregrine
O	White
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	the
O	fun
O	went
O	on
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	daytime
O	the
O	young
O	men
O	ran
O	races
O	,
O	played
O	games
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	shooting
O	match
O	.
O	Every
O	night
O	the
O	Indians
O	sang
O	and
O	danced
O	for
O	their
O	friends;
O	and
O	to
O	make
O	things
O	still
O	more
O	lively
O	they
O	gave
O	every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	a
O	shrill
O	war
O	whoop
O	that
O	made
O	the
O	woods
O	echo
O	in
O	the
O	still
O	night
O	air
O	.
O	The
O	Indians
O	had
O	already
O	learned
O	to
O	love
O	and
O	fear
O	Captain
O	Miles
O	Standish
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	them
O	called
O	him
O	""""
O	Boiling
O	Water
O	""""
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	easily
O	made

O	Others

O	Captain
O	Shrimp
O	,
O	""""
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	small
O	size
O	.
O	Every
O	morning
O	the
O	shrewd
O	captain
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	armour
O	and
O	paraded
O	his
O	little
O	company
O	of
O	a
O	dozen
O	or
O	more
O	soldiers;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	fired
O	off
O	the
O	cannon
O	on
O	Burial
O	Hill
O	the
O	Indians
O	must
O	have
O	felt
O	that
O	the
O	English
O	were
O	men
O	of
O	might
O	thus
O	to
O	harness
O	up
O	thunder
O	and
O	lightning
O	.
O	During
O	this
O	week
O	of
O	fun
O	and
O	frolic
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	wonder
O	if
O	young
O	Jack
O	Billington
O	did
O	not
O	play
O	some
O	prank
O	on
O	the
O	Indians
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	the

O	who
O	fired

O	his

O	s
O	gun
O	one

O	,
O	in
O	the
O	crowded
O	cabin
O	of
O	the
O	_Mayflower_
O	.
O	The
O	third
O	day
O	came
O	.
O	Massasoit
O	had
O	been
O	well
O	treated
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	doubt
O	would
O	have
O	liked
O	to
O	stay
O	longer
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	said
O	he
O	could
O	stay
O	only
O	three
O	days
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	pipe
O	of
O	peace
O	was
O	silently
O	passed
O	around
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	taking
O	their
O	presents
O	of
O	glass
O	beads
O	and
O	trinkets
O	,
O	the
O	Indian
O	king
O	and
O	his
O	warriors
O	said
O	farewell
O	to
O	their
O	English
O	friends
O	and
O	began
O	their
O	long
O	tramp
O	through
O	the
O	woods
O	to
O	their
O	wigwams
O	on

O	On
O	the
O	last
O	day
O	of
O	this
O	Thanksgiving
O	party
O	the
O	Pilgrims
O	had
O	a
O	service
O	of
O	prayer
O	and
O	praise
O	.
O	Elder
O	Brewster
O	preached
O	the
O	first
O	Thanksgiving
O	sermon
O	.
O	After
O	thanking
O	God
O	for
O	all
O	his
O	goodness
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	forget
O	the
O	many
O	loved
O	ones
O	sleeping
O	on
O	the
O	hillside
O	.
O	He
O	spoke
O	of
O	noble
O	John
O	Carver
O	,
O	the
O	first
O	governor
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	died
O	of
O	worry
O	and
O	overwork
O	.
O	Nor
O	was
O	Rose
O	Standish
O	forgotten
O	,
O	the
O	lovely
O	young
O	wife
O	of
O	Captain
O	Miles
O	Standish
O	,
O	whose
O	death
O	was
O	caused
O	by
O	cold
O	and
O	lack
O	of
O	good
O	food
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	there
O	was
O	gentle
O	Dorothy
O	,
O	wife
O	of
O	Governor
O	Bradford
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	fallen
O	overboard
O	from
O	the
O	_Mayflower_
O	in

O	harbour
O	while

O	bleak
O	shore
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	a
O	place
O	for
O	a
O	home
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	Thanksgiving
O	took
O	place
O	nearly
O	three
O	hundred
O	years

O	.
O	Since
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	almost
O	without

O	,
O	Thanksgiving
O	has
O	been
O	kept
O	by
O	the

O	as
O	the
O	great
O	family

O	At
O	this
O	time
O	children

O	To-day

O	You
O	would
O	not
O	think
O	Fisherman
O	Jones
O	of
O	much

O	The

O	there

O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	Miltiades
O	.
O	To
O	catch
O	Miltiades
O	became
O	the
O	household
O	problem
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	heaven-born
O	inventor
O	set
O	wonderful

O	for
O	him
O	,
O	which
O	caught
O	almost
O	everything

O	Miltiades
O	,
O	who
O	easily
O	avoided
O	them
O	.
O	Eph
O	used
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	daily
O	before

O	and
O	chase
O	Miltiades
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	might
O	as
O	well
O	have
O	chased
O	a
O	government
O	position
O	.
O	The
O	turkey
O	scorned
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	grew
O	only
O	wilder
O	and
O	tougher
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	lean
O	and
O	hungry
O	look
O	that
O	would
O	have
O	shamed
O	Cassius
O	.
O	The
O	day
O	before
O	Thanksgiving
O	it
O	looked
O	as

O	there
O	would
O	be
O	no

O	at
O	Todd
O	'

O	breach
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	beautiful
O	Indian-summer
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	hobbled
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	field
O	for
O	an
O	afternoon
O	'

O	,
O	under

O	lurked
O	Miltiades

O	viewed

O	with

O	.
O	By

O	Fisherman

O	kicked
O	up
O	a

O	,

O	disclosed
O	beneath

O	a
O	fine
O	fat

O	blossoms
O	into
O	June
O	beetles
O	with
O	the

O	was
O	not
O	so
O	blind

O	saw
O	this
