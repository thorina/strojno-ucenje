O	exactly
O	how
O	many
O	,
O	many
O	years
O	ago
O	--
O	a
O	poor
O	Indian
O	was
O	living
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	children
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	beautiful
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	not
O	only
O	poor
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	the
O	misfortune
O	to
O	be
O	inexpert
O	in
O	procuring
O	food
O	for
O	his
O	family
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	children
O	were
O	all
O	too
O	young
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	assistance
O	.
O	Although
O	of
O	a
O	lowly
O	condition
O	and
O	straitened
O	in
O	his
O	circumstances
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	kind
O	and
O	contented
O	disposition
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	always
O	thankful
O	to
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	for
O	every
O	thing
O	he
O	received
O	.
O	He
O	even
O	stood
O	in
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	his
O	lodge
O	to
O	bless
O	the
O	birds
O	that
O	flew
O	past
O	in
O	the
O	summer
O	evenings
O	;
O	although
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	of
O	a
O	complaining
O	temper
O	,
O	he
O	might
O	have
O	repined
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	rather
O	spread
O	upon
O	the
O	table
O	for
O	his
O	evening
O	meal
O	.
O	The
O	same
O	gracious
O	and
O	sweet
O	disposition
O	was
O	inherited
O	by
O	his
O	eldest
O	son
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	now
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	proper
O	age
O	to
O	undertake
O	the
O	ceremony
O	of
O	the
O	fast
O	,
O	to
O	learn
O	what
O	kind
O	of
O	a
O	spirit
O	would
O	be
O	his
O	guide
O	and
O	guardian
O	through
O	life
O	.
O	Wunzh
O	,
O	for
O	this
O	was
O	his
O	name
O	,
O	had
O	been
O	an
O	obedient
O	boy
O	from
O	his
O	infancy
O	--
O	pensive
O	,
O	thoughtful
O	,
O	and
O	gentle
O	--
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	beloved
O	by
O	the
O	whole
O	family
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	first
O	buds
O	of
O	spring
O	appeared
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	delicious
O	fragrance
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	year
O	began
O	to
O	sweeten
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	his
O	younger
O	brothers
O	,
O	built
O	for
O	Wunzh
O	the
O	customary
O	little
O	lodge
O	,
O	at
O	a
O	retired
O	spot
O	at
O	some
O	distance
O	from
O	their
O	own
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	disturbed
O	during
O	the
O	solemn
O	rite
O	.
O	To
O	prepare
O	himself
O	,
O	Wunzh
O	sought
O	to
O	clear
O	his
O	heart
O	of
O	every
O	evil
O	thought
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	nothing
O	that
O	was
O	not
O	good
O	,
O	and
O	beautiful
O	,
O	and
O	kindly
O	.
O	That
O	he
O	might
O	store
O	his
O	mind
O	with
O	pleasant
O	ideas
O	for
O	his
O	dreams
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	few
O	days
O	he
O	amused
O	himself
O	by
O	walking
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	and
O	over
O	the
O	mountains
O	,
O	examining
O	the
O	early
O	plants
O	and
O	flowers
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	rambled
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	wild
O	country
O	,
O	he
O	felt
O	a
O	strong
O	desire
O	to
O	know
O	how
O	the
O	plants
O	and
O	herbs
O	and
O	berries
O	grew
O	,
O	without
O	any
O	aid
O	from
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	why
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	some
O	kinds
O	were
O	good
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	others
O	were
O	possessed
O	of
O	medicinal
O	or
O	poisonous
O	power
O	.
O	After
O	he
O	had
O	become
O	too
O	languid
O	to
O	walk
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	confined
O	himself
O	strictly
O	to
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	he
O	recalled
O	these
O	thoughts
O	,
O	and
O	turning
O	them
O	in
O	his
O	mind
O	,
O	he
O	wished
O	he
O	could
O	dream
O	of
O	something
O	that
O	would
O	prove
O	a
O	benefit

O	On
O	the
O	third

O	Wunzh
O	became
O	weak
O	and
O	faint
O	,
O	and
O	kept
O	his
O	bed
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	he
O	fancied
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	lay
O	thus
O	,
O	that
O	a
O	bright

O	came

O	,
O	and
O	ere
O	he
O	was
O	aware
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	handsome
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	complexion
O	of
O	the
O	softest

O	white
O	,
O	coming
O	down
O	from

O	and
O	advancing
O	toward

O	.
O	The
O	beautiful
O	stranger
O	was
O	richly
O	and
O	gayly
O	dressed
O	,
O	having
O	on
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	garments
O	of

O	yellow
O	colors
O	,
O	but
O	differing
O	in
O	their
O	deeper

O	.
O	He
O	had
O	a

O	on
O	his
O	head
O	,

O	were
O	graceful
O	,

O	Wunzh
O	of
O	the
O	deep

O	after
O	a

O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	you
O	have
O	prevailed
O	against

O	you
O	will
O	strip
O	off

O	never

O	then
O	shook
O	Wunzh
O	by
O	the

O	disappeared

O	he

O	In

O	'

O	came
O	to
O	his

O	with
O	some
O	slight

O	,

O	:

O	``
O	At
O	his
O	usual
O	hour
O	of
O	appearing
O	,
O	the
O	beautiful
O	sky-visitor
O	returned
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	trial
O	of
O	strength
O	was
O	renewed
O	.
O	Although
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	availed
O	himself
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	offer
O	of
O	food
O	,
O	Wunzh
O	felt
O	that
O	new
O	strength
O	had
O	been
O	given
O	him
O	.
O	His
O	heart
O	was
O	mighty
O	within
O	him
O	to
O	achieve
O	some
O	great
O	purpose
O	.
O	Courage
O	was
O	like
O	the
O	eagle
O	that
O	spreads
O	his
O	wings
O	within
O	the
O	tree-top
O	for
O	a
O	great
O	flight
O	,
O	within
O	the
O	bosom
O	of
O	the
O	brave
O	Wunzh
O	.
O	He
O	grasped
O	his
O	angel
O	challenger
O	with
O	supernatural
O	strength
O	,
O	threw
O	him
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	mindful
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	instructions
O	,
O	tore
O	from
O	him
O	his
O	beautiful
O	garments
O	and
O	plume
O	,
O	and
O	finding
O	him
O	dead
O	,
O	he
O	immediately
O	buried
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	spot
O	,
O	using
O	all
O	the
O	precautions
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	told
O	of
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	confident
O	was
O	Wunzh
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	,
O	that
O	his
O	friend
O	would
O	again
O	come
O	to
O	life
O	.
O	Wunzh
O	now
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	lodge
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	warmly
O	welcomed
O	,
O	for
O	as
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	appointed
O	to
O	him
O	during
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	his
O	fasting
O	to
O	walk
O	apart
O	with
O	Heaven
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	permitted
O	to
O	see
O	any
O	human
O	face
O	save
O	that
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	the
O	representative
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	household
O	upon
O	earth
O	of
O	the
O	Good
O	Father
O	who
O	is
O	in
O	Heaven
O	.
O	Wunzh
O	partook
O	sparingly
O	of
O	the
O	meal
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	prepared
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	once
O	more
O	mingled
O	in
O	the
O	cares
O	and
O	sports
O	of
O	the
O	family
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	never
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	forgot
O	the
O	grave
O	of
O	his
O	friend
O	.
O	He
O	carefully
O	visited
O	it
O	throughout
O	the
O	spring
O	,
O	and
O	weeded
O	out
O	the
O	grass
O	,
O	and
O	kept
O	the
O	ground
O	in
O	a
O	soft
O	and
O	pliant
O	state
O	;
O	and
O	sometimes
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	brave
O	Wunzh
O	thought
O	of
O	his
O	friend
O	that
O	was
O	gone
O	from
O	his
O	sight
O	,
O	he
O	dropped
O	a
O	tear
O	upon
O	the
O	earth
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	.
O	Watching
O	and
O	tending
O	,
O	and
O	moistening
O	the
O	earth
O	with
O	his
O	tears
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	Wunzh
O	saw
O	the
O	tops
O	of
O	green
O	plumes
O	coming
O	through
O	the
O	ground
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	more
O	faithful
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	obeying
O	his
O	instructions
O	in
O	keeping
O	the
O	ground
O	in
O	order
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	cherishing
O	the
O	memory
O	of
O	his
O	departed
O	friend
O	,
O	the
O	faster
O	they
O	grew
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	careful
O	to
O	conceal
O	the
O	charge
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	from
O	his
O	father
O	.
O	Days
O	and
O	weeks
O	had
O	passed
O	in
O	this
O	way
O	;
O	the
O	summer
O	was
O	drawing
O	toward
O	a
O	close
O	,
O	when
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	long
O	absence
O	in
O	hunting
O	,
O	Wunzh
O	invited
O	his
O	father
O	to
O	follow
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	quiet
O	and
O	lonesome
O	spot
O	of
O	his
O	former
O	fast
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	fasting-lodge
O	had
O	been
O	removed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	weeds
O	kept
O	from
O	growing
O	on
O	the
O	circle
O	where
O	it
O	had
O	stood
O	;
O	but
O	in
O	its
O	place
O	rose
O	a
O	tall
O	and
O	graceful
O	plant
O	,
O	surmounted
O	with
O	nodding
O	plumes
O	and
O	stately
O	leaves
O	,
O	and
O	golden
O	clusters
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	in
O	its
O	aspect
O	and
O	bearing
O	the
O	deep
O	green
O	of
O	the
O	summer
O	grass
O	,
O	the
O	clear
O	amber
O	of
O	the
O	summer
O	sky
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	gentle
O	blowing
O	of
O	the
O	summer
O	wind
O	.
O	``
O	It
O	is
O	my
O	friend
O	!
O	``
O	shouted
O	Wunzh
O	,
O	``
O	it
O	is
O	the
O	friend
O	of
O	all

O	It
O	is

O	We
O	need
O	no
O	longer
O	rely
O	on
O	hunting
O	alone
O	,
O	for
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	this
O	gift
O	is
O	cherished
O	and
O	taken
O	care
O	of
O	,
O	the

O	will
O	give
O	us
O	a

O	``
O	He
O	then
O	pulled
O	an
O	ear
O	.
O	``
O	See

O	said
O	he
O	,
O	``

O	Great
O	Spirit

O	listened
O	to
O	my

O	and
O	sent
O	us
O	something
O	new
O	,

O	will
O	not
O	alone
O	depend
O	upon

O	upon

O	.
O	``
O	Wunzh
O	then
O	communicated
O	to
O	his
O	father
O	the
O	instructions
O	given
O	to
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	stranger
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	broad
O	husks
O	must
O	be
O	torn
O	away
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	pulled
O	off
O	the
O	garments
O	in
O	his
O	wrestling
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	done
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	directed
O	him
O	how
O	the
O	ear
O	must
O	be
O	held
O	before
O	the
O	fire
O	till
O	the
O	outer
O	skin
O	became
O	brown
O	--
O	as

O	while
O	all

O	The
O	whole
