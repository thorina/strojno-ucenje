O	arrived
O	,

O	my
O	Cid
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	King
O	Don

O	saw
O	that

O	After

O	assembled
O	together
O	all

O	And
O	the

O	much

O	.
O	At
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	Cid
O	was
O	gathering
O	strength

O	;

O	the
O	Moors
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	heard
O	this
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	fly
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Cid
O	followed
O	them
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	Toledo
O	,
O	slaying
O	and
O	burning
O	,
O	and
O	plundering
O	and
O	destroying
O	,
O	and
O	laying
O	hands
O	on
O	all
O	whom
O	he
O	found
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	brought

O	and
O	women
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	people
O	returned
O	rich
O	and
O	with
O	great
O	honour
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Toledo
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	hurt
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	received
O	at
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	Cid

O	sent
O	to
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	to
O	complain
O	thereof
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	King
O	was
O	greatly
O	troubled
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	went
O	with
O	all
O	speed
O	to
O	Burgos
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	from
O	thence
O	to
O	bid
O	the
O	Cid
O	come
O	unto
O	him
O	.
O	Now
O	my
O	Cid
O	knew
O	the
O	evil
O	disposition

O	the
O	King
O	toward
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	received
O	his

O	he
O	made
O	answer
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	meet
O	him
O	between
O	Burgos
O	and
O	Bivar
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	King
O	went
O	out
O	from
O	Burgos
O	and
O	came
O	nigh
O	unto
O	Bivar
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	Cid
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	kissed
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	King
O	withheld
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	angrily
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	``
O	Ruydiez
O	,
O	quit
O	my
O	land
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	Cid
O	clapt
O	spurs
O	to
O	the
O	mule
O	upon
O	which
O	he
O	rode
O	,
O	and
O	vaulted
O	into
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	ground
O	which
O	was
O	his
O	own
O	inheritance
O	,
O	and
O	answered
O	,
O	``

O	And
O	the

O	replied
O	full
O	wrathfully

O	And
O	the

O	The
O	counts
O	were
O	well

O	at
O	this
O	;
O	but
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	of

O	were
O	sorrowful

O	And
O	then
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	the
O	Cid
O	parted
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Cid
O	sent
O	for

O	when

O	which
O	had
O	been
O	divided
O	,
O	making
O	great
O	gain
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	all
O	who
O	were
O	in
O	my
O	Cid
O	'
O	s
O	company
O	were
O	full
O	rich
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	my
O	Cid
O	was
O	joyous
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	sent
O	to
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	,
O	telling
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	companions
O	would
O	yet
O	do
O	him
O	service
O	upon
O	the
O	Moors
O	.
O	Then
O	my
O	Cid
O	assembled
O	together
O	his
O	good
O	men
O	and
O	said
O	unto
O	them
O	,
O	``
O	Friends
O	,
O	we
O	can
O	not
O	take
O	up
O	our
O	abode
O	in
O	this
O	castle
O	,
O	for
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	water
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	moreover
O	the
O	King
O	is
O	at
O	peace
O	with
O	these
O	Moors
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	know
O	that
O	the
O	treaty
O	between
O	them
O	hath
O	been
O	written
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	if
O	we
O	should
O	abide
O	here
O	he
O	would
O	come
O	against
O	us
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	power
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	the
O	Moors
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	could
O	not
O	stand
O	against
O	him
O	.
O	If
O	therefore
O	it
O	seem
O	good
O	unto
O	you
O	,
O	let
O	us
O	leave
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	our
O	prisoners
O	here
O	,
O	that
O	we
O	may
O	be
O	free
O	from
O	all
O	encumbrance
O	,
O	like
O	men
O	who
O	are
O	to
O	live
O	by
O	war
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	it
O	pleased
O	them
O	well
O	that
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	so
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	``
O	Ye
O	have
O	all
O	had
O	your
O	shares
O	,
O	neither
O	is
O	there
O	anything
O	owing
O	to
O	any
O	one
O	among
O	ye
O	.
O	Now
O	then
O	let
O	us
O	be
O	ready
O	to
O	take
O	horse
O	betimes
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	would
O	not
O	fight
O	against
O	my
O	Lord
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	horse
O	and
O	departed
O	,
O	being
O	rich
O	with
O	the
O	spoils
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	won
O	:
O	and
O	they
O	left
O	the
O	castle
O	to
O	the
O	Moors
O	,
O	who
O	remained
O	blessing
O	them
O	for
O	this
O	bounty
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	received
O	at
O	their
O	hands
O	.
O	Then
O	my
O	Cid
O	and
O	his
O	company
O	went
O	up
O	the
O	Henares
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	go
O	;
O	great
O	were
O	the
O	spoils
O	which
O	they
O	collected
O	as
O	they
O	went
O	along
O	.
O	And
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	they
O	came
O	against
O	Alcocer
O	.
O	There
O	my
O	Cid
O	pitched
O	his
O	tents
O	upon
O	a
O	round
O	hill
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	hill
O	and
O	a
O	strong
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	river
O	Salon
O	ran
O	near
O	them
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	water
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	cut
O	off
O	.
O	My
O	Cid
O	thought
O	to
O	take
O	Alcocer
O	:
O	so
O	he
O	pitched
O	his
O	tents
O	securely
O	,
O	having
O	the
O	Sierra
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	river
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	made
O	all
O	his
O	people
O	dig
O	a
O	trench
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	alarmed
O	,
O	neither
O	by
O	day
O	nor
O	by
O	night
O	.
O	When
O	my
O	Cid
O	had
O	thus
O	encamped
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	the
O	Alcazar
O	,
O	and
O	see
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	by
O	any
O	means
O	enter
O	it
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Moors
O	offered
O	tribute
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	leave
O	them
O	in
O	peace
O	;
O	but
O	this
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	do
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	lay
O	before
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	And
O	news
O	went
O	through
O	all
O	the
O	land
O	that
O	the
O	Cid
O	was
O	come
O	among
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	my
O	Cid
O	lay
O	before
O	Alcocer
O	fifteen
O	weeks
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	town
O	did
O	not
O	surrender
O	,
O	he
O	ordered
O	his
O	people
O	to
O	break
O	up
O	their
O	camp
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	flying
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	took
O	their
O	way
O	along
O	the
O	Salon
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	banners
O	spread
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	Moors
O	saw
O	this
O	they
O	rejoiced
O	greatly
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	praised
O	themselves
O	for
O	what
O	they
O	had
O	done
O	in
O	withstanding
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	the
O	Cid
O	'
O	s
O	bread
O	and
O	barley
O	had
O	failed
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	fled
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	tents
O	behind
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	said
O	among
O	themselves
O	,
O	``
O	Let
O	us
O	pursue
O	them
O	and
O	spoil
O	them
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	they
O	went
O	out
O	after
O	him
O	,
O	great
O	and
O	little
O	,
O	leaving
O	the
O	gates
O	open
O	and
O	shouting
O	as
O	they
O	went
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	left
O	in
O	the
O	town
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	could
O	bear
O	arms
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	my
O	Cid
O	saw
O	them
O	coming
O	he
O	gave
O	orders
O	to
O	quicken
O	their
O	speed
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	fear
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	let
O	his
O	people
O	turn
O	till
O	the
O	Moors
O	were
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	distance
O	between
O	them
O	and
O	the
O	gates
O	,
O	he
O	bade
O	his
O	banner
O	turn
O	,
O	and
O	spurred
O	toward
O	them
O	crying
O	,
O	``
O	Lay
O	on

O	knights
O	,

O	``
O	God

O	theirs
O	that
O	morning

O	My
O	Cid
O	'

O	in
O	one
O	hour
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	space
O	,
O	three
O	hundred
O	Moors
O	were
O	slain
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	Cid
O	won
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	and

O	his
O	banner
O	upon
O	the
O	highest
O	point
O	of
O	the

O	``
O	And
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	Alvar
O	Fanez
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	knights
O	,
O	``

O	In

O	win

O	In

O	returned

O	rode
O	up

O	.
O	God
O	,

O	was
O	that
O	whole

O	Alvar
O	Fanez
O	was
O	returned

O	with
O	the
O	fleecy
O	beard
O	,
O	that
O	Minaya
O	had
O	purchased
O	the

O	had
O	brought

O	the

O	daughters
O	!
O	God
O	,
O	what
O	a
O	joyful
O	man
O	was
O	he
O	!
O	Now
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	King
O	Almudafar
O	were
O	fulfilled
O	:
O	and
O	he
O	left
O	his
O	two
O	sons
O	Zulema
O	and
O	Abenalfange
O	,
O	and
O	Zulema
O	had
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Zaragoza
O	,
O	and
O	Abenalfange
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Denia
O	.
O	And
O	Zulema
O	put
O	his
O	kingdom
O	under
O	my
O	Cid
O	'
O	s
O	protection
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	all
O	his
O	people
O	obey
O	him
O	even
O	as
O	they
O	would
O	himself
O	.
O	Now
O	there
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	great
O	enmity
O	between
O	the
O	two
O	brethren
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	made
O	war
O	upon
O	each
O	other
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Count
O	Don
O	Ramon
O	Berenguer
O	of
O	Barcelona
O	helped
O	Abenalfange
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	enemy
O	to
O	the
O	Cid
O	because
O	he
O	defended
O	Zulema
O	.
O	And
O	my
O	Cid
O	chose
O	out
O	two
O	hundred
O	horsemen
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	by
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	lands
O	of
O	Alcaniz
O	and
O	brought
O	away
O	great
O	booty
O	.
O	Great
O	was
O	the
O	talk
O	among
O	the
O	Moors
O	;
O	how
O	my
O	Cid
O	was
O	over-running
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	When
O	Don
O	Ramon
O	Berenguer
O	the
O	Count
O	of
O	Barcelona
O	heard
O	this
O	,
O	it
O	troubled
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	held
O	it
O	for
O	a
O	great
O	dishonour
O	,
O	because
O	that
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	Moors
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	keeping
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	spake
O	boastfully
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	Great
O	wrong
O	doth
O	that
O	Cid
O	of
O	Bivar
O	offer
O	unto
O	me
O	;
O	he
O	ravages
O	the
O	lands
O	which
O	are
O	in
O	my
O	keeping
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	have
O	never
O	renounced
O	his
O	friendship
O	;
O	but
O	since
O	he
O	goes
O	on
O	in
O	this
O	way
O	I
O	must
O	take
O	vengeance
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	he
O	and
O	King
O	Abenalfange
O	gathered
O	together
O	a
O	great
O	power
O	both
O	of
O	Moors
O	and
O	Christians
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	in
O	pursuit
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	three
O	days
O	and
O	two
O	nights
O	they
O	came
O	up
O	with
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	pine-forest
O	of
O	Tebar
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	Cid
O	heard
O	this
O	he
O	sent
O	to
O	Don
O	Ramon
O	saying
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	booty
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	won
O	was
O	none
O	of
O	his
O	,
O	and
O	bidding
O	him
O	let
O	him
O	go
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	in
O	peace
O	:
O	but
O	the
O	Count
O	made
O	answer
O	,
O	that
O	my
O	Cid
O	should
O	now
O	learn
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	dishonoured
O	.
O	Then
O	my
O	Cid
O	sent
O	the
O	booty
O	forward
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	his
O	knights
O	make
O	ready
O	.
O	``
O	They
O	are
O	coming
O	upon
O	us

O	``
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	with
O	a
O	great

O	``
O	While
O	my

O	his

O	had
O	taken

O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	ready
O	on
O	horseback
O	for
O	the
O	charge
O	.
O	Presently
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	Frenchmen
O	coming
O	down
O	the
O	hill
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	yet
O	set
O	foot
O	upon
O	the

O	ground
O	,
O	my

O	,
O	which
O	they
O	did
O	with
O	a
O	right
O	good

O	s
O	good

O	not
O	a
O	man
O	whom
O	they
O	encountered
O	but
O	lost
O	his

O	.
O	The
O	Count
O	'
O	s
O	people
O	stood
O	firm
O	round
O	their
O	Lord
O	;
O	but
O	my
O	Cid
O	was
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	clearing
O	the
O	way
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	such
O	a
O	stroke
O	with
O	his
O	lance
O	that
O	he
O	felled
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	Frenchmen
O	saw
O	their
O	Lord
O	in
O	this
O	plight
O	they
O	fled
O	away
O	and
O	left
O	him
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	pursuit
O	lasted
O	three
O	leagues
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	continued
O	farther
O	if
O	the
O	conquerors
O	had
O	not
O	had
O	tired
O	horses
O	.
O	Thus
O	was
O	Count
O	Ramon
O	Berenguer
O	made
O	prisoner
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	Cid
O	won
O	from
O	him
O	that
O	day
O	the
O	good
O	sword
O	Colada
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	worth
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	thousand
O	marks
O	of
O	silver
O	.
O	That
O	night
O	did
O	my
O	Cid
O	and
O	his
O	men
O	make
O	merry
O	,
O	rejoicing
O	over
O	their
O	gains
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Count
O	was
O	taken
O	to
O	my
O	Cid
O	'
O	s
O	tent
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	good
O	supper
O	was
O	set
O	before
O	him
O	;
O	nevertheless
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	eat
O	,
O	though
O	my
O	Cid
O	besought
O	him
O	so
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	And
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	my
O	Cid
O	ordered
O	a
O	feast
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	do
O	pleasure
O	to
O	the
O	Count
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	Count
O	said
O	that
O	for
O	all
O	Spain
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	eat
O	one
O	mouthful
O	,
O	but
O	would
O	rather
O	die
O	,
O	since
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	beaten
O	in
O	battle
O	by
O	such
O	a
O	set
O	of
O	ragged
O	fellows
O	.
O	And
O	Ruydiez
O	said
O	to

O	,
O	``
O	Eat

O	And
O	in
O	this

O	he
O	continued
O	for
O	three
O	days
O	,
O	refusing
O	all
O	food
O	.
O	But
O	then
O	my
O	Cid
O	said

O	and
O	the
O	three
O	hundred
O	of
O	silver
O	as
O	the
O	Cid
O	had
O	commanded
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	besought
O	them
O	to
O	forgive
O	the
O	Cid
O	the
O	deceit
O	of
O	the
O	chests
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	done
O	because
O	of
O	his
O	great
O	necessity
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	said
O	they
O	heartily
O	forgave
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	themselves
O	well
O	paid
O	;
O	and
O	they
O	prayed
O	God
O	to
O	grant
O	him
O	long
O	life
O	and
O	good
O	health
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	power
O	to
O	advance
O	Christendom
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	down
O	Pagandom
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	known
O	through
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Burgos
O	the
O	goodness
O	and
O	the
O	gentleness
O	which
O	the
O	Cid
O	had
O	shown
O	to
O	these
O	merchants
O	in
O	redeeming
O	from
O	them
O	the
O	chests
O	full
O	of
O	sand
O	and
O	earth
O	and
O	stones
O	,
O	the
O	people
O	held
O	it
O	for
O	a
O	great
O	wonder
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	place
O	in
O	all
O	Burgos
O	where
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	talk
O	of
O	the
O	gentleness
O	and
O	loyalty
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	;
O	and
O	they
O	besought
O	blessings
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	prayed
O	that
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	people
O	might
O	be
O	advanced
O	in
O	honour
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	done
O	this
O	,
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	monastery
O	of
O	St
O	.
O	Pedro
O	de
O	Cardena
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	porter
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	went
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	order
O	everywhere
O	that
O	everything
O	which
O	they
O	wanted
O	should
O	be
O	given
O	them
O	.
O	If
O	they
O	were
O	well
O	received
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	there
O	was
O	great
O	joy
O	in
O	St
O	.
O	Pedro
O	de
O	Cardena
O	over
O	them
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	a
O	thing
O	to
O	ask
O	,
O	for
O	Dona
O	Ximena
O	and
O	her
O	daughters
O	were
O	like
O	people
O	beside
O	themselves
O	with
O	the
O	great
O	joy
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	came
O	running
O	out
O	on
O	foot
O	to
O	meet
O	them
O	,
O	weeping
O	plenteously
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	long
O	life-time
O	of
O	adventure
O	the
O	Cid
O	sickened
O	of
O	a
O	malady
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	day
O	before
O	his
O	weakness
O	waxed
O	great
O	,
O	he
O	ordered
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	Valencia
O	to
O	be
O	shut
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	to

O	returned

O	more
O	encouraged
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	making
O	engines
O	wherewith
O	to
O	combat
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	while
O	the
O	company
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	were
O	preparing
O	all
O	things
O	to
O	go
O	into
O	Castille
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	commanded
O	before
O	his
O	death
O	;
O	and
O	his
O	trusty
O	Gil
O	Diaz
O	did
O	nothing
O	else
O	but
O	labour
O	at
O	this
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	was
O	prepared
O	and
O	the
O	virtue
O	of
O	the
O	balsam
O	and
O	myrrh
O	was
O	such
O	that
O	the
O	flesh
O	remained
O	firm
O	and
O	fair
O	,
O	having
O	its
O	natural
O	colour
O	and
O	his
O	countenance
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	wont
O	to
O	be
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	eyes
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	long
O	beard
O	in
O	order
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	would
O	have
O	thought
O	him
O	dead
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	on
O	the
O	second
O	day
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	departed
O	,
O	Gil
O	Diaz
O	placed
O	the
O	body
O	upon
O	a
O	right
O	noble
O	saddle
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	took
O	two
O	boards
O	and
O	fitted
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	body
O	,
O	one
O	to
O	the
O	breast
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	to
O	the
O	shoulders
O	;
O	these
O	were
O	so
O	hollowed
O	out
O	and
O	fitted
O	that
O	they
O	met
O	at
O	the
O	sides
O	and
O	under
O	the
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	these
O	boards
O	were
O	fastened
O	into
O	the
O	saddle
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	body
O	could
O	not
O	move
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	was
O	done
O	by
O	the
O	morning
O	of
O	the
O	twelfth
O	day
O	;
O	and
O	all
O	that
O	day
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	were
O	busied
O	in
O	making
O	ready
O	their
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	loading
O	beasts
O	with
O	all
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	midnight
O	they
O	took
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	fastened
O	to
O	the
O	saddle
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	it
O	upon
O	his
O	horse
O	Bavieca
O	,
O	and
O	fastened
O	the
O	saddle
O	well
O	:
O	and
O	the
O	body
O	sate
O	so
O	upright
O	and
O	well
O	that
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	was
O	alive
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	had
O	on
O	painted
O	hose
O	of
O	black
O	and
O	white
O	,
O	so
O	cunningly
O	painted
O	that
O	no
O	man
O	who
O	saw
O	them
O	would
O	have
O	thought
O	but
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	grieves
O	,
O	unless
O	he
O	had
O	laid
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	them
O	;
O	and
O	they
O	put
O	on
O	it
O	a
O	surcoat
O	of
O	green
O	sendal
O	,
O	having
O	his
O	arms
O	blazoned
O	thereon
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	helmet
O	of
O	parchment
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	cunningly
O	painted
O	that
O	every
O	one
O	might
O	have
O	believed
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	iron
O	;
O	and
O	his
O	shield
O	was
O	hung
O	around
O	his
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	placed
O	the
O	sword
O	Tizona
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	raised
O	his
O	arm
O	,
O	and
O	fastened
O	it
O	up
O	so
O	subtly
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	marvel
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	upright
O	he
O	held
O	the
O	sword
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Bishop
O	Don
O	Hieronymo
O	went
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	trusty
O	Gil
O	Diaz
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	led
O	the
O	horse
O	Bavieca
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	Cid
O	had
O	commanded
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	all
O	this
O	had
O	been
O	made
O	ready
O	,
O	they
O	went
O	out
O	from
O	Valencia
O	at
O	midnight
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	Roseros
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	towards
O	Castille
O	.
O	Pero
O	Bermudez
O	went
O	first
O	with
O	the
O	banner
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	him
O	five
O	hundred
O	knights
O	who
O	guarded
O	it
O	,
O	all
O	well
O	appointed
O	.
O	Then
O	came
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	with
O	an
O	hundred
O	knights
O	,
O	all
O	chosen
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	behind
O	them
O	Dona
O	Ximena
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	company
O	,
O	and
O	six
O	hundred
O	knights
O	in
O	the
O	rear
O	.
O	All
O	these
O	went
O	out
O	so
O	silently
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	such
O	a
O	measured
O	pace
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	there
O	were
O	only
O	a
O	score
O	.
O	And
O	by
O	the
O	time
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	all
O	gone
O	out
O	it
O	was
O	broad
O	day
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	Bishop
O	Don
O	Hieronymo
O	and
O	Gil
O	Diaz
O	led
O	away
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	and
O	Dona
O	Ximena
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	baggage
O	,
O	Alvar
O	Fanez
O	Minaya
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	Moors
O	.
O	First
O	he
O	attacked
O	the
O	tents
O	of
O	that
O	Moorish
O	Queen
O	,
O	the
O	Negress
O	,
O	who
O	lay
O	nearest
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	;
O	and
O	this
O	onset
O	was
O	so
O	sudden
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	killed
O	full
O	a
O	hundred
O	and
O	fifty
O	Moors
O	before
O	they
O	had
O	time
O	to
O	take
O	arms
O	or
O	go
O	to
O	horse
O	.
O	But
O	that
O	Moorish
O	Negress
O	,
O	so
O	skilful
O	in
O	drawing
O	the
O	Turkish
O	bow
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	called
O	her
O	the
O	Star
O	of
O	the
O	Archers
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	that
O	got
O	on
O	horseback
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	some
O	fifty
O	that
O	were
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	did
O	some
O	hurt
O	to
O	the
O	company
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	;
O	but
O	in
O	fine
O	they
O	slew
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	people
O	fled
O	to
O	the
O	camp
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	great
O	was
O	the
O	uproar
O	and
O	confusion
O	,
O	that
O	few
O	there
O	were
O	who
O	took
O	arms
O	,
O	but
O	instead
O	thereof
O	they
O	turned
O	their
O	backs
O	and
O	fled
O	toward
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	King
O	Bucar
O	and
O	his
O	Kings
O	saw
O	this
O	they
O	were
O	astonished
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	them
O	that
O	there
O	came
O	against
O	them
O	on
O	the
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	Christians
O	full
O	seventy
O	thousand
O	knights
O	,
O	all
O	as
O	white
O	as
O	snow
O	:
O	and
O	before
O	them
O	a
O	knight
O	of
O	great
O	stature
O	upon
O	a
O	white
O	horse
O	.
O	And
O	King
O	Bucar
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	Kings
O	were
O	so
O	greatly
O	dismayed
O	that
O	they
O	never
O	checked
O	the
O	reins
O	till
O	they
O	had
O	ridden
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	company
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	rode
O	after
O	them
O	,
O	smiting
O	and
O	slaying
O	and
O	giving
O	them
O	,
O	no
O	respite
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	Moors
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	so
O	great
O	was
O	the
O	press
O	among
O	them
O	to
O	get
O	to
O	the
O	ships
O	,
O	that
O	more
O	than
O	ten
O	thousand
O	died
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	And
O	King
O	Bucar
O	and
O	they
O	who
O	escaped
O	with
O	him
O	hoisted
O	sails
O	and
O	went
O	their
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	more
O	turned
O	their
O	heads
O	.
O	Then
O	Alvar
O	Fanez
O	and
O	his
O	people
O	went
O	after
O	the
O	Bishop
O	Don
O	Hieronymo
O	and
O	Gil
O	Diaz
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	and
O	Dona
O	Ximena
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	baggage
O	,
O	had
O	gone
O	on
O	till
O	they
O	were
O	clear
O	of
O	the
O	host
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	waited
O	for
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	gone
O	against
O	the
O	Moors
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	great
O	was
O	the
O	spoil
O	,
O	gold
O	,
O	and
O	silver
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	precious
O	things
O	that
O	the
O	poorest
O	man
O	among
O	the
O	Christians
O	,
O	horseman
O	or
O	on
O	foot
O	,
O	became
O	rich
O	with
O	what
O	he
O	won
O	that
O	day
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	met
O	together
O	,
O	they
O	took
O	the
O	road
O	toward
O	Castille
O	;
O	and
O	they
O	halted
O	that
O	night
O	in
O	a
O	village
O	which
O	is
O	called
O	Siete
O	Aguas
O	,
O	that
O	is
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	the
O	Seven
O	Waters
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	nine
O	leagues
O	from
O	Valencia
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	company
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	departed
O	from
O	the
O	Siete
O	Aguas
O	,
O	they
O	held
O	their
O	way
O	by
O	short
O	journeys
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Cid
O	went
O	alway
O	upon
O	his
O	horse
O	Bavieca
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	out
O	from
O	Valencia
O	,
O	save
O	only
O	that
O	he
O	wore
O	no
O	arms
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	clad
O	in
O	right
O	noble
O	garments
O	,
O	Great
O	was
O	the
O	concourse
O	of
O	people
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	Cid
O	Ruydiez
O	coming
O	in
O	that
O	guise
O	.
O	They
O	came
O	from
O	all
O	the
O	country
O	round
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	him
O	their
O	wonder
O	was
O	the
O	greater
O	,
O	and
O	hardly
O	could
O	they
O	be
O	persuaded
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	dead
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	time
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	abode
O	in
O	Toledo
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	letters
O	came
O	unto
O	him
O	saying
O	how
O	the
O	Cid
O	Campeador
O	was
O	departed
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	what
O	manner
O	he
O	had
O	discomfited
O	King
O	Bucar
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	they
O	brought
O	him
O	in
O	this
O	goodly
O	manner
O	upon
O	his
O	horse
O	Bavieca
O	,
O	he
O	set
O	out
O	from
O	Toledo
O	,
O	taking
O	long
O	journeys
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	San
O	Pedro
O	de
O	Cardena
O	to
O	do
O	honour
O	to
O	the
O	Cid
O	at
O	his
O	funeral
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	saw
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	company
O	and
O	in
O	such
O	goodly
O	array
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Cid
O	Ruydiez
O	so
O	nobly
O	clad
O	and
O	upon
O	his
O	horse
O	Bavieca
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	greatly
O	astonished
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	King
O	beheld
O	his
O	countenance
O	,
O	and
O	seeing
O	it
O	so
O	fresh
O	and
O	comely
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	eyes
O	so
O	bright
O	and
O	fair
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	even
O	and
O	open
O	that
O	he
O	seemed
O	alive
O	,
O	he
O	marvelled
O	greatly
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	after
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	interred
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	King
O	heard
O	what
O	Dona
O	Ximena
O	had
O	said
O	,
O	that
O	while
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	fair
O	and
O	comely
O	it
O	should
O	not
O	be
O	laid
O	in
O	a
O	coffin
O	,
O	he
O	held
O	that
O	what
O	she
O	said
O	was
O	good
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	sent
O	for
O	the
O	ivory
O	chair
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	carried
O	to
O	the
O	Cortes
O	of
O	Toledo
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	order
O	that
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	placed
O	on
O	the
O	right
O	of
O	the
O	altar
O	of
O	St
O	.
O	Peter
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	laid
O	a
O	cloth
O	of
O	gold
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	ordered
O	a
O	graven
O	tabernacle
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	over
O	the
O	chair
O	,
O	richly
O	wrought
O	with
O	azure
O	and
O	gold
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Navarre
O	and
O	the
O	Infante
O	of
O	Aragon
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Bishop
O	Don
O	Hieronymo
O	,
O	to
O	do
O	honour
O	to
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	helped
O	to
O	take
O	his
O	body
O	from
O	between
O	the
O	two
O	boards
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	fastened
O	at
O	Valencia
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	taken
O	it
O	out
O	,
O	the
O	body
O	was
O	so
O	firm
O	that
O	it
O	bent
O	not
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	flesh
O	so
O	firm
O	and
O	comely
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	yet
O	alive
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	King
O	thought
O	that
O	what
O	they
O	purported
O	to
O	do
O	and
O	had
O	thus
O	begun
O	,
O	might
O	full
O	well
O	be
O	effected
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	clad
O	the
O	body
O	in
O	cloth
O	of
O	purple
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	Soldan
O	of
O	Persia
O	had
O	sent
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	him
O	on
O	hose
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	ivory
O	chair
O	;
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	left
O	hand
O	they
O	placed
O	his
O	sword
O	Tizona
O	in
O	its
O	scabbard
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	strings
O	of
O	his
O	mantle
O	in
O	his
O	right
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	this
O	fashion
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	remained
O	there
O	ten
O	years
O	and
O	more
O	,
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	taken
O	thence
O	and
O	buried
O	.
O	Gil
O	Diaz
O	took
O	great
O	delight
O	in
O	tending
O	the
O	horse
O	Bavieca
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	few
O	days
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	lead
O	him
O	to
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	bring
O	him
O	back
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	hand
O	.
O	And
O	from
O	the
O	day
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	dead
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	was
O	taken
O	off
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	never
O	man
O	was
O	suffered
O	to
O	bestride
O	that
O	horse
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	alway
O	led
O	when
O	they
O	took
O	him
O	to
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	brought
O	him
O	back
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	good
O	horse
O	lived
O	two
O	years
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	after
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	his
O	master
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	died
O	also
O	,
O	having
O	lived
O	full
O	forty
O	years
O	.
O	And
O	Gil
O	Diaz
O	buried
O	him
O	before
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	monastery
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	public
O	place
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	right
O	hand
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	planted
O	two
O	elms
O	upon
O	the
O	grave
O	,
O	the
O	one
O	at
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	these
O	elms
O	grew
O	and
O	became
O	great
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	are
O	yet
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	before
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	monastery
O	.
