O	Great
O	woe
O	was
O	there
O	in
O	Camelot
O	next
O	day
O	when
O	,
O	after
O	worship
O	in
O	the
O	cathedral
O	,
O	the
O	knights
O	who
O	had
O	vowed
O	themselves
O	to
O	the
O	Quest
O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	got
O	to
O	horse
O	and
O	rode
O	away
O	.
O	A
O	goodly
O	company
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	passed
O	through
O	the
O	streets
O	,
O	the
O	townfolk
O	weeping
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	go
O	;
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	du
O	Lac
O	and
O	his
O	kin
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	of
O	whom
O	all
O	expected
O	great
O	deeds
O	,
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	and
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	another
O	scarcely
O	less
O	famed
O	than
O	they
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	rode
O	together
O	that
O	day
O	to
O	the
O	Castle
O	of
O	Vagon
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	were
O	entertained
O	right
O	hospitably
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	they
O	separated
O	,
O	each
O	to
O	ride
O	his
O	own
O	way
O	and
O	see
O	what
O	adventures
O	should
O	befall
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	,
O	after
O	four
O	days
O	'
O	ride
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	reached
O	an
O	abbey
O	.
O	Now
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	was
O	still
O	clothed
O	in
O	red
O	armor
O	as
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	hung
O	the
O	wondrous
O	sword
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	without
O	a
O	shield
O	.
O	They
O	of
O	the
O	abbey
O	received
O	him
O	right
O	heartily
O	,
O	as
O	also
O	did
O	the
O	brave
O	King
O	Bagdemagus
O	,
O	Knight
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	resting
O	there
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	greeted
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	asked
O	King
O	Bagdemagus
O	what
O	adventure
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	there
O	.
O	``
O	Sir
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Bagdemagus
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	was
O	told
O	that
O	in
O	this
O	abbey
O	was
O	preserved
O	a
O	wondrous
O	shield
O	which
O	none
O	but
O	the
O	best
O	knight
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	might
O	bear
O	without
O	grievous
O	harm
O	to
O	himself
O	.
O	And
O	though
O	I
O	know
O	well
O	that
O	there
O	are
O	better
O	knights
O	than
O	I
O	,
O	to-morrow
O	I
O	purpose
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	attempt
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	I
O	pray
O	you
O	,
O	bide
O	at
O	this
O	monastery
O	awhile
O	until
O	you
O	hear
O	from
O	me
O	;
O	and
O	if
O	I
O	fail
O	,
O	do
O	ye
O	take
O	the
O	adventure
O	upon
O	you
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	So
O	be
O	it
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	at
O	their
O	request
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	and
O	King
O	Bagdemagus
O	were
O	led
O	into
O	the
O	church
O	by
O	a
O	monk
O	and
O	shown
O	where
O	,
O	behind
O	the
O	altar
O	,
O	hung
O	the
O	wondrous
O	shield
O	,
O	whiter
O	than
O	snow
O	save
O	for
O	the
O	blood-red
O	cross
O	in
O	its
O	midst
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	monk
O	warned
O	them
O	of
O	the
O	danger
O	to
O	any
O	who
O	,
O	being
O	unworthy
O	,
O	should
O	dare
O	to
O	bear
O	the
O	shield
O	.
O	But
O	King
O	Bagdemagus
O	made
O	answer
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	know
O	well
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	the
O	best
O	knight
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	yet
O	will
O	I
O	try
O	if
O	I
O	may
O	bear
O	it
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	he
O	hung
O	it
O	about
O	his
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	bidding
O	farewell
O	,
O	rode
O	away
O	with
O	his
O	squire
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	had
O	not
O	journeyed
O	far
O	before
O	they
O	saw
O	a
O	knight
O	approach
O	,
O	armed
O	all
O	in
O	white
O	mail
O	and
O	mounted
O	upon
O	a
O	white
O	horse
O	.
O	Immediately
O	he
O	laid
O	his
O	spear
O	in
O	rest
O	and
O	,
O	charging
O	King
O	Bagdemagus
O	,
O	pierced
O	him
O	through
O	the
O	shoulder
O	and
O	bore
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	;
O	and
O	standing
O	over
O	the
O	wounded
O	knight
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Knight
O	,
O	thou
O	hast
O	shown
O	great
O	folly
O	,
O	for
O	none
O	shall
O	bear
O	this
O	shield
O	save
O	the
O	peerless
O	knight
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	,
O	taking
O	the
O	shield
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	squire
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Bear
O	this
O	shield
O	to
O	the
O	good
O	Knight
O	Galahad
O	and
O	greet
O	him
O	well
O	from
O	me
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	What
O	is
O	your
O	name
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	the
O	squire
O	.
O	``
O	That
O	is
O	not
O	for
O	thee
O	or
O	any
O	other
O	to
O	know
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	One
O	thing
O	I
O	pray
O	you
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	squire
O	;
O	``
O	why
O	may
O	this
O	shield
O	be
O	borne
O	by
O	none
O	but
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	without
O	danger
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	Because
O	it
O	belongs
O	to
O	him
O	only
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	the
O	stranger
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	vanished
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	squire
O	took
O	the
O	shield
O	and
O	setting
O	King
O	Bagdemagus
O	on
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	bore
O	him
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	abbey
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	long
O	,
O	sick
O	unto
O	death
O	.
O	To
O	Galahad
O	the
O	squire
O	gave
O	the
O	shield
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	befallen
O	.
O	So
O	Galahad
O	hung
O	the
O	shield
O	about
O	his
O	neck
O	and
O	rode
O	the
O	way
O	that
O	Bagdemagus
O	had
O	gone
O	the
O	day
O	before
O	;
O	and
O	presently
O	he
O	met
O	the
O	White
O	Knight
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	greeted
O	courteously
O	,
O	begging
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	make
O	known
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	marvels
O	of
O	the
O	red-cross
O	shield
O	.
O	``
O	That
O	will
O	I
O	gladly
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	the
O	White
O	Knight
O	.
O	``
O	Ye
O	must
O	know
O	,
O	sir
O	knight
O	,
O	that
O	this
O	shield
O	was
O	made
O	and
O	given
O	by
O	Joseph
O	of
O	Arimathea
O	to
O	the
O	good
O	King
O	Evelake
O	of
O	Sarras
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	might
O	of
O	the
O	holy
O	symbol
O	,
O	he
O	should
O	overthrow
O	the
O	heathen
O	who
O	threatened
O	his
O	kingdom
O	.
O	But
O	afterward
O	,
O	King
O	Evelake
O	followed
O	Joseph
O	to
O	this
O	land
O	of
O	Britain
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	taught
O	the
O	true
O	faith
O	unto
O	the
O	people
O	who
O	before
O	were
O	heathen
O	.
O	Then
O	when
O	Joseph
O	lay
O	dying
O	,
O	he
O	bade
O	King
O	Evelake
O	set
O	the
O	shield
O	in
O	the
O	monastery
O	where
O	ye
O	lay
O	last
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	foretold
O	that
O	none
O	should
O	wear
O	it
O	without
O	loss
O	until
O	that
O	day
O	when
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	taken
O	by
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	ninth
O	and
O	last
O	in
O	descent
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	who
O	should
O	come
O	to
O	that
O	place
O	the
O	fifteenth
O	day
O	after
O	receiving
O	the
O	degree
O	of
O	knighthood
O	.
O	Even
O	so
O	has
O	it
O	been
O	with
O	you
O	,
O	sir
O	knight
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	saying
O	,
O	the
O	unknown
O	knight
O	disappeared
O	and
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	rode
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	.
