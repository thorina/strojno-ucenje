O	Once
O	a
O	little
O	Indian
O	girl
O	was
O	very
O	sad
O	and
O	unhappy
O	.
O	The
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	had
O	taken
O	her
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	live
O	with
O	relatives
O	who
O	did
O	not
O	want
O	her
O	.
O	Often
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	hungry
O	,
O	for
O	only
O	the
O	scraps
O	of
O	food
O	that
O	were
O	left
O	from
O	a
O	meal
O	were
O	given
O	to
O	her
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	relatives
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	brought
O	in
O	a
O	fine
O	deer
O	from
O	the
O	chase
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	ready
O	for
O	a
O	feast
O	.
O	They
O	told
O	the
O	girl
O	to
O	get
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	for
O	there
O	was
O	neither
O	room
O	,
O	nor
O	meat
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	girl
O	ran
O	and
O	hid
O	herself
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	field
O	of
O	corn
O	.
O	There
O	she
O	cried
O	aloud
O	.
O	Soon
O	a
O	band
O	of
O	strange
O	Little
O	People
O	gathered
O	about
O	her
O	,
O	to
O	comfort
O	her
O	.
O	On
O	all
O	sides
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	folds
O	of
O	the
O	green
O	cornstalks
O	they
O	came
O	.
O	They
O	stroked
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	wiped
O	the
O	tears
O	from
O	her
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``

O	At
O	this
O	the
O	little

O	dried

O	at
O	the

O	.
O	``
O	You
O	are
O	very
O	good
O	to

O	she
O	said

O	Then
O	they
O	slipped
O	some
O	winged

O	upon

O	.
O	They
O	wrapped
O	her
O	in

O	put
O	a

O	,
O	the
O	rocks
O	opened

O	passed
O	within
O	.
O	The
O	girl
O	found
O	herself
O	in
O	a
O	beautiful
O	lodge
O	.
O	Kind
O	_Jo

O	soon
O	a

O	there
O	was
O	not

O	did
O	not

O	the

O	But
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	high
O	tide
O	of
O	their
O	prosperity
O	,
O	suddenly
O	there
O	arose
O	a
O	great
O	alarm
O	at
O	the
O	invasion
O	of
O	a
O	ferocious
O	band
O	of
O	warriors
O	from
O	the
O	North
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	Lakes
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	these
O	bands
O	advanced
O	,
O	an
O	indiscriminate
O	slaughter
O	was
O	made
O	of
O	men
O	,
O	women
O	,
O	and
O	children
O	.
O	Destruction
O	fell
O	upon
O	all
O	alike
O	.
O	The
O	public
O	alarm
O	was
O	great
O	;
O	and
O	Hiawatha
O	advised
O	them
O	not
O	to
O	waste
O	their
O	efforts
O	in
O	a
O	desultory
O	manner
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	call
O	a
O	council
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	tribes
O	that
O	could
O	be
O	gathered
O	together
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	East
O	to
O	the
O	West
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	,
O	he
O	appointed
O	a
O	meeting
O	to
O	take
O	place
O	on
O	an
O	eminence
O	on
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	Onondaga
O	Lake
O	.
O	There
O	,
O	accordingly
O	,
O	the
O	chief
O	men
O	assembled
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	occasion
O	brought
O	together
O	a
O	vast
O	multitude
O	of
O	men
O	,
O	women
O	,
O	and
O	children
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	in
O	expectation
O	of
O	some
O	marvellous
O	deliverance
O	.
O	Three
O	days
O	elapsed
O	,
O	and
O	Hiawatha
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	.
O	The
O	multitude
O	began
O	to
O	fear
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	coming
O	,
O	and
O	messengers
O	were
O	despatched
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	Tioto
O	,
O	who
O	found
O	him
O	depressed
O	with
O	a
O	presentiment
O	that
O	evil
O	would
O	follow
O	his
O	attendance
O	.
O	These
O	fears
O	were
O	overruled
O	by
O	the
O	eager
O	persuasions
O	of
O	the
O	messengers
O	;
O	and
O	Hiawatha
O	,
O	taking
O	his
O	daughter
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	put
O	his
O	wonderful
O	canoe
O	in
O	its
O	element
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	for
O	the
O	council
O	.
O	The
O	grand
O	assemblage
O	that
O	was
O	to
O	avert
O	the
O	threatened
O	danger
O	appeared
O	quickly
O	in
O	sight
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	moved
O	rapidly
O	along
O	in
O	his
O	magic
O	canoe
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	people
O	saw
O	him
O	,
O	they
O	sent
O	up
O	loud
O	shouts
O	of
O	welcome
O	until
O	the
O	venerated
O	man
O	landed
O	.
O	A
O	steep
O	ascent
O	led
O	up
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	occupied
O	by
O	the
O	council
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	walked
O	up
O	,
O	a
O	loud
O	whirring
O	sound
O	was
O	heard
O	above
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	caused
O	by
O	some
O	rushing
O	current
O	of
O	air
O	.
O	Instantly
O	,
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	all
O	were
O	directed
O	upward
O	to
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	where
O	was
O	seen
O	a
O	dark
O	spot
O	,
O	something
O	like
O	a
O	small
O	cloud
O	,
O	descending
O	rapidly
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	it
O	approached
O	,
O	enlarging
O	in
O	its
O	size
O	and
O	increasing
O	in
O	velocity
O	.
O	Terror
O	and
O	alarm
O	filled
O	the
O	minds
O	of
O	the
O	multitude
O	and
O	they
O	scattered
O	in
O	confusion
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	gained
O	the
O	eminence
O	,
O	Hiawatha
O	stood
O	still
O	,
O	causing
O	his
O	daughter
O	to
O	do
O	the
O	same
O	--
O	deeming
O	it
O	cowardly
O	to
O	fly
O	,
O	and
O	impossible
O	,
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	attempted
O	,
O	to
O	divert
O	the
O	designs
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	.
O	The
O	descending
O	object
O	now
O	assumed
O	a
O	more
O	definite
O	aspect
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	came
O	nearer
O	,
O	revealed
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	a
O	gigantic
O	white
O	bird
O	,
O	with
O	wide-extended
O	and
O	pointed
O	wings
O	.
O	This
O	bird
O	came
O	down
O	with
O	ever
O	increasing
O	velocity
O	,
O	until
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	mighty
O	swoop
O	,
O	it
O	dropped
O	upon
O	the
O	girl
O	,
O	crushing
O	her
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	The
O	fixed
O	face
O	of
O	Hiawatha
O	alone
O	indicated
O	his
O	consciousness
O	of
O	his
O	daughter
O	'
O	s
O	death
O	;
O	while
O	in
O	silence
O	he
O	signalled
O	to
O	the
O	warriors
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	stood
O	watching
O	the
O	event
O	in
O	speechless
O	consternation
O	.
O	One
O	after
O	the
O	other
O	stepped
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	prostrate
O	bird
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	killed
O	by
O	its
O	violent
O	fall
O	,
O	and
O	selecting
O	a
O	feather
O	from
O	its
O	snow-white
O	plumage
O	,
O	decorated
O	himself
O	therewith
O	.
O	[
O	:

O	,
O	the
O	plumage

O	been
O	used
O	for

O	But
O	now
O	a
O	new
O	affliction
O	fell
O	upon
O	Hiawatha
O	;
O	for
O	,
O	on
O	removing
O	the
O	carcass
O	of
O	the
O	bird
O	,
O	not
O	a
O	trace
O	could
O	be
O	discovered
O	of
O	his
O	daughter
O	.
O	Her
O	body
O	had
O	vanished
O	from
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	Shades
O	of
O	anguish
O	contracted
O	the
O	dark
O	face
O	of
O	Hiawatha
O	.
O	He
O	stood
O	apart
O	in
O	voiceless
O	grief
O	.
O	No
O	word
O	was
O	spoken
O	.
O	His
O	people
O	waited
O	in
O	silence
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	length
O	arousing
O	himself
O	,
O	he
O	turned
O	to
O	them
O	and
O	walked
O	in
O	calm
O	dignity
O	to
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	council
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	day
O	he
O	listened
O	with
O	attentive
O	gravity
O	to
O	the
O	plans
O	of
O	the
O	different
O	speakers
O	;
O	on
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	he
O	arose
O	and
O	said
O	:
