O	The
O	country
O	of
O	the
O	Greedy
O	,
O	well
O	known
O	in
O	history
O	,
O	was
O	ruled
O	by
O	a
O	king
O	who
O	had
O	much
O	trouble
O	.
O	His
O	subjects
O	were
O	well
O	behaved
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	had
O	one
O	sad
O	fault
O	:
O	they
O	were
O	too
O	fond
O	of
O	pies
O	and
O	tarts
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	as
O	disagreeable
O	to
O	them
O	to
O	swallow
O	a
O	spoonful
O	of
O	soup
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	so
O	much
O	sea
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	would
O	take
O	a
O	policeman
O	to
O	make
O	them
O	open
O	their
O	mouths
O	for
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	meat
O	,
O	either
O	boiled
O	or
O	roasted
O	.
O	This
O	deplorable
O	taste
O	made
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	pastry
O	cooks
O	,
O	but
O	also
O	of
O	the

O	This
O	view
O	of
O	things
O	did
O	not
O	suit
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	wise
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	very
O	plainly
O	that
O	a
O	monarch
O	without
O	subjects
O	would
O	be
O	but

O	,
O	after
O	this
O	utter
O	failure
O	of
O	the
O	doctors
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	mind
O	of
O	His
O	Majesty
O	a
O	first-class
O	idea
O	:
O	he
O	telegraphed
O	for
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	the
O	most
O	celebrated
O	of
O	all
O	pastry
O	cooks
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	soon
O	arrived
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	black
O	cat
O	,
O	Fanfreluche
O	,
O	who
O	accompanied
O	her
O	everywhere
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	an
O	incomparable
O	cat
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	not

O	equal
O	as
O	an
O	adviser
O	and
O	a
O	taster
O	of
O	tarts
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	having
O	respectfully
O	inquired
O	what
O	she
O	and
O	her
O	cat
O	could
O	do
O	for
O	His
O	Majesty
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	demanded
O	of
O	the
O	astonished
O	pastry
O	cook
O	a
O	tart
O	as
O	big
O	as
O	the
O	capitol
O	--
O	bigger
O	even
O	,
O	if
O	possible
O	,
O	but
O	no
O	smaller
O	!
O	When
O	the
O	King
O	uttered
O	this
O	astounding
O	order
O	,
O	deep
O	emotion
O	was
O	shown
O	by
O	the
O	chamberlains
O	,
O	the
O	pages
O	,
O	and
O	lackeys
O	.
O	Nothing
O	but
O	the
O	respect
O	due
O	to
O	his
O	presence
O	prevented
O	them
O	from
O	crying
O	``
O	Long
O	live
O	Your
O	Majesty
O	!
O	``
O	in
O	his
O	very
O	ears
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	King
O	had
O	seen
O	enough
O	of
O	the
O	enthusiasm
O	of
O	the
O	populace
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	allow
O	such
O	sounds
O	in
O	the
O	recesses
O	of
O	his
O	palace
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	gave
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	one
O	month
O	to
O	carry
O	out
O	his
O	gigantic
O	project
O	.
O	``
O	It
O	is
O	enough
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	proudly
O	replied
O	,
O	brandishing
O	her
O	crutch
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	taking
O	leave
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	she
O	and
O	her
O	cat
O	set
O	out
O	for
O	their
O	home
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	way
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	arranged
O	in
O	her
O	head
O	the
O	plan
O	of
O	the
O	monument
O	which
O	was
O	to
O	immortalize
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	considered
O	the
O	means
O	of
O	executing
O	it
O	.
O	As
O	to
O	its
O	form
O	and
O	size
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	as
O	exact
O	a
O	copy
O	of
O	the
O	capitol
O	as
O	possible
O	,
O	since
O	the
O	King
O	had
O	willed
O	it
O	;
O	but
O	its
O	outside
O	crust
O	should
O	have
O	a
O	beauty
O	all
O	its
O	own
O	.
O	The
O	dome
O	must
O	be
O	adorned
O	with
O	sugarplums
O	of
O	all
O	colours
O	,
O	and
O	surmounted
O	by
O	a
O	splendid
O	crown
O	of
O	macaroons
O	,
O	spun
O	sugar
O	,
O	chocolate
O	,
O	and
O	candied
O	fruits
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	no
O	small
O	affair
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	did
O	not
O	like
O	to
O	lose
O	her
O	time
O	.
O	Her
O	plan
O	of
O	battle
O	once
O	formed
O	,
O	she
O	recruited
O	on
O	her
O	way
O	all
O	the
O	little
O	pastry
O	cooks
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	all
O	the
O	tiny
O	six-year-olds
O	who
O	had
O	a
O	sincere
O	love
O	for
O	the
O	noble
O	callings
O	of
O	scullion
O	and
O	apprentice
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	plenty
O	of
O	these
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	may
O	suppose
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	of
O	the
O	Greedy
O	;
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	had
O	her
O	pick
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	her
O	crutch
O	and
O	of
O	Fanfreluche
O	,
O	who
O	miaowed
O	loud
O	enough
O	to
O	be
O	heard
O	twenty
O	miles
O	off
O	,
O	called
O	upon
O	all
O	the
O	millers
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	commanded
O	them
O	to
O	bring
O	together
O	at
O	a
O	certain
O	time
O	as
O	many
O	sacks
O	of
O	fine
O	flour
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	grind
O	in
O	a
O	week
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	only
O	windmills
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	;
O	you
O	may
O	easily
O	believe
O	how
O	they
O	all
O	began
O	to
O	go
O	.
O	B-r-r-r-r-r
O	!
O	What
O	a
O	noise
O	they
O	made
O	!
O	The
O	clatter
O	was
O	so
O	great
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	birds
O	flew
O	away
O	to
O	other
O	climes
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	the
O	clouds
O	fled
O	from
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	call
O	of
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	all
O	the
O	farmers
O	'
O	wives
O	were
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	;
O	they
O	rushed
O	to
O	the
O	hencoops
O	to
O	collect
O	the
O	seven
O	thousand
O	fresh
O	eggs
O	that
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	wanted
O	for
O	her
O	great
O	edifice
O	.
O	Deep
O	was
O	the
O	emotion
O	of
O	the
O	fowls
O	.
O	The
O	hens
O	were
O	inconsolable
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	unhappy
O	creatures
O	mourned
O	upon
O	the
O	palings
O	for
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	all
O	their
O	hopes
O	.
O	The
O	milkmaids
O	were
O	busy
O	from
O	morning
O	till
O	night
O	in
O	milking
O	the
O	cows
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	must
O	have
O	twenty
O	thousand
O	pails
O	of
O	milk
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	little
O	calves
O	were
O	put
O	on
O	half
O	rations
O	.
O	This
O	great
O	work
O	was
O	nothing
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	complained
O	pitifully
O	to
O	their
O	mothers
O	.
O	Many
O	of
O	the
O	cows
O	protested
O	with
O	energy
O	against
O	this
O	unreasonable
O	tax
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	their
O	young
O	families
O	so
O	uncomfortable
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	pails
O	upset
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	some
O	milkmaids
O	went
O	head
O	over
O	heels
O	.
O	But
O	these
O	little
O	accidents
O	did
O	not
O	chill
O	the
O	enthusiasm
O	of
O	the
O	labourers
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	called
O	for
O	a
O	thousand
O	pounds
O	of
O	the
O	best
O	butter
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	churns
O	for
O	twenty
O	miles
O	around
O	began
O	to
O	work
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	lively
O	manner
O	.
O	Their
O	dashers
O	dashed
O	without
O	ceasing
O	,
O	keeping
O	perfect
O	time
O	.
O	The
O	butter
O	was
O	tasted
O	,
O	rolled
O	into
O	pats
O	,
O	wrapped
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	into
O	baskets
O	.
O	Such
O	energy
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	known
O	before
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	passed
O	for
O	a
O	sorceress
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	all
O	because
O	of
O	her
O	cat
O	,
O	Fanfreluche
O	,
O	with
O	whom
O	she
O	had
O	mysterious
O	doings
O	and
O	pantomimes
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	whom
O	she
O	talked
O	in
O	her
O	inspired
O	moments
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	a
O	real
O	person
O	.
O	Certainly
O	,
O	since
O	the
O	famous
O	``
O	Puss
O	in
O	Boots
O	,
O	``
O	there
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	an
O	animal
O	so
O	extraordinary
O	;
O	and
O	credulous
O	folks
O	suspected
O	him
O	of
O	being
O	a
O	magician
O	.
O	Some
O	curious
O	people
O	had
O	the
O	courage
O	to
O	ask
O	Fanfreluche
O	if
O	this
O	were
O	true
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	replied
O	by
O	bristling
O	,
O	and
O	showing
O	his
O	teeth
O	and
O	claws
O	so
O	fiercely
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	conversation
O	had
O	ended
O	there
O	.
O	Sorceress
O	or
O	not
O	,
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	was
O	always
O	obeyed
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	else
O	was
O	ever
O	served
O	so
O	punctually
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	appointed
O	day
O	all
O	the
O	millers
O	arrived
O	with
O	their
O	asses
O	trotting
O	in
O	single
O	file
O	,
O	each
O	laden
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	sack
O	of
O	flour
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	after
O	having
O	examined
O	the
O	quality
O	of
O	the
O	flour
O	,
O	had
O	every
O	sack
O	accurately
O	weighed
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	head
O	work
O	and
O	hard
O	work
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	time
O	;
O	but
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	was
O	untiring
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	cat
O	,
O	also
O	,
O	for
O	while
O	the
O	operation
O	lasted
O	he
O	sat
O	on
O	the
O	roof
O	watching
O	.
O	It

O	just
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	the
O	millers
O	of
O	the
O	Greedy
O	Kingdom
O	brought
O	flour
O	not
O	only
O	faultless
O	but
O	of
O	full
O	weight
O	.
O	They
O	knew

O	was
O	with

O	Perhaps
O	also
O	they
O	were
O	a
O	little
O	afraid
O	of
O	the
O	cat
O	,
O	whose
O	great
O	green
O	eyes
O	were
O	always
O	shining
O	upon
O	them
O	like
O	two
O	round
O	lamps
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	lost
O	sight
O	of
O	them
O	for
O	one
O	moment
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	farmers
O	'
O	wives
O	arrived
O	in
O	turn
O	,
O	with
O	baskets
O	of
O	eggs
O	upon
O	their
O	heads
O	.
O	They
O	did
O	not
O	load
O	their
O	donkeys
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	that
O	in
O	jogging
O	along
O	they
O	would
O	become
O	omelettes
O	on
O	the
O	way
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	received
O	them
O	with
O	her
O	usual
O	gravity
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	the
O	patience
O	to
O	look
O	through
O	every
O	egg
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	fresh
O	.
O	She
O	did
O	not
O	wish
O	to
O	run
O	the
O	risk
O	of
O	having
O	young
O	chickens
O	in
O	a
O	tart
O	that
O	was
O	destined
O	for
O	those
O	who
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	the
O	taste
O	of
O	any
O	meat
O	however
O	tender
O	and
O	delicate
O	.
O	The
O	number
O	of
O	eggs
O	was
O	complete
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	and
O	her
O	cat
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	complain
O	of
O	.
O	This
O	Greedy
O	nation
O	,
O	though
O	carried
O	away
O	by
O	love
O	of
O	good
O	eating
O	,
O	was
O	strictly
O	honest
O	.
O	It
O	must
O	be
O	said
O	that
O	where
O	nations
O	are
O	patriotic
O	,
O	desire
O	for
O	the
O	common
O	good
O	makes
O	them
O	unselfish
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	'
O	s
O	tart
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	glory
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	one
O	was
O	proud
O	to
O	contribute
O	to
O	such
O	a
O	great
O	work
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	the
O	milkmaids
O	with
O	their
O	pots
O	and
O	pails
O	of
O	milk
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	buttermakers
O	with
O	their
O	baskets
O	filled
O	with
O	the
O	rich
O	yellow
O	pats
O	of
O	butter
O	,
O	filed
O	in
O	long
O	procession
O	to
O	the
O	right
O	and
O	left
O	of
O	the
O	cabin
O	of
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	need
O	for
O	her
O	to
O	examine
O	so
O	carefully
O	the
O	butter
O	and
O	the
O	milk
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	such
O	a
O	delicate
O	nose
O	that
O	if
O	there
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	single
O	pat
O	of
O	ancient
O	butter
O	or
O	a
O	pail
O	of
O	sour
O	milk
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	pounced
O	upon
O	it
O	instantly
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	was
O	perfectly
O	fresh
O	.
O	In
O	that
O	golden
O	age
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	understand
O	the
O	art
O	,
O	now
O	so
O	well
O	known
O	,
O	of
O	making
O	milk
O	out
O	of
O	flour
O	and
O	water
O	.
O	Real
O	milk
O	was
O	necessary
O	to
O	make
O	cheesecakes
O	and
O	ice
O	cream
O	and
O	other
O	delicious
O	confections
O	much
O	adored
O	in
O	the
O	Greedy
O	Kingdom
O	.
O	If
O	any
O	one
O	had
O	made
O	such
O	a
O	despicable
O	discovery
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	chased
O	from
O	the
O	country
O	as
O	a
O	public
O	nuisance
O	.
O	Then
O	came
O	the
O	grocers
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	aprons
O	of
O	coffee
O	bags
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	jolly
O	,
O	mischievous
O	faces
O	the
O	rogues
O	always
O	have
O	.
O	Each
O	one
O	clasped
O	to
O	his
O	heart
O	a
O	sugar
O	loaf
O	nearly
O	as
O	large
O	as
O	himself
O	,
O	whose
O	summit
O	,
O	without
O	its
O	paper
O	cap
O	,
O	looked
O	like
O	new-fallen
O	snow
O	upon
O	a
O	pyramid
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	crutch
O	for
O	a
O	baton
O	,
O	saw
O	them
O	all
O	placed
O	in
O	her
O	storerooms
O	upon
O	shelves
O	put
O	up
O	for
O	the
O	purpose
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	strict
O	,
O	for
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	fellows
O	could
O	hardly
O	part
O	from
O	their
O	merchandise
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	were
O	indiscreet
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	tongues
O	behind
O	their
O	great
O	mountains
O	of
O	sugar
O	.
O	If
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	let
O	alone
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	never
O	have
O	stopped
O	till
O	the
O	sugar
O	was
O	all
O	gone
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	implacable
O	eye
O	of
O	old
O	Fanfreluche
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	posted
O	upon
O	a
O	water
O	spout
O	,
O	took
O	note
O	of
O	all
O	their
O	misdeeds
O	.
O	From
O	another
O	quarter
O	came
O	a
O	whole
O	army
O	of
O	country
O	people
O	,
O	rolling
O	wheelbarrows
O	and
O	carrying
O	huge
O	baskets
O	,
O	all
O	filled
O	with
O	cherries
O	,
O	plums
O	,
O	peaches
O	,
O	apples
O	,
O	and
O	pears
O	.
O	All
O	these
O	fruits
O	were
O	so
O	fresh
O	,
O	in
O	such
O	perfect
O	condition
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	fair
O	shining
O	skins
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	looked
O	like
O	wax
O	or
O	painted
O	marble
O	,
O	but
O	their
O	delicious
O	perfume
O	proved
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	real
O	.
O	Some
O	little
O	people
O	,
O	hidden
O	in
O	the
O	corners
O	,
O	took
O	pains
O	to
O	find
O	this
O	out
O	.
O	Between
O	ourselves
O	,
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	made
O	believe
O	not
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	precaution
O	of
O	holding
O	Fanfreluche
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	spring
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	fruits
O	were
O	all
O	put
O	into
O	bins
O	,
O	each
O	kind
O	by
O	itself
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	the
O	preparations
O	were
O	finished
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	time
O	to
O	lose
O	before
O	setting
O	to
O	work
O	.
O	The
O	spot
O	which
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	had
O	chosen
O	for
O	her
O	great
O	edifice
O	was
O	a
O	pretty
O	hill
O	on
O	which
O	a
O	plateau
O	formed
O	a
O	splendid
O	site
O	.
O	This
O	hill
O	commanded
O	the
O	capital
O	city
O	,
O	built
O	upon
O	the
O	slope
O	of
O	another
O	hill
O	close
O	by
O	.
O	After
O	having
O	beaten
O	down
O	the
O	earth
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	smooth
O	as
O	a
O	floor
O	,
O	they
O	spread
O	over
O	it
O	loads
O	of
O	bread
O	crumbs
O	,
O	brought
O	from
O	the
O	baker
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	and
O	levelled
O	it
O	with
O	rake
O	and
O	spade
O	,
O	as
O	we
O	do
O	gravel
O	in
O	our
O	garden
O	walks
O	.
O	Little
O	birds
O	,
O	as
O	greedy
O	as
O	themselves
O	,
O	came
O	in
O	flocks
O	to
O	the
O	feast
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	might
O	eat
O	as
O	they
O	liked
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	never
O	be
O	missed
O	,
O	so
O	thick
O	was
O	the
O	carpet
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	chance
O	for
O	the
O	bold
O	little
O	things
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	ingredients
O	for
O	the
O	tart
O	were
O	now
O	ready
O	.
O	Upon
O	order
O	of
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	peel
O	the
O	apples
O	and
O	pears
O	and
O	to
O	take
O	out
O	the
O	pips
O	.
O	The
O	weather
O	was
O	so
O	pleasant
O	that
O	the
O	girls
O	sat
O	out
O	of
O	doors
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	in
O	long
O	rows
O	.
O	The
O	sun
O	looked
O	down
O	upon
O	them
O	with
O	a
O	merry
O	face
O	.
O	Each
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	workers
O	had
O	a
O	big
O	earthen
O	pan
O	,
O	and
O	peeled
O	incessantly
O	the
O	apples
O	which
O	the
O	boys
O	brought
O	them
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	pans
O	were
O	full
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	carried
O	away
O	and
O	others
O	were
O	brought
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	also
O	to
O	carry
O	away
O	the
O	peels
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	girls
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	buried
O	in
O	them
O	.
O	Never
O	was
O	there
O	such
O	a
O	peeling
O	before
O	.
O	Not
O	far
O	away
O	,
O	the
O	children
O	were
O	stoning
O	the
O	plums
O	,
O	cherries
O	,
O	and
O	peaches
O	.
O	This
O	work
O	,
O	being
O	the
O	easiest
O	,
O	was
O	given
O	to
O	the
O	youngest
O	and
O	most
O	inexperienced
O	hands
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	all
O	first
O	carefully
O	washed
O	,
O	for
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	though
O	not
O	very
O	particular
O	about
O	her
O	own
O	toilet
O	,
O	was
O	very
O	neat
O	in
O	her
O	cooking
O	.
O	The
O	schoolhouse
O	,
O	long
O	unused
O	(
O	for
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	of
O	the
O	Greedy
O	they
O	had
O	forgotten
O	everything
O	)
O	,
O	was
O	arranged
O	for
O	this
O	second
O	class
O	of
O	workers
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	cat
O	was
O	their
O	inspector
O	.
O	He
O	walked
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	,
O	growling
O	if
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	fruit
O	popping
O	into
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	mouths
O	.
O	If
O	they
O	had
O	dared
O	,
O	how
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	pelted
O	him
O	with
O	plum
O	stones
O	!
O	But
O	no
O	one
O	risked
O	it
O	.
O	Fanfreluche
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	trifled
O	with
O	.
O	In
O	those
O	days
O	powdered
O	sugar
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	invented
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	grate
O	it
O	all
O	was
O	no
O	small
O	affair
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	work
O	that
O	the
O	grocers
O	used
O	to
O	dislike
O	the
O	most
O	;
O	both
O	lungs
O	and
O	arms
O	were
O	soon
O	tired
O	.
O	But
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	was
O	there
O	to
O	sustain
O	them
O	with
O	her
O	unequalled
O	energy
O	.
O	She
O	chose
O	the
O	labourers
O	from
O	the
O	most
O	robust
O	of
O	the
O	boys
O	.
O	With
O	mallet
O	and
O	knife
O	she
O	broke
O	the
O	cones
O	into
O	round
O	pieces
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	grated
O	them
O	till
O	they
O	were
O	too
O	small
O	to
O	hold
O	.
O	The
O	bits
O	were
O	put
O	into
O	baskets
O	to
O	be
O	pounded
O	.
O	One
O	would
O	never
O	have
O	expected
O	to
O	find
O	all
O	the
O	thousand
O	pounds
O	of
O	sugar
O	again
O	.
O	But
O	a
O	new
O	miracle
O	was
O	wrought
O	by
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	all
O	there
O	!
O	It
O	was
O	then
O	the
O	turn
O	of
O	the
O	ambitious
O	scullions
O	to
O	enter
O	the
O	lists
O	and
O	break
O	the
O	seven
O	thousand
O	eggs
O	for
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	hard
O	to
O	break
O	them
O	--
O	any
O	fool
O	could
O	do
O	that
O	;
O	but
O	to
O	separate
O	adroitly
O	the
O	yolks
O	and
O	the
O	whites
O	demands
O	some
O	talent
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	above
O	all
O	,
O	great
O	care
O	.
O	We
O	dare
O	not
O	say
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	accidents
O	here
O	,
O	no
O	eggs
O	too
O	well
O	scrambled
O	,
O	no
O	baskets
O	upset
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	experience
O	of
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	had
O	counted
O	upon
O	such
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	may
O	truly
O	be
O	said
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	never
O	so
O	many
O	eggs
O	broken
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	or
O	ever
O	could
O	be
O	again
O	.
O	To
O	make
O	an
O	omelette
O	of
O	them
O	would
O	have
O	taken
O	a
O	saucepan
O	as
O	large
O	as
O	a
O	skating
O	pond
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fattest
O	cook
O	that
O	ever
O	lived
O	could
O	not
O	hold
O	the
O	handle
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	saucepan
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	was
O	not
O	all
O	.
O	Now
O	that
O	the
O	yolks
O	and
O	whites
O	were
O	once
O	divided
O	,
O	they
O	must
O	each
O	be
O	beaten
O	separately
O	in
O	wooden
O	bowls
O	,
O	to
O	give
O	them
O	the
O	necessary
O	lightness
O	.
O	The
O	egg
O	beaters
O	were
O	marshalled
O	into
O	two
O	brigades
O	,
O	the
O	yellow
O	and
O	the
O	white
O	.
O	Every
O	one
O	preferred
O	the
O	white
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	much
O	more
O	amusing
O	to
O	make
O	those
O	snowy
O	masses
O	that
O	rose
O	up
O	so
O	high
O	than
O	to
O	beat
O	the
O	yolks
O	,
O	which
O	knew
O	no
O	better
O	than
O	to
O	mix
O	together
O	like
O	so
O	much
O	sauce
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	usual
O	wisdom
O	,
O	had
O	avoided
O	this
O	difficulty
O	by
O	casting
O	lots
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	not
O	on
O	the
O	white
O	side
O	had
O	no
O	reason
O	to
O	complain
O	of
O	oppression
O	.
O	And
O	truly
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	was
O	done
O	,
O	the
O	whites
O	and
O	the
O	yellows
O	were
O	equally
O	tired
O	.
O	All
O	had
O	cramps
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	.
O	Now
O	began
O	the
O	real
O	labour
O	of
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	.
O	Till
O	now
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	commander-in-chief
O	--
O	the
O	head
O	only
O	;
O	now
O	she
O	put
O	her
O	own
O	finger
O	in
O	the
O	pie
O	.
O	First
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	to
O	make
O	sweetmeats
O	and
O	jam
O	out
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	immense
O	quantity
O	of
O	fruit
O	she
O	had
O	stored
O	.
O	For
O	this
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	could
O	only
O	do
O	one
O	kind
O	at
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	ten
O	kettles
O	,
O	each
O	as
O	big
O	as
O	a
O	dinner
O	table
O	.
O	During
O	forty-eight
O	hours
O	the
O	cooking
O	went
O	on
O	;
O	a
O	dozen
O	scullions
O	blew
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	put
O	on
O	the
O	fuel
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	spoon
O	that
O	four
O	modern
O	cooks
O	could
O	hardly
O	lift
O	,
O	never
O	ceased
O	stirring
O	and
O	trying
O	the
O	boiling
O	fruit
O	.
O	Three
O	expert
O	tasters
O	,
O	chosen
O	from
O	the
O	most
O	dainty
O	,
O	had
O	orders
O	to
O	report
O	progress
O	every
O	half
O	hour
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	unnecessary
O	to
O	state
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	sweetmeats
O	were
O	perfectly
O	successful
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	of
O	exquisite
O	consistency
O	,
O	colour
O	,
O	and
O	perfume
O	.
O	With
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	such
O	word
O	as
O	_fail_
O	.
O	When
O	each
O	kind
O	of
O	sweetmeat
O	was
O	finished
O	,
O	she
O	skimmed
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	away
O	to
O	cool
O	in
O	enormous
O	bowls
O	before
O	potting
O	.
O	She
O	did
O	not
O	use
O	for
O	this
O	the
O	usual
O	little
O	glass
O	or
O	earthen
O	jars
O	,
O	but
O	great
O	stone
O	ones
O	,
O	like
O	those
O	in
O	the
O	``
O	Forty
O	Thieves
O	.
O	``
O	Not
O	only
O	did
O	these
O	take
O	less
O	time
O	to
O	fill
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	safe
O	from
O	the
O	children
O	.
O	The
O	scum
O	and
O	the
O	scrapings
O	were
O	something
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	little
O	Toto
O	,
O	who
O	thought
O	this
O	was
O	not
O	enough
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	have
O	jumped
O	into
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	bowls
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	held
O	him
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	who
O	thought
O	of
O	everything
O	,
O	had
O	ordered
O	two
O	hundred
O	great
O	kneading
O	troughs
O	,
O	wishing
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	utensils
O	of
O	this
O	great
O	work
O	should
O	be
O	perfectly
O	new
O	.
O	These
O	two
O	hundred
O	troughs
O	,
O	like
O	her
O	other
O	materials
O	,
O	were
O	all
O	delivered
O	punctually
O	and
O	in
O	good
O	order
O	.
O	The
O	pastry
O	cooks
O	rolled
O	up
O	their
O	sleeves
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	knead
O	the
O	dough
O	with
O	cries
O	of
O	``
O	Hi
O	!
O	Hi
O	!
O	``
O	that
O	could
O	be
O	heard
O	for
O	miles
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	odd
O	to
O	see
O	this
O	army
O	of
O	bakers
O	in
O	serried
O	ranks
O	,
O	all
O	making
O	the
O	same
O	gestures
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	like
O	well-disciplined
O	soldiers
O	,
O	stooping
O	and
O	rising
O	together
O	in
O	time
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	a
O	foreign
O	ambassador
O	wrote
O	to
O	his
O	court
O	that
O	he
O	wished
O	his
O	people
O	could
O	load
O	and
O	fire
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	these
O	could
O	knead
O	.
O	Such
O	praise
O	a
O	people
O	never
O	forgets
O	.
O	When
O	each
O	troughful
O	of
O	paste
O	was
O	approved
O	it
O	was
O	moulded
O	with
O	care
O	into
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	bricks
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	aid
O	of
O	the
O	engineer-in-chief
O	,
O	a
O	young
O	genius
O	who
O	had
O	gained
O	the
O	first
O	prize
O	in
O	the
O	school
O	of
O	architecture
O	,
O	the
O	majestic
O	edifice
O	was
O	begun
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	herself
O	drew
O	the
O	plan
O	;
O	in
O	following
O	her
O	directions
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	engineer
O	showed
O	himself
O	modest
O	beyond
O	all
O	praise
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	sense
O	to
O	understand
O	that
O	the
O	architecture
O	of
O	tarts
O	and
O	pies
O	had
O	rules
O	of
O	its
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	therefore
O	the
O	experience
O	of
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	was
O	worth
O	all
O	the
O	scientific
O	theories
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	The
O	inside
O	of
O	the
O	monument
O	was
O	divided
O	into
O	as
O	many
O	compartments
O	as
O	there
O	were
O	kinds
O	of
O	fruits
O	.
O	The
O	walls
O	were
O	no
O	less
O	than
O	four
O	feet
O	thick
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	were
O	finished
O	,
O	twenty-four
O	ladders
O	were
O	set
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	twenty-four
O	experienced
O	cooks
O	ascended
O	them
O	.
O	These
O	first-class
O	artists
O	were
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	armed
O	with
O	an
O	enormous
O	cooking
O	spoon
O	.
O	Behind
O	them
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	lower
O	rounds
O	of
O	the
O	ladders
O	,
O	followed
O	the
O	kitchen
O	boys
O	,
O	carrying
O	on
O	their
O	heads
O	pots
O	and
O	pans
O	filled
O	to
O	the
O	brim
O	with
O	jam
O	and
O	sweetmeats
O	,
O	each
O	sort
O	ready
O	to
O	be
O	poured
O	into
O	its
O	destined
O	compartment
O	.
O	This
O	colossal
O	labour
O	was
O	accomplished
O	in
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	wonderful
O	exactness
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	sweetmeats
O	were
O	used
O	to
O	the
O	last
O	drop
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	great
O	spoons
O	had
O	done
O	all
O	their
O	work
O	,
O	the
O	twenty-four
O	cooks
O	descended
O	to
O	earth
O	again
O	.
O	The
O	intrepid
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	never
O	quitted
O	the
O	spot
O	,
O	now
O	ascended
O	,
O	followed
O	by
O	the
O	noble
O	Fanfreluche
O	,
O	and
O	dipped
O	her
O	finger
O	into
O	each
O	of
O	the
O	compartments
O	,
O	to
O	assure
O	herself
O	that
O	everything
O	was
O	right
O	.
O	This
O	part
O	of
O	her
O	duty
O	was
O	not
O	disagreeable
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	scullions
O	would
O	have
O	liked
O	to
O	perform
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	might
O	have
O	lingered
O	too
O	long
O	over
O	the
O	enchanting
O	task
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	too
O	well
O	used
O	to
O	sweets
O	to
O	be
O	excited
O	now
O	.
O	She
O	only
O	wished
O	to
O	do
O	her
O	duty
O	and
O	to
O	insure
O	success
O	.
O	All
O	went
O	on
O	well
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	approbation
O	.
O	Nothing
O	was
O	needed
O	now
O	but
O	to
O	crown
O	the
O	sublime
O	and
O	delicious
O	edifice
O	by
O	placing
O	upon
O	it
O	the
O	crust
O	--
O	that
O	is
O	,
O	the
O	roof
O	,
O	or
O	dome
O	.
O	This
O	delicate
O	operation
O	was
O	confided
O	to
O	the
O	engineer-in-chief
O	who
O	now
O	showed
O	his
O	superior
O	genius
O	.
O	The
O	dome
O	,
O	made
O	beforehand
O	of
O	a
O	single
O	piece
O	,
O	was
O	raised
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	twelve
O	balloons
O	,
O	whose
O	force
O	of
O	ascension
O	had
O	been
O	carefully
O	calculated
O	.
O	First
O	it
O	was
O	directed
O	,
O	by
O	ropes
O	,
O	exactly
O	over
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	tart
O	;
O	then
O	at
O	the
O	word
O	of
O	command
O	it
O	gently
O	descended
O	upon
O	the
O	right
O	spot
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	inch
O	out
O	of
O	place
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	triumph
O	for
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	and
O	her
O	able
O	assistant
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	was
O	not
O	over
O	.
O	How
O	should
O	this
O	colossal
O	tart
O	be
O	cooked
O	?
O	That
O	was
O	the
O	question
O	that
O	agitated
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	Greedy
O	country
O	,
O	who
O	came
O	in
O	crowds
O	--
O	lords
O	and
O	commons
O	--
O	to
O	gaze
O	at
O	the
O	wonderful
O	spectacle
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	envious
O	or
O	ill-tempered
O	declared
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	impossible
O	to
O	cook
O	the
O	edifice
O	which
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	had
O	built
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	doctors
O	were
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	knows
O	why
O	,
O	the
O	saddest
O	of
O	all
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	smiling
O	at
O	the
O	general
O	bewilderment
O	,
O	mounted
O	the
O	summit
O	of
O	the
O	tart
O	;
O	she
O	waved
O	her
O	crutch
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	while
O	her
O	cat
O	miaowed
O	in
O	his
O	sweetest
O	voice
O	,
O	suddenly
O	there
O	issued
O	from
O	the
O	woods
O	a
O	vast
O	number
O	of
O	masons
O	,
O	drawing
O	wagons
O	of
O	well-baked
O	bricks
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	prepared
O	in
O	secret
O	.
O	This
O	sight
O	silenced
O	the
O	ill-wishers
O	and
O	filled
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	the
O	Greedy
O	with
O	hope
O	.
O	In
O	two
O	days
O	an
O	enormous
O	furnace
O	was
O	built
O	around
O	and
O	above
O	the
O	colossal
O	tart
O	,
O	which
O	found
O	itself
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	an
O	immense
O	earthen
O	pot
O	.
O	Thirty
O	huge
O	mouths
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	connected
O	with
O	thousands
O	of
O	winding
O	pipes
O	for
O	conducting
O	heat
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	building
O	,
O	were
O	soon
O	choked
O	with
O	fuel
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	two
O	hundred
O	charcoal
O	burners
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	obeying
O	a
O	private
O	signal
O	,
O	came
O	forth
O	in
O	long
O	array
O	from
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	each
O	carrying
O	his
O	sack
O	of
O	coal
O	.
O	Behind
O	them
O	stood
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	with
O	a
O	box
O	of
O	matches
O	,
O	ready
O	to
O	fire
O	each
O	oven
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	filled
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	the
O	kindlings
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	forgotten
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	all
O	soon
O	in
O	a
O	blaze
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	fire
O	was
O	lighted
O	in
O	the
O	thirty
O	ovens
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	clouds
O	of
O	smoke
O	rolling
O	above
O	the
O	dome
O	,
O	that
O	announced
O	that
O	the
O	cooking
O	had
O	begun
O	,
O	the
O	joy
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	was
O	boundless
O	.
O	Poets
O	improvised
O	odes
O	,
O	and
O	musicians
O	sung
O	verses
O	without
O	end
O	,
O	in
O	honour
O	of
O	the
O	superb
O	prince
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	inspired
O	to
O	feed
O	his
O	people
O	in
O	so
O	dainty
O	a
O	manner
O	,
O	when
O	other
O	rulers
O	could
O	not
O	give
O	them
O	enough
O	even
O	of
O	dry
O	bread
O	.
O	The
O	names
O	of
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	illustrious
O	engineer
O	were
O	not
O	forgotten
O	in
O	this
O	great
O	glorification
O	.
O	Next
O	to
O	His
O	Majesty
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	certainly
O	the
O	first
O	of
O	mankind
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	names
O	were
O	worthy
O	of
O	going
O	down
O	with
O	his
O	to
O	the
O	remotest
O	posterity
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	envious
O	ones
O	were
O	thunderstruck
O	.
O	They
O	tried
O	to
O	console
O	themselves
O	by
O	saying
O	that
O	the
O	work
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	finished
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	an
O	accident
O	might
O	happen
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	moment
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	really
O	believe
O	a
O	word
O	of
O	this
O	.
O	Notwithstanding
O	all
O	their
O	efforts
O	to
O	look
O	cheerful
O	,
O	it
O	had
O	to
O	be
O	acknowledged
O	that
O	the
O	cooking
O	was
O	possible
O	.
O	Their
O	last
O	resource
O	was
O	to
O	declare
O	the
O	tart
O	a
O	bad
O	one
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	would
O	be
O	biting
O	off
O	their
O	own
O	noses
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	declining
O	to
O	eat
O	it
O	,
O	envy
O	could
O	never
O	go
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	of
O	the
O	Greedy
O	.
O	After
O	two
O	days
O	,
O	the
O	unerring
O	nose
O	of
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	discovered
O	that
O	the
O	tart
O	was
O	cooked
O	to
O	perfection
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	country
O	was
O	perfumed
O	with
O	its
O	delicious
O	aroma
O	.
O	Nothing
O	more
O	remained
O	but
O	to
O	take
O	down
O	the
O	furnaces
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	made
O	her
O	official
O	announcement
O	to
O	His
O	Majesty
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	delighted
O	,
O	and
O	complimented
O	her
O	upon
O	her
O	punctuality
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	was
O	still
O	wanting
O	to
O	complete
O	the
O	month
O	.
O	During
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	people
O	gave
O	their
O	eager
O	help
O	to
O	the
O	engineer
O	in
O	the
O	demolition
O	,
O	wishing
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	hand
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	national
O	work
O	and
O	to
O	hasten
O	the
O	blessed
O	moment
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	twinkling
O	of
O	an
O	eye
O	the
O	thing
O	was
O	done
O	.
O	The
O	bricks
O	were
O	taken
O	down
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	,
O	counted
O	carefully
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	again
O	,
O	to
O	serve
O	for
O	another
O	occasion
O	.
O	The
O	TART
O	,
O	unveiled
O	,
O	appeared
O	at
O	last
O	in
O	all
O	its
O	majesty
O	and
O	splendour
O	.
O	The
O	dome
O	was
O	gilded
O	,
O	and
O	reflected
O	the
O	rays
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	dazzling
O	manner
O	.
O	The
O	wildest
O	excitement
O	and
O	rapture
O	ran
O	through
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	Greedy
O	.
O	Each
O	one
O	sniffed
O	with
O	open
O	nostrils
O	the
O	appetizing
O	perfume
O	.
O	Their
O	mouths
O	watered
O	,
O	their
O	eyes
O	filled
O	with
O	tears
O	,
O	they
O	embraced
O	,
O	pressed
O	each
O	other
O	'
O	s
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	indulged
O	in
O	touching
O	pantomimes
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	town
O	and
O	country
O	,
O	united
O	by
O	one
O	rapturous
O	feeling
O	,
O	joined
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	danced
O	in
O	a
O	ring
O	around
O	the
O	grand
O	confection
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	dared
O	to
O	touch
O	the
O	tart
O	before
O	the
O	arrival
O	of
O	His
O	Majesty
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	something
O	must
O	be
O	done
O	to
O	allay
O	the
O	universal
O	impatience
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	resolved
O	to
O	show
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	the
O	gratitude
O	with
O	which
O	all
O	hearts
O	were
O	filled
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	crowned
O	with
O	the
O	laurel
O	of
O	_conquerors_
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	also
O	the
O	laurel
O	of
O	_sauce_
O	,
O	thus
O	serving
O	a
O	double
O	purpose
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	placed
O	her
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	crutch
O	and
O	her
O	cat
O	,
O	upon
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	throne
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	her
O	all
O	round
O	her
O	vast
O	work
O	.
O	Before
O	her
O	marched
O	all
O	the
O	musicians
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	dancing
O	,
O	drumming
O	,
O	fifing
O	,
O	and
O	tooting
O	upon
O	all
O	instruments
O	,
O	while
O	behind
O	her
O	pressed
O	an
O	enthusiastic
O	crowd
O	,
O	who
O	rent
O	the
O	air
O	with
O	their
O	plaudits
O	and
O	filled
O	it
O	with
O	a
O	shower
O	of
O	caps
O	.
O	Her
O	fame
O	was
O	complete
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	noble
O	pride
O	shone
O	on
O	her
O	countenance
O	.
O	The
O	royal
O	procession
O	arrived
O	.
O	A
O	grand
O	stairway
O	had
O	been
O	built
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	his
O	ministers
O	could
O	mount
O	to
O	the
O	summit
O	of
O	this
O	monumental
O	tart
O	.
O	Thence
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	amid
O	a
O	deep
O	silence
O	,
O	thus
O	addressed
O	his
O	people
O	:
O	``
O	My
O	children

O	said
O	he
O	,

O	A
O	breach

O	soon

O	The

O	The

O	the

O	like
O	the
O	balm
O	of
O	Gilead
O	on
O	her
O	cut
O	thumb
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	unhappy
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	.
O	She
O	wondered
O	if
O	her
O	father
O	would
O	whip
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	made
O	up
O	her
O	mind
O	not
O	to
O	cry
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	.
O	After
O	Jonas
O	came
O	back
O	she
O	still
O	crouched
O	at

O	window
O	.
O	Exactly
O	opposite
O	in
O	the
O	Adams
O	'
O	house
O	was
O	another

O	square
O	window
O	,

O	lighted
O	Sarah

O	All
O	of
O	a
O	sudden
O	Sarah
O	'

O	face
O	appeared
O	there
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	little
O	girls
O	stared
O	pitifully
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	.
O	Presently
O	Sarah
O	raised
O	her
O	window
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	a
O	stick
O	under
O	it
O	;
O	then
O	Submit
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	.
O	They
O	put
O	their
O	faces
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	a
O	minute
O	before
O	speaking
O	.
O	Sarah
O	'
O	s
O	face
O	was
O	streaming
O	with
O	tears
O	.
