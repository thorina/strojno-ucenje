O	to
O	what
O	he
O	heard
O	with
O	no
O	small
O	grief
O	of
O	mind
O	,
O	seeing
O	that
O	all
O	hopes
O	of
O	his
O	earldom
O	vanished
O	away
O	like
O	smoke
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fair
O	Princess
O	Micomicona
O	was
O	turned
O	into
O	Dorothea
O	,
O	whilst
O	his
O	master
O	was
O	sound
O	asleep
O	,
O	careless
O	of
O	all
O	that

O	.
O	Dorothea
O	could
O	not
O	believe
O	that
O	the
O	happiness
O	she
O	enjoyed
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	dream
O	.
O	Cardenio
O	and
O	Lucinda
O	were
O	of
O	a
O	similar
O	mind
O	,
O	and
O	Don
O	Fernando
O	was
O	truly
O	thankful
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	free
O	from
O	the
O	dangerous
O	path
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	,
O	which
O	must
O	have
O	ended
O	in
O	loss
O	of
O	all
O	honour
O	and
O	credit
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	all
O	were
O	contented
O	and
O	happy
O	.
O	The
O	curate
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	sense
O	,
O	congratulated
O	every
O	one
O	on
O	his
O	good
O	fortune
O	;
O	but
O	she
O	that
O	kept
O	greatest
O	jubilee
O	and
O	joy
O	was
O	the
O	hostess
O	,
O	because
O	Cardenio
O	and
O	the
O	curate
O	had
O	promised
O	to
O	pay
O	all
O	the
O	damages
O	done
O	by
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	.
O	Only
O	Sancho
O	,
O	as
O	has
O	been
O	said
O	,
O	was
O	unhappy
O	and
O	sorrowful
O	.
O	And
O	thus
O	he
O	went
O	with
O	a
O	melancholy
O	face
O	to
O	his
O	master
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	then
O	just
O	awaking
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	:

O	any

O	This
O	being

O	so
O	that

O	could

O	strange
O	faces
O	that
O	he
O	saw
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	immediately
O	he
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	idea
O	,
O	which
O	his
O	wild
O	imagination
O	had
O	at
O	once
O	suggested
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	that
O	all
O	these

O	were
O	spirits

O	happened

O	brought
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	cage
O	,
O	they
O	shut
O	him
O	within
O	,
O	and
O	afterwards
O	nailed
O	the
O	bars
O	thereof
O	so

O	when

O	Once
O	upon

O	time
O	the
O	youngest

O	of
O	a
O	king
O	became
O	filled
O	with
O	the
O	desire
O	to
O	go
O	abroad
O	and
O	see
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	He
O	got
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	permission
O	to
O	depart
O	,
O	kissed
O	his
O	parents
O	good-bye
O	,
O	mounted
O	his
O	black
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	galloped
O	away
O	down
O	the
O	high
O	road
O	.
O	Soon
O	the
O	gray
O	towers
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	castle
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	born
O	hid
O	themselves
O	behind

O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	journeyed
O	on

O	the
O	days
O	in

O	,

O	the
O	nights
O	in
O	little
O	wayside
O	inns
O	,
O	till
O	one
O	day
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	Adamant
O	Mountains
O	.
O	The
O	great
O	,
O	red
O	granite
O	crags
O	of
O	the

O	peaks
O	rose
O	out
O	of
O	the

O	snow
O	like

O	glaciers
O	sparkled
O	in
O	the

O	like

O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	sat
O	down
O	by
O	some
O	stunted
O	trees
O	whose
O	tops
O	had
O	long
O	before
O	been
O	broken
O	off
O	by
O	an
O	avalanche
O	,
O	and
O	began

O	eat
O	the
O	bit
O	of
O	bread
O	and
O	cheese
O	which
O	he

O	.
O	And
O	as
O	the

O	sat

O	in

O	casting
O	another

O	his
O	steed
O	,
O	who

O	contentedly
O	browsing
O	,
O	the
O	Prince
O	climbed
O	up
O	the
O	mountainside
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	of
O	the
O	sound
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	climbed
O	and
O	climbed
O	,

O	went
O	in
O	this
O	direction
O	and
O	in
O	that
O	,
O	yet
O	the
O	sound
O	never
O	grew
O	any
O	louder
O	or
O	fainter
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	he
O	realized
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	hopelessly
O	lost
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	path
O	up
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	ridden
O	had
O	vanished
O	completely
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	the
O	slightest
O	idea
O	in
O	which
O	direction
O	it
O	lay
O	.
O	He
O	called
O	aloud
O	,
O	but
O	only
O	the
O	mountain
O	echoes
O	answered
O	mockingly
O	.
O	Night
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Prince
O	took
O	shelter
O	behind
O	a
O	great
O	rock
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	he
O	labored
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	path
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	He
O	grew
O	very
O	hungry
O	and
O	cold
O	.
O	Every
O	once
O	in
O	a
O	while
O	he
O	would
O	hear
O	the
O	roaring
O	of
O	the
O	waterfall
O	,
O	which
O	seemed
O	to
O	have
O	grown
O	louder
O	.
O	Another
O	day
O	dawned
O	,
O	and
O	another
O	day
O	again
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	was
O	getting
O	very
O	weak
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	approaching
O	the
O	mysterious
O	cataract
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	was
O	now
O	tremendous
O	,
O	and
O	heaven
O	and
O	earth
O	were
O	full
O	of
O	its
O	roar
O	.
O	The
O	third
O	night
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	full
O	moon
O	rose
O	solemnly
O	over
O	the
O	snow-clad
O	summits
O	of
O	the
O	lonely
O	and
O	mysterious
O	mountains
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	the
O	Prince
O	,
O	walking
O	blindly
O	on
O	,
O	staggered
O	through
O	a
O	narrow
O	passage-way
O	between
O	two
O	splintered
O	crags
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	himself
O	face
O	to
O	face
O	with
O	the
O	mystery
O	.
O	He
O	stood
O	on
O	the
O	snowy
O	floor
O	of
O	a
O	vast
O	amphitheatre
O	whose
O	walls
O	were
O	the
O	steep
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	giant
O	mountains
O	.
O	Farthest
O	away
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	opposite
O	the
O	moon
O	,
O	the
O	wall
O	of
O	the
O	bowl
O	appeared
O	as
O	a
O	giant
O	black
O	precipice
O	,
O	whose
O	top
O	seemed
O	to
O	reach
O	almost
O	to
O	the
O	moon-dimmed
O	stars
O	;
O	and
O	over
O	this
O	precipice
O	a
O	broad
O	river
O	was
O	endlessly
O	pouring
O	,
O	shining
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	like
O	the
O	overflow
O	of
O	an
O	ocean
O	of
O	molten
O	silver
O	.
O	Though
O	now
O	very
O	weak
O	from
O	lack
O	of
O	food
O	,
O	and
O	dizzy
O	with
O	the
O	roaring
O	of
O	the
O	cataract
O	,
O	the
O	Prince
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	the
O	foaming
O	and
O	eddying
O	lake
O	into
O	which
O	the
O	water
O	was
O	falling
O	.
O	Great
O	was
O	his
O	surprise
O	to
O	discover
O	that
O	the
O	overflow
O	of
O	this
O	lake
O	disappeared
O	into
O	the
O	earth
O	through
O	a
O	long
O	,
O	low
O	opening
O	in
O	the
O	cliff
O	behind
O	the
O	fall
O	.
O	Greater
O	still
O	was
O	his
O	surprise
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	strange
O	many-colored
O	light
O	burning
O	within
O	the
O	cave
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	toward
O	the
O	light
O	,
O	along
O	a
O	narrow
O	beach
O	of
O	white
O	sand
O	lying
O	between
O	the
O	wall
O	of
O	the
O	cavern
O	and
O	the
O	racing
O	waters
O	of
O	the
O	mysterious
O	river
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	glow
O	came
O	from
O	a
O	magnificent
O	lantern
O	studded
O	with
O	emeralds
O	,
O	topazes
O	,
O	amethysts
O	,
O	and
O	rubies
O	,
O	which
O	hung
O	by
O	a
O	chain
O	from
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	the
O	grotto
O	.
O	Directly
O	under
O	this
O	lantern
O	,
O	drawn
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	sand
O	,
O	lay
O	a
O	little
O	boat
O	with
O	a
O	lantern
O	fastened
O	to
O	the
O	bow
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	pushed
O	the
O	boat
O	into
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	swift
O	current
O	seized
O	him
O	and
O	hurried
O	him
O	away
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	the
O	cavern
O	grew
O	higher
O	and
O	wider
O	;
O	then
O	it
O	shrank
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	borne
O	along
O	with
O	incredible
O	speed
O	,
O	shot
O	down
O	a
O	rocky
O	passageway
O	into
O	the
O	very
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	The
O	passageway
O	broadened
O	once
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boat
O	rode
O	gently
O	through
O	monstrous
O	caves
O	whose
O	roofs
O	were
O	upheld
O	by
O	twisted
O	columns
O	taller
O	than
O	the
O	tallest
O	tree
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	times
O	when
O	all
O	was
O	so
O	still
O	that
O	the
O	Prince
O	could
O	easily
O	have
O	imagined
O	himself
O	back
O	in
O	the
O	solitude
O	of
O	the
O	mountains
O	;
O	there
O	were
O	times
O	when
O	the
O	foaming
O	and
O	roaring
O	of
O	the
O	underground
O	river
O	grew
O	so
O	deafening
O	that
O	the
O	Prince
O	feared
O	lest
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	approaching
O	the
O	brink
O	of
O	a
O	subterranean
O	cataract
O	.
O	Many
O	hours
O	passed
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	whether
O	it
O	was
O	night
O	or
O	day
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	boat
O	was
O	gliding
O	through
O	a
O	vast
O	hall
O	,
O	he
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	awoke
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	boat
O	was
O	floating
O	on
O	the
O	black
O	,
O	glassy
O	surface
O	of
O	an
O	immense
O	underground
O	ocean
O	.
O	All
O	signs
O	of
O	the
O	cavern
O	had
O	disappeared
O	.
O	Far
O	away
O	,
O	over
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	this
O	ocean
O	,
O	a
O	strange
O	,
O	beautiful
O	glow
O	mounted
O	into
O	the
O	starless
O	sky
O	of
O	the
O	underworld
O	.
O	And
O	while
O	the
O	Prince
O	was
O	gazing
O	at
O	the
O	glow
O	,
O	the
O	boat
O	swung
O	into
O	a
O	new
O	current
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	borne
O	swiftly
O	toward
O	the
O	light
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	the
O	light
O	grew
O	so
O	wide
O	and
O	bright
O	that
O	one
O	would
O	have
O	believed
O	that
O	a
O	strange
O	,
O	golden
O	sun
O	had
O	risen
O	.
O	The
O	boat
O	passed
O	between
O	two
O	giant
O	marble
O	pillars
O	supporting
O	enormous
O	crystal
O	globes
O	filled
O	with
O	a
O	golden
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Prince
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	harbor
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	.
O	A
O	city
O	lay
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	a
O	strange
O	golden
O	city
O	edging
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	a
O	vast
O	,
O	semi-circular
O	bay
O	.
O	Because
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	there
O	is
O	neither
O	sun
O	nor
O	moon
O	,
O	the
O	people
O	have
O	to
O	be
O	continually
O	burning
O	lights
O	;
O	and
O	so
O	many
O	and
O	so
O	great
O	were
O	the
O	lanterns
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	that
O	the
O	town
O	was
O	as
O	bright
O	as
O	day
O	.
O	The
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	harbor
O	was
O	marked
O	with
O	a
O	row
O	of
O	golden
O	lanterns
O	;
O	there
O	were
O	immense
O	lanterns
O	at
O	every
O	six
O	paces
O	along
O	the
O	streets
O	;
O	a
O	lantern
O	hung
O	from
O	every
O	house
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	church-towers
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	having
O	bells
O	in
O	them
O	,
O	had
O	great
O	golden
O	lamps
O	which
O	illumined
O	everything
O	for
O	some
O	distance
O	about
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	every
O	inhabitant
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	carried
O	a
O	lantern
O	with
O	him
O	wherever
O	he
O	went
O	,
O	the
O	rich
O	carrying
O	golden
O	lanterns
O	set
O	with
O	transparent
O	precious
O	stones
O	,
O	the
O	poor
O	carrying
O	lights
O	of
O	ordinary
O	glass
O	.
O	Soon
O	the
O	Prince
O	saw
O	a
O	magnificent
O	ship
O	coming
O	out
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	prow
O	was
O	carved
O	in
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	a
O	dragon
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	beautiful
O	lantern
O	hung
O	from
O	its
O	jaws
O	.
O	Overcome
O	by
O	hunger
O	and
O	fatigue
O	,
O	the
O	poor
O	Prince
O	fell
O	insensible
O	to
O	the
O	floor
O	of
O	his
O	little
O	boat
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	senses
O	again
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	lying
O	between
O	sheets
O	of
O	the
O	whitest
O	,
O	most
O	delicate
O	linen
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	four-poster
O	bed
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	room
O	in
O	the
O	royal
O	palace
O	.
O	Thanks
O	to
O	his
O	kind
O	hosts
O	,
O	the
O	Prince
O	soon
O	recovered
O	his
O	strength
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	was
O	completely
O	himself
O	again
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	summoned
O	to
O	an
O	audience
O	with
O	the
O	Queen
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	.
O	The
O	Queen
O	,
O	a
O	very
O	beautiful
O	young
O	woman
O	,
O	wearing
O	a
O	wonderful
O	lantern
O	crown
O	,
O	sat
O	on
O	an
O	ebony
O	throne
O	.
O	On
O	each
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	throne
O	stood
O	a
O	tall
O	soldier
O	,
O	clad
O	in
O	scarlet
O	and
O	holding
O	a
O	long
O	ebony
O	staff
O	surmounted
O	by
O	a
O	round
O	lantern
O	lit
O	by
O	a
O	golden
O	flame
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	dropped
O	on
O	his
O	knee
O	,
O	and
O	thanked
O	the
O	Queen
O	for
O	her
O	kindness
O	and
O	hospitality
O	.
O	``
O	You
O	are
O	the
O	first
O	stranger
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	for
O	a
O	thousand
O	years
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	young
O	Queen
O	.
O	``
O	If
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	asking
O	too
O	much
O	from
O	a
O	guest
O	,
O	pray
O	how
O	did
O	you
O	happen
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	river
O	of
O	the
O	underworld
O	?
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	Prince
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	and
O	described
O	his
O	adventures
O	in
O	the
O	mountains
O	.
O	You
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	the
O	Queen
O	was
O	glad
O	to
O	hear
O	of
O	his
O	royal
O	birth
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	had
O	fallen
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	him
O	at
O	first
O	sight
O	.
O	A
O	month
O	passed
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	remained
O	a
O	guest
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	All
O	kinds
O	of
O	festivities
O	were
O	given
O	in
O	his
O	honor
O	;
O	there
O	were
O	wonderful
O	dances
O	,
O	masquerades
O	,
O	picnics
O	,
O	and
O	theatricals
O	going
O	on
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	the
O	Prince
O	and
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	accompanied
O	by
O	a
O	little
O	group
O	of
O	courtiers
O	,
O	rode
O	to
O	the
O	frontier
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	.
O	The
O	lovers
O	galloped
O	ahead
O	of
O	the
O	party
O	and
O	reached
O	a
O	little
O	hill
O	beyond
O	which
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	more
O	lanterns
O	.
O	Ahead
O	of
O	them
O	the
O	rolling
O	land
O	,
O	sweeping
O	farther
O	and
O	farther
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	light
O	,
O	grew
O	darker
O	and
O	darker
O	,
O	till
O	it
O	finally
O	plunged
O	into
O	the
O	eternal
O	night
O	of
O	the
O	underworld
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	weeping
O	.
O	``
O	Dear
O	love
O	,
O	why
O	do
O	you
O	weep
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	the
O	Prince
O	,
O	who
O	felt
O	sad
O	to
O	see
O	tears
O	in
O	his
O	lady
O	'
O	s
O	lovely
O	eyes
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	weep
O	to
O	think

O	must
O	soon
O	part

O	.
O	``

O	.
O	``
O	A

O	.
O	``
O	Alas
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	``
O	the
O	Enchanter

O	We

O	at
O	a

O	given

O	of
O	the

O	Dragondel
O	pursued
O	me
O	with

O	.
O	A
O	few
O	days
O	afterwards
O	,
O	an
O	iron
O	boat
O	arrived
O	in
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	,
O	having
O	on
O	board
O	a
O	giant
O	blue
O	dog
O	who
O	is
O	Dragondel
O	'
O	s
O	younger
O	brother
O	.
O	This
O	terrible
O	animal
O	,
O	from
O	whose
O	sight
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	fled
O	screaming
O	,
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	dropped
O	at
O	my
O	feet
O	a
O	jeweled
O	casket
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	carried
O	between

O	jaws
O	.
O	The
O	casket
O	contained
O	Dragondel
O	'
O	s
O	request
O	for
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	added
O	that
O	,
O	were
O	I
O	to
O	refuse
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	let

O	winged
O	spirits
O	against
O	the
O	lanterns
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	vision
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	in
O	darkness
O	;
O	of
O	my
O	poor
O	subjects
O	dying

O	Rather

O	let
O	this

O	Soon
O	I

O	the
O	Queen
O	dabbed

O	The
O	Prince
O	and
O	the

O	felt
O	very

O	On
O	the

O	,
O	sure

O	,
O	the

O	A
O	dozen
O	of

O	in
O	which
O	the
O	young
O	Queen
O	could
O	be
O	rescued
O	from
O	the

O	formed
O	in

O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the

O	It
O	stood
O	on
O	the

O	of
O	a

O	The
O	Prince
O	took
O	his
O	place
O	in
O	the

O	,

O	sought

O	,
O	the
O	poor

O	making
O	pastries
O	for
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	the

O	anything

O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning

O	terrible
O	moaning

O	outside
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	cooks

O	had
O	been

O	too
O	near
O	Dragondel
O	'

O	had
O	formed
O	,
O	and
O	caught
O	the
O	boat
O	in
O	its
O	awful
O	circle
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	went
O	slowly
O	round

O	down

O	the
O	awful

O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	it
O	vanished
O	.
O	An
O	instant
O	later
O	,
O	the

O	had
O	disappeared
O	,

O	The
O	Prince
O	shuddered
O	.
O	``
O	Well

O	you
O	have
O	had
O	given
O	you
O	for
O	the
O	pastry
O	icings
O	,
O	and
O	bring
O	it
O	to
O	me
O	tomorrow
O	night
O	at
O	this
O	very
O	hour
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	Prince
O	worked
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	carving
O	and
O	gilding
O	the
O	little
O	golden
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	next
O	night
O	he
O	gave
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	cat
O	.
O	The
O	cat
O	took
O	it
O	in
O	her
O	mouth
O	as
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	a
O	mouse
O	,
O	walked
O	coolly
O	by
O	the
O	panthers
O	,
O	and
O	entered
O	Dragondel
O	'
O	s
O	room
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	just
O	succeeded
O	in
O	getting
O	the
O	true
O	hand
O	out
O	from
O	under
O	the
O	magician
O	'
O	s
O	pillow
O	when
O	Dragondel
O	woke
O	up
O	.
O	The
O	cat
O	was
O	clever
O	enough
O	to
O	pretend
O	to
O	be
O	engaged
O	in
O	a
O	mouse-hunt
O	,
O	so
O	the
O	Enchanter
O	paid
O	no
O	attention
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	once
O	more
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	cat
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	got
O	under
O	Dragondel
O	'
O	s
O	couch
O	again
O	,
O	the
O	two
O	hands
O	lay
O	side
O	by
O	side
O	and
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	remember
O	just
O	which
O	one
O	was
O	the
O	talisman
O	and
O	which
O	one
O	the
O	false
O	hand
O	.
O	So
O	because
O	she
O	had
O	to
O	act
O	quickly
O	,
O	she
O	put
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	hands
O	under
O	the
O	pillow
O	,
O	brought
O	the
O	other
O	to
O	the
O	Prince
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	her
O	story
O	.
O	But
O	so
O	well
O	matched
O	were
O	the
O	little
O	hands
O	,
O	that
O	even
O	the
O	Prince
O	was
O	far
O	from
O	certain
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	got
O	his
O	own
O	hand
O	back
O	again
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	came
O	the
O	seventh
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	day
O	on
O	which
O	Dragondel
O	,
O	the
O	blue
O	dog
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	wicked
O	Enchanter
O	'
O	s
O	friends
O	were
O	to
O	sail
O	to
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	for
O	the
O	marriage
O	ceremony
O	.
O	The
O	iron
O	ship
O	,
O	made
O	gay
O	with
O	a
O	thousand
O	small
O	scarlet
O	lanterns
O	,
O	stood
O	ready
O	to
O	carry
O	them
O	over
O	.
O	The
O	Enchanter
O	and
O	his
O	company
O	got
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	vessel
O	left
O	the
O	island
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	stood
O	watching
O	the
O	ship
O	from
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	cliffs
O	.
O	What
O	anxiety
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	!
O	If
O	Dragondel
O	still
O	possessed
O	the
O	true
O	talisman
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	cross
O	the
O	whirlpool
O	safely
O	,
O	and
O	marry
O	the
O	beautiful
O	Queen
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	.
O	The
O	vessel
O	sped
O	on
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	now
O	at
O	some
O	distance
O	from
O	the
O	island
O	.
O	``
O	All
O	is
O	lost
O	,
O	``
O	thought
O	the
O	Prince
O	with
O	a
O	sinking
O	heart
O	;
O	``
O	Dragondel
O	has
O	the
O	true
O	talisman
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	in
O	his
O	bitterness
O	he
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	throw
O	the
O	little
O	golden
O	hand
O	which
O	lay
O	in
O	his
O	pocket
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	the
O	air
O	became
O	filled
O	with
O	a
O	terrible
O	moaning
O	;
O	the
O	sea
O	became
O	troubled
O	;
O	the
O	whirlpool
O	awoke
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Prince
O	saw
O	the
O	red
O	lights
O	of
O	the
O	Enchanter
O	'
O	s
O	ship
O	whirled
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	,
O	faster
O	and
O	faster
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	disappeared
O	forever
O	in
O	the
O	waters
O	of
O	the
O	sunless
O	sea
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	Prince
O	,
O	he
O	soon
O	found
O	another
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	with
O	him
O	the
O	talisman
O	,
O	his
O	fellow
O	servants
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	black
O	cat
O	and
O	her
O	kittens
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	,
O	married
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	happily
O	ever
O	after
O	.
