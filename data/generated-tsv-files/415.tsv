O	Every
O	boy
O	has
O	wondered
O	how
O	there
O	came
O	to
O	be
O	two
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	Every
O	girl
O	has
O	puzzled
O	over
O	how
O	she
O	happened
O	to
O	be
O	twins
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	she
O	is
O	the
O	good
O	girl
O	,
O	--
O	sometimes
O	a
O	naughty
O	one
O	.
O	The
O	Indians
O	say
O	this
O	is
O	how
O	it
O	happened
O	.
O	The
O	world
O	was
O	very
O	young
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	earth
O	,
O	only
O	a
O	cloud-like
O	sea
O	.
O	The
O	sea
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	water
O	animals
O	,
O	and
O	water
O	birds
O	flew
O	over
O	it
O	.
O	All
O	was
O	dark
O	.
O	Light
O	had
O	not
O	yet
O	come
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	cloud-sea
O	began
O	to
O	call
O	for
O	light
O	.
O	The
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	heard
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	It
O	shall
O	be
O	so
O	.
O	I
O	will
O	make
O	a
O	new
O	place
O	for
O	man
O	to
O	live
O	in
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	called
O	the
O	beautiful
O	Sky
O	Mother
O	to
O	Him
O	.
O	Her
O	face
O	was
O	like
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	light
O	of
O	heart
O	.
O	The
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	told
O	the
O	Sky
O	Mother
O	to
O	look
O	down
O	.
O	She
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	heard
O	the
O	cloud-sea
O	calling
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	.
O	``
O	As
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	descend
O	,
O	the
O	animals
O	saw
O	her
O	coming
O	.
O	``
O	See
O	the
O	light
O	,
O	``
O	they
O	cried
O	.
O	``
O	Where
O	will
O	it
O	rest
O	?
O	``
O	One
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	animals
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	get
O	something
O	for
O	it
O	to
O	rest
O	on
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	went
O	down
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	never
O	came
O	back
O	.
O	Other
O	animals
O	followed
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	did
O	not
O	come
O	back
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	muskrat
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	.
O	I
O	will
O	be
O	the
O	earth
O	bringer
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	returned
O	,
O	with
O	some
O	mud
O	in
O	his
O	mouth
O	and
O	claws
O	.
O	``
O	It
O	will
O	grow
O	fast
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	cried
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	weak
O	voice
O	.
O	``
O	Who
O	will
O	carry
O	it
O	?
O	``
O	The
O	turtle
O	offered
O	his
O	back
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	muskrat
O	placed
O	the
O	mud
O	on
O	the
O	turtle
O	'
O	s
O	shell
O	he
O	died
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	beaver
O	came
O	and
O	slapped
O	the
O	mud
O	down
O	with
O	his
O	tail
O	.
O	The
O	mud
O	on
O	the
O	turtle
O	'
O	s
O	back
O	grew
O	very
O	fast
O	.
O	Soon
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	small
O	island
O	.
O	The
O	turtle
O	became
O	the
O	earth
O	bearer
O	.
O	He
O	has
O	continued
O	to
O	hold
O	up
O	the
O	earth
O	ever
O	since
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	sea
O	rises
O	in
O	great
O	waves
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	earth
O	shakes
O	,
O	the
O	Indians
O	say
O	,
O	``
O	The
O	turtle

O	He
O	is
O	wiggling
O	his

O	``
O	Now
O	,

O	there
O	was
O	a
O	place
O	for
O	the
O	light
O	to
O	rest
O	on
O	,
O	the
O	birds
O	flew
O	up
O	to
O	meet
O	it
O	.
O	They
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	light
O	was
O	the
O	beautiful
O	Sky
O	Mother
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	birds
O	spread
O	wide
O	their
O	great
O	wings
O	,
O	and
O	bore
O	the
O	Sky
O	Mother
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	to
O	the
O	cloud-sea
O	.
O	They
O	placed
O	her
O	on
O	the
O	island
O	on
O	the
O	turtle
O	'
O	s
O	back
O	.
O	There
O	the
O	Sky
O	Mother
O	had
O	rested
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	felt
O	something
O	stirring
O	beneath
O	her
O	heart
O	.
O	She
O	heard
O	voices
O	.
O	One
O	was
O	soft
O	and
O	kind
O	and
O	full
O	of
O	love
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	was
O	harsh
O	and
O	quarrelsome
O	.
O	Soon
O	the
O	Sky
O	Mother
O	looked
O	into
O	the
O	faces
O	of
O	the
O	first-born
O	of
O	earth
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	had
O	borne
O	the
O	twin
O	brothers
O	,
O	the
O	spirits
O	of
O	Good
O	and
O	Evil
O	.
O	As
O	she
O	looked
O	into
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	Good
O	Mind
O	,
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	You
O	shall
O	be
O	called
O	the
O	Light
O	One
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	she
O	looked
O	into
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	You
O	shall
O	be
O	named
O	the
O	Dark
O	One
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	island
O	became
O	a
O	beautiful

O	.
O	The
O	twin
O	brother
O	Light
O	One
O	grew
O	up
O	happy
O	,
O	loving
O	,
O	peaceful
O	,
O	and
O	kind
O	.
O	He
O	wanted
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	new
O	land
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	place
O	in
O	which
O	to

O	.
O	The
O	twin
O	brother
O	Dark
O	One
O	grew
O	up
O	sullen
O	,
O	quarrelsome
O	,
O	hateful
O	,
O	and
O	unkind
O	.
O	He
O	tried
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	land
O	the
O	worst

O	in
O	which
O	to

O	From
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	beautiful
O	face
O	the
O	Light
O	One
O	made
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	He
O	set
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	eastern
O	sky
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	might
O	shine
O	forever
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Dark
O	One
O	put
O	darkness
O	in
O	the
O	west
O	to
O	drive
O	the
O	sun
O	from
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	The
O	Light
O	One
O	gave
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	body
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	the
O	Great
O	Mother
O	from
O	which
O	springs
O	all
O	life
O	.
O	He
O	made
O	great
O	mountains
O	,
O	and
O	covered
O	them
O	with
O	forests
O	from
O	which
O	beautiful
O	rivers
O	ran
O	.
O	The
O	Dark
O	One
O	threw
O	down
O	the

O	,
O	gnarled
O	the
O	forests
O	,
O	and
O	bent
O	the

O	which
O	his

O	Every

O	One
O	tried

O	And
O	because
