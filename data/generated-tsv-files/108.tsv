O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	had
O	a
O	daughter
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	called
O	``
O	Clever
O	Alice
O	;
O	``
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	grown
O	up
O	,
O	her
O	father
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	We
O	must
O	see
O	about
O	her
O	marrying
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Yes
O	,
O	``
O	replied
O	her
O	mother
O	,
O	``
O	whenever
O	a
O	young
O	man
O	shall
O	appear
O	who
O	is
O	worthy

O	.
O	``
O	At
O	last
O	a
O	certain
O	youth
O	,
O	by
O	name
O	Hans
O	,
O	came
O	from
O	a
O	distance
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	proposal
O	of
O	marriage
O	but
O	he
O	required
O	one
O	condition
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	Clever
O	Alice
O	should
O	be
O	very
O	prudent
O	.
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	her
O	father
O	,
O	``
O	no
O	fear
O	of
O	that
O	!
O	she
O	has
O	got
O	a
O	head
O	full
O	of
O	brains
O	;
O	``
O	and
O	the
O	mother
O	added
O	,
O	``
O	Ah
O	,
O	she
O	can
O	see
O	the
O	wind

O	up

O	,
O	and
O	hear
O	the
O	flies

O	!
O	``
O	``
O	Very
O	well
O	,
O	``
O	replied
O	Hans
O	;
O	``
O	but
O	remember
O	,
O	if
O	she
O	is
O	not
O	very
O	prudent
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	take
O	her
O	.
O	``
O	Soon
O	afterwards
O	they
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	dinner
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	mother
O	said

O	``
O	Alice

O	down

O	draw
O	some

O	.
O	``
O	So
O	Clever
O	Alice
O	took
O	the
O	jug
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	cellar
O	,
O	jerking
O	the
O	lid
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	on
O	her
O	way
O	,
O	to
O	pass
O	away
O	the
O	time
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	she
O	got
O	downstairs
O	,
O	she
O	drew
O	a
O	stool
O	and
O	placed
O	it
O	before
O	the
O	cask
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	not

O	to

O	,
O	for
O	she
O	thought
O	stooping
O	might
O	in
O	some
O	way
O	injure
O	her
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	give
O	it
O	an
O	undesirable
O	bend
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	placed
O	the
O	can
O	before
O	her
O	and
O	turned
O	the
O	tap
O	,
O	and
O	while
O	the
O	beer
O	was
O	running
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	wish
O	her
O	eyes
O	to
O	be
O	idle
O	,
O	she
O	looked
O	about
O	upon
O	the
O	wall
O	above
O	and
O	below
O	.
O	Presently
O	she
O	perceived
O	,
O	after
O	much
O	peeping
O	into
O	this
O	corner
O	and
O	that
O	corner
O	,
O	a
O	hatchet
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	bricklayers
O	had
O	left
O	behind
O	,
O	sticking
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	ceiling
O	right
O	above
O	her
O	head
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	this
O	Clever
O	Alice
O	began
O	to
O	cry
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	Oh

O	weeping
O	with
O	all

O	the
O	impending

O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	the
O	good
O	folks
O	upstairs
O	were
O	waiting

O	but
O	as

O	The

O	sitting
O	before
O	the

O	crying
O	heartily
O	,
O	and

O	And
O	,
O	sitting
O	down

O	too
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	misfortune

O	to

O	After
O	a

O	the
O	servant
O	did
O	not

O	,
O	the
O	good
O	folks
O	above
O	began
O	to
O	feel
O	very
O	thirsty
O	;
O	so
O	the
O	husband
O	told
O	the
O	boy
O	to

O	The

O	went
O	down

O	there
O	sat
O	Clever
O	Alice
O	and
O	the
O	maid
O	both
O	crying
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	asked
O	the
O	reason
O	;
O	and
O	Alice
O	told
O	him
O	the
O	same
O	tale
O	,
O	of
O	the

O	When

O	and
O	fell
O	weeping
O	and
O	howling
O	with
O	the
O	others
O	.
O	Upstairs
O	they
O	were
O	still
O	waiting

O	So

O	down

O	three
O	sitting

O	crying

O	Then
O	the

O	,
O	sitting
O	down

O	much
O	as
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	rest
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	the
O	husband
O	waited
O	for
O	his
O	wife

O	but
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	felt
O	so
O	very
O	thirsty
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``

O	As
O	soon

O	he
O	found
O	the
O	four
O	sitting
O	and
O	crying
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	reason

O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	cry
O	with
O	the
O	whole
O	strength

O	his
O	lungs

O	All
O	this

O	so
O	he
O	went
O	down
O	to

O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	entered
O	,

O	the
O	five
O	crying

O	over
O	her
O	head
O	while
O	she
O	still
O	slept
O	on
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	back
O	again
O	and
O	shut
O	to
O	the
O	house-door
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	seating
O	himself
O	on
O	his
O	stool
O	,
O	began
O	working
O	very
O	industriously
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	nearly
O	dark
O	,
O	the
O	Clever
O	Alice
O	awoke
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	she
O	stood
O	up
O	,
O	the
O	net
O	fell
O	all
O	over
O	her
O	hair
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bells
O	jingled
O	at
O	every
O	step
O	she
O	took
O	.
O	This
O	quite
O	frightened
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	doubt
O	whether
O	she
O	were
O	really
O	Clever
O	Alice
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	herself
O	,
O	``
O	Am
O	I
O	she
O	,
O	or
O	am
O	I
O	not
O	?
O	``
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	question
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	answer
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	stood
O	still
O	a
O	long
O	while
O	considering
O	about
O	it
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	thought
O	she
O	would
O	go
O	home
O	and
O	ask
O	whether
O	she
O	were
O	really
O	herself
O	--
O	supposing
O	somebody
O	would
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	tell
O	her
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	house-door
O	it
O	was
O	shut
O	;
O	so
O	she
O	tapped
O	at
O	the
O	window
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	,
O	``
O	Hans
O	,
O	is
O	Alice
O	within
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	Yes
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	replied
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	is
O	.
O	``
O	At
O	which
O	answer
O	she
O	became
O	really
O	terrified
O	,
O	and
O	exclaiming
O	,
O	``
O	Ah
O	,
O	heaven
O	,
O	then
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	Alice
O	!
O	``
O	she
O	ran
O	up
O	to
O	another
O	house
O	,
O	intending
O	to
O	ask
O	the
O	same
O	question
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	folks
O	within
O	heard
O	the
O	jingling
O	of
O	the
O	bells
O	in
O	her
O	net
O	,
O	they
O	refused
O	to
O	open
O	their
O	doors
O	,
O	and
O	nobody
O	would
O	receive
O	her
O	.
O	So
O	she
O	ran
O	straight
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	one
O	has
O	ever
O	seen
O	her
O	since
O	.
