O	History
O	relates
O	that
O	after
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	King
O	Don
O	Ferrando
O	of
O	Spain
O	,
O	the
O	three
O	kings
O	,
O	his
O	sons
O	,
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	,
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	and
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	,
O	reigned
O	each
O	in
O	his
O	kingdom
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	division
O	made
O	by
O	their
O	father
O	.
O	Don
O	Ferrando
O	had
O	divided
O	into
O	five
O	portions
O	(
O	one
O	for
O	each
O	of
O	the
O	sons
O	and
O	one
O	for
O	each
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	daughters
O	,
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	and
O	Donya
O	Elvira
O	)
O	that
O	which
O	should
O	all
O	by
O	right
O	have
O	descended
O	to
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	as
O	the
O	eldest
O	son
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	the
O	kings
O	of
O	Spain
O	were
O	of
O	the
O	blood
O	of
O	the
O	Goths
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	fierce
O	blood
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	had
O	many
O	times
O	come
O	to
O	pass
O	among
O	the
O	Gothic
O	kings
O	,
O	that
O	brother
O	had
O	slain
O	brother
O	.
O	From
O	this
O	blood
O	was
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	descended
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	reproach
O	to
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	join
O	together
O	the
O	three
O	kingdoms
O	under
O	his
O	own
O	dominion
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	pleased
O	with
O	what
O	his
O	father
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	,
O	holding
O	that
O	the
O	whole
O	ought
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	his
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	went
O	through
O	the
O	land
O	setting
O	it
O	in
O	order
O	,
O	and
O	what
O	thing
O	soever
O	his
O	people
O	asked
O	,
O	that
O	did
O	he
O	grant
O	them
O	freely
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	end
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	win
O	their
O	hearts
O	.
O	When
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	of
O	Navarre
O	,
O	nephew
O	of
O	Don
O	Ferrando
O	,
O	saw
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	new
O	king
O	in
O	Castille
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	to
O	recover
O	the
O	lands
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	lost
O	when
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	was
O	defeated
O	and
O	slain
O	in
O	the
O	mountains
O	of
O	Oca
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	seeing
O	that
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Ferrando
O	was
O	divided
O	,
O	he
O	asked
O	help
O	of
O	his
O	uncle
O	Don
O	Ramiro
O	,
O	King
O	of
O	Aragon;
O	and
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Aragon
O	and
O	of
O	Navarre
O	entered
O	Castille
O	together
O	.
O	But
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	gathered
O	together
O	his
O	host
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	the
O	Cid
O	at
O	their
O	head;
O	and
O	such
O	account
O	did
O	he
O	give
O	of
O	his
O	enemies
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	of
O	Navarre
O	was
O	glad
O	to
O	lay
O	no
O	farther
O	claim
O	to
O	what
O	his
O	father
O	had
O	lost
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	of
O	Castille
O	was
O	wroth
O	against
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Aragon
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	thus
O	have
O	joined
O	against
O	him
O	without
O	cause;
O	and
O	in
O	despite
O	of
O	him
O	he
O	marched
O	against
O	the
O	Moors
O	of
O	Zaragoza
O	,
O	and
O	laying
O	waste
O	their
O	country
O	with
O	fire
O	and
O	sword
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	before
O	their
O	city
O	,
O	gave
O	orders
O	to
O	assault
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	set
O	up
O	his
O	engines
O	.
O	The
O	Moors
O	seeing
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	themselves
O	,
O	made
O	such
O	terms
O	with
O	him
O	as
O	it
O	pleased
O	him
O	to
O	grant
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	hostages
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	prove
O	false
O	.
O	They
O	gave
O	him
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	and
O	precious
O	stones
O	in
O	abundance
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	with
O	great
O	riches
O	and
O	full
O	honourably
O	did
O	he
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	men
O	depart
O	from
O	the
O	siege
O	.
O	Greatly
O	was
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Aragon
O	displeased
O	at
O	this
O	which
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	had
O	done
O	.
O	He
O	required
O	he
O	should
O	yield
O	unto
O	him
O	all
O	the
O	spoil
O	which
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Zaragoza
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	,
O	else
O	should
O	he
O	not
O	pass
O	without
O	battle
O	.
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	,
O	being
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	great
O	heart
O	,
O	made
O	answer
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	kingdoms
O	of
O	Castille
O	and
O	Leon
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	conquests
O	in
O	Spain
O	were
O	his
O	.
O	Wherefore
O	he
O	counselled
O	him
O	to
O	waive
O	his
O	demand
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	him
O	pass
O	in
O	peace
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Aragon
O	drew
O	up
O	his
O	host
O	for
O	battle
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	onset
O	was
O	made
O	,
O	and
O	heavy
O	blows
O	were
O	dealt
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	horses
O	were
O	left
O	without
O	a
O	master
O	.
O	And
O	while
O	the
O	battle
O	was
O	yet
O	undecided
O	,
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	riding
O	right
O	bravely
O	through
O	the
O	battle
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	call
O	out
O	Castille
O	!
O	Castille
O	!
O	and
O	charged
O	the
O	main
O	body
O	so
O	fiercely
O	that
O	by
O	fine
O	force
O	he
O	broke
O	them;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	thus
O	broken
O	,
O	the
O	Castillians
O	began
O	cruelly
O	to
O	slay
O	them
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	had
O	pity
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	to
O	his
O	people
O	not
O	to
O	kill
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	Christians
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Don
O	Ramiro
O	being
O	discomfited
O	,
O	retired
O	to
O	a
O	mountain
O	,
O	and
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	beset
O	the
O	mountain
O	round
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	covenant
O	with
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	depart
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Zaragoza
O	should
O	remain
O	tributary
O	to
O	Castille;
O	and
O	but
O	for
O	this
O	covenant
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Aragon
O	would
O	then
O	have
O	been
O	slain
O	,
O	or
O	made
O	prisoner
O	.
O	In
O	all
O	these
O	wars
O	did
O	my
O	Cid
O	demean
O	himself
O	after
O	his
O	wonted
O	manner;
O	and
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	feats
O	which
O	he
O	performed
O	the
O	king
O	loved
O	him
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	him
O	his
O	Alfarez
O	,
O	[
O	:
O	A
O	standard
O	bearer]
O	so
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	army
O	he
O	was
O	second
O	only
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	And
O	because
O	when
O	the
O	host
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	field
O	it
O	was
O	his
O	office
O	to
O	choose
O	the
O	place
O	for
O	encampment
O	,
O	therefore
O	was
O	my
O	Cid
O	called
O	the
O	Campeador
O	.
O	[
O	:
O	One
O	who
O	is
O	remarkable
O	for
O	his
O	exploits]
