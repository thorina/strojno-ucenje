O	of
O	fluff
O	,
O	which
O	meant
O	some

O	to

O	.
O	At
O	one

O	a

O	,
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	laughing
O	at
O	the
O	way
O	in
O	which
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	Bryda
O	'
O	s
O	shoes
O	floated
O	about
O	like
O	little
O	canoes
O	,
O	till
O	one
O	that
O	had
O	a
O	hole
O	at
O	the
O	side
O	turned
O	over
O	and
O	went
O	down
O	.
O	This
O	happened
O	at
O	Bryda
O	'
O	s
O	own
O	home
O	,
O	before
O	her
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	went
O	away
O	.
O	Mother
O	was
O	not
O	pleased
O	,
O	of
O	course;
O	but
O	still
O	she
O	was
O	not
O	quite
O	so
O	dreadfully
O	shocked
O	as
O	the
O	grannies
O	were
O	at
O	the
O	adventure
O	in
O	the
O	old
O	tub
O	.
