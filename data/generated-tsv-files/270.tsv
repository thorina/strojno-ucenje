O	There
O	was
O	once
O	a
O	woman
O	who
O	had
O	three
O	daughters
O	,
O	of
O	whom
O	the
O	eldest
O	was
O	named
O	``
O	One
O	Eye
O	,
O	``
O	because
O	she
O	had
O	only
O	one
O	eye
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	her
O	forehead
O	.
O	The
O	second
O	had
O	two
O	eyes
O	,
O	like
O	other
O	people
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	called
O	``
O	Two
O	Eyes
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	youngest
O	had
O	three
O	eyes
O	,
O	two
O	like
O	her
O	second
O	sister
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	her
O	forehead
O	,
O	like
O	the
O	eldest
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	bore
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	``
O	Three
O	Eyes
O	.
O	``
O	Now
O	because
O	little
O	Two
O	Eyes
O	looked
O	just
O	like
O	other
O	people
O	,
O	her
O	mother
O	and
O	sisters
O	could
O	not
O	endure
O	her
O	.
O	They
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	``
O	You
O	are
O	not
O	better
O	than
O	common
O	folks
O	,

O	two
O	eyes
O	;
O	you
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	belong
O	to
O	us
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	they
O	pushed
O	her
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	all
O	their
O	old
O	clothes
O	to
O	her
O	for
O	her
O	to
O	wear
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	her
O	only
O	the
O	pieces
O	that
O	were
O	left
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	everything
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	to
O	make
O	her
O	miserable
O	.
O	It
O	so
O	happened
O	that
O	little
O	Two
O	Eyes
O	was
O	sent
O	into
O	the
O	fields
O	to
O	take
O	care
O	of
O	the
O	goats
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	often
O	very
O	hungry
O	,
O	although
O	her
O	sisters
O	had
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	they
O	liked
O	to
O	eat
O	.
O	So
O	one
O	day
O	she
O	seated
O	herself
O	on
O	a
O	mound
O	in
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	and
O	cry
O	so
O	bitterly
O	that
O	two
O	little
O	rivulets
O	flowed
O	from
O	her
O	eyes
O	.
O	Once
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	her
O	sorrow
O	she
O	looked
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	woman
O	standing
O	near
O	her
O	who
O	said
O	,
O	``

O	they

O	that

O	Eyes
O	took
O	her

O	to
O	the
O	field

O	Eye
O	should
O	go

O	she
O	drove
O	the

O	not
O	the

O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	Three
O	Eyes
O	was
O	wide
O	awake
O	with
O	one
O	eye
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	and
O	saw
O	all
O	that
O	Two
O	Eyes
O	did
O	;
O	for
O	poor
O	little
O	Two
O	Eyes
O	,
O	thinking
O	she
O	was
O	asleep
O	,
O	said
O	her
O	speech
O	to
O	the
O	goat
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	table
O	came
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	good
O	things
O	on
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	carried
O	away
O	when
O	Two
O	Eyes
O	had
O	eaten
O	enough
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	cunning
O	Three
O	Eyes
O	saw
O	it
O	all
O	with
O	her
O	one
O	eye
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	pretended
O	to

O	asleep
O	when

O	sister
O	came
O	to

O	her

O	left
O	the

O	a
O	most
O	wonderful
O	tree

O	there

O	one
O	night
O	,
O	excepting
O	little
O	Two

O	the

O	was
O	impatient
O	,

O	climbed
O	up
O	herself

O	with
O	no

O	``
O	But
O	Two

O	them
O	one

O	she
O	carried
O	down
O	her
O	own

O	The

O	took
O	them

O	,
O	and
O	the
O	knight
O	was
O	astonished
O	to
O	find
O	her
O	so
O	beautiful
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Little
O	Two
O	Eyes
O	,
O	can
O	you
O	break
O	off
O	a
O	branch
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	for
O	me
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	Oh
O	yes
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	replied
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	can
O	,
O	very
O	easily
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	tree
O	belongs
O	to
O	me
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	she
O	climbed
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	without
O	any
O	trouble
O	,
O	broke
O	off
O	a
O	branch
O	with
O	its
O	silver
O	leaves
O	and
O	golden
O	fruit
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	knight
O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	down
O	at
O	her
O	as
O	she
O	stood
O	by
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Little
O	Two
O	Eyes
O	,
O	what
O	shall
O	I
O	give
O	you
O	for
O	this
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	Ah
O	!
O	``
O	she
O	answered
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	suffer
O	from
O	hunger
O	and
O	thirst
O	,
O	and
O	sorrow
O	,
O	and
O	trouble
O	,
O	from
O	early
O	morning
O	till
O	late
O	at
O	night
O	;
O	if
O	you
O	would
O	only
O	take
O	me
O	with
O	you
O	,
O	and
O	release
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	so
O	happy
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	knight
O	lifted
O	the
O	little
O	maiden
O	on
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	home
O	with
O	her
O	to
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	castle
O	.
O	There
O	she
O	was
O	given
O	beautiful
O	clothes
O	to
O	wear
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	much
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	drink
O	as
O	she
O	wished
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	grew
O	up
O	the
O	young
O	knight
O	loved
O	her
O	so
O	dearly
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	married
O	with
O	great
O	rejoicings
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	two
O	sisters
O	saw
O	little
O	Two
O	Eyes
O	carried
O	away
O	by
O	the
O	handsome
O	young
O	knight
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	overjoyed
O	at
O	their
O	good
O	fortune
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	wonderful
O	tree
O	belongs
O	to
O	us
O	now
O	,
O	``
O	they
O	said
O	;
O	``
O	even
O	if
O	we
O	can
O	not
O	break
O	off
O	a
O	branch
O	,
O	yet
O	everybody
O	who
O	passes
O	will
O	stop
O	to
O	admire
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	make
O	acquaintance
O	with
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	who
O	knows
O	?
O	we
O	may
O	get
O	husbands
O	after
O	all
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	when
O	they
O	rose
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	,
O	lo
O	!
O	the
O	tree
O	had
O	vanished
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	it
O	all
O	their
O	hopes
O	.
O	And
O	on
O	this
O	very
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	little
O	Two
O	Eyes
O	looked
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	chamber
O	window
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	she
O	saw
O	,
O	to
O	her
O	great
O	joy
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	tree
O	had
O	followed
O	her
O	.
O	Little
O	Two
O	Eyes
O	lived
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	in
O	great
O	happiness
O	;
O	but
O	she
O	heard
O	nothing
O	of
O	her
O	sisters
O	,
O	till
O	one
O	day
O	two
O	poor
O	women
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	to
O	beg
O	for
O	alms
O	.
O	Little
O	Two
O	Eyes
O	saw
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	looking
O	earnestly
O	in
O	their
O	faces
O	,
O	she
O	recognised
O	her
O	two
O	sisters
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	become
O	so
O	poor
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	obliged
O	to
O	beg
O	their
O	bread
O	from
O	door
O	to
O	door
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	good
O	sister
O	received
O	them
O	most
O	kindly
O	,
O	and
O	promised
O	to
O	take
O	care
O	of
O	them
O	and
O	give
O	them
O	all
O	they
O	wanted
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	they
O	did
O	indeed
O	repent
O	and
O	feel
O	sorry
O	for
O	having
O	treated
O	her
O	so
O	badly
O	in
O	their
O	youthful
O	days
O	.
