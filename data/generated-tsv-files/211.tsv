O	``
O	So
O	the

O	speedily
O	cast
O	off
O	his

O	donned
O	a

O	so
O	did
O	all

O	The

O	rode
O	together
O	,

O	``
O	Faith

O	``
O	When
O	they
O	drew
O	near
O	Nottingham
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	stood
O	to
O	behold
O	them
O	.
O	They
O	saw
O	nothing
O	but
O	mantles
O	of
O	green
O	covering
O	all

O	;
O	then
O	every

O	began
O	saying
O	to
O	another
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	dread

O	will
O	never

O	one
O	of
O	us
O	alive
O	.
O	``
O	They
O	all
O	hastened
O	to
O	make
O	their
O	escape
O	,
O	both
O	men
O	and
O	lads
O	,
O	yeomen
O	and
O	peasants
O	;
O	the
O	ploughman
O	left
O	the
O	plough
O	in
O	the
O	fields
O	,
O	the
O	smith
O	left
O	his
O	shop
O	,
O	and
O	old
O	wives
O	who
O	could
O	scarcely
O	walk
O	hobbled
O	along
O	on
O	their
O	staves
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	laughed
O	loud
O	and
O	long
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	townsfolk
O	scurry
O	off
O	in
O	this
O	fashion
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	commanded
O	them
O	to
O	come
O	back
O	.
O	He
O	soon
O	let
O	them
O	understand
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	from
O	that
O	day
O	for
O	evermore
O	he
O	had
O	pardoned
O	Robin
O	Hood
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	found
O	out
O	the
O	tall
O	outlaw
O	in
O	the
O	Lincoln
O	green
O	was
O	really
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	overjoyed
O	;
O	they
O	danced
O	and
O	sang
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	great
O	feasting
O	and
O	revelry
O	for
O	gladness
O	at
O	his
O	safe
O	return
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Edward
O	called
O	Sir
O	Richard
O	Lee
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	gave
O	him
O	his
O	lands
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	be
O	a
O	good
O	man
O	.
O	Sir
O	Richard
O	thanked
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	paid
O	homage
O	to
O	him
O	as
O	the
O	true
O	and
O	loyal
O	knight
O	he
O	had
O	always
O	been
O	.
O	So
O	Robin
O	Hood
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	London
O	with
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	dwelt
O	at
O	court
O	.
O	But
O	before
O	many
O	months
O	had
O	gone
O	he
O	found
O	all
O	his
O	money
O	had
O	melted
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	nothing
O	left
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	spent
O	over
O	a
O	hundred
O	pounds
O	and
O	now
O	had
O	not
O	enough
O	to
O	pay
O	the
O	fees
O	of
O	his
O	followers
O	.
O	For
O	everywhere
O	he
O	went
O	he
O	had
O	always
O	been
O	laying
O	down
O	money
O	both
O	for
O	knights
O	and
O	squires
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	win
O	renown
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	could
O	no
O	longer
O	afford
O	to
O	pay
O	their
O	fee
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	new
O	retainers
O	left
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	year
O	he
O	had
O	none
O	but
O	two
O	still
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	those
O	were
O	his
O	own
O	faithful
O	old
O	comrades
O	,
O	Little
O	John
O	and
O	Will
O	Scarlet
O	.
O	It
O	happened
O	one
O	day
O	some
O	young
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	went
O	out
O	to
O	shoot
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	Robin
O	Hood
O	stood
O	with
O	a
O	sad
O	heart
O	to
O	watch
O	them
O	,
O	a
O	sudden
O	great
O	longing
O	for
O	his
O	old
O	life
O	in
O	the
O	greenwood
O	came
O	over
O	him
O	.
O	``

O	sure
O	of
O	eye
O	and
O	strong
O	of
O	hand
O	;
O	I
O	was

O	through

O	Robin
O	Hood
O	went
O	and

O	a

O	.
O	``

O	I
O	built
O	a

O	.
O	``
O	Seven

O	Thanking

O	saluted

O	It
O	was
O	a
O	fair
O	morning

O	forest
O	.
O	The
O	sun
O	shone
O	,
O	the
O	soft
O	green
O	turf
O	was

O	rolled
O	away
