O	of
O	1699
O	,
O	the
O	greater
O	part
O	of
O	his
O	time
O	was
O	given
O	up
O	to
O	military
O	exercises
O	and
O	field
O	sports
O	,
O	with
O	but
O	little
O	attention
O	to
O	debates
O	in
O	council
O	or
O	to
O	the
O	cares
O	of
O	state
O	.
O	Among
O	his
O	chief
O	enjoyments
O	were
O	the
O	sham
O	fights
O	on
O	land
O	and
O	water
O	.
O	Many
O	a
O	hard-fought
O	battle
O	was
O	waged
O	between
O	the
O	boys
O	and
O	young
O	men
O	who
O	made
O	up
O	his
O	guards
O	and
O	crews
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	would
O	be
O	divided
O	into
O	two
O	or
O	more
O	opposing
O	parties
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	plan
O	of
O	battle
O	required
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	rough
O	and
O	dangerous
O	sport
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	attended
O	often
O	with
O	really
O	serious
O	results
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	participants
O	were
O	stout
O	and
O	sturdy
O	Northern
O	lads
O	,
O	used
O	to
O	hardships
O	and
O	trained
O	to
O	physical
O	endurance
O	.
O	They
O	thought
O	no
O	more
O	of
O	these
O	encounters
O	than
O	do
O	the
O	boys
O	of
O	to-day
O	of
O	the
O	crush
O	of
O	football
O	and
O	the
O	hard
O	hitting
O	of
O	the
O	baseball
O	field
O	,
O	and
O	blows
O	were
O	given
O	and
O	taken
O	with
O	equal
O	good
O	nature
O	and
O	unconcern
O	.

O	in

O	full
O	of

O	upon

O	.
O	Now
O	Arvid
O	Horn
O	had

O	Arvid
O	fell
O	fainting

O	the

O	battle
O	at
O	``

O	came
O	to
O	a
O	sudden

O	.
O	But
O	the
O	heat
O	and
O	the

O	And
O	among

O	Arvid

O	the
O	bear
O	backward
O	in
O	the
O	snow
O	.

O	a
O	floundering
O	prisoner

O	while
O	the
O	intrepid
O	king
O	coolly
O	cut
O	its
O	throat
O	with
O	his
O	sharp
O	hunting-knife

O	Arvid
O	learned
O	to
O	do
O	this

O	of
O	November
O	,
O	1700
O	,
O	the
O	boy
O	from
O	Sweden
O	appeared
O	with
O	his
O	eight
O	thousand
O	victory-flushed
O	though
O	wearied
O	troops
O	before
O	the
O	fortified
O	camp
O	of
O	his
O	enemy
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	without
O	a
O	moment
O	'
O	s
O	hesitation
O	,
O	ordered
O	instant
O	battle
O	.
O	``
O	Sire
O	,

O	said
O	one

O	General
O	Stenbock
O	,
O	``

O	``
O	What
O	,

O	said
O	the

O	,
O	``

O	to

O	through
O	a

O	Again
O	valor
O	and

O	The
O	Russian
O	line
O	broke
O	before
O	the
O	impetuosity
O	of
O	the
O	Swedes
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as

O	,
O	the

O	army
O	of
O	eighty

O	but
O	eight
O	thousand
O	tired
O	soldiers
O	at

O	.
O	So
O	the
O	boy
O	conqueror
O	entered
O	upon

O	career
O	of
O	victory
O	.

O	at

O	.
O	How
O	,
O	at

O	,
O	his
O	ambition
O	getting
O	the
O	better
O	of
O	his
O	discretion
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	to

O	to
O	make

O	How
O	,
O	by
O	unwise
O	measures
O	and
O	foolhardy
O	endeavors
O	,

O	there
O	a
O	prisoner
O	of

O	for
O	over
O	five

O	;

O	THE
O	TRUE
O	STORY
O	OF
O	A
O	KIDNAPPED
O	BOY
O	AS
O	TOLD
O	BY
O	HIMSELF
O	By
O	Peter
O	Williamson
O	I
O	was
O	born
O	in
O	Hirulay
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	county
O	of
O	Aberdeen
O	,
O	Scotland
O	.
O	My
O	parents
O	,
O	though
O	not
O	rich
O	,
O	were
O	respectable
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	long
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	under
O	their
O	care
O	all
O	went
O	well
O	with
O	me
O	.
O	Unhappily
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	sent
O	to
O	stay
O	with
O	an
O	aunt
O	at
O	Aberdeen
O	,
O	where
O	,
O	at
O	eight
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	when
O	playing
O	on
O	the
O	quay
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	noticed
O	as
O	a
O	strong
O	,
O	active
O	little
O	fellow
O	by
O	two
O	men
O	belonging
O	to
O	a
O	vessel
O	in
O	the
O	harbor
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	this
O	vessel
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	employ
O	of
O	certain
O	merchants
O	of
O	Aberdeen
O	,
O	who
O	used
O	her
O	for
O	the
O	villanous
O	purpose
O	of
O	kidnapping
O	--
O	that
O	is
O	,
O	stealing
O	young
O	children
O	from
O	their
O	parents
O	and
O	selling
O	them
O	as
O	slaves
O	in
O	the
O	plantations
O	abroad
O	.
O	These
O	impious
O	monsters
O	,
O	marking
O	me
O	out
O	for
O	their
O	prey
O	,
O	tempted
O	me
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	entered
O	than
O	they
O	led
O	me
O	between
O	the
O	decks
O	to
O	some
O	other
O	boys
O	whom
O	they
O	had
O	kidnapped
O	in
O	like
O	manner
O	.
O	Not
O	understanding
O	what
O	a
O	fate
O	was
O	in
O	store
O	for
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	passed
O	the
O	time
O	in
O	childish
O	amusement
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	lads
O	in
O	the
O	steerage
O	,
O	for
O	we
O	were
O	never
O	allowed
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	deck
O	while
O	the
O	vessel
O	stayed
O	in
O	the
O	harbor
O	,
O	which
O	it
O	did
O	till
O	they
O	had
O	imprisoned
O	as
O	many
O	luckless
O	boys
O	as
O	they
O	needed
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	ship
O	set
O	sail
O	for
O	America
O	.
O	I
O	can
O	not
O	remember
O	much
O	of
O	the
O	voyage
O	,
O	being
O	a
O	mere
O	child
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	shall
O	never
O	forget
O	what
O	happened
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	nearly
O	ended
O	.
O	We
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	American
O	coast
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	hard
O	gale
O	of
O	wind
O	sprang
O	up
O	from
O	the
O	southeast
O	,
O	and
O	about
O	midnight
O	the
O	ship
O	struck
O	on
O	a
O	sandbank
O	off
O	Cape
O	May
O	,
O	near
O	Delaware
O	.
O	To
O	the
O	terror
O	of
O	all
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	soon
O	almost
O	full
O	of
O	water
O	.
O	The
O	boat
O	was
O	then
O	hoisted
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	and
O	his
O	fellow-villains
O	,
O	the
O	crew
O	,
O	got
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	leaving
O	me
O	and
O	my
O	deluded
O	companions
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	supposed
O	,
O	to
O	perish
O	.
O	The
O	cries
O	,
O	shrieks
O	,
O	and
O	tears
O	of
O	a
O	throng
O	of
O	children
O	had
O	no
O	effect
O	on
O	these
O	merciless
O	wretches
O	.
O	But
O	happily
O	for
O	us
O	the
O	wind
O	abated
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	ship
O	being
O	on
O	a
O	sandbank
O	,
O	which
O	did
O	not
O	give
O	way
O	to
O	let
O	her
O	deeper
O	,
O	we
O	lay
O	here
O	till
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	unwilling
O	to
O	lose
O	all
O	his
O	cargo
O	,
O	sent
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	crew
O	in
O	a
O	boat
O	to
O	the
O	ship
O	'
O	s
O	side
O	to
O	bring
O	us
O	ashore
O	.
O	A
O	sort
O	of
O	camp
O	was
O	made
O	,
O	and
O	here
O	we
O	stayed
O	till
O	we
O	were
O	taken
O	in
O	by
O	a
O	vessel
O	bound
O	to
O	Philadelphia
O	.
O	At
O	Philadelphia
O	,
O	people
O	soon
O	came
O	to
O	buy
O	us
O	.
O	We
O	were
O	sold
O	for
O	ae16
O	apiece
O	.
O	I
O	never
O	knew
O	what
O	became
O	of
O	my
O	unhappy
O	companions
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	was
O	sold
O	for
O	seven
O	years
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	countrymen
O	,
O	Hugh
O	Wilson
O	,
O	who
O	in
O	his
O	youth
O	had
O	suffered
O	the
O	same
O	fate
O	as
O	myself
O	in
O	being
O	kidnapped
O	from
O	his
O	home
O	.
O	Happy
O	was
O	my
O	lot
O	in
O	falling
O	into
O	his
O	power
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	humane
O	,
O	worthy
O	man
O	.
O	Having
O	no
O	children
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	pitying
O	my
O	sad
O	condition
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	great
O	care
O	of
O	me
O	till
O	I
O	was
O	fit
O	for
O	business
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	twelve
O	years
O	old
O	set
O	me
O	about
O	little
O	things
O	till
O	I
O	could
O	manage
O	harder
O	work
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	seeing
O	my
O	fellow-servants
O	often
O	reading
O	and
O	writing
O	,
O	I
O	felt
O	a
O	strong
O	desire
O	to
O	learn
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	my
O	master
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	glad
O	to
O	serve
O	a
O	year
O	longer
O	than
O	the
O	bond
O	obliged
O	me
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	let
O	me
O	go
O	to
O	school
O	.
O	To
O	this
O	he
O	readily
O	agreed
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	went
O	every
O	winter
O	for
O	five
O	years
O	,
O	also
O	learning
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	from
O	my
O	fellow-servants
O	.
O	With
O	this
O	good
O	master
O	I
O	stayed
O	till
O	I
O	was
O	seventeen
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	died
O	,
O	leaving
O	me
O	a
O	sum
O	of
O	money
O	,
O	about
O	ae120
O	sterling
O	,
O	his
O	best
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	wearing
O	apparel
O	.
O	I
O	now
O	maintained
O	myself
O	by
O	working
O	about
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	for
O	any
O	one
O	who
O	would
O	employ
O	me
O	,
O	for
O	nearly
O	seven
O	years
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	determined
O	to
O	settle
O	down
O	.
O	I
O	applied
O	to
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	a
O	prosperous
O	planter
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	my
O	suit
O	was
O	acceptable
O	both
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	her
O	father
O	,
O	so
O	we
O	married
O	.
O	My
O	father-in-law
O	,
O	wishing
O	to
O	establish
O	us
O	comfortably
O	,
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	tract
O	of
O	land
O	which
O	lay
O	,
O	unhappily
O	for
O	me
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	has
O	since
O	proved
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	frontiers
O	of
O	Pennsylvania
O	.
O	It
O	contained
O	about
O	two
O	hundred
O	acres
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	good
O	house
O	and
O	barn
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	now
O	happy
O	in
O	my
O	home
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	good
O	wife
O	;
O	but
O	my
O	peace
O	did
O	not
O	last
O	long
O	,
O	for
O	about
O	1754
O	the
O	Indians
O	in
O	the
O	French
O	interest
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	formerly
O	been
O	very
O	troublesome
O	in
O	our
O	province
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	renew
O	their
O	old
O	practices
O	.
O	Even
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	Indians
O	whom
O	we
O	supposed
O	to
O	be
O	in
O	the
O	English
O	interest
O	joined
O	the
O	plundering
O	bands
O	;
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	wonder
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	French
O	did
O	their
O	utmost
O	to
O	win
O	them
O	over
O	,
O	promising
O	to
O	pay
O	ae15
O	for
O	every
O	scalp
O	of
O	an
O	Englishman
O	!
O	Hardly
O	a
O	day
O	passed
O	but
O	some
O	unhappy
O	family
O	fell
O	a
O	victim
O	to
O	French
O	bribery
O	and
O	savage
O	cruelty
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	me
O	,
O	though
O	now
O	in
O	comfortable
O	circumstances
O	,
O	with
O	an
O	affectionate
O	and
O	amiable
O	wife
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	I
O	suddenly
O	became
O	the
O	most
O	pitiable
O	of
O	mankind
O	.
O	I
O	can
O	never
O	bear
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	the
O	last
O	time
O	I
O	saw
O	my
O	dear
O	wife
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	fatal
O	2d
O	of
O	October
O	,
O	1754
O	.
O	That
O	day
O	she
O	had
O	left
O	home
O	to
O	visit
O	some
O	of
O	her
O	relations
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	being
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	but
O	myself
O	,
O	I
O	stayed
O	up
O	later
O	than
O	usual
O	,
O	expecting
O	her
O	return
O	.
O	How
O	great
O	was
O	my
O	terror
O	when
O	,
O	at
O	eleven
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	I
O	heard
O	the
O	dismal
O	warwhoop
O	of
O	the
O	savages
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	flying
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	,
O	saw
O	a
O	band
O	of
O	them
O	outside
O	,
O	about
O	twelve
O	in
O	number
O	.
O	They
O	made
O	several
O	attempts
O	to
O	get
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	asked
O	them
O	what
O	they
O	wanted
O	.
O	They
O	paid
O	no
O	attention
O	,
O	but
O	went
O	on
O	beating
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	trying
O	to
O	get
O	it
O	open
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	having
O	my
O	gun
O	loaded
O	in
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	I
O	threatened
O	them
O	with
O	death
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	go
O	away
O	.
O	But
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	who
O	could
O	speak
O	a
O	little
O	English
O	,
O	called
O	out
O	in
O	return
O	that
O	if
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	come
O	out
O	they
O	would
O	burn
O	me
O	alive
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	They
O	told
O	me
O	further
O	--
O	what
O	I
O	had
O	already
O	found
O	out
O	--
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	no
O	friends
O	to
O	the
O	English
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	if
O	I
O	would
O	surrender
O	myself
O	prisoner
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	kill
O	me
O	.
O	My
O	horror
O	was
O	beyond
O	all
O	words
O	.
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	depend
O	on
O	the
O	promises
O	of
O	such
O	creatures
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	must
O	either
O	accept
O	their
O	offer
O	or
O	be
O	burned
O	alive
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	house
O	with
O	my
O	gun
O	in
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	not
O	knowing
O	what
O	I
O	did
O	or
O	that
O	I
O	still
O	held
O	it
O	.
O	Immediately
O	,
O	like
O	so
O	many
O	tigers
O	,
O	they
O	rushed
O	on
O	me
O	and
O	disarmed
O	me
O	.
O	Having
O	me
O	now
O	completely
O	in
O	their
O	power
O	,
O	the
O	merciless
O	villains
O	bound
O	me
O	to
O	a
O	tree
O	near
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	plundered
O	what
O	they
O	could
O	.
O	Numbers
O	of
O	things
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	unable
O	to
O	carry
O	away
O	were
O	set
O	fire
O	to
O	with
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	consumed
O	before
O	my
O	eyes
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	set
O	fire
O	to
O	my
O	barn
O	,
O	stable
O	,
O	and
O	outhouses
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	about
O	two
O	hundred
O	bushels
O	of
O	wheat
O	,
O	and
O	cows
O	,
O	sheep
O	,
O	and
O	horses
O	.
O	My
O	agony
O	as
O	I
O	watched
O	all
O	this
O	havoc
O	it
O	is
O	impossible
O	to
O	describe
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	terrible
O	business
O	was
O	over
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	monsters
O	came
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	a
O	tomahawk
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	threatening
O	me
O	with
O	a
O	cruel
O	death
O	if
O	I
O	would
O	not
O	consent
O	to
O	go
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	agree
O	,
O	promising
O	to
O	do
O	all
O	that
O	was
O	in
O	my
O	power
O	for
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	trusting
O	to
O	Providence
O	to
O	deliver
O	me
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	hands
O	.
O	On
O	this
O	they
O	untied
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	great
O	load
O	to
O	carry
O	on
O	my
O	back
O	,
O	under
O	which
O	I
O	travelled
O	all
O	that
O	night
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	full
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	terrible
O	fear
O	lest
O	my
O	unhappy
O	wife
O	should
O	likewise
O	have
O	fallen
O	into
O	their
O	clutches
O	.
O	At
O	daybreak
O	my
O	master
O	ordered
O	me
O	to
O	lay
O	down
O	my
O	load
O	,
O	tying
O	my
O	hands
O	round
O	a
O	tree
O	with
O	a
O	small
O	cord
O	.
O	They
O	then
O	kindled
O	a
O	fire
O	near
O	the
O	tree
O	to
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	bound
O	,
O	which
O	redoubled
O	my
O	agony
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	thought
O	they
O	were
O	going
O	to
O	sacrifice
O	me
O	there
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	fire
O	was
O	made
O	,
O	they
O	danced
O	round
O	me
O	after
O	their
O	manner
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	kinds
O	of
O	antics
O	,
O	whooping
O	and
O	crying
O	out
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	horrible
O	fashion
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	took
O	the
O	burning
O	coals
O	and
O	sticks
O	,
O	flaming
O	with
O	fire
O	at
O	the
O	ends
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	them
O	near
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	head
O	,
O	hands
O	and
O	feet
O	,
O	with
O	fiendish
O	delight
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	threatening
O	to
O	burn
O	me
O	entirely
O	if
O	I
O	called
O	out
O	or
O	made
O	the
O	least
O	noise
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	tortured
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	,
O	I
O	could
O	make
O	no
O	sign
O	of
O	distress
O	but
O	shedding
O	silent
O	tears
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	,
O	they
O	took
O	fresh
O	coals
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	them
O	near
O	my
O	eyes
O	,
O	telling
O	me
O	my
O	face
O	was
O	wet
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	would
O	dry
O	it
O	for
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	often
O	wondered
O	how
O	I
O	endured
O	these
O	tortures
O	;
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	were
O	satisfied
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	round
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	roasted
O	the
O	meat
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	brought
O	from
O	my
O	dwelling
O	!
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	prepared
O	it
O	,
O	they
O	offered
O	some
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	it
O	may
O	be
O	imagined
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	much
O	heart
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	seem
O	pleased
O	,
O	lest
O	if
O	I
O	refused
O	it
O	they
O	should
O	again
O	begin
O	to
O	torture
O	me
O	.
O	What
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	eat
O	I
O	contrived
O	to
O	get
O	between
O	the
O	bark
O	and
O	the
O	tree
O	--
O	my
O	foes
O	having
O	unbound
O	my
O	hands
O	till
O	they
O	supposed
O	I
O	had
O	eaten
O	all
O	they
O	gave
O	me
O	.
O	But
O	then
O	they
O	bound
O	me
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	I
O	continued
O	all
O	day
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	set
O	they
O	put
O	out
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	covered
O	the
O	ashes
O	with
O	leaves
O	,
O	as
O	is
O	their
O	custom
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	white
O	people
O	may
O	find
O	no
O	signs
O	of
O	their
O	having
O	been
O	there
O	.
O	Travelling
O	thence
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	for
O	about
O	six
O	miles
O	,
O	I
O	being
O	loaded
O	heavily
O	,
O	we
O	reached
O	a
O	spot
O	near
O	the
O	Blue
O	Hills
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	savages
O	hid
O	their
O	plunder
O	under
O	logs
O	of
O	wood
O	.
O	Thence
O	,
O	shocking
O	to
O	relate
O	,
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	a
O	neighboring
O	house
O	,
O	that
O	of
O	Jacob
O	Snider
O	,
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	five
O	children
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	a
O	servant
O	.
O	They
O	soon
O	forced
O	their
O	way
O	into
O	the
O	unhappy
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	dwelling
O	,
O	slew
O	the
O	whole
O	family
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	fire
O	to
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	The
O	servant
O	'
O	s
O	life
O	was
O	spared
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	since
O	they
O	thought
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	of
O	use
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	forthwith
O	loaded
O	him
O	with
O	plunder
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	the
O	cruel
O	treatment
O	that
O	we
O	suffered
O	;
O	and
O	though
O	I
O	tried
O	to
O	console
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	hope
O	of
O	deliverance
O	,
O	he
O	continued
O	to
O	sob
O	and
O	moan
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	the
O	savages
O	,
O	seeing
O	this
O	,
O	instantly
O	came
O	up
O	,
O	struck
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	slew
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	family
O	of
O	John
O	Adams
O	next
O	suffered
O	.
O	All
O	were
O	here
O	put
O	to
O	death
O	except
O	Adams
O	himself
O	,
O	a
O	good
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	whom
O	they
O	loaded
O	with
O	plunder
O	,
O	and
O	day
O	after
O	day
O	continued
O	to
O	treat
O	with
O	the
O	most
O	shocking
O	cruelty
O	,
O	painting
O	him
O	all
O	over
O	with
O	various
O	colors
O	,
O	plucking
O	the
O	white
O	hairs
O	from
O	his
O	beard
O	,
O	and
O	telling
O	him
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	fool
O	for
O	living
O	so
O	long
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	other
O	tortures
O	which
O	he
O	bore
O	with
O	wonderful
O	composure
O	,
O	praying
O	to
O	God
O	.
O	One
O	night
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	tortured
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	and
O	I
O	were
O	sitting
O	together
O	,
O	pitying
O	each
O	other
O	'
O	s
O	misfortunes
O	,
O	another
O	party
O	of
O	Indians
O	arrived
O	,
O	bringing
O	twenty
O	scalps
O	and
O	three
O	prisoners
O	,
O	who
O	gave
O	us
O	terrible
O	accounts
O	of
O	what
O	tragedies
O	had
O	passed
O	in
O	their
O	parts
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	I
O	can
O	not
O	bear
O	to
O	dwell
O	.
O	These
O	three
O	prisoners
O	contrived
O	to
O	escape
O	,
O	but
O	unhappily
O	,
O	not
O	knowing
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	recaptured
O	and
O	brought
O	back
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	then
O	all
O	put
O	to
O	death
O	,
O	with
O	terrible
O	tortures
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	snow
O	now
O	falling
O	,
O	the
O	savages
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	afraid
O	that
O	the
O	white
O	people
O	would
O	follow
O	their
O	tracks
O	upon
O	it
O	and
O	find
O	out
O	their
O	skulking
O	retreats
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	caused
O	them
O	to
O	make
O	their
O	way
O	to
O	their
O	winter
O	quarters
O	,
O	about
O	two
O	hundred
O	miles
O	further
O	from
O	any
O	plantations
O	or
O	English
O	inhabitants
O	.
O	There
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	long
O	and
O	tedious
O	journey
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	almost
O	starved
O	,
O	I
O	arrived
O	with
O	this
O	villainous
O	crew
O	.
O	The
O	place
O	where
O	we
O	had
O	to
O	stay
O	,
O	in
O	their
O	tongue
O	,
O	was
O	called
O	Alamingo
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	wigwams
O	full
O	of
O	Indian
O	women
O	and
O	children
O	.
O	Dancing
O	,
O	singing
O	,
O	and
O	shooting
O	were
O	their
O	general
O	amusements
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	told
O	what
O	successes
O	they
O	had
O	had
O	in
O	their
O	expeditions
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	part
O	of
O	their
O	theme
O	.
O	The
O	severity
O	of
O	the
O	cold
O	increasing
O	,
O	they
O	stripped
O	me
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	clothes
O	and
O	gave
O	me
O	what
O	they
O	usually
O	wear
O	themselves
O	--
O	a
O	blanket
O	,
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	coarse
O	cloth
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	shoes
O	made
O	of
O	deerskin
O	.
O	The
O	better
O	sort
O	of
O	Indians
O	have
O	shirts
O	of
O	the
O	finest
O	linen
O	they
O	can
O	get
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	these
O	some
O	wear
O	ruffles
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	never
O	put
O	them
O	on
O	till
O	they
O	have
O	painted
O	them
O	different
O	colors
O	,
O	and
O	do
O	not
O	take
O	them
O	off
O	to
O	wash
O	,
O	but
O	wear
O	them
O	till
O	they
O	fall
O	into
O	pieces
O	.
O	They
O	are
O	very
O	proud
O	,
O	and
O	delight
O	in
O	trinkets
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	silver
O	plates
O	round
O	their
O	wrists
O	and
O	necks
O	,
O	with
O	several
O	strings
O	of
O	_wampum_
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	made
O	of
O	cotton
O	,
O	interwoven
O	with
O	pebbles
O	,
O	cockle-shells
O	,
O	etc
O	.
O	From
O	their
O	ears
O	and
O	noses
O	they
O	have
O	rings
O	and
O	beads
O	,
O	which
O	hang
O	dangling
O	an
O	inch
O	or
O	two
O	.
O	The
O	hair
O	of
O	their
O	heads
O	is
O	managed
O	in
O	different
O	ways
O	:
O	some
O	pluck
O	out
O	and
O	destroy
O	all
O	except
O	a
O	lock
O	hanging
O	from
O	the
O	crown
O	of
O	the
O	head
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	interweave
O	with
O	wampum
O	and
O	feathers
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	women
O	wear
O	it
O	very
O	long
O	,
O	twisted
O	down
O	their
O	backs
O	,
O	with
O	beads
O	,
O	feathers
O	,
O	and
O	wampum
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	their
O	heads
O	they
O	carry
O	little
O	coronets
O	of
O	brass
O	or
O	copper
O	.
O	No
O	people
O	have
O	a
O	greater
O	love
O	of
O	liberty
O	or
O	affection
O	for
O	their
O	relations
O	,
O	yet
O	they
O	are
O	the
O	most
O	revengeful
O	race
O	on
O	earth
O	,
O	and
O	inhumanly
O	cruel
O	.
O	They
O	generally
O	avoid
O	open
O	fighting
O	in
O	war
O	,
O	yet
O	they
O	are
O	brave
O	when
O	taken
O	,
O	enduring
O	death
O	or
O	torture
O	with
O	wonderful
O	courage
O	.
O	Nor
O	would
O	they
O	at
O	any
O	time
O	commit
O	such
O	outrages
O	as
O	they
O	do
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	tempted
O	by
O	drink
O	and
O	money
O	by
O	those
O	who
O	call
O	themselves
O	civilized
O	.
O	At
O	Alamingo
O	I
O	was
O	kept
O	nearly
O	two
O	months
O	,
O	till
O	the
O	snow
O	was
O	off
O	the
O	ground
O	--
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	to
O	be
O	among
O	such
O	creatures
O	!
O	I
O	was
O	too
O	far
O	from
O	any
O	plantations
O	or
O	white
O	people
O	to
O	try
O	to
O	escape
O	;
O	besides
O	,
O	the
O	bitter
O	cold
O	made
O	my
O	limbs
O	quite
O	benumbed
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	contrived
O	to
O	defend
O	myself
O	more
O	or
O	less
O	against
O	the
O	weather
O	by
O	building
O	a
O	little
O	wigwam
O	with
O	the
O	bark
O	of
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	covering
O	it
O	with
O	earth
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	it
O	resemble
O	a
O	cave
O	,
O	and
O	keeping
O	a
O	good
O	fire
O	always
O	near
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	Seeing
O	me
O	outwardly
O	submissive
O	,
O	the
O	savages
O	sometimes
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	little
O	meat
O	,
O	but
O	my
O	chief
O	food
O	was
O	Indian
O	corn
O	.
O	Having
O	liberty
O	to
O	go
O	about
O	was
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	more
O	than
O	I
O	expected
O	;
O	but
O	they
O	knew
O	well
O	it
O	was
O	impossible
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	escape
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	they
O	prepared
O	for
O	another
O	expedition
O	against
O	the
O	planters
O	and
O	white
O	people
O	,
O	but
O	before
O	they
O	set
O	out
O	they
O	were
O	joined
O	by
O	many
O	other
O	Indians
O	from
O	Fort
O	Duquesne
O	,
O	well
O	stored
O	with
O	powder
O	and
O	ball
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	received
O	from
O	the
O	French
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	snow
O	was
O	quite
O	gone
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	no
O	trace
O	of
O	their
O	footsteps
O	could
O	be
O	found
O	,
O	they
O	set
O	out
O	on
O	their
O	journey
O	toward
O	Pennsylvania
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	nearly
O	a
O	hundred
O	and
O	fifty
O	.
O	Their
O	wives
O	and
O	children
O	were
O	left
O	behind
O	in
O	the
O	wigwams
O	.
O	My
O	duty
O	was
O	to
O	carry
O	whatever
O	they
O	intrusted
O	to
O	me
O	;
O	but
O	they
O	never
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	gun
O	.
O	For
O	several
O	days
O	we
O	were
O	almost
O	famished
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	proper
O	provisions
O	:
O	I
O	had
O	nothing
O	but
O	a
O	few
O	stalks
O	of
O	Indian
O	corn
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	glad
O	to
O	eat
O	dry
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Indians
O	themselves
O	did
O	not
O	fare
O	much
O	better
O	.
O	When
O	we
O	again
O	reached
O	the
O	Blue
O	Hills
O	,
O	a
O	council
O	of
O	war
O	was
O	held
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	agreed
O	to
O	divide
O	into
O	companies
O	of
O	about
O	twenty
O	men
O	each
O	,
O	after
O	which
O	every
O	captain
O	marched
O	with
O	his
O	party
O	where
O	he
O	thought
O	proper
O	.
O	I
O	still
O	belonged
O	to
O	my
O	old
O	masters
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	left
O	behind
O	on
O	the
O	mountains
O	with
O	ten
O	Indians
O	,
O	to
O	stay
O	till
O	the
O	rest
O	returned
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	think
O	it
O	safe
O	to
O	carry
O	me
O	nearer
O	to
O	the
O	plantations
O	.
O	Here
O	being
O	left
O	,
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	meditate
O	on
O	my
O	escape
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	knew
O	the
O	country
O	round
O	very
O	well
O	,
O	having
O	often
O	hunted
O	there
O	.
O	The
O	third
O	day
O	after
O	the
O	great
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	Indians
O	quitted
O	us
O	,
O	my
O	keepers
O	visited
O	the
O	mountains
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	game
O	,
O	leaving
O	me
O	bound
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	way
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	free
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	returned
O	at
O	night
O	they
O	unbound
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	all
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	supper
O	together
O	,
O	feasting
O	on
O	two
O	polecats
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	killed
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	being
O	greatly
O	tired
O	with
O	their
O	day
O	'
O	s
O	excursion
O	,
O	they
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	rest
O	as
O	usual
O	.
O	Seeing
O	them
O	apparently
O	fast
O	asleep
O	,
O	I
O	tried
O	different
O	ways
O	of
O	finding
O	out
O	whether
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	pretence
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	I
O	should
O	do
O	.
O	But
O	after
O	making
O	a
O	noise
O	and
O	walking
O	about
O	,
O	sometimes
O	touching
O	them
O	with
O	my
O	feet
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	they
O	really
O	slept
O	.
O	My
O	heart
O	exulted
O	at
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	freedom
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	sank
O	again
O	when
O	I
O	thought
O	how
O	easily
O	I
O	might
O	be
O	recaptured
O	.
O	I
O	resolved
O	,
O	if
O	possible
O	,
O	to
O	get
O	one
O	of
O	their
O	guns
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	discovered
O	to
O	die
O	in
O	self-defence
O	rather
O	than
O	be
O	taken
O	;
O	and
O	I
O	tried
O	several
O	times
O	to
O	take
O	one
O	from
O	under
O	their
O	heads
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	always
O	secure
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	vain
O	;
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	have
O	done
O	so
O	without
O	rousing
O	them
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	trusting
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	Divine
O	protection
O	,
O	I
O	set
O	out
O	defenceless
O	.
O	Such
O	was
O	my
O	terror
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	at
O	first
O	I
O	halted
O	every
O	four
O	or
O	five
O	yards
O	,
O	looking
O	fearfully
O	toward
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	the
O	Indians
O	,
O	lest
O	they
O	should
O	wake
O	and
O	miss
O	me
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	about
O	two
O	hundred
O	yards
O	off
O	I
O	mended
O	my
O	pace
O	and
O	made
O	all
O	the
O	haste
O	I
O	could
O	to
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	mountains
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	I
O	was
O	struck
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	terror
O	and
O	dismay
O	,
O	hearing
O	behind
O	me
O	the
O	fearful
O	cries
O	and
O	bowlings
O	of
O	the
O	savages
O	,
O	far
O	worse
O	than
O	the
O	roaring
O	of
O	lions
O	or
O	the
O	shrieking
O	of
O	hyenas
O	;
O	and
O	I
O	knew
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	missed
O	me
O	.
O	The
O	more
O	my
O	dread
O	increased
O	,
O	the
O	faster
O	I
O	hurried
O	,
O	scarce
O	knowing
O	where
O	I
O	trod
O	,
O	sometimes
O	falling
O	and
O	bruising
O	myself
O	,
O	cutting
O	my
O	feet
O	against
O	the
O	stones
O	,
O	yet
O	,
O	faint
O	and
O	maimed
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	,
O	rushing
O	on
O	through
O	the
O	woods
O	.
O	I
O	fled
O	till
O	daybreak
O	,
O	then
O	crept
O	into
O	a
O	hollow
O	tree
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	lay
O	concealed
O	,
O	thanking
O	God
O	for
O	so
O	far
O	having
O	favored
O	my
O	escape
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	eat
O	but
O	a
O	little
O	corn
O	.
O	But
O	my
O	repose
O	did
O	not
O	last
O	long
O	,
O	for
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	hours
O	I
O	heard
O	the
O	voices
O	of
O	the
O	savages
O	near
O	the
O	tree
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	hid
O	threatening
O	me
O	with
O	what
O	they
O	would
O	do
O	if
O	they
O	caught
O	me
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	already
O	guessed
O	too
O	well
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	left
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	I
O	heard
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	stayed
O	in
O	my
O	shelter
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	that
O	day
O	without
O	any
O	fresh
O	alarms
O	.
O	At
O	night
O	I
O	ventured
O	out
O	again
O	,
O	trembling
O	at
O	every
O	bush
O	I
O	passed
O	,
O	and
O	thinking
O	each
O	twig
O	that
O	touched
O	me
O	a
O	savage
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	I
O	concealed
O	myself
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	night
O	travelled
O	forward
O	,
O	keeping
O	off
O	the
O	main
O	road
O	,
O	used
O	by
O	the
O	Indians
O	,
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	possible
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	my
O	journey
O	far
O	longer
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	painful
O	than
O	I
O	can
O	express
O	.
O	But
O	how
O	shall
O	I
O	describe
O	my
O	terror
O	when
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	fourth
O	night
O	,
O	a
O	party
O	of
O	Indians
O	lying
O	round
O	a
O	small
O	fire
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	seen
O	,
O	hearing
O	the
O	rustling
O	I
O	made
O	among
O	the
O	leaves
O	,
O	started
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	seizing
O	their
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	?
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	,
O	in
O	my
O	agony
O	of
O	fear
O	,
O	whether
O	to
O	stand
O	still
O	or
O	rush
O	on
O	.
O	I
O	expected
O	nothing
O	but
O	a
O	terrible
O	death
O	;
O	but
O	at
O	that
O	very
O	moment
O	a
O	troop
O	of
O	swine
O	made
O	toward
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	savages
O	were
O	.
O	They
O	,
O	seeing
O	the
O	hogs
O	,
O	guessed
O	that
O	their
O	alarm
O	had
O	been
O	caused
O	by
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	returned
O	merrily
O	to
O	their
O	fire
O	and
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	sleep
O	again
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	this
O	happened
O	,
O	I
O	pursued
O	my
O	way
O	more
O	cautiously
O	and
O	silently
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	a
O	cold
O	perspiration
O	of
O	terror
O	at
O	the
O	peril
O	I
O	had
O	just
O	escaped
O	.
O	Bruised
O	,
O	cut
O	,
O	and
O	shaken
O	,
O	I
O	still
O	held
O	on
O	my
O	path
O	till
O	break
O	of
O	day
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	lay
O	down
O	under
O	a
O	huge
O	log
O	,
O	and
O	slept
O	undisturbed
O	till
O	noon
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	getting
O	up
O	,
O	I
O	climbed
O	a
O	great
O	hill
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	scanning
O	the
O	country
O	round
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	,
O	to
O	my
O	unspeakable
O	joy
O	,
O	some
O	habitations
O	of
O	white
O	people
O	,
O	about
O	ten
O	miles
O	distant
O	.
O	My
O	pleasure
O	was
O	somewhat
O	damped
O	by
O	not
O	being
O	able
O	to
O	get
O	among
O	them
O	that
O	night
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	were
O	too
O	far
O	off
O	;
O	therefore
O	,
O	when
O	evening
O	fell
O	,
O	I
O	again
O	commended
O	myself
O	to
O	Heaven
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	down
O	,
O	utterly
O	exhausted
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	I
O	woke
O	,
O	I
O	made
O	toward
O	the
O	nearest
O	of
O	the
O	cleared
O	lands
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	day
O	before
O	;
O	and
O	that
O	afternoon
O	I
O	reached
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	John
O	Bull
O	,
O	an
O	old
O	acquaintance
O	.
O	I
O	knocked
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	who
O	opened
O	it
O	,
O	seeing
O	me
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	frightful
O	condition
O	,
O	flew
O	from
O	me
O	like
O	lightning
O	,
O	screaming
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	This
O	alarmed
O	the
O	whole
O	family
O	,
O	who
O	immediately
O	seized
O	their
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	was
O	soon
O	greeted
O	by
O	the
O	master
O	with
O	his
O	gun
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	I
O	made
O	myself
O	known
O	--
O	for
O	at
O	first
O	he
O	took
O	me
O	for
O	an
O	Indian
O	--
O	he
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	family
O	welcomed
O	me
O	with
O	great
O	joy
O	at
O	finding
O	me
O	alive
O	;
O	since
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	told
O	I
O	was
O	murdered
O	by
O	the
O	savages
O	some
O	months
O	ago
O	.
O	No
O	longer
O	able
O	to
O	bear
O	up
O	,
O	I
O	fainted
O	and
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	recovered
O	me
O	,
O	seeing
O	my
O	weak
O	and
O	famished
O	state
O	,
O	they
O	gave
O	me
O	some
O	food
O	,
O	but
O	let
O	me
O	at
O	first
O	partake
O	of
O	it
O	very
O	sparingly
O	.
O	Then
O	for
O	two
O	days
O	and
O	nights
O	they
O	made
O	me
O	welcome
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	their
O	utmost
O	to
O	bring
O	back
O	my
O	strength
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	kindest
O	hospitality
O	.
O	Finding
O	myself
O	once
O	more
O	able
O	to
O	ride
O	,
O	I
O	borrowed
O	a
O	horse
O	and
O	some
O	clothes
O	of
O	these
O	good
O	people
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	for
O	my
O	father-in-law
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	in
O	Chester
O	County
O	,
O	about
O	a
O	hundred
O	and
O	forty
O	miles
O	away
O	.
O	I
O	reached
O	it
O	on
O	January
O	4
O	,
O	1755
O	;
O	but
O	none
O	of
O	the
O	family
O	could
O	believe
O	their
O	eyes
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	me
O	,
O	having
O	lost
O	all
O	hope
O	on
O	hearing
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	fallen
O	a
O	prey
O	to
O	the
O	Indians
O	.
O	They
O	received
O	me
O	with
O	great
O	joy
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	I
O	asked
O	for
O	my
O	dear
O	wife
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	dead
O	two
O	months
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	fatal
O	news
O	greatly
O	lessened
O	the
O	delight
O	I
O	felt
O	at
O	my
O	deliverance
O	.
