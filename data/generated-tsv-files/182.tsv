O	When
O	they
O	were
O	married
O	,
O	Havelok
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	no
O	home
O	whereto
O	he
O	might
O	take
O	Goldborough
O	.
O	Godrich
O	had
O	such
O	hatred
O	for
O	Athelwold
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	do
O	nought
O	to
O	aid
O	them
O	;
O	and
O	Havelok
O	was
O	in
O	sore
O	straits
O	till
O	he
O	bethought
O	himself
O	of
O	Grimsby
O	.
O	Straightway
O	he
O	took
O	Goldborough
O	to
O	Grimsby
O	.
O	But
O	Grim
O	himself
O	was
O	dead
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	his
O	sons
O	welcomed
O	Havelok
O	gladly
O	.
O	``
O	Welcome
O	,
O	dear
O	lord
O	,
O	and
O	welcome
O	to
O	your
O	fair
O	lady
O	,
O	``
O	they
O	said
O	.
O	``
O	We
O	have
O	here
O	horses
O	and
O	nets
O	and
O	ships
O	,
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	,
O	and
O	much
O	else
O	that
O	Grim
O	our
O	father
O	bequeathed
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	bade
O	us
O	give
O	them
O	to
O	you
O	;
O	take
O	them
O	,
O	dear
O	lord
O	;
O	they
O	are
O	all
O	yours
O	.
O	You
O	shall
O	be
O	our
O	lord
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	will
O	be
O	your
O	servants
O	in
O	all
O	things
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	Havelok
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	Grimsby
O	.
O	But
O	on
O	the
O	night
O	of
O	his
O	coming
O	Goldborough
O	was
O	sad
O	and
O	sorrowful
O	as
O	she
O	lay
O	beside
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	sleep
O	.
O	Her
O	wakeful
O	eyes
O	fell
O	on
O	Havelok
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	aware
O	suddenly
O	of
O	a
O	wondrous
O	sight
O	.
O	A
O	bright
O	light
O	,
O	clear
O	and
O	flaming
O	,
O	issued
O	from
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	lit
O	up
O	all
O	the
O	chamber
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	may
O	this
O	mean
O	?
O	``
O	she
O	said
O	to
O	herself
O	in
O	sore
O	dread
O	.
O	``

O	?
O	``
O	She
O	looked
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	new
O	wonder
O	.
O	On
O	Havelok

O	and
O	as
O	she
O	looked
O	,
O	an
O	angel
O	'
O	s
O	voice
O	spoke
O	to
O	her
O	:
O	``

O	Soon
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	ready
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	set
O	sail
O	.
O	Their
O	voyage
O	prospered
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	landed
O	safely
O	in
O	Denmark
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	dominions
O	of
O	one
O	Ubbe

O	a
O	rich

O	a
O	friend
O	of
O	King
O	Birkabeyn
O	,
O	Havelok
O	'

O	that
O	part
O	of

O	,

O	was
O	glad

O	set
O	out
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	Ubbe
O	'
O	s
O	castle
O	in
O	good
O	hope

O	He
O	dared
O	not

O	yet

O	he
O	was
O	Birkabeyn
O	'
O	s

O	But
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	Ubbe
O	and
O	spoke
O	him
O	fair
O	and
O	courteously
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	gold
O	ring
O	,

O	comely
O	Havelok
O	was
O	,
O	gladly
O	gave
O	him
O	leave
O	,

O	thereafter
O	bade
O	him
O	to
O	a

O	so
O	well

O	But
O	as

O	demanding
O	entrance
O	.
O	At
O	that
O	news
O	Bernard
O	started
O	up
O	and
O	took
O	a
O	good
O	axe

O	to
O	the

O	.
O	``
O	What

O	from
O	crown
O	to
O	toe
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	began
O	so
O	to
O	mow
O	with
O	the
O	beam
O	that
O	the
O	robbers
O	soon
O	felt
O	how
O	hard
O	he
O	could
O	smite
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	none
O	who
O	could
O	escape
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	he
O	had
O	felled
O	twenty
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	Then
O	a
O	great
O	din
O	began
O	to
O	arise
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	thieves
O	set
O	upon
O	Havelok
O	and
O	Bernard
O	with
O	all
O	their
O	might
O	.
O	But
O	Hugh
O	and
O	his
O	brothers
O	heard
O	the
O	noise
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	running
O	with
O	many
O	other
O	men
O	;
O	and
O	before
O	long
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	thieves
O	left
O	alive
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morrow
O	tidings
O	came
O	to
O	Ubbe
O	that
O	Havelok
O	had
O	slain
O	with
O	a
O	club
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	score
O	of
O	stout
O	rogues
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	down
O	to
O	Bernard
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	what
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	pass
O	;
O	and
O	Bernard
O	,
O	sore
O	wounded
O	from
O	the
O	fight
O	,
O	showed
O	him
O	his
O	wounds
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	how
O	sixty
O	robbers
O	had
O	attacked
O	his
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	Havelok
O	had
O	slain
O	great
O	plenty
O	of
O	them
O	;
O	but
O	Havelok
O	also
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	was
O	grievously
O	wounded
O	.
O	Others
O	also
O	of
O	Bernard
O	'
O	s
O	men
O	told
O	the
O	like
O	true
O	tale
O	;
O	and
O	Ubbe
O	sent
O	for
O	Havelok
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	his
O	wounds
O	,
O	called
O	for
O	a
O	skilful
O	leech
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	Havelok
O	into
O	his
O	house
O	and
O	cared
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	night
O	that
O	Havelok
O	lay
O	in
O	Ubbe
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	,
O	Ubbe
O	slept
O	nigh
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	chamber
O	,
O	with
O	places
O	boarded
O	off
O	for
O	each
O	man
O	.
O	About
O	midnight
O	he
O	awoke
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	light
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	Havelok
O	lay
O	,
O	as
O	bright
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	day
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	may
O	this
O	be
O	?
O	``
O	he
O	thought
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	myself
O	and
O	see
O	.
O	Perchance
O	Havelok
O	secretly
O	holds
O	revel
O	with
O	his
O	friends
O	,
O	and
O	has
O	lit
O	many
O	lights
O	.
O	I
O	vow
O	he
O	shall
O	do
O	no
O	such
O	sottishness
O	in
O	my
O	castle
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	stood
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	peeped
O	in
O	between
O	the
O	boards
O	that
O	shut
O	Havelok
O	from
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	him
O	sleeping
O	fast
O	,
O	as
O	still
O	as
O	any
O	stone
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	aware
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	light
O	coming
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	from
O	Havelok
O	'
O	s
O	mouth
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	aghast
O	at
O	that
O	sight
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	secretly
O	to
O	his
O	knights
O	and
O	sergeants
O	and
O	men-at-arms
O	,
O	more
O	than
O	five
O	score
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	them
O	come
O	and
O	see
O	the
O	strange
O	light
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	light
O	continued
O	to
O	issue
O	from
O	Havelok
O	'
O	s
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	grow
O	in
O	strength
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	bright
O	as
O	two
O	hundred
O	wax-candles
O	.
O	Havelok
O	'
O	s
O	right
O	shoulder
O	was
O	towards
O	Ubbe
O	and
O	his
O	men
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	light
O	,
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	mark
O	on
O	the
O	shoulder
O	,
O	a
O	bright
O	cross
O	,
O	brighter
O	than
O	gold
O	,
O	sparkling
O	like
O	a
O	carbuncle
O	stone
O	.
O	Then
O	Ubbe
O	knew
O	that
O	Havelok
O	was
O	a
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	guessed
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	be
O	Birkaheyn
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	the
O	rightful
O	king
O	.
O	When
O	Havelok
O	awoke
O	,
O	he
O	fell
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	and
O	did
O	obeisance
O	,
O	he
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	men
O	.
O	``
O	Dear
O	lord
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	know
O	you
O	to
O	be
O	Birkabeyn
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	.
O	You
O	shall
O	be
O	King
O	of
O	Denmark
O	;
O	right
O	soon
O	shall
O	every
O	lord
O	and
O	baron
O	come
O	and
O	do
O	you
O	homage
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	was
O	Havelok
O	glad
O	and
O	blithe
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	thanks
O	to
O	God
O	for
O	His
O	goodness
O	.
O	Before
O	long
O	Ubbe
O	dubbed
O	Havelok
O	knight
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	knighted
O	all
O	the
O	barons
O	and
O	lords
O	of
O	those
O	parts
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	swore
O	fealty
O	;
O	and
O	anon
O	they
O	crowned
O	him
O	King
O	of
O	Denmark
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	themselves
O	in
O	array
O	to
O	attack
O	the
O	false
O	Earl
O	Godard
O	.
O	But
O	Godard
O	'
O	s
O	knights
O	,
O	being
O	weary
O	of
O	his
O	rule
O	,
O	had
O	all
O	gone
O	over
O	to
O	Havelok
O	;
O	and
O	Grim
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	Robert
O	,
O	sufficed
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	in
O	combat
O	.
O	Robert
O	wounded
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	right
O	arm
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	bound
O	him
O	and
O	brought
O	him
O	before
O	Havelok
O	.
O	Sorry
O	now
O	was
O	Godard
O	'
O	s
O	lot
O	;
O	all
O	his
O	greatness
O	was
O	gone
O	from
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	came
O	before
O	Havelok
O	and
O	his
O	nobles
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	gave
O	sentence
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	flayed
O	alive
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	hanged
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	end
O	in
O	great
O	misery
O	and
O	torment
O	.
O	When
O	Godrich
O	in
O	England
O	heard
O	that
O	Havelok
O	was
O	king
O	of
O	all
O	Denmark
O	,
O	and
O	purposed
O	(
O	for
O	Havelok
O	had
O	given
O	out
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	his
O	intent
O	)
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	England
O	and
O	set
O	Goldborough
O	on
O	her
O	throne
O	,
O	he
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	to
O	gather
O	a
O	great
O	host
O	to
O	meet
O	Havelok
O	when
O	he
O	should
O	come
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	spread
O	lying
O	tales
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	English
O	hate
O	and
O	fear
O	Havelok
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	burn
O	and
O	destroy
O	,
O	and
O	oppress
O	them
O	;
O	and
O	by
O	these
O	means
O	he
O	got
O	together
O	many
O	and
O	led
O	them
O	to
O	Grimsby
O	.
O	Afron
O	came
O	Havelok
O	and
O	his
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	landed
O	at
O	Grimsby
O	;
O	and
O	they
O	fought
O	a
O	great
O	battle
O	.
O	All
O	that
O	day
O	Havelok
O	'
O	s
O	men
O	fought
O	with
O	Godrich
O	'
O	s
O	men
O	;
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	they
O	fought
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	Godrich
O	came
O	face
O	to
O	face
O	with
O	Havelok
O	himself
O	.
O	``
O	Godrich
O	,
O	``
O	Havelok
O	cried
O	,
O	``
O	you
O	have
O	taken
O	Athelwold
O	'
O	s
O	kingdom
O	for
O	yourself
O	;
O	I
O	claim
O	it
O	for
O	his
O	daughter
O	Goldborough
O	.
O	Yield
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	forgive
O	you
O	,
O	for
O	you
O	are
O	a
O	doughty
O	knight
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Never
O	will
O	I
O	yield
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	Godrich
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	slay
O	you
O	here
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	gripped
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	smote
O	at
O	Havelok
O	,
O	and
O	clove
O	his
O	shield
O	in
O	twain
O	.
O	But
O	Havelok
O	drew
O	his
O	own
O	good
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	one
O	blow
O	felled
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	Yet
O	Godrich
O	started
O	up
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	dealt
O	him
O	such
O	a
O	stroke
O	on
O	the
O	shoulder
O	that
O	his
O	armour
O	was
O	broken
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	blade
O	bit
O	into
O	the
O	flesh
O	.
O	Then
O	Havelok
O	heaved
O	up
O	his
O	sword
O	in
O	turn
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	fiercely
O	,
O	and
O	shore
O	off
O	Godrich
O	'
O	s
O	hand
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	smite
O	no
O	more
O	,
O	but
O	yielded
O	as
O	best
O	he
O	might
O	.
O	They
O	seized
O	Godrich
O	and
O	fettered
O	him
O	;
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	English
O	took
O	the
O	oath
O	of
O	fealty
O	to
O	Goldborough
O	,
O	and
O	swore
O	to
O	be
O	her
O	men
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	passed
O	judgment
O	on
O	Godrich
O	,
O	and
O	sentenced
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	burnt
O	to
O	death
O	.
O	So
O	Havelok
O	and
O	Goldborough
O	came
O	again
O	into
O	their
O	kingdoms
O	;
O	and
O	Havelok
O	rewarded
O	Grim
O	'
O	s
O	sons
O	and
O	made
O	them
O	barons
O	.
O	Havelok
O	was
O	crowned
O	King
O	of
O	England
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	of
O	Denmark
O	;
O	and
O	full
O	sixty
O	winters
O	did
O	he
O	reign
O	with
O	Goldborough
O	in
O	great
O	joy

O	.
