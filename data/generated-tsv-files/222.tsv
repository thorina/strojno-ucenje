O	Sindbad
O	the
O	sailor
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	his
O	adventures
O	and
O	wanderings
O	,
O	settled
O	down
O	in
O	happiness
O	and
O	prosperity
O	in
O	Bagdad
O	.
O	Here
O	are
O	the
O	stories
O	which
O	he
O	told
O	to
O	his
O	friends
O	of
O	his
O	seven
O	marvelous
O	voyages
O	.
O	THE
O	FIRST
O	VOYAGE
O	My
O	father
O	died
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	young
O	and
O	left
O	me
O	a
O	fortune
O	.
O	Having
O	no
O	one
O	to
O	restrain
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	fell
O	into
O	bad
O	ways
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	I
O	not
O	only
O	wasted
O	my
O	time
O	,
O	but
O	injured
O	my
O	health
O	,
O	and
O	destroyed
O	my
O	property
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	recovered
O	,
O	I
O	collected
O	together
O	what
O	was
O	left
O	of
O	my
O	fortune
O	,
O	and
O	bought
O	merchandise
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	loaded
O	on
O	board
O	a
O	vessel
O	for
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	Balsora
O	.
O	During
O	the
O	voyage
O	we
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	islands
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	sold
O	or
O	exchanged
O	our
O	goods
O	.
O	We
O	were
O	one
O	day
O	becalmed
O	near
O	a
O	small
O	island
O	.
O	As
O	its
O	appearance
O	was
O	inviting
O	,
O	we
O	determined
O	to
O	dine
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	while
O	we
O	were
O	laughing
O	and
O	preparing
O	for
O	dinner
O	,
O	the
O	island
O	began
O	to
O	move
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	moment
O	the
O	people
O	in
O	the
O	ship
O	called
O	out
O	that
O	we
O	were
O	on
O	the
O	back
O	of
O	a
O	monstrous
O	whale
O	.
O	Some
O	jumped
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	others
O	swam
O	to
O	the
O	ship;
O	but
O	before
O	I
O	could
O	get
O	off
O	the
O	animal
O	dived
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	only
O	time
O	to
O	catch
O	hold
O	of
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	wood
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	brought
O	from
O	the
O	ship
O	to
O	serve
O	as
O	a
O	table
O	.
O	Upon
O	this
O	piece
O	of
O	timber
O	I
O	was
O	carried
O	away
O	by
O	the
O	current
O	.
O	The
O	others
O	reached
O	the
O	vessel
O	,
O	but
O	a
O	gale
O	sprang
O	up
O	and
O	the
O	ship
O	sailed
O	without
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	floated
O	during
O	that
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	night
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	following
O	morning
O	was
O	thrown
O	on
O	a
O	small
O	island
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	fresh
O	water
O	and
O	fruit
O	.
O	I
O	looked
O	about
O	for
O	some
O	house
O	,
O	but
O	found
O	none
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	colts
O	grazing
O	together
O	,
O	but
O	no
O	traces
O	of
O	other
O	animals
O	.
O	When
O	evening
O	approached
O	I
O	took
O	some
O	more
O	fruit
O	and
O	climbed
O	in
O	a
O	tree
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	About
O	midnight
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	trumpets
O	and
O	drums
O	seemed
O	to
O	pass
O	around
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	which
O	continued
O	until
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	again
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	uninhabited
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	small
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	no
O	other
O	land
O	was
O	in
O	sight
O	.
O	I
O	therefore
O	gave
O	myself
O	up
O	as
O	lost
O	.
O	Nor
O	were
O	my
O	fears
O	lessened
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	shore
O	abounded
O	with
O	enormous
O	serpents
O	and
O	other
O	sea
O	monsters
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	timid
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	rattling
O	of
O	sticks
O	would
O	make
O	them
O	dive
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	I
O	climbed
O	the
O	tree
O	next
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	drums
O	and
O	trumpets
O	returned
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	satisfaction
O	of
O	seeing
O	a
O	body
O	of
O	men
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	on
O	landing
O	,
O	were
O	astonished
O	to
O	see
O	me
O	there
O	.
O	Having
O	related
O	to
O	them
O	how
O	I
O	came
O	hither
O	,
O	they
O	told
O	me
O	they
O	were
O	grooms
O	of
O	King
O	Mihrage;
O	that
O	the
O	island
O	belonged
O	to
O	genii
O	,
O	who
O	visited
O	it
O	every
O	night
O	with
O	drums
O	and
O	trumpets;
O	that
O	the
O	genii
O	had
O	allowed
O	their
O	sovereign
O	to
O	train
O	his
O	colts
O	upon
O	the
O	island;
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	,
O	being
O	sent
O	every
O	six
O	months
O	to
O	select
O	some
O	,
O	had
O	arrived
O	for
O	that
O	purpose
O	.
O	The
O	grooms
O	carried
O	me
O	to
O	King
O	Mihrage
O	,
O	who
O	allowed
O	me
O	apartments
O	in
O	his
O	palace
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	I
O	saw
O	men
O	unloading
O	a
O	ship
O	in
O	the
O	harbor
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	bales
O	were
O	those
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	sent
O	to
O	Balsora
O	.
O	Going
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	I
O	said
O	:
O	""""
O	Captain
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	Sindbad
O	.
O	""""
O	""""
O	Surely
O	,
O	""""
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	""""
O	I
O	and
O	the
O	passengers
O	saw
O	Sindbad
O	swallowed
O	in
O	the
O	waves
O	many
O	hundred
O	miles
O	away
O	.
O	""""
O	Some
O	others
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	coming
O	up
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	recognized;
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	then
O	restored
O	me
O	the
O	bales
O	,
O	with
O	many
O	congratulations
O	.
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	valuable
O	present
O	to
O	King
O	Mihrage
O	,
O	who
O	bestowed
O	a
O	rich
O	gift
O	on
O	me
O	in
O	return;
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	made
O	some
O	advantageous
O	purchases
O	,
O	I
O	arrived
O	at
O	Balsora
O	,
O	where
O	,
O	after
O	I
O	had
O	sold
O	my
O	goods
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	possessed
O	of
O	a
O	hundred
O	thousand
O	sequins
O	.
