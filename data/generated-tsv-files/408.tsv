O	The
O	Sheriff
O	of
O	Nottingham
O	was
O	wroth
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	that
O	Robin
O	Hood
O	and
O	his
O	band
O	of
O	outlaws
O	had
O	taken
O	refuge
O	in
O	the
O	knight
O	'

O	castle
O	.
O	All
O	the

O	was
O	up
O	in
O	rout
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	came
O	and
O	besieged
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	From
O	his
O	post
O	outside
O	the
O	walls
O	the
O	sheriff
O	loudly
O	proclaimed
O	that
O	the
O	knight
O	was
O	a
O	traitor
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	shielding
O	the
O	king

O	answer

O	``
O	The
O	sheriff
O	,
O	having
O	had
O	his
O	answer
O	,
O	curt
O	and
O	to
O	the
O	point
O	,
O	rode
O	forth
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	London
O	to
O	carry
O	the
O	tale
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	him
O	of
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	Robin
O	Hood
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	band
O	of
O	bold
O	archers
O	which
O	the
O	latter
O	kept
O	up
O	.
O	``
O	The

O	.
O	``

O	``
O	So
O	the
O	sheriff
O	took
O	his
O	leave
O	,

O	went
O	home
O	to
O	Nottingham
O	to
O	do
O	as
O	the

O	commanded
O	.
O	Robin

O	castle
O	,

O	had
O	gone
O	back

O	Little

O	in
O	his
O	knee
O	,
O	went
O	and
O	joined
O	him
O	there
O	.
O	It
O	caused
O	great
O	vexation
O	to
O	the
O	sheriff
O	to
O	know
O	that
O	Robin

O	all
O	the
O	more
O	he
O	was
O	resolved

O	be
O	revenged
O	on
O	Sir

O	Lee
O	.
O	Night
O	and
O	day
O	he
O	kept
O	watch
O	for
O	that

O	;
O	at

O	,
O	one
O	morning
O	when

O	,
O	the

O	When

O	no

O	Mounting
O	a
