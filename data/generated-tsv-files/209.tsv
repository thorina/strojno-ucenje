O	Aladdin
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	son
O	of
O	a
O	poor
O	widow
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	China;
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	helping
O	his
O	mother
O	to
O	earn
O	their
O	living
O	,
O	he
O	let

O	do
O	all
O	the

O	work
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	himself
O	only
O	thought
O	of
O	idling
O	and
O	amusement
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	playing
O	in
O	the
O	streets
O	,
O	a
O	stranger
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	claiming
O	him
O	as
O	his
O	long-lost
O	nephew
O	.
O	Aladdin
O	had
O	never
O	heard
O	that
O	his
O	father
O	had
O	had
O	a
O	brother;
O	but
O	as
O	the
O	stranger
O	gave
O	him
O	money
O	and
O	promised
O	to
O	buy
O	him
O	fine
O	clothes
O	and
O	set
O	him
O	up
O	in
O	business
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	ready
O	to
O	believe
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	told
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	man
O	was
O	a
O	magician
O	,
O	who
O	wanted
O	to
O	use
O	Aladdin
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	purposes
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	the
O	stranger
O	came
O	again
O	,
O	brought
O	Aladdin
O	a
O	beautiful
O	suit
O	of
O	clothes
O	,
O	gave
O	him
O	many
O	good
O	things
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	walk
O	,
O	telling
O	him
O	stories
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	to
O	amuse
O	him
O	.
O	After
O	they
O	had
O	walked
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	,

O	came
O	to
O	a
O	narrow
O	valley
O	,
O	bounded
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	by
O	tall
O	,
O	gloomy-looking
O	mountains
O	.
O	Aladdin
O	was
O	beginning
O	to

O	tired
O	,
O	and

O	did
O	not

O	He

O	the

O	reached
O	the

O	where
O	he
O	intended
O	to
O	carry
O	out
O	his
O	evil
O	design
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	made
O	Aladdin
