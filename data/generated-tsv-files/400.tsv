O	Few
O	boys
O	have
O	ever
O	led
O	a
O	happier
O	,
O	busier
O	,
O	or
O	more
O	varied
O	existence
O	than
O	did
O	Humphry
O	Davy
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	a
O	poor
O	wood-carver
O	,
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	pretty
O	seaside
O	town
O	of
O	Penzance
O	,
O	in
O	England
O	,
O	where
O	Humphry
O	was
O	born
O	in
O	1778
O	.
O	Lowly
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	as
O	was
O	his
O	birth
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	earliest
O	years
O	Humphry
O	gave
O	many
O	proofs
O	that
O	nature
O	had
O	endowed
O	him
O	with
O	rare
O	talents
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	stories
O	told
O	of
O	his
O	childish
O	brightness
O	are
O	hard
O	to
O	believe
O	.
O	They
O	relate
O	,
O	for
O	instance
O	,
O	that
O	before
O	he
O	was
O	two
O	years
O	old
O	he
O	could
O	talk
O	almost
O	as
O	plainly
O	and
O	clearly
O	as
O	a
O	grown
O	person
O	;
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	repeat
O	many
O	passages
O	of
O	``
O	Pilgrim
O	'
O	s
O	Progress
O	,
O	``
O	from
O	having
O	heard
O	them
O	,
O	before
O	he
O	could
O	read
O	;
O	and
O	that
O	at
O	five
O	years
O	old
O	he
O	could
O	read
O	very
O	rapidly
O	,
O	and
O	remembered
O	almost
O	everything
O	he
O	read
O	.
O	His
O	father
O	,
O	the
O	wood-carver
O	,
O	had
O	died
O	while
O	Humphry
O	was
O	still
O	very
O	young
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	left
O	his
O	family
O	poor
O	.
O	But
O	by
O	good-fortune
O	a
O	kind
O	neighbor
O	and
O	friend
O	,
O	a
O	Mr
O	.
O	Tonkine
O	,
O	took
O	care
O	of
O	the
O	widow
O	and
O	her
O	children
O	,
O	and
O	obtained
O	a
O	place
O	for
O	Humphry
O	as
O	an
O	apprentice
O	with
O	an
O	apothecary
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	Humphry
O	proved
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	a
O	rather
O	troublesome
O	inmate
O	of
O	the
O	apothecary
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	.
O	He
O	set
O	up
O	a
O	chemical
O	laboratory
O	in
O	his
O	little
O	room
O	upstairs
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	devoted
O	himself
O	to
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	experiments
O	.
O	Every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	an
O	explosion
O	would
O	be
O	heard
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	the
O	members
O	of
O	the
O	apothecary
O	'
O	s
O	household
O	quake
O	with
O	terror
O	.
O	Humphry
O	began
O	to
O	dream
O	ambitious
O	dreams
O	.
O	Not
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	drudgery
O	of
O	an
O	apothecary
O	store
O	.
O	He
O	felt
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	in
O	himself
O	the
O	making
O	of
O	a
O	famous
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	resolved
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	leave
O	no
O	science
O	unexplored
O	.
O	He
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	with
O	a
O	will
O	.
O	His
O	quick
O	mind
O	soon
O	grasped
O	the
O	sciences
O	not
O	only
O	of
O	mathematics
O	and
O	chemistry
O	,
O	but
O	of
O	botany
O	,
O	anatomy
O	,
O	geology
O	,
O	and
O	metaphysics
O	.
O	His
O	means
O	for
O	the
O	experiments
O	he
O	desired
O	to
O	make
O	were
O	very
O	limited
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	allow
O	any
O	obstacle
O	to
O	prevent
O	him
O	from
O	pursuing
O	them
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	especially
O	fond
O	of
O	wandering
O	along
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	and
O	observing
O	and
O	examining
O	the
O	many
O	curious
O	and
O	mysterious
O	objects
O	which
O	he
O	found
O	on
O	the
O	crags
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	sand
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	his
O	eye
O	was
O	struck
O	with
O	the
O	bladders
O	of
O	seaweed
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	found
O	full
O	of
O	air
O	.
O	The
O	question
O	was
O	,
O	how
O	did
O	the
O	air
O	get
O	into
O	them
O	?
O	This
O	puzzled
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	no
O	answer
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	instruments
O	to
O	experiment
O	with
O	.
O	But
O	on
O	another
O	day
O	,
O	soon
O	after
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	strolled
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	what
O	was
O	his
O	surprise
O	and
O	delight
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	case
O	of
O	surgical
O	instruments
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	flung
O	up
O	from
O	some
O	wreck
O	on
O	the
O	coast
O	!
O	Armed
O	with
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	hastened
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	managed
O	to
O	turn
O	each
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	instruments
O	to
O	some
O	useful
O	account
O	.
O	He
O	constructed
O	an
O	air-pump
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	surgeon
O	'
O	s
O	syringe
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	experiments
O	with
O	it
O	.
O	Fortunately
O	for
O	Humphry
O	,
O	he
O	formed
O	a
O	friendship
O	with
O	a
O	youth
O	who
O	could
O	not
O	only
O	sympathize
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	use
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	Gregory
O	Watt
O	,
O	a
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	James
O	Watt
O	,
O	the
O	inventor
O	of
O	the
O	steam-engine
O	.
O	Gregory
O	Watt
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	Penzance
O	for
O	his
O	health
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	there
O	fallen
O	in
O	with
O	the
O	ambitious
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	wood-carver
O	.
O	This
O	new
O	friend
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	give
O	Humphry
O	many
O	new
O	and
O	valuable
O	hints
O	and
O	encouraged
O	him
O	with
O	hopeful
O	words
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	with
O	his
O	studies
O	and
O	experiments
O	.
O	Already
O	Humphry
O	was
O	getting
O	to
O	be
O	known
O	as
O	a
O	scientific
O	genius
O	beyond
O	the
O	quiet
O	neighborhood
O	of
O	Penzance
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	proposed
O	a
O	theory
O	on
O	heat
O	and
O	light
O	which
O	had
O	attracted
O	the
O	attention
O	of
O	learned
O	men
O	;
O	and
O	at
O	twenty-one
O	he
O	had
O	discovered
O	the
O	peculiar
O	properties
O	of
O	nitrous
O	oxide
O	--
O	what
O	we
O	now
O	call
O	``
O	laughing-gas
O	``
O	--
O	though
O	he
O	nearly
O	killed
O	himself
O	by
O	inhaling
O	too
O	much
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	also
O	made
O	many
O	experiments
O	in
O	galvanism
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	found
O	silicious
O	earth
O	in
O	the
O	skin
O	of
O	reeds
O	and
O	grass
O	.
O	So
O	famous
O	indeed
O	had
O	he
O	already
O	become
O	,
O	that
O	at
O	the
O	age
O	of
O	twenty-two
O	--
O	when
O	most
O	young
O	men
O	are
O	only
O	just
O	leaving
O	college
O	--
O	he
O	was
O	chosen
O	lecturer
O	on
O	science
O	at
O	the
O	great
O	Royal
O	Institution
O	in
O	London
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	amazed
O	men
O	by
O	the
O	eloquence
O	and
O	clearness
O	with
O	which
O	he
O	revealed
O	the
O	mysteries
O	of
O	science
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	bright
O	and
O	attractive
O	a
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	moreover
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	best
O	London
O	society
O	gladly
O	welcomed
O	him
O	to
O	its
O	drawing-rooms
O	,
O	and
O	praises
O	of
O	him
O	were
O	in
O	every
O	mouth
O	.
O	His
O	lecture-room
O	was
O	crowded
O	whenever
O	he
O	spoke
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	bit
O	spoiled
O	by
O	all
O	this
O	flattery
O	and
O	homage
O	.
O	He
O	worked
O	all
O	the
O	harder
O	;
O	resolved
O	to
O	achieve
O	yet
O	greater
O	triumphs
O	in
O	science
O	than
O	he
O	had
O	yet
O	done
O	.
O	An
O	opportunity
O	soon
O	arose
O	to
O	turn
O	his
O	knowledge
O	and
O	inventive
O	powers
O	to
O	account
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	important
O	way
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	the
O	English
O	public
O	had
O	every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	been
O	horrified
O	by
O	the
O	terrible
O	explosions
O	which
O	took
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	coal
O	mines
O	.
O	These
O	explosions
O	resulted
O	often
O	in
O	an
O	appalling
O	loss
O	of
O	human
O	life
O	.
O	Their
O	cause
O	was
O	the
O	filling
O	of
O	the
O	mine
O	by
O	a
O	deadly
O	gas
O	,
O	called
O	``
O	fire-damp
O	,
O	``
O	which
O	,
O	when
O	ignited
O	by
O	a
O	lighted
O	candle
O	or
O	lamp
O	,
O	exploded
O	with
O	fearful
O	violence
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	an
O	explosion
O	of
O	fire-damp
O	occurred
O	which
O	killed
O	over
O	one
O	hundred
O	miners
O	on
O	the
O	spot
O	.
O	This
O	event
O	called
O	universal
O	attention
O	to
O	the
O	subject
O	,
O	and
O	Humphry
O	Davy
O	was
O	besought
O	to
O	try
O	and
O	find
O	some
O	means
O	of
O	preventing
O	,
O	or
O	at
O	least
O	lessening
O	,
O	similar
O	calamities
O	.
O	He
O	promptly
O	undertook
O	the
O	task
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	about
O	it
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	wonted
O	energy
O	.
O	The
O	problem
O	before
O	him
O	was
O	how
O	to
O	provide
O	light
O	in
O	the
O	mines
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	way
O	that
O	the
O	miners
O	might
O	see
O	to
O	work
O	by
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	be
O	safe
O	from
O	the
O	danger
O	of
O	fire-damp
O	explosion
O	.
O	Many
O	attempts
O	had
O	been
O	made
O	to
O	achieve
O	this
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	had
O	all
O	failed
O	,
O	Davy
O	began
O	his
O	experiments
O	.
O	He
O	soon
O	made
O	several
O	valuable
O	discoveries
O	.
O	One
O	was
O	that
O	explosions
O	of
O	inflammable
O	gases
O	could
O	not
O	pass
O	through
O	long
O	narrow
O	metallic
O	tubes
O	.
O	Another
O	was
O	that
O	when
O	he
O	held
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	wire
O	gauze
O	over
O	a
O	lighted
O	candle
O	,
O	the
O	flame
O	would
O	not
O	pass
O	through
O	it
O	.
O	As
O	a
O	result
O	of
O	his
O	long
O	and
O	patient
O	toil
O	Davy
O	was
O	able
O	at
O	last
O	to
O	construct
O	his
O	now
O	famous
O	_Safety-Lamp_
O	,
O	which
O	has
O	undoubtedly
O	saved
O	the
O	lives
O	of
O	thousands
O	during
O	the
O	period
O	which
O	has
O	elapsed
O	since
O	it
O	was
O	invented
O	.
O	He
O	presented
O	a
O	model
O	of
O	his
O	new
O	lamp
O	to
O	the
O	Royal
O	Society
O	,
O	in
O	whose
O	rooms
O	in
O	London
O	it
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	to
O	this
O	day
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	a
O	simple
O	affair
O	,
O	being
O	merely
O	a
O	lamp
O	screwed
O	on
O	to
O	a
O	wire
O	gauze
O	cylinder
O	,
O	and
O	fitted
O	to
O	it
O	by
O	a
O	tight
O	ring
O	.
O	His
O	idea
O	was
O	to
O	admit
O	the
O	fire-damp
O	into
O	the
O	lamp
O	gradually
O	by
O	narrow
O	tubes
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	consumed
O	by
O	combustion
O	.
O	The
O	Safety-Lamp
O	was
O	in
O	truth
O	the
O	greatest
O	triumph
O	of
O	Humphry
O	Davy
O	'
O	s
O	useful
O	life
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	value

O	said
O	,

O	``
O	Honors
O	of
O	all
O	kinds
O	were
O	showered
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	Many
O	medals
O	were
O	awarded
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	grateful
O	miners
O	subscribed
O	from
O	their
O	scant
O	wages
O	enough
O	to
O	present
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	magnificent
O	service
O	of
O	silver
O	worth
O	$
O	12
O	,

O	.
O	His
O	discovery
O	was
O	hailed
O	from
O	every
O	part
O	of
O	Europe
O	.
O	The
O	Czar
O	Alexander
O	of
O	Russia
O	sent
O	him
O	a
O	beautiful
O	vase
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	chosen
O	a
O	member
O	of
O	the
O	historic
O	Institute
O	of
O	France
O	;
O	while
O	his
O	own
O	government
O	conferred
O	upon
O	him
O	the
O	coveted
O	title
O	of
O	baronet
O	.
O	Sir
O	Humphry
O	Davy
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	now
O	called
O	,
O	died
O	in
O	the
O	prime
O	of
O	life
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	fulness
O	of
O	honor
O	and
O	fame
O	.
O	Fond
O	of
O	travel
O	,
O	and
O	continuing
O	to
O	the
O	last
O	his
O	scientific
O	studies
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	continent
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	up
O	his
O	abode
O	at
O	Geneva
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	borders
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	loveliest
O	of
O	Swiss
O	lakes
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	laboratory
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	could
O	work
O	at
O	will
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	also
O	indulge
O	his
O	passion
O	for
O	fishing
O	and
O	hunting
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	was
O	worn
O	out
O	before
O	his
O	time
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	attacked
O	by
O	palsy
O	,
O	and
O	passed
O	away
O	at
O	Geneva
O	in
O	1829
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	fifty-first
O	year
O	of
O	his
O	age
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	was
O	buried
O	.
O	A
O	simple
O	monument
O	reveals
O	where
O	he
O	lies
O	in
O	the
O	foreign
O	churchyard
O	;
O	while
O	a
O	tablet
O	in
O	Westminster
O	Abbey
O	keeps
O	alive
O	his
O	memory
O	in
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	his
O	countrymen
O	.
