O	long
O	time
O	ago

O	the

O	was
O	very
O	young
O	.
O	Trees

O	flowers
O	were
O	growing
O	everywhere
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	were
O	no

O	One
O	morning
O	the
O	Great

O	drew
O	back

O	from
O	the

O	smiled

O	Then
O	the

O	and
O	the

O	were
O	full
O	of
O	birds

O	All

O	their

O	long

O	did
O	not
O	please
O	him
O	.
O	Before
O	the
O	sun
O	had
O	set
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	feathered

O	,
O	of
O	every
O	size
O	and
O	color
O	,
O	to
O	cover

O	That

O	,
O	as
O	the
O	birds
O	hid
O	their
O	heads
O	under
O	their
O	wings
O	,
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	spoke

O	for

O	A
O	council
O	was
O	called
O	next
O	day
O	by
O	the
O	birds

O	They

O	to

O	could
O	fly
O	over
O	a
O	long
O	trail
O	and
O	not
O	be
O	tired
O	.
O	The
O	birds
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	go
O	,
O	he
O	might
O	have
O	the
O	first
O	choice
O	of
O	the
O	suits
O	of
O	feathers
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	must
O	try
O	on
O	no
O	suit
O	more
O	than
O	once
O	.
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	promised
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	toward
O	the
O	setting
O	sun
O	.
O	Twice
O	the
O	sun
O	set
O	,

O	three
O	times
O	it
O	rose
O	,
O	before

O	he
O	would

O	remembered

O	he
O	could
O	try
O	on
O	each
O	suit
O	of
O	feathers
O	once
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	put
O	them
O	on
O	.
O	The
O	feathers
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	suit
O	were
O	too
O	long
O	.
O	They
O	trailed
O	on

O	walked
O	.
O	Neither
O	could
O	he
O	fly

O	Turkey

O	There

O	not
O	enough
O	feathers
O	in
O	the

O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	shivered
O	with

O	enough

O	He
O	would

O	Turkey

O	did
O	not

O	So
O	he
O	went
O	from
O	one
O	suit
O	to
O	another
O	,
O	trying
O	on
O	and
O	taking
O	off
O	.
O	Always
O	he
O	had
O	some
O	new
O	fault
O	to

O	Something
O	was
O	wrong
O	with
O	each
O	one
O	.
O	Nothing
O	quite

O	No
O	suit

O	At

O	there
O	was
O	but
O	one
O	suit
O	left
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	pretty
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	plain
O	,
O	dull
O	color
O	,
O	--and
O	very
O	short
O	of
O	feathers
O	at
O	the
O	neck
O	and
O	head
O	.
O	Turkey

O	It

O	well
O	:
O	it

O	cut
O	too
O	low

O	the
O	neck

O	Turkey
O	Buzzard

O	it
O	was
O	the
O	last
O	suit
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	kept
O	it
O	on
O	.
O	Then
O	_Gah
