O	One
O	afternoon
O	of
O	a
O	cold
O	winter
O	'
O	s
O	day
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	sun
O	shone
O	forth
O	with
O	chilly
O	brightness
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	long
O	storm
O	,
O	two
O	children
O	asked
O	leave
O	of
O	their
O	mother
O	to
O	run
O	out
O	and
O	play
O	in
O	the
O	new-fallen
O	snow
O	.
O	The
O	elder
O	child
O	was
O	a
O	girl
O	,
O	whom
O	,
O	because
O	she
O	was
O	of
O	a
O	tender
O	and
O	modest
O	disposition
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	thought
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	beautiful
O	,
O	her
O	parents
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	people
O	who
O	were
O	familiar
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	used
O	to
O	call
O	Violet
O	.
O	But
O	her
O	brother
O	was
O	known
O	by
O	the
O	style
O	and
O	title
O	of
O	Peony
O	,
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	ruddiness
O	of
O	his
O	broad
O	and
O	round
O	little
O	phiz
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	everybody
O	think
O	of
O	sunshine
O	and
O	great
O	scarlet
O	flowers
O	.
O	The
O	father
O	of
O	these
O	two
O	children
O	,
O	a
O	certain
O	Mr
O	.
O	Lindsey
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	important
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	was
O	an
O	excellent
O	but
O	exceedingly
O	matter-of-fact
O	sort
O	of
O	man
O	,
O	a
O	dealer
O	in
O	hardware
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	sturdily
O	accustomed
O	to
O	take
O	what
O	is
O	called
O	the
O	common-sense
O	view
O	of
O	all
O	matters
O	that
O	came
O	under
O	his
O	consideration
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	heart
O	about
O	as
O	tender
O	as
O	other
O	people
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	head
O	as
O	hard
O	and
O	impenetrable
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	as
O	empty
O	,
O	as
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	iron
O	pots
O	which
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	his
O	business
O	to
O	sell
O	.
O	The
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	character
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	hand
O	,
O	had
O	a
O	strain
O	of
O	poetry
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	a
O	trait
O	of
O	unworldly
O	beauty
O	--
O	a
O	delicate
O	and
O	dewy
O	flower
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	,
O	that
O	had
O	survived
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	imaginative
O	youth
O	,
O	and
O	still
O	kept
O	itself
O	alive
O	amid
O	the
O	dusty
O	realities
O	of
O	matrimony
O	and
O	motherhood
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	Violet
O	and
O	Peony
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	began
O	with
O	saying
O	,
O	besought
O	their
O	mother
O	to
O	let
O	them
O	run
O	out
O	and
O	play
O	in
O	the
O	new
O	snow
O	;
O	for
O	,
O	though
O	it
O	had
O	looked
O	so
O	dreary
O	and
O	dismal
O	,
O	drifting
O	downward
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	gray
O	sky
O	,
O	it
O	had
O	a
O	very
O	cheerful
O	aspect
O	,
O	now
O	that
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	shining
O	on
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	children
O	dwelt
O	in
O	a
O	city
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	no
O	wider
O	play-place
O	than
O	a
O	little
O	garden
O	before
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	divided
O	by
O	a
O	white
O	fence
O	from
O	the
O	street
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	pear-tree
O	and
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	plum-trees
O	overshadowing
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	rose-bushes
O	just
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	parlour-windows
O	.
O	The
O	trees
O	and
O	shrubs
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	were
O	now
O	leafless
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	twigs
O	were
O	enveloped
O	in
O	the
O	light
O	snow
O	,
O	which
O	thus
O	made
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	wintry
O	foliage
O	,
O	with
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	a
O	pendent
O	icicle
O	for
O	the
O	fruit
O	.
O	``
O	Yes
O	,
O	Violet
O	--
O	yes
O	,
O	my
O	little
O	Peony
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	their
O	kind
O	mother
O	;
O	``
O	you
O	may
O	go
O	out
O	and
O	play
O	in
O	the
O	new
O	snow
O	.
O	``
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	the
O	good
O	lady
O	bundled
O	up
O	her
O	darlings
O	in
O	woollen
O	jackets
O	and
O	wadded
O	sacks
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	comforters
O	round
O	their
O	necks
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	striped
O	gaiters
O	on
O	each
O	little
O	pair
O	of
O	legs
O	,
O	and
O	worsted
O	mittens
O	on
O	their
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	them
O	a
O	kiss
O	apiece
O	,
O	by
O	way
O	of
O	a
O	spell
O	to
O	keep
O	away
O	Jack
O	Frost
O	.
O	Forth
O	sallied
O	the
O	two
O	children
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	hop-skip-and-jump
O	,
O	that
O	carried
O	them
O	at
O	once
O	into
O	the
O	very
O	heart
O	of
O	a
O	huge
O	snow-drift
O	,
O	whence
O	Violet
O	emerged
O	like
O	a
O	snow-bunting
O	,
O	while
O	little
O	Peony
O	floundered
O	out
O	with
O	his
O	round
O	face
O	in
O	full
O	bloom
O	.
O	Then
O	what
O	a
O	merry
O	time
O	had
O	they
O	!
O	To
O	look
O	at
O	them
O	,
O	frolicking
O	in
O	the
O	wintry
O	garden
O	,
O	you
O	would
O	have
O	thought
O	that
O	the
O	dark
O	and
O	pitiless
O	storm
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	for
O	no
O	other
O	purpose
O	but
O	to
O	provide
O	a
O	new
O	plaything
O	for
O	Violet
O	and
O	Peony
O	;
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	themselves
O	had
O	been
O	created
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	snow-birds
O	were
O	,
O	to
O	take
O	delight
O	only
O	in
O	the
O	tempest
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	white
O	mantle
O	which
O	it
O	spread
O	over
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	frosted
O	one
O	another
O	all
O	over
O	with
O	handfuls
O	of
O	snow
O	,
O	Violet
O	,
O	after
O	laughing
O	heartily
O	at
O	little
O	Peony
O	'
O	s
O	figure
O	,
O	was
O	struck
O	with
O	a
O	new
O	idea
O	.
O	``
O	You
O	look
O	exactly
O	like
O	a
O	snow-image
O	,
O	Peony
O	,

O	said
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	if

O	And
O	that
O	puts
O	me
O	in
O	mind
O	!
O	Let
O	us
O	make
O	an
O	image
O	out
O	of

O	--
O	an
O	image
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	girl
O	--
O	and
O	it
O	shall
O	be
O	our
O	sister
O	,
O	and
O	shall
O	run
O	about
O	and
O	play
O	with
O	us
O	all
O	winter
O	long
O	.
O	Won
O	'
O	t
O	it

O	?
O	``
O	``
O	O
O	,
O	yes
O	!
O	``
O	cried
O	Peony
O	,

O	plainly
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	speak

O	a
O	little

O	``
O	``
O	Yes

O	answered
O	Violet
O	;
O	``

O	;

O	our
O	little
O	snow-sister
O	will
O	not

O	the
O	warmth
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	forthwith
O	the
O	children
O	began
O	this
O	great
O	business
O	of
O	making
O	a
O	snow-image
O	that
O	should
O	run
O	about
O	;
O	while
O	their
O	mother
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	sitting
O	at
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	overheard
O	some
O	of
O	their
O	talk
O	,
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	smiling
O	at
O	the
O	gravity
O	with
O	which
O	they
O	set
O	about
O	it
O	.
O	They
O	really
O	seemed
O	to
O	imagine
O	that
O	there
O	would
O	be
O	no
O	difficulty
O	whatever
O	in
O	creating
O	a
O	live
O	little
O	girl
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	snow
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	to
O	say
O	the
O	truth
O	,
O	if
O	miracles
O	are
O	ever
O	to
O	be
O	wrought
O	,
O	it
O	will
O	be
O	by
O	putting
O	our
O	hands
O	to
O	the
O	work
O	in
O	precisely
O	such
O	a
O	simple
O	and
O	undoubting
O	frame
O	of
O	mind
O	as
O	that
O	in
O	which
O	Violet
O	and
O	Peony
O	now
O	undertook
O	to
O	perform
O	one
O	,
O	without
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	knowing
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	miracle
O	.
O	So
O	thought
O	the
O	mother
O	;
O	and
O	thought
O	,
O	likewise
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	new
O	snow
O	,
O	just
O	fallen
O	from
O	heaven
O	,
O	would
O	be
O	excellent
O	material
O	to
O	make
O	new
O	beings
O	of
O	,
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	not
O	so
O	very
O	cold
O	.
O	She
O	gazed
O	at
O	the
O	children
O	a
O	moment
O	longer
O	,
O	delighting
O	to
O	watch
O	their
O	little
O	figures
O	--
O	the
O	girl
O	,
O	tall
O	for
O	her
O	age
O	,
O	graceful
O	and
O	agile
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	delicately
O	coloured
O	that
O	she
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	cheerful
O	thought
O	,
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	physical
O	reality
O	;
O	while
O	Peony
O	expanded
O	in
O	breadth
O	rather
O	than
O	height
O	,
O	and
O	rolled
O	along
O	on
O	his
O	short
O	and
O	sturdy
O	legs
O	as
O	substantial
O	as
O	an
O	elephant
O	,
O	though
O	not
O	quite
O	so
O	big
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	mother
O	resumed
O	her
O	work
O	.
O	What
O	it
O	was
O	I
O	forget
O	;
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	either
O	trimming
O	a
O	silken
O	bonnet
O	for
O	Violet
O	,
O	or
O	darning
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	stockings
O	for
O	little
O	Peony
O	'
O	s
O	short
O	legs
O	.
O	Again
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	other
O	agains
O	,
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	turning
O	her
O	head
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	the
O	children
O	got
O	on
O	with
O	their
O	snow-image
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	an
O	exceedingly
O	pleasant
O	sight
O	,
O	those
O	bright
O	little
O	souls
O	at
O	their
O	task
O	!
O	Moreover
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	really
O	wonderful
O	to
O	observe
O	how
O	knowingly
O	and
O	skilfully
O	they
O	managed
O	the
O	matter
O	.
O	Violet
O	assumed
O	the
O	chief
O	direction
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	Peony
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	while
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	own
O	delicate
O	fingers
O	,
O	she
O	shaped
O	out
O	all
O	the
O	nicer
O	parts
O	of
O	the
O	snow-figure
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	not
O	so
O	much
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	by
O	the
O	children
O	,
O	as
O	to
O	grow
O	up
O	under
O	their
O	hands
O	,
O	while
O	they
O	were
O	playing
O	and
O	prattling
O	about
O	it
O	.
O	Their
O	mother
O	was
O	quite
O	surprised
O	at
O	this
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	longer
O	she
O	looked
O	,
O	the
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	surprised
O	she
O	grew
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	remarkable
O	children
O	mine
O	are
O	!
O	``
O	thought
O	she
O	,
O	smiling
O	with
O	a
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	pride
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	smiling
O	at
O	herself
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	for
O	being
O	so
O	proud
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	other
O	children
O	could
O	have
O	made
O	anything
O	so
O	like
O	a
O	little
O	girl
O	'
O	s
O	figure
O	out
O	of
O	snow
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	trial
O	?
O	Well
O	;
O	but
O	now
O	I
O	must
O	finish
O	Peony

O	s
O	new
O	frock
O	,
O	for

O	took

O	,
O	sweeping
O	through
O	the

O	It
O	sounded
O	so
O	wintry
O	cold
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	mother

O	about

O	a

O	The

O	was
O	now
O	gone
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	leaving
O	,
O	however

O	a

O	among

O	clouds
O	which

O	Why
O	,
O	if
O	you
O	will

O	there
O	was
O	a
O	small
O	figure

O	a
O	girl
O	,
O	dressed
O	all
O	in
O	white
O	,
O	with
O	rose-tinged
O	cheeks
O	and
O	ringlets
O	of
O	golden
O	hue
O	,
O	playing
O	about

O	with
O	the
O	two
O	children
O	!
O	A
O	stranger
O	though
O	she
O	was
O	,
O	the
O	child
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	on
O	as
O	familiar
O	terms
O	with
O	Violet
O	and
O	Peony
O	,

O	,
O	as
O	if
O	all
O	the
O	three
O	had
O	been
O	playmates
O	during
O	the
O	whole
O	of
O	their
O	little
O	lives
O	.
O	The
O	mother
O	thought
O	to
O	herself
O	that
O	it
O	must
O	certainly
O	be
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	neighbours

O	that
O	,

O	Violet
O	,
O	and
O	Peony
O	in
O	the
O	garden
O	,
O	the
O	child
O	had
O	run
O	across
O	the
O	street
O	to
O	play
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	So
O	this
O	kind
O	lady
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	intending
O	to
O	invite
O	the
O	little
O	runaway
O	into
O	her
O	comfortable
O	parlour
O	;
O	for
O	,
O	now
O	that
O	the
O	sunshine
O	was
O	withdrawn
O	,
O	the
O	atmosphere
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	doors
O	,
O	was
O	already
O	growing
O	very
O	cold
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	after
O	opening
O	the
O	house-door
O	,
O	she
O	stood
O	an
O	instant
O	on
O	the
O	threshold
O	,
O	hesitating
O	whether
O	she
O	ought
O	to
O	ask
O	the
O	child
O	to
O	come
O	in
O	,
O	or
O	whether
O	she
O	should
O	even
O	speak
O	to
O	her
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	she
O	almost
O	doubted
O	whether
O	it
O	were
O	a
O	real
O	child
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	,
O	or
O	only
O	a
O	light
O	wreath
O	of
O	the
O	new-fallen
O	snow
O	,
O	blown
O	hither
O	and
O	thither
O	about
O	the
O	garden
O	by
O	the
O	intensely
O	cold
O	west-wind
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	certainly
O	something
O	very
O	singular
O	in
O	the
O	aspect
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	stranger
O	.
O	Among
O	all
O	the
O	children
O	of
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	,
O	the
O	lady
O	could
O	remember
O	no
O	such
O	face
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	pure
O	white
O	,
O	and
O	delicate
O	rose-colour
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	golden
O	ringlets
O	tossing
O	about
O	the
O	forehead
O	and
O	cheeks
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	for
O	her
O	dress
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	entirely
O	of
O	white
O	,
O	and
O	fluttering
O	in
O	the
O	breeze
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	such
O	as
O	no
O	reasonable
O	woman
O	would
O	put
O	upon
O	a
O	little
O	girl
O	,
O	when
O	sending
O	her
O	out
O	to
O	play
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	depth
O	of
O	winter
O	.
O	It
O	made
O	this
O	kind
O	and
O	careful
O	mother
O	shiver
O	only
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	those
O	small
O	feet
O	,
O	with
O	nothing
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	on
O	them
O	,
O	except
O	a
O	very
O	thin
O	pair
O	of
O	white
O	slippers
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	airily
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	clad
O	,
O	the
O	child
O	seemed
O	to
O	feel
O	not
O	the
O	slightest
O	inconvenience
O	from
O	the
O	cold
O	,
O	but
O	danced
O	so
O	lightly
O	over
O	the
O	snow
O	that
O	the
O	tips
O	of
O	her
O	toes
O	left
O	hardly
O	a
O	print
O	in
O	its
O	surface
O	;
O	while
O	Violet
O	could
O	but
O	just
O	keep
O	pace
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	Peony
O	'
O	s
O	short
O	legs
O	compelled
O	him
O	to
O	lag
O	behind
O	.
O	Once
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	course
O	of
O	their
O	play
O	,
O	the
O	strange
O	child
O	placed
O	herself
O	between
O	Violet
O	and
O	Peony
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	a
O	hand
O	of
O	each
O	,
O	skipped
O	merrily
O	forward
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	along
O	with
O	her
O	.
O	Almost
O	immediately
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	Peony
O	pulled
O	away
O	his
O	little
O	fist
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	rub
O	it
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	fingers
O	were
O	tingling
O	with
O	cold
O	;
O	while
O	Violet
O	also
O	released
O	herself
O	,
O	though
O	with
O	less
O	abruptness
O	,
O	gravely
O	remarking
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	better
O	not
O	to
O	take
O	hold
O	of
O	hands
O	.
O	The
O	white-robed
O	damsel
O	said
O	not
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	but
O	danced
O	about
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	merrily
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	If
O	Violet
O	and
O	Peony
O	did
O	not
O	choose
O	to
O	play
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	she
O	could
O	make
O	just
O	as
O	good
O	a
O	playmate
O	of
O	the
O	brisk
O	and
O	cold
O	west-wind
O	,
O	which
O	kept
O	blowing
O	her
O	all
O	about
O	the
O	garden
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	such
O	liberties
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	seemed
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	friends
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	while
O	,
O	the
O	mother
O	stood
O	on
O	the
O	threshold
O	,
O	wondering
O	how
O	a
O	little
O	girl
O	could
O	look
O	so
O	much
O	like
O	a
O	flying
O	snow-drift
O	,
O	or
O	how
O	a
O	snow-drift
O	could
O	look
O	so
O	very
O	like
O	a
O	little
O	girl
O	.
O	She
O	called
O	Violet
O	,
O	and
O	whispered
O	to
O	her
O	.
O	``
O	Violet
O	,
O	my
O	darling
O	,
O	what
O	is

O	child

O	name
O	?

O	``
O	``
O	Why

O	dearest
O	mamma
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	Violet
O	,
O	laughing
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	her
O	mother
O	did
O	not
O	comprehend
O	so
O	very
O	plain
O	an
O	affair
O	,

O	her
O	heart
O	full
O	of
O	childlike
O	simplicity
O	and
O	faith
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	as
O	pure
O	and
O	clear
O	as
O	crystal
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	looking
O	at
O	all
O	matters
O	through
O	this
O	transparent
O	medium
O	,
O	she
O	sometimes
O	saw
O	truths
O	so
O	profound
O	,
O	that
O	other
O	people
O	laughed
O	at
O	them
O	as
O	nonsense
O	and
O	absurdity
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	kind
O	Mr
O	.
O	Lindsey
O	had
O	entered
O	the
O	garden
O	,
O	breaking
O	away
O	from
O	his
O	two
O	children
O	,
O	who
O	still
O	sent
O	their
O	shrill
O	voices
O	after
O	him
O	,
O	beseeching
O	him
O	to
O	let
O	the
O	snow-child
O	stay
O	and
O	enjoy
O	herself
O	in
O	the
O	cold
O	west-wind
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	approached
O	,
O	the
O	snow-birds
O	took
O	to
O	flight
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	white
O	damsel
O	,
O	also
O	,
O	fled
O	backward
O	,
O	shaking
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	``
O	Pray
O	,
O	do
O	not
O	touch
O	me
O	!
O	``
O	and
O	roguishly
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	appeared
O	,
O	leading
O	him
O	through
O	the
O	deepest
O	of
O	the
O	snow
O	.
O	Once
O	,
O	the
O	good
O	man
O	stumbled
O	,
O	and
O	floundered
O	down
O	upon
O	his
O	face
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	gathering
O	himself
O	up
O	again
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	snow
O	sticking
O	to
O	his
O	rough
O	pilot-cloth
O	sack
O	,
O	he
O	looked
O	as
O	white
O	and
O	wintry
O	as
O	a
O	snow-image
O	of
O	the
O	largest
O	size
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	neighbours
O	,
O	meanwhile
O	,
O	seeing
O	him
O	from
O	their
O	windows
O	,
O	wondered
O	what
O	could
O	possess
O	poor
O	Mr
O	.
O	Lindsey
O	to
O	be
O	running
O	about
O	his
O	garden
O	in
O	pursuit
O	of
O	a
O	snow-drift
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	west-wind
O	was
O	driving
O	hither
O	and
O	thither
O	!
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	vast
O	deal
O	of
O	trouble
O	,
O	he
O	chased
O	the
O	little
O	stranger
O	into
O	a
O	corner
O	,
O	where
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	possibly
O	escape
O	him
O	.
O	His
O	wife
O	had
O	been
O	looking
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	it
O	being
O	nearly
O	twilight
O	,
O	was
O	wonderstruck
O	to
O	observe
O	how
O	the
O	snow-child
O	gleamed
O	and
O	sparkled
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	she
O	seemed
O	to
O	shed
O	a
O	glow
O	all
O	round
O	about
O	her
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	driven
O	into
O	the
O	corner
O	,
O	she
O	positively
O	glistened
O	like
O	a
O	star
O	!
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	frosty
O	kind
O	of
O	brightness
O	,
O	too
O	like
O	that
O	of
O	an
O	icicle
O	in
O	the
O	moonlight
O	.
O	The
O	wife
O	thought
O	it
O	strange
O	that
O	good
O	Mr
O	.
O	Lindsey
O	should
O	see
O	nothing
O	remarkable
O	in
O	the
O	snow-child
O	'
O	s
O	appearance
O	.
O	``
O	Come
O	,
O	you
O	odd
O	little
O	thing
O	!
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	honest
O	man
O	,
O	seizing
O	her
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	have
O	caught
O	you
O	at

O	make

O	comfortable
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	yourself
O	.
O	We
O	will
O	put
O	a
O	nice
O	warm
O	pair
O	of
O	worsted
O	stockings
O	on
O	your
O	frozen
O	little
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	you
O	shall
O	have
O	a
O	good
O	thick
O	shawl
O	to
O	wrap
O	yourself
O	in
O	.
O	Your
O	poor
O	white
O	nose
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	afraid

O	benevolent
O	smile

O	sagacious
O	visage

O	was
O	with
O	the
O	cold
O	,
O	this
O	very
O	well-meaning
O	gentleman
O	took
O	the
O	snow-child
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	and
O	led
O	her
O	towards
O	the

O	followed

O	reluctant
O	;
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	glow

O	before

O	with
O	a
O	crimson

O	up

O	which
O	froze
O	before
O	they
O	could
O	run
O	down
O	their
O	cheeks
O	--
O	and
O	again
O	entreated
O	him
