O	""""
O	And
O	to
O	Halcyone
O	a
O	great
O	miracle
O	was
O	then
O	vouchsafed
O	,
O	for
O	from
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	snowy
O	shoulders
O	grew
O	snow-white
O	pinions
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	them
O	she
O	skimmed
O	over
O	the
O	waves
O	until
O	she
O	reached
O	the
O	rigid
O	body
O	of
O	Ceyx
O	,
O	drifting
O	,
O	a
O	helpless
O	burden
O	for
O	the
O	conquering
O	waves
O	,
O	in
O	with
O	the
O	swift-flowing
O	tide
O	.
O	As
O	she
O	flew
O	,
O	she
O	uttered
O	cries
O	of
O	love
O	and
O	of
O	longing
O	,
O	but
O	only
O	strange
O	raucous
O	cries
O	came
O	from
O	the
O	throat
O	that
O	had
O	once
O	only
O	made
O	music
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	she
O	reached
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	Ceyx
O	and
O	would
O	fain
O	have
O	kissed
O	his
O	marble
O	lips
O	,
O	Halcyone
O	found
O	that
O	no
O	longer
O	were
O	her
O	own
O	lips
O	like
O	the
O	petals
O	of
O	a
O	fair
O	red
O	rose
O	warmed
O	by
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	gods
O	had
O	heard
O	her
O	prayer
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	horny
O	beak
O	seemed
O	to
O	the
O	watchers
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	to
O	be
O	fiercely
O	tearing
O	at
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	him
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	king
O	of
O	Thessaly
O	.
O	Yet
O	the
O	gods
O	were
O	not
O	merciless--or
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	the
O	love
O	of
O	Halcyone
O	was
O	an
O	all-conquering
O	love
O	.
O	For
O	as
O	the
O	soul
O	of
O	Halcyone
O	had
O	passed
O	into
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	a
O	white-winged
O	sea-bird
O	,
O	so
O	also
O	passed
O	the
O	soul
O	of
O	her
O	husband
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	And
O	for
O	evermore
O	Halcyone
O	and
O	her
O	mate
O	,
O	known
O	as
O	the
O	Halcyon
O	birds
O	,
O	defied
O	the
O	storm
O	and
O	tempest
O	,
O	and
O	proudly
O	breasted
O	,
O	side
O	by
O	side
O	,
O	the
O	angriest
O	waves
O	of
O	the
O	raging
O	seas
O	.
O	To
O	them
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	did
O	the
O	gods
O	grant
O	a
O	boon
O	:
O	that
O	,
O	for
O	seven
O	days
O	before
O	the
O	shortest
O	day
O	of
O	the
O	year
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	seven
O	days
O	after
O	it
O	,
O	there
O	should
O	reign
O	over
O	the
O	sea
O	a
O	great
O	calm
O	in
O	which
O	Halcyone
O	,
O	in
