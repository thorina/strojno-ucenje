O	He
O	had

O	with
O	him
O	the
O	news
O	that
O	the
O	alarm
O	of
O	invasion
O	was
O	false
O	.
O	The
O	beacon
O	which
O	Caxon
O	had
O	seen
O	was
O	only
O	the
O	burning
O	of
O	the
O	mining
O	machinery
O	in
O	Glen
O	Withershins
O	which

O	But
O	there
O	was
O	yet
O	further
O	and
O	more
O	interesting
O	private
O	news
O	.
O	The
O	proofs
O	that
O	Lovel
O	was
O	indeed
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	Earl
O	of
O	Glenallan
O	were
O	found
O	to
O	be
O	overwhelming
O	.
O	His
O	heirship
O	to
O	the
O	title
O	had
O	been
O	fully
O	made
O	out
O	.
O	The
O	chaplain
O	who
O	had
O	performed
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	wedding
O	had
O	returned
O	from
O	abroad
O	,
O	exiled
O	by
O	the
O	French
O	Revolution
O	.
O	The
O	witnesses
O	also
O	had
O	been
O	found
O	.
O	Most
O	decisive
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	among
O	the
O	papers
O	of
O	the
O	Earl
O	'
O	s
O	late
O	brother
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	discovered
O	a
O	duly
O	authenticated
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	carrying
O	off
O	the
O	child
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	how
O	he
O	had
O	had
O	him
O	educated
O	and
O	pushed
O	on
O	in
O	the
O	army
O	.
O	So
O	that
O	very
O	night
O	the
O	Antiquary
O	enjoyed
O	in
O	some
O	degree
O	the
O	crowning
O	pleasure
O	of
O	his
O	whole
O	life
O	,
O	in
O	bringing
O	together
O	father
O	and
O	son
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	.
O	That
O	is
O	,
O	if
O	the

O	which
O	took
O	place
O	soon
O	after

O	)
O	and

O	did
O	not
O	turn
O	out
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	yet
O	greater
O	pleasure
O	.
O	Old
O	Edie
O	still
O	travels
O	from
O	farm
O	to
O	farm
O	,
O	but
O	mostly

O	himself
O	to
O	the
O	short
O	round
O	between
O	Monkbarns
O	and
O	Knockwinnock
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	reported
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	means
O	soon
O	to

O	with

O	,

O	the

O	of

O	to

O	Hiawatha
O	was
O	of
O	high
O	and
O	mysterious
O	origin
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	a

O	It

O	from
O	Hiawatha
O	the

O	learned
O	to

O	efforts

O	a

O	,
O	at

O	appointed

O	meeting

O	on
O	an
O	eminence
O	on
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	Onondaga
O	Lake
O	.
O	There
O	,
O	accordingly
O	,
O	the
O	chief
O	men
O	assembled
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	occasion
O	brought
O	together
O	a
O	vast
O	multitude
O	of
O	men
O	,
O	women
O	,
O	and
O	children
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	in
O	expectation
O	of
O	some
O	marvellous
O	deliverance
O	.
O	Three
O	days
O	elapsed
O	,
O	and
O	Hiawatha
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	.
O	The
O	multitude
O	began
O	to
O	fear
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	coming
O	,
O	and
O	messengers
O	were
O	despatched
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	Tioto
O	,
O	who
O	found
O	him
O	depressed
O	with
O	a
O	presentiment
O	that
O	evil
O	would
O	follow
O	his
O	attendance
O	.
O	These
O	fears
O	were
O	overruled
O	by
O	the
O	eager
O	persuasions
O	of
O	the
O	messengers;
O	and
O	Hiawatha
O	,
O	taking
O	his
O	daughter
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	put
O	his
O	wonderful
O	canoe
O	in
O	its
O	element
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	for
O	the
O	council
O	.
O	The
O	grand
O	assemblage
O	that
O	was
O	to
O	avert
O	the
O	threatened
O	danger
O	appeared
O	quickly
O	in
O	sight
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	moved
O	rapidly
O	along
O	in
O	his
O	magic
O	canoe;
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	people
O	saw
O	him
O	,
O	they
O	sent
O	up
O	loud
O	shouts
O	of
O	welcome
O	until
O	the
O	venerated
O	man
O	landed
O	.
O	A
O	steep
O	ascent
O	led
O	up
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	occupied
O	by
O	the
O	council;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	walked
O	up
O	,
O	a
O	loud
O	whirring
O	sound
O	was
O	heard
O	above
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	caused
O	by
O	some
O	rushing
O	current
O	of
O	air
O	.
O	Instantly
O	,
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	all
O	were
O	directed
O	upward
O	to
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	where
O	was
O	seen
O	a
O	dark
O	spot
O	,
O	something
O	like
O	a
O	small
O	cloud
O	,
O	descending
O	rapidly
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	it
O	approached
O	,
O	enlarging
O	in
O	its
O	size
O	and
O	increasing
O	in
O	velocity
O	.
O	Terror
O	and
O	alarm
O	filled
O	the
O	minds
O	of
O	the
O	multitude
O	and
O	they
O	scattered
O	in
O	confusion
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	gained
O	the
O	eminence
O	,
O	Hiawatha
O	stood
O	still
O	,
O	causing
O	his
O	daughter
O	to
O	do
O	the
O	same--deeming
O	it
O	cowardly
O	to
O	fly
O	,
O	and
O	impossible
O	,
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	attempted
O	,
O	to
O	divert
O	the
O	designs
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	.
O	The
O	descending
O	object
O	now
O	assumed
O	a
O	more
O	definite
O	aspect;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	came
O	nearer
O	,
O	revealed
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	a
O	gigantic
O	white
O	bird
O	,
O	with
O	wide-extended
O	and
O	pointed
O	wings
O	.
O	This
O	bird
O	came
O	down
O	with
O	ever
O	increasing
O	velocity
O	,
O	until
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	mighty
O	swoop
O	,
O	it
O	dropped
O	upon
O	the
O	girl
O	,
O	crushing
O	her
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	The
O	fixed
O	face
O	of
O	Hiawatha
O	alone
O	indicated
O	his
O	consciousness
O	of
O	his
O	daughter
O	'
O	s
O	death;
O	while
O	in
O	silence
O	he
O	signalled
O	to

O	,
O	who
O	had
O	stood
O	watching

O	event
O	in
O	speechless
O	consternation
O	.
O	One
O	after
O	the
O	other
O	stepped
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	prostrate
O	bird
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	killed
O	by
O	its
O	violent
O	fall
O	,
O	and
O	selecting
O	a
O	feather
O	from
O	its
O	snow-white
O	plumage
O	,
O	decorated
O	himself
O	therewith

O	now

O	removing

O	carcass
O	of

O	bird
O	,
O	not

O	Shades

O	contracted

O	stood
O	apart
O	in

O	grief
O	.
O	No

O	was

O	waited
O	in

O	at

O	arousing
