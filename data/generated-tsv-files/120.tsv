O	not
O	wonderful
O	,
O	considering
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	Brownie
O	in
O	the

O	.
O	Otherwise
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	the

O	most
O	other

O	.
O	The
O	children
O	also
O	:
O	they
O	were
O	sometimes
O	good
O	,
O	sometimes
O	naughty
O	,
O	like
O	other

O	;
O	but
O	,
O	on

O	the

O	a

O	to
O	play

O	they
O	declared
O	he
O	did
O	--
O	many
O	and
O	many
O	a
O	time
O	.
O	A
O	favorite
O	play-place
O	was
O	the

O	,
O	where
O	grew
O	the
O	biggest
O	cherry

O	you

O	They
O	called
O	it
O	their
O	``

O	,
O	``
O	because
O	it
O	rose
O	up
O	ten

O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	in
O	one
O	thick
O	stem
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	branched
O	out
O	into
O	a
O	circle
O	of
O	boughs
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	flat
O	place
O	in
O	the

O	,
O	where
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	children
O	could
O	sit
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	There
O	they

O	,
O	or
O	one

O	a
O	time
O	--
O	sometimes
O	with
O	a
O	book
O	,

O	;
O	and
O	the
O	biggest
O	boy
O	made
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	rope
O	ladder
O	by
O	which
O	they
O	could
O	climb
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	--
O	which
O	they
O	did
O	all
O	winter
O	,
O	and
O	enjoyed
O	their
O	``

O	``
O	very
O	much
O	.
O	But
O	one
O	day
O	in
O	spring
O	they
O	found
O	their
O	ladder
O	cut
O	away
O	!
O	The
O	Gardener
O	had
O	done
O	it
O	,

O	injured
O	the

O	,
O	which
O	was
O	just
O	coming
O	into
O	blossom
O	.
O	Now
O	this
O	Gardener
O	was
O	a
O	rather
O	gruff
O	man
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	growling
O	voice
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	mean
O	to
O	be
O	unkind
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	disliked
O	children
O	;
O	he
O	said
O	they
O	bothered
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	they
O	complained
O	to
O	their
O	mother
O	about
O	the
O	ladder
O	,
O	she
O	agreed
O	with
O	Gardener
O	that
O	the
O	tree
O	must
O	not
O	be
O	injured
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	bore
O	the

O	cherries
O	in
O	all

O	--
O	so
O	big
O	that
O	the
O	old
O	saying
O	of
O	``
O	taking
O	two
O	bites
O	at
O	a
O	cherry
O	``
O	came
O	really
O	true
O	.
O	``
O	Wait
O	till

O	said
O	she
O	;
O	and
O	so
O	the
O	little
O	people
O	waited
O	,
O	and
O	watched
O	it
O	through
O	its
O	leafing
O	and
O	blossoming

O	such

O	on

O	he
O	is
O	an
O	awful
O	creature
O	to
O	have
O	so
O	near
O	one
O	.
O	I
O	would
O	much
O	rather
O	he

O	an

O	soldier
O	.
O	I

O	not
O	looking
O	after

O	;
O	he
O	shall
O	not

O	him
O	,

O	him
O	offer
O	ever
O	so
O	much
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	more
O	the
O	wife
O	talked
O	,
O	the
O	more
O	the
O	husband
O	laughed
O	at
O	her
O	fears
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	fell
O	asleep
O	,
O	whilst

O	thinking
O	and
O	thinking
O	,
O	till
O	by
O	degrees
O	she
O	forgot
O	her
O	fears
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	wonder
O	what
O	they
O	might
O	expect
O	by
O	way
O	of
O	reward
O	.
O	Hours
O	appeared

O	away
O	during

O	At

O	to
O	her
O	great
O	surprise
O	,
O	while
O	it
O	was
O	still
O	quite
O	dark
O	,
O	her
O	husband
O	called
O	to
O	her
O	from
O	below
O	:
O	``
O	Come
O	down
O	,

O	As
O	quickly
O	as

O	Kitty
O	started
O	up
O	and
O	dressed
O	herself
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	down
O	the
O	ladder
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	she
O	saw
O	her
O	husband
O	kneeling
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	over
O	the
O	knapsack
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	Ouphe
O	had
O	left
O	behind
O	him

O	Kitty
O	rushed
O	to
O	the
O	spot
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	knapsack
O	bursting
O	open
O	with
O	gold
O	coins
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	rolling
O	out
O	over
O	the
O	brick
O	floor
O	.
O	Here
O	was
O	good
O	fortune
O	!
O	She
O	began
O	to
O	pick
O	them
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	count
O	them
O	into
O	her
O	apron
O	.
O	The
O	more
O	she
O	gathered
O	,
O	the
O	faster
O	they
O	rolled
O	,
O	till
O	she
O	left
O	off
O	counting
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	breath
O	with
O	joy

O	surprise
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	shall
O	we
O	do
O	with
O	all
O	this
O	money

O	said
O	the
O	delighted
O	woodman
O	.
O	They
O	consulted
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	they
O	decided
O	to
O	bury
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	garden
O	,
O	all
O	but
O	twenty
O	pieces
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	would
O	spend
O	directly
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	they
O	dug
O	a
O	hole
O	and
O	carefully
O	hid
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	money
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	woodman
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	returned
O	laden
O	with
O	the
O	things
O	they
O	had
O	agreed
O	upon
O	as
O	desirable
O	possessions
O	;
O	namely
O	,
O	a
O	leg
O	of
O	mutton
O	,
O	two
O	bottles
O	of
O	wine
O	,
O	a
O	necklace
O	for
O	Kitty
O	,
O	some
O	tea

O	,
O	a

O	a
O	great

O	a
O	rattle
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	new
O	pairs
O	of

O	.
O	How
O	enchanted
O	they
O	both
O	were
O	!
O	Kitty
O	cooked
O	the
O	nice
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	dressed
O	themselves
O	in
O	the
O	finery
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	dinner
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	alas
O	!
O	the
O	woodman
O	drank
O	so
O	much
O	of
O	the
O	wine
O	that
O	he
O	soon
O	got
O	quite
O	tipsy
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	dance
O	and
O	sing
O	.
O	Kitty
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	shocked
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	proposed
O	to
O	dig
O	up
O	some
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	gold
O	,
O	and
O	go
O	to
O	market
O	for
O	some
O	more
O	wine
O	and
O	some
O	more
O	blue
O	velvet
O	waistcoats
O	,
O	she
O	remonstrated
O	very
O	strongly
O	.
O	Such
O	was
O	the
O	change
O	that
O	had
O	come
O	over
O	this
O	loving
O	couple
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	presently
O	began
O	to
O	quarrel
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	words
O	the
O	woodman
O	soon
O	got
O	to
O	blows
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	beating
O	his
O	little
O	wife
O	,
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	and
O	fell
O	fast
O	asleep
O	,
O	while
O	she
O	sat
O	crying
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	they
O	both
O	felt
O	very
O	miserable
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	woodman
O	had
O	such
O	a
O	terrible
O	headache
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	neither
O	eat
O	nor
O	work
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	day
O	after
O	,
O	being
O	pretty
O	well
O	again
O	,
O	he
O	dug
O	up
O	some
O	more
O	gold
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	town
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	bought
O	such
O	quantities
O	of
O	fine
O	clothes
O	and
O	furniture
O	and
O	so
O	many
O	good
O	things
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	end
O	he
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	buy
O	a
O	wagon
O	to
O	bring
O	them
O	home
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	was
O	the
O	delight
O	of
O	his
O	wife
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	him
O	coming
O	home
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	driving
O	the
O	four
O	gray
O	horses
O	himself
O	.
O	They
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	unpack
O	the
O	goods
O	and
O	lay
O	them
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	grass
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	cottage
O	was
O	far
O	too
O	small
O	to
O	hold
O	them
O	.
O	``
O	There
O	are
O	some
O	red
O	silk
O	curtains
O	with
O	gold
O	rods
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	woodman
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	grand
O	indeed
O	they
O	are
O	!
O	``
O	exclaimed
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	spreading
O	them
O	over
O	the
O	onion
O	bed
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	here
O	'

O	a
O	great
O	looking-glass

O	continued
O	the
O	woodman
O	,
O	setting
O	one
O	up
O	against
O	the
O	outside

O	the
O	cottage
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	would
O	not
O	go
O	in
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	went
O	on
O	handing
O	down
O	the
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	took
O	nearly
O	the
O	whole
O	afternoon
O	to
O	empty
O	the
O	wagon
O	.
O	No

O	for
O	the

O	five
O	very
O	large
O	tea-trays
O	adorned
O	with

O	the

O	the

O	,

O	often
O	been

O	felt
O	so
O	unwell
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	look
O	after
O	them
O	;
O	therefore
O	it
O	is
O	not

O	damask
O	sofa

O	now
O	Kitty
O	had
O	a

O	he
O	was
O	allowed
O	to
O	tear
O	his
O	picture-books
O	as
O	often
O	as
O	he
O	pleased
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	eat
O	so
O	many
O	sugar-plums
O	and
O	macaroons
O	that
O	they
O	often
O	made
O	him
O	quite
O	ill
O	.
O	The
O	woodman
O	looked
O	very
O	pale
O	and
O	miserable
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	often
O	said
O	what
O	a
O	fine
O	thing
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	rich
O	.
O	He
O	never
O	thought
O	of
O	going
O	to
O	his
O	work
O	,
O	and
O	used
O	generally
O	to
O	sit
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen
O	till
O	dinner
O	was
O	ready
O	,
O	watching
O	the
O	spit
O	.
O	Kitty
O	wished
O	she
O	could
O	see
O	him
O	looking
O	as
O	well
O	and
O	cheerful
O	as
O	in
O	old
O	days
O	,
O	though
O	she
O	felt
O	naturally
O	proud
O	that
O	her
O	husband
O	should
O	always
O	be
O	dressed
O	like
O	a
O	gentleman
O	,
O	namely
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	blue
O	coat
O	,
O	red
O	waistcoat
O	,
O	and
O	top-boots
O	.
O	He
O	and
O	Kitty
O	could
O	never
O	agree
O	as
O	to
O	what
O	should
O	be
O	done
O	with
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	money
O	;
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	would
O	have
O	known
O	them
O	for
O	the
O	same
O	people
O	;
O	they
O	quarrelled
O	almost
O	every
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	lost
O	nearly
O	all
O	their
O	love
O	for
O	one
O	another
O	.
O	Kitty
O	often
O	cried
O	herself
O	to
O	sleep
O	--
O	a
O	thing
O	she
O	had
O	never
O	done
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	poor
O	;
O	she
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	strange
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	be
O	a
O	lady
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	not
O	be
O	happy
O	.
O	Every
O	morning
O	when
O	the
O	woodman
O	was
O	sober
O	they
O	invented
O	new
O	plans
O	for
O	making
O	themselves
O	happy
O	,
O	yet
O	,
O	strange
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	none
O	of
O	them
O	succeeded
O	,
O	and
O	matters
O	grew
O	worse
O	and
O	worse
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	Kitty
O	thought
O	she
O	should
O	be
O	happy
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	coach
O	;
O	so
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	knapsack
O	was
O	buried
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	dig
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	garden
O	was
O	so
O	trodden
O	down
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	dig
O	deep
O	enough
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	got
O	tired
O	of
O	trying
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	called
O	the
O	servant
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	the
O	secret
O	as
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	money
O	was
O	,
O	promising
O	her
O	a
O	gold
O	piece
O	if
O	she
O	could
O	dig
O	it
O	up
O	.
O	The
O	servant
O	dug
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	strength
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	trouble
O	they
O	got
O	the
O	knapsack
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	Kitty
O	found
O	that
O	not
O	many
O	gold
O	pieces
O	were
O	left
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	she
O	resolved
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	coach
O	,
O	so
O	she
O	took
O	them
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	where
O	she
O	bought
O	a
O	yellow
O	chariot
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	most
O	beautiful
O	coat
O	of
O	arms
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	cream-colored
O	horses
O	to
O	draw
O	it
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	the
O	maid
O	ran
O	to
O	the
O	magistrates
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	she
O	had
O	discovered
O	something
O	very
O	dreadful
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	her
O	mistress
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	dig
O	in
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	make
O	money
O	come
O	--
O	coined
O	money
O	:
O	``
O	which
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	maid
O	,
O	``
O	is
O	a
O	very
O	terrible
O	thing
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	proves
O	that

O	must
O	be
O	a
O	witch
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	mayor
O	and
O	aldermen
O	were
O	very
O	much
O	shocked
O	,
O	for
O	witches
O	were
O	commonly
O	believed
O	in
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	heard
O	that
O	Kitty
O	had
O	dug
O	up
O	money
O	that
O	very
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	bought
O	a
O	yellow
O	coach
O	with
O	it
O	,
O	they
O	decided
O	that
O	the
O	matter
O	must
O	be
O	investigated
O	.
O	When
O	Kitty
O	drove
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	own
O	door
O	,
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	mayor
O	and
O	aldermen
O	standing
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen
O	waiting
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	She
O	demanded
O	what
O	they
O	wanted
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	said
O	they
O	were
O	come
O	in
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	name
O	to
O	search
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	Kitty
O	immediately
O	ran
O	up-stairs
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	baby
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	cradle
O	,
O	lest
O	any
O	of
O	them
O	should
O	steal
O	him
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	seemed
O	a
O	very
O	probable
O	thing
O	for
O	them
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	her
O	husband
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	shocking
O	to
O	relate
O	,
O	was
O	quite
O	tipsy
O	,
O	quarrelling
O	and
O	arguing
O	with
O	the
O	mayor
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	actually
O	saw
O	him

O	ears
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	thing

O	;
O	``
O	this

O	a

O	Kitty
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	bewildered
O	at
O	this
O	;
O	but
O	how
O	much
O	more
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	her
