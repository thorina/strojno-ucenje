O	There

O	one
O	morning
O	more
O	than

O	One
O	night
O	a

O	came
O	to
O	him
O	in

O	separated

O	the

O	,
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	got
O	a
O	good
O	way
O	off
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	damsel
O	placed
O	the
O	pocket-handkerchief
O	in
O	her
O	bosom
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	after

O	again

O	a
O	good

O	off
O	.
O	Then
O	the

O	Again

O	saw
O	that

O	had
O	never

O	herself
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	not
O	knowing
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	herself
O	,

O	was
O	somebody
O	else
O	,
O	she
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	,
O	fell
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	herself
O	in
O	the
O	mirror
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	man
O	got
O	so
O	far
O	off
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	able
O	to
O	overtake
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	saw
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	catch
O	him
O	,
O	she
O	turned
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	man
O	reached
O	his
O	home
O	safe
O	and
O	sound
O	.
O	After
O	arriving
O	at
O	his
O	home
O	,
O	he
O	showed
O	his
O	wife
O	the
O	hair
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	happened
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	jeer
O	and
O	laugh
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	paid
O	no
O	attention
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	a
O	town
O	to
O	sell
O	the
O	hair
O	.
O	A
O	crowd
O	of
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	people
O	and
O	merchants
O	collected
O	round
O	him;
O	one
O	offered
O	a
O	sequin
O	,
O	another
O	two
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	on
O	,
O	higher
O	and
O	higher
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	hundred
O	gold
O	sequins
O	.
O	Just
O	then
O	the
O	emperor
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	hair
O	,
O	summoned
O	the
O	man
O	into
O	his
O	presence
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	a
O	thousand
O	sequins
O	for
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	sold
O	it
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	What
O	was
O	the
O	hair
O	?
O	The
O	emperor
O	split
O	it
O	in
O	two
O	from
O	top
O	to
O	bottom
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	registered
O	in
O	it
O	in
O	writing
O	many
O	remarkable
O	things
O	,
O	which
O	happened
O	in
O	the
O	olden
O	time
O	since
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	Thus
O	the
O	man
O	became
O	rich
O	and
O	lived
O	on
O	with
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	children
O	.
O	And
O	that
O	child
O	,
O	that
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	sleep
O	,
O	was
O	an
O	angel
O	sent
O	by
O	the
O	Lord
O	God
O	,
O	whose
O	will
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	aid
O	the
O	poor
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	reveal
O	secrets
O	which
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	revealed
O	till
O	then
O	.
