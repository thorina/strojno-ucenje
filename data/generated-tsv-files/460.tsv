O	A
O	long
O	,
O	long
O	time
O	ago
O	there
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	hut
O	on
O	the
O	borders
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	forest
O	a
O	huntsman
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	son
O	.
O	From
O	his
O	earliest
O	years
O	the
O	boy
O	,
O	whose
O	name
O	was
O	Fergus
O	,
O	used
O	to
O	hunt
O	with
O	his
O	father
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	grew
O	up
O	strong
O	and
O	active
O	,
O	sure
O	and
O	swift-footed
O	as
O	a
O	deer
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	free
O	and
O	fearless
O	as
O	the
O	wind
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	tall
O	and
O	handsome
O	;
O	as
O	supple
O	as
O	a
O	mountain
O	ash
O	,
O	his
O	lips
O	were
O	as
O	red
O	as
O	its
O	berries
O	;
O	his
O	eyes
O	were
O	as
O	blue
O	as
O	the
O	skies
O	in
O	spring
O	;
O	and
O	his
O	hair
O	fell
O	down
O	over
O	his
O	shoulders
O	like
O	a
O	shower
O	of
O	gold
O	.
O	His
O	heart
O	was
O	as
O	light
O	as
O	a
O	bird
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	bird
O	was
O	fonder
O	of
O	green
O	woods
O	and
O	waving
O	branches
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	lived
O	since
O	his
O	birth
O	in
O	the
O	hut
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	never
O	wished
O	to
O	leave
O	it
O	,
O	until
O	one
O	winter
O	night
O	a
O	wandering
O	minstrel
O	sought
O	shelter
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	paid
O	for
O	his
O	night
O	'
O	s
O	lodging
O	with
O	songs
O	of
O	love
O	and
O	battle
O	.
O	Ever
O	since
O	that
O	night
O	Fergus
O	pined
O	for
O	another
O	life
O	.
O	He
O	no
O	longer
O	found
O	joy
O	in
O	the
O	music
O	of
O	the
O	hounds
O	or
O	in
O	the
O	cries
O	of
O	the
O	huntsmen
O	in
O	forest
O	glades
O	.
O	He
O	yearned
O	for
O	the
O	chance
O	of
O	battle
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	clang
O	of
O	shields
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fierce
O	shouts
O	of
O	fighting
O	warriors
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	spent
O	all
O	his
O	spare
O	hours
O	practicing
O	on
O	the
O	harp
O	and
O	learning
O	the
O	use
O	of
O	arms
O	,
O	for
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	the
O	bravest
O	warriors
O	were
O	also
O	bards
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	way
O	the
O	spring
O	and
O	summer
O	and
O	autumn
O	passed
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	winter
O	came
O	again
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
O	on
O	a
O	stormy
O	night
O	,
O	when
O	thunder
O	was
O	rattling
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	smiting
O	the
O	huge
O	oaks
O	and
O	hurling
O	them
O	crashing
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	Fergus
O	lay
O	awake
O	thinking
O	of
O	his
O	present
O	lot
O	,
O	and
O	wondering
O	what
O	the
O	future
O	might
O	have
O	in
O	store
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	lightning
O	was
O	playing
O	around
O	the
O	hut
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	a
O	flash
O	brightened
O	up
O	the
O	interior
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	peal
O	,
O	louder
O	than
O	any
O	which
O	had
O	preceded
O	it
O	,
O	Fergus
O	heard
O	three
O	loud
O	knocks
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	He
O	called
O	out
O	to
O	his
O	parents
O	that
O	someone
O	was
O	knocking
O	.
O	``
O	If

O	a

O	And
O	soon
O	everybody
O	in
O	the

O	was
O	fast
O	asleep
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	morning
O	came
O	the
O	storm
O	had
O	gone
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	shining
O	through
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	hut
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	song
O	of
O	the
O	lark
O	Fergus
O	got
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	one
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	was
O	ever
O	more
O	surprised
O	than
O	he
O	when

O	saw
O	no
O	sign
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	or
O	the

O	,
O	or
O	the
O	wild
O	horse
O	of
O	the

O	.
O	His
O	parents
O	were
O	also
O	surprised
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	all
O	thought
O	that
O	they
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	dreaming
O	until
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	empty
O	peggins
O	around
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	some
O	pieces
O	of
O	broken
O	bread
O	;
O	and
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	what
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	all
O	.
O	From
O	that
O	day
O	forward
O	the
O	desire
O	grew
O	stronger
O	in
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	Fergus
O	for
O	a
O	change
O	of
O	life
O	;
O	and
O	one
O	day
O	he
O	told
O	his
O	parents
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	resolved
O	to
O	seek
O	his
O	fortune
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	soldier
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	set
O	out
O	for
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	try
O	to
O	join
O	the
O	ranks
O	of
O	the
O	Feni
O	.
O	About
O	a
O	week
O	afterwards
O	he
O	took
O	leave
O	of
O	his
O	parents
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	received
O	their
O	blessing
O	he
O	struck
O	out
O	for
O	the
O	road
O	that
O	led
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	the
O	High
O	King
O	of
O	Erin
O	.
O	He
O	arrived
O	there
O	just
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	when
O	the
O	great
O	captain
O	of
O	the
O	Fenian
O	host
O	was
O	recruiting
O	his
O	battalions
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	thinned
O	in
O	recent
O	battle
O	.
O	The
O	manly
O	figure
O	of
O	Fergus
O	,
O	his
O	gallant
O	bearing
O	,
O	and
O	handsome
O	face
O	,
O	all
O	told
O	in
O	his
O	favor
O	.
O	But
O	before
O	he
O	could
O	be
O	received
O	into
O	the
O	Fenian
O	ranks
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	prove
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	play
O	the
O	harp
O	like
O	a
O	bard
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	contend
O	with
O	staff
O	and
O	shield
O	against
O	nine
O	Fenian
O	warriors
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	run
O	with
O	plaited
O	hair
O	through
O	the
O	tangled
O	forest
O	without
O	loosening
O	a
O	single
O	hair
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	in
O	his
O	course
O	he
O	could
O	jump
O	over
O	trees
O	as
O	high
O	as
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	stoop
O	under
O	trees
O	as
O	low
O	as
O	his
O	knee
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	run
O	so
O	lightly
O	that
O	the
O	rotten
O	twigs
O	should
O	not
O	break
O	under
O	his
O	feet
O	.
O	Fergus
O	proved
O	equal
O	to
O	all
O	the
O	tests
O	,
O	thanks
O	to
O	the
O	wandering
O	minstrel
O	who
O	taught
O	him
O	the
O	use
O	of
O	the
O	harp
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	brave
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	his
O	forest
O	training
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	enrolled
O	in
O	the
O	second
O	battalion
O	of
O	the
O	Feni
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	long
O	he
O	was
O	its
O	bravest
O	and
O	ablest
O	champion
O	.
O	At
O	that
O	very
O	time
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	the
O	niece
O	of
O	the
O	High
O	King
O	of
O	Erin
O	was
O	staying
O	with
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	in
O	their
O	palace
O	at
O	Tara
O	.
O	The
O	princess
O	was
O	the
O	loveliest
O	lady
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	as
O	proud
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	beautiful
O	.
O	The
O	princes
O	and
O	chieftains
O	of
O	Erin
O	in
O	vain
O	sought
O	her
O	hand
O	in
O	marriage
O	.
O	From
O	Alba
O	and
O	Spain
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	far-off
O	isles
O	of
O	Greece
O	,
O	kings
O	came
O	to
O	woo
O	her
O	.
O	From
O	the
O	northern
O	lands
O	came
O	vikings
O	in
O	stately
O	galleys
O	with
O	brazen
O	prows
O	,
O	whose
O	oarsmen
O	tore
O	the
O	white
O	foam
O	from
O	the
O	emerald
O	seas
O	as
O	they
O	swept
O	towards
O	the
O	Irish
O	coasts
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	lady
O	had
O	vowed
O	she
O	would
O	wed
O	with
O	no
O	one
O	except
O	a
O	battle
O	champion
O	who
O	could
O	excel
O	in
O	music
O	the
O	chief
O	bard
O	of
O	the
O	High
O	King
O	of
O	Erin
O	;
O	who
O	could
O	outstrip
O	on
O	his
O	steed
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	race
O	of
O	Tara
O	the
O	white
O	steed
O	of
O	the
O	plains
O	;
O	and
O	who
O	could
O	give
O	her
O	as
O	a
O	wedding
O	robe
O	a
O	garment
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	colors
O	of
O	the
O	rainbow
O	,
O	so
O	finely
O	spun
O	that
O	when
O	folded
O	up
O	it
O	would
O	fit
O	in
O	the
O	palm
O	of
O	her
O	small
O	white
O	hand
O	.
O	To
O	fulfill
O	these
O	three
O	conditions
O	was
O	impossible
O	for
O	all
O	her
O	suitors
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	loveliest
O	lady
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	would
O	go
O	unmarried
O	to
O	her
O	grave
O	.
O	It
O	chanced
O	that
O	once
O	,
O	on
O	a
O	day
O	when
O	the
O	Fenian
O	battalions
O	were
O	engaged
O	in
O	a
O	hurling-match
O	,
O	Fergus
O	beheld
O	the
O	lady
O	watching
O	the
O	match
O	from
O	her
O	sunny
O	bower
O	.
O	He
O	no
O	sooner
O	saw
O	her
O	than
O	he
O	fell
O	over
O	head
O	and
O	ears
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	her
O	by
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	her
O	by
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	believing
O	that
O	his
O	love
O	was
O	hopeless
O	,
O	he
O	often
O	wished
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	left
O	his
O	forest-home
O	.
O	The
O	great
O	fair
O	of
O	Tara
O	[
O	8
O	]
O	was
O	coming
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	Feni
O	were
O	busy
O	from
O	morning
O	till
O	night
O	practicing
O	feats
O	of
O	arms
O	and
O	games
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	take
O	part
O	in
O	the
O	contests
O	to
O	be
O	held
O	during
O	the
O	fair
O	.
O	And
O	Fergus
O	,
O	knowing
O	that
O	the
O	princess
O	would
O	be
O	present
O	,
O	determined
O	to
O	do
O	his
O	best
O	to
O	win
O	the
O	prizes
O	which
O	were
O	to
O	be
O	contended
O	for
O	before
O	the
O	ladies
O	'
O	eyes
O	.
O	The
O	fair
O	began
O	on
O	the
O	1st
O	of
O	August
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	a
O	whole
O	week
O	before
O	the
O	five
O	great
O	roads
O	of
O	Erin
O	were
O	thronged
O	with
O	people
O	of

O	Princes

O	countless

O	,
O	all
O	wending
O	their
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	meeting-place
O	by
O	the

O	had
O	been
O	raised
O	over
O	the
O	grave
O	of
O	the

O	queen
O	.
O	For
O	there
O	the
O	fair
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	held
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	opening
O	day
O	the
O	High
O	King
O	,
O	attended
O	by
O	the
O	four
O	kings
O	of
O	Erin
O	,
O	set

O	and
O	the
O	ladies
O	of
O	the

O	in

O	The

O	with
O	the
O	High
O	Queen
O	,
O	under
O	an
O	awning
O	made
O	of

O	of

O	,
O	to
O	protect

O	silk
O	.
O	Then
O	came
O	the

O	,
O	the

O	judges
O	of
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	carrying

O	in

O	.
O	When
O	the

O	reached
O	the

O	it
O	took
O	its
O	place
O	in
O	inclosures
O	right
O	up
O	against
O	the
O	monumental
O	mound
O	.
O	The

O	In

O	to

O	At
O	a
O	signal
O	from
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	greeted
O	with
O	a
O	thunderous

O	,
O	the

O	three
O	times
O	with

O	swords
O	,
O	they
O	made
O	a
O	solemn
O	proclamation
O	of

O	.
O	Then

O	again
O	the
O	heralds
O	struck
O	their
O	shields
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	contests
O	began
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	contest
O	was
O	the
O	contest
O	of
O	spear-throwing
O	between
O	the
O	champions
O	of
O	the
O	seven

O	,
O	everyone
O	,

O	the

O	struck
O	by
O	the
O	manly
O	beauty
O	and
O	noble
O	bearing
O	of
O	Fergus
O	.
O	The
O	champions
O	poised
O	their

O	,
O	and
O	at
O	a
O	stroke
O	from
O	the
O	heralds
O	upon
O	their
O	shields
O	the
O	seven
O	spears
O	sped
O	flashing
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	.
O	They
O	all
O	struck
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	shafts
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	seen
O	that
O	two
O	were
O	standing
O	side
O	by
O	side
O	in
O	advance
O	of
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	one
O	belonged
O	to
O	Fergus
O	,
O	the

O	to
O	the

O	chief
O	,
O	Oscar

O	The
O	contest
O	for
O	the
O	prize
O	then
O	lay
O	between
O	Oscar
O	and
O	Fergus
O	,
O	and
O	when

O	in

O	the

O	,
O	holding
O	their
O	spears
O	aloft
O	,
O	every

O	was
O	throbbing
O	with
O	excitement
O	.
O	Once
O	more
O	the
O	heralds
O	struck
O	their
O	shields

O	and
O	,
O	swifter
O	than

O	lightning

O	s
O	flash
O	,
O	forth
O	went
O	the
O	spears
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	Fergus
O	'
O	s
O	spear
O	was
O	seen
O	shivering
O	in
O	the

O	full
O	length
O	ahead
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	chief
O	Oscar
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	the
O	air
O	was
O	shaken
O	by
O	a
O	wild
O	cheer
O	that
O	was
O	heard
O	far
O	beyond
O	the

O	.
O	And
O	as
O	Fergus
O	approached
O	the
O	high
O	king
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	prize
O	the
O	cheers
O	were
O	renewed
O	.
O	But
O	Fergus
O	thought
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	winsome
O	glance
O	of
O	the
O	princess
O	than
O	he
O	did
O	of
O	the
O	prize
O	or
O	the
O	sounding
O	cheers
O	.
O	And
O	Princess
O	Maureen
O	was
O	almost
O	sorry
O	for
O	her
O	vow
O	,
O	for
O	her
O	heart
O	was
O	touched
O	by

O	from

O	in

O	In
O	the
O	height
O	of
O	the
O	debate
O	the
O	cry
O	arose
O	that
O	another
O	competitor
O	had
O	ascended
O	the
O	mound
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	standing

O	the

O	All

O	but
O	no
O	one
O	looked
O	so
O	eagerly
O	as
O	the
O	princess
O	.
O	He
O	touched
O	his
O	harp
O	with
O	gentle
O	fingers
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	sound
O	low
O	and

O	as
O	a
O	faint
O	summer
O	breeze
O	passing
O	through
O	forest
O	trees
O	stole
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	was
O	heard
O	the
O	rustle
O	of
O	birds
O	through
O	the
O	branches
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dreamy
O	murmur
O	of
O	waters
O	lost
O	in
O	deepest
O	woods
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	fairy

O	whispering
O	when
O	the
O	leaves
O	are
O	motionless
O	in
O	the
O	noonday
O	heat
O	;
O	then
O	followed
O	notes
O	cool
O	and
O	soft
O	as
O	the
O	drip
O	of
O	summer
O	showers
O	on
O	the
O	parched
O	grass
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	song
O	of
O	the
O	blackbird
O	,
O	sounding
O	as
O	clearly
O	as
O	it
O	sounds
O	in
O	long
O	silent
O	spaces
O	of
O	the
O	evening
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	in
O	one
O	sweet
O	jocund
O	burst
O	the
O	multitudinous
O	voices
O	that
O	hail
O	the
O	breaking
O	of
O	the
O	morn
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	lark
O	,
O	singing
O	and
O	soaring
O	above
O	the
O	minstrel
O	,
O	sank
O	mute
O	and
O	motionless
O	upon
O	his
O	shoulder
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	all
O	the
O	leafy
O	woods
O	the

O	came
O	thronging
O	out
O	and
O	formed
O	a
O	fluttering
O	canopy
O	above
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	bard
O	ceased
O	playing
O	no
O	shout
O	arose
O	from
O	the
O	mighty
O	multitude
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	strains
O	of
O	his
O	harp
O	,
O	long
O	after
O	its
O	chords
O	were
O	stilled
O	,
O	held
O	their
O	hearts
O	spellbound
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	passed
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	mound
O	of
O	contest
O	all
O	knew
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	need
O	to
O	declare
O	the
O	victor
O	.
O	[
O	9
O	]
O	And
O	all
O	were
O	glad
O	the
O	comely
O	Fenian
O	champion
O	had
O	maintained
O	the
O	supremacy
O	of
O	the
O	bards
O	of
O	Erin
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	one
O	heart
O	sad
O	,
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	princess
O	;
O	and
O	now
O	she
O	wished
O	more
O	than
O	ever
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	never
O	made
O	her
O	hateful
O	vow
O	.
O	Other
O	contests
O	went
O	on
O	,
O	but
O	Fergus
O	took
O	no
O	interest
O	in
O	them
O	;
O	and
O	once
O	more
O	he
O	stole
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	forest
O	glade
O	.
O	His
O	heart
O	was
O	sorrowful
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	race
O	of
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	hope
O	to
O	compete
O	with
O	the
O	rider
O	of
O	the
O	white

O	lay
O	beneath
O	the
O	spreading
O	branches
O	during
O	the
O	whole
O	night
O	long

O	of
O	the
O	victory
O	he
O	had
O	won
O	,
O	but
O	of
O	the

O	was
O	as
O	far
O	away
O	from
O	him
O	as

O	passed
O	the

O	without

O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	morning
O	came
O	he
O	rose
O	and
O	walked
O	aimlessly
O	through
O	the
O	woods
O	.
O	A
O	deer
O	starting
O	from
O	a

O	reminded
O	him
O	of

O	boyhood
O	,
O	and
O	once

O	followed
O	the
O	deer
O	wistfully
O	,
O	suddenly

O	started
O	in
O	amazement
O	.
