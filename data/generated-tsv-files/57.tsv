O	Perilous
O	circumstances
O	,
O	from
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	already
O	escaped
O	,
O	inspired
O	me
O	with
O	a
O	strong
O	impulse
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	some
O	time
O	recover
O	my
O	liberty
O	,
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	impossible
O	to
O	conjecture
O	by
O	what
O	means
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	form
O	any
O	project
O	with
O	the
O	least
O	hope
O	of
O	succeeding
O	.
O	The
O	ship
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	sailed
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	known
O	to
O	be
O	driven
O	within
O	sight
O	of
O	that
O	coast
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	given
O	strict
O	orders
O	,
O	that
O	if
O	at
O	any
O	time
O	another
O	appeared
O	,
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	taken
O	ashore
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	all
O	its
O	crew
O	and
O	passengers
O	brought
O	in
O	a
O	tumbrel
O	to
O	Lorbrulgrud
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	indeed
O	treated
O	with
O	much
O	kindness
O	:
O	I
O	was
O	the
O	favorite
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	delight
O	of
O	the
O	whole
O	court;
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	upon
O	such
O	a
O	foot
O	as
O	ill
O	became
O	the
O	dignity
O	of
O	human-kind
O	.
O	I
O	could
O	never
O	forget
O	these
O	domestic
O	pledges
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	behind
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	wanted
O	to
O	be
O	among
O	people
O	with
O	whom
O	I
O	could
O	converse
O	upon
O	even
O	terms
O	,
O	and
O	walk
O	about
O	the
O	streets
O	and
O	fields
O	without
O	being
O	afraid
O	of
O	being
O	trod
O	to
O	death
O	like
O	a
O	frog
O	or
O	a
O	young
O	puppy
O	.
O	But
O	my
O	deliverance
O	came
O	sooner
O	than
O	I
O	expected
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	manner
O	not
O	very
O	common
O	:
O	the
O	whole
O	story
O	and
O	circumstances
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	shall
O	faithfully
O	relate
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	now
O	been
O	two
O	years
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	:
O	and
O	about
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	the
O	third
O	,
O	Glumdalclitch
O	and
O	I
O	attended
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	progress
O	to
O	the
O	south
O	coast
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	carried
O	as
O	usual
O	,
O	in
O	my
O	travelling
O	box
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	already
O	described
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	convenient
O	closet
O	of
O	twelve
O	feet
O	wide
O	.
O	And
O	I
O	had
O	ordered
O	a
O	hammock
O	to
O	be
O	fixed
O	,
O	by
O	silken
O	ropes
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	four
O	corners
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	to
O	break
O	the
O	jolts
O	when
O	a
O	servant
O	carried
O	me
O	before
O	him
O	on
O	horseback
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	sometimes
O	desired;
O	and
O	would
O	often
O	sleep
O	in
O	my
O	hammock
O	,
O	while
O	we
O	were
O	upon
O	the
O	road
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	my
O	closet
O	,
O	not
O	directly
O	over
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	hammock
O	,
O	I
O	ordered
O	the
O	joiner
O	to
O	cut
O	a
O	hole
O	of
O	a
O	foot
O	square
O	,
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	air
O	in
O	hot
O	weather
O	as
O	I
O	slept;
O	which
O	hole
O	I
O	shut
O	at
O	pleasure
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	board
O	that
O	drew
O	backward
O	and
O	forward
O	through
O	a
O	groove
O	.
O	When
O	we
O	came
O	to
O	our
O	journey
O	'
O	s
O	end
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	thought
O	proper
O	to
O	pass
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	at
O	a
O	palace
O	he
O	has
O	near
O	Flanflasnic
O	,
O	a
O	city
O	within
O	eighteen
O	English
O	miles
O	of
O	the
O	seaside
O	.
O	Glumdalclitch
O	and
O	I
O	were
O	much
O	fatigued
O	:
O	I
O	had
O	gotten
O	a
O	small
O	cold
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	poor
O	girl
O	was
O	so
O	ill
O	as
O	to
O	be
O	confined
O	to
O	her
O	chamber
O	.
O	I
O	longed
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	ocean
O	,
O	which
O	must
O	be
O	the
O	only
O	scene
O	of
O	my
O	escape
O	,
O	if
O	ever
O	it
O	should
O	happen
O	.
O	I
O	pretended
O	to
O	be
O	worse
O	than
O	I
O	really
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	desired
O	leave
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	fresh
O	air
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	page
O	whom
O	I
O	was
O	very
O	fond
O	of
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	had
O	sometimes
O	been
O	trusted
O	with
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	shall
O	never
O	forget
O	with
O	what
O	unwillingness
O	Glumdalclitch
O	consented
O	,
O	nor
O	the
O	strict
O	charge
O	she
O	gave
O	the
O	page
O	to
O	be
O	careful
O	of
O	me
O	,
O	bursting
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	into
O	a
O	flood
O	of
O	tears
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	some
O	foreboding
O	of
O	what
O	was
O	to
O	happen
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	took
O	me
O	out
O	in
O	my
O	box
O	,
O	about
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	'
O	s
O	walk
O	from
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	toward
O	the
O	rocks
O	on
O	the
O	sea-shore
O	.
O	I
O	ordered
O	him
O	to
O	set
O	me
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	lifting
O	up
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	sashes
O	,
O	cast
O	many
O	a
O	wistful
O	melancholy
O	look
O	toward
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	not
O	very
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	the
O	page
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	mind
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	nap
O	in
O	my
O	hammock
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	hoped
O	would
O	do
O	me
O	good
O	.
O	I
O	got
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boy
O	shut
O	the
O	window
O	close
O	down
O	to
O	keep
O	out
O	the
O	cold
O	.
O	I
O	soon
O	fell
O	asleep
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	I
O	can
O	conjecture
O	is
O	that
O	,
O	while
O	I
O	slept
O	,
O	the
O	page
O	,
O	thinking
O	no
O	danger
O	could
O	happen
O	,
O	went
O	among
O	the
O	rocks
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	birds
O	'
O	eggs
O	,
O	having
O	before
O	observed
O	him
O	from
O	my
O	window
O	searching
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	picking
O	up
O	one
O	or
O	two
O	in
O	the
O	clefts
O	.
O	Be
O	that
O	as
O	it
O	will
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	suddenly
O	awakened
O	with
O	a
O	violent
O	pull
O	upon
O	the
O	ring
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	fastened
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	my
O	box
O	for
O	the
O	convenience
O	of
O	carriage
O	.
O	I
O	felt
O	my
O	box
O	raised
O	very
O	high
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	borne
O	forward
O	with
O	prodigious
O	speed
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	jolt
O	had
O	like
O	to
O	have
O	shaken
O	me
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	hammock
O	,
O	but
O	afterward
O	the
O	motion
O	was
O	easy
O	enough
O	.
O	I
O	called
O	out
O	several
O	times
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	raise
O	my
O	voice
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	to
O	no
O	purpose
O	.
O	I
O	looked
O	toward
O	my
O	windows
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	see
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	clouds
O	and
O	sky
O	.
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	noise
O	over
O	my
O	head
O	,
O	like
O	the
O	clapping
O	of
O	wings
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	began
O	to
O	perceive
O	the
O	woful
O	condition
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	:
O	that
O	some
O	eagle
O	had
O	got
O	the
O	cord
O	of
O	my
O	box
O	in
O	his
O	beak
O	,
O	with
O	an
O	intent
O	to
O	let
O	it
O	fall
O	on
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	tortoise
O	in
O	a
O	shell
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	pick
O	out
O	my
O	body
O	and
O	devour
O	it
O	:
O	for
O	the
O	sagacity
O	and
O	smell
O	of
O	this
O	bird
O	enable
O	him
O	to
O	discover
O	his
O	quarry
O	at
O	a
O	great
O	distance
O	,
O	though
O	better
O	concealed
O	than
O	I
O	could
O	be
O	within
O	a
O	two-inch
O	board
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	I
O	observed
O	the
O	noise
O	and
O	flutter
O	of
O	wings
O	to
O	increase
O	very
O	fast
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	box
O	was
O	tossed
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	sign
O	on
O	a
O	windy
O	day
O	.
O	I
O	heard
O	several
O	bangs
O	or
O	buffets
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	thought
O	,
O	given
O	to
O	the
O	eagle
O	(
O	for
O	such
O	I
O	am
O	certain
O	it
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	that
O	held
O	the
O	cord
O	of
O	my
O	box
O	in
O	his
O	beak
O	)
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	all
O	on
O	a
O	sudden
O	,
O	felt
O	myself
O	falling
O	perpendicularly
O	down
O	,
O	for
O	above
O	a
O	minute
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	such
O	incredible
O	swiftness
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	almost
O	lost
O	my
O	breath
O	.
O	My
O	fall
O	was
O	stopped
O	by
O	a
O	terrible
O	squash
O	,
O	that
O	sounded
O	louder
O	to
O	my
O	ears
O	than
O	the
O	cataract
O	of
O	Niagara;
O	after
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	quite
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	for
O	another
O	minute
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	my
O	box
O	began
O	to
O	rise
O	so
O	high
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	see
O	light
O	from
O	the
O	tops
O	of
O	the
O	windows
O	.
O	I
O	now
O	perceived
O	I
O	was
O	fallen
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	My
O	box
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	weight
O	of
O	my
O	body
O	,
O	the
O	goods
O	that
O	were
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	broad
O	plates
O	of
O	iron
O	fixed
O	for
O	strength
O	at
O	the
O	four
O	corners
O	of
O	the
O	top
O	and
O	bottom
O	,
O	floated
O	about
O	five
O	feet
O	deep
O	in
O	water
O	.
O	I
O	did
O	then
O	,
O	and
O	do
O	now
O	suppose
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	eagle
O	which
O	flew
O	away
O	with
O	my
O	box
O	was
O	pursued
O	by
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	others
O	,
O	and
O	forced
O	to
O	let
O	me
O	drop
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	defended
O	himself
O	against
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	who
O	hoped
O	to
O	share
O	in
O	the
O	prey
O	.
O	The
O	plates
O	of
O	iron
O	fastened
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	box
O	(
O	for
O	those
O	were
O	the
O	strongest
O	)
O	preserved
O	the
O	balance
O	while
O	it
O	fell
O	,
O	and
O	hindered
O	it
O	from
O	being
O	broken
O	on
O	the
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	Every
O	joint
O	of
O	it
O	was
O	well
O	grooved;
O	and
O	the
O	door
O	did
O	not
O	move
O	on
O	hinges
O	,
O	but
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	like
O	a
O	sash
O	,
O	which
O	kept
O	my
O	closet
O	so
O	tight
O	that
O	very
O	little
O	water
O	came
O	in
O	.
O	I
O	got
O	with
O	much
O	difficulty
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	hammock
O	,
O	having
O	first
O	ventured
O	to
O	draw
O	back
O	the
O	slip-board
O	on
O	the
O	roof
O	already
O	mentioned
O	,
O	contrived
O	on
O	purpose
O	to
O	let
O	in
O	air
O	,
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	almost
O	stifled
O	.
O	How
O	often
O	did
O	I
O	then
O	wish
O	myself
O	with
O	my
O	dear
O	Glumdalclitch
O	,
O	from
O	whom
O	one
O	single
O	hour
O	had
O	so
O	far
O	divided
O	me
O	!
O	And
O	I
O	may
O	say
O	with
O	truth
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	misfortunes
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	forbear
O	lamenting
O	my
O	poor
O	nurse
O	,
O	the
O	grief
O	she
O	would
O	suffer
O	for
O	my
O	loss
O	,
O	the
O	displeasure
O	of
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	ruin
O	of
O	her
O	fortune
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	many
O	travellers
O	have
O	not
O	been
O	under
O	greater
O	difficulties
O	and
O	distress
O	than
O	I
O	was
O	at
O	this
O	juncture
O	,
O	expecting
O	every
O	moment
O	to
O	see
O	my
O	box
O	dashed
O	to
O	pieces
O	,
O	or
O	at
O	least
O	overset
O	by
O	the
O	first
O	violent
O	blast
O	or
O	rising
O	wave
O	.
O	A
O	breach
O	in
O	one
O	single
O	pane
O	of
O	glass
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	immediate
O	death
O	:
O	nor
O	could
O	anything
O	have
O	preserved
O	the
O	windows
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	strong
O	lattice
O	wires
O	placed
O	on
O	the
O	outside
O	,
O	against
O	accidents
O	in
O	travelling
O	.
O	I
O	saw
O	the
O	water
O	ooze
O	in
O	at
O	several
O	crannies
O	,
O	although
O	the
O	leaks
O	were
O	not
O	considerable
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	endeavored
O	to
O	stop
O	them
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	lift
O	up
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	my
O	closet
O	,
O	which
O	otherwise
O	I
O	certainly
O	should
O	have
O	done
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	it
O	:
O	where
O	I
O	might
O	at
O	least
O	preserve
O	myself
O	some
O	hours
O	longer
O	,
O	than
O	by
O	being
O	shut
O	up
O	(
O	as
O	I
O	may
O	call
O	it
O	)
O	in
O	the
O	hold
O	.
O	Or
O	if
O	I
O	escaped
O	these
O	dangers
O	for
O	a
O	day
O	or
O	two
O	,
O	what
O	could
O	I
O	expect
O	but
O	a
O	miserable
O	death
O	of
O	cold
O	and
O	hunger
O	?
O	I
O	was
O	for
O	four
O	hours
O	under
O	these
O	circumstances
O	,
O	expecting
O	,
O	and
O	indeed
O	wishing
O	,
O	every
O	moment
O	to
O	be
O	my
O	last
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	already
O	told
O	the
O	reader
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	two
O	strong
O	staples
O	fixed
O	upon
O	that
O	side
O	of
O	my
O	box
O	which
O	had
O	no
O	window;
O	and
O	into
O	which
O	the
O	servant
O	who
O	used
O	to
O	carry
O	me
O	on
O	horseback
O	would
O	put
O	a
O	leathern
O	belt
O	,
O	and
O	buckle
O	it
O	about
O	his
O	waist
O	.
O	Being
O	in
O	this
O	disconsolate
O	state
O	,
O	I
O	heard
O	,
O	or
O	at
O	least
O	thought
O	I
O	heard
O	,
O	some
O	kind
O	of
O	grating
O	noise
O	on
O	that
O	side
O	of
O	my
O	box
O	where
O	the
O	staples
O	were
O	fixed;
O	and
O	soon
O	after
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	fancy
O	that
O	the
O	box
O	was
O	pulled
O	or
O	towed
O	along
O	the
O	sea;
O	for
O	I
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	felt
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	tugging
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	the
O	waves
O	rise
O	near
O	the
O	tops
O	of
O	my
O	windows
O	,
O	leaving
O	me
O	almost
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	.
O	This
O	gave
O	me
O	some
O	faint
O	hopes
O	of
O	relief
O	,
O	although
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	imagine
O	how
O	it
O	could
O	be
O	brought
O	about
O	.
O	I
O	ventured
O	to
O	unscrew
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	chairs
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	always
O	fastened
O	to
O	the
O	floor;
O	and
O	having
O	made
O	a
O	hard
O	shift
O	to
O	screw
O	it
O	down
O	again
O	directly
O	under
O	the
O	shipping-board
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	lately
O	opened
O	,
O	I
O	mounted
O	on
O	the
O	chair
O	,
O	and
O	putting
O	my
O	mouth
O	as
O	near
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	to
O	the
O	hole
O	,
O	I
O	called
O	for
O	help
O	in
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	languages
O	I
O	understood
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	fastened
O	my
O	handkerchief
O	to
O	a
O	stick
O	I
O	usually
O	carried
O	,
O	and
O	thrusting
O	it
O	up
O	the
O	hole
O	,
O	waved
O	it
O	several
O	times
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	that
O	if
O	any
O	boat
O	or
O	ship
O	was
O	near
O	,
O	the
O	seamen
O	might
O	conjecture
O	some
O	unhappy
O	mortal
O	to
O	be
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	box
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	no
O	effect
O	from
O	all
O	I
O	could
O	do
O	,
O	but
O	plainly
O	perceived
O	my
O	closet
O	to
O	be
O	moved
O	along;
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	space
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	,
O	or
O	better
O	,
O	that
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	box
O	where
O	the
O	staples
O	were
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	no
O	windows
O	,
O	struck
O	against
O	something
O	that
O	was
O	hard
O	.
O	I
O	apprehended
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	myself
O	tossed
O	more
O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	I
O	plainly
O	heard
O	a
O	noise
O	upon
O	the
O	cover
O	of
O	my
O	closet
O	,
O	like
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	cable
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	grating
O	of
O	it
O	as
O	it
O	passed
O	through
O	the
O	ring
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	found
O	myself
O	hoisted
O	up
O	by
O	degrees
O	,
O	at
O	least
O	three
O	feet
O	higher
O	than
O	I
O	was
O	before
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	I
O	again
O	thrust
O	up
O	my
O	stick
O	and
O	handkerchief
O	,
O	calling
O	for
O	help
O	till
O	I
O	was
O	almost
O	hoarse
O	.
O	In
O	return
O	to
O	which
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	great
O	shout
O	repeated
O	three
O	times
O	,
O	giving
O	me
O	such
O	transports
O	of
O	joy
O	as
O	are
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	conceived
O	but
O	by
O	those
O	who
O	feel
O	them
O	.
O	I
O	now
O	heard
O	a
O	trampling
O	over
O	my
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	somebody
O	calling
O	through
O	the
O	hole
O	with
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	English
O	tongue
O	,
O	If
O	there
O	be
O	anybody
O	below
O	,
O	let
O	them
O	speak
O	.
O	I
O	answered
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	an
O	Englishman
O	,
O	drawn
O	by
O	ill
O	fortune
O	into
O	the
O	greatest
O	calamity
O	that
O	ever
O	any
O	creature
O	underwent
O	,
O	and
O	begged
O	,
O	by
O	all
O	that
O	was
O	moving
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	delivered
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	dungeon
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	.
O	The
O	voice
O	replied
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	safe
O	,
O	for
O	my
O	box
O	was
O	fastened
O	to
O	their
O	ship;
O	and
O	the
O	carpenter
O	should
O	immediately
O	come
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	cover
O	,
O	large
O	enough
O	to
O	pull
O	me
O	out
O	.
O	I
O	answered
O	that
O	was
O	needless
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	take
O	up
O	too
O	much
O	time;
O	for
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	more
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	,
O	but
O	let
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	crew
O	put
O	his
O	finger
O	into
O	the
O	ring
O	,
O	and
O	take
O	the
O	box
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	into
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	into
O	the
O	captain
O	'
O	s
O	cabin
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	upon
O	hearing
O	me
O	talk
O	so
O	wildly
O	,
O	thought
O	I
O	was
O	mad;
O	others
O	laughed;
O	for
O	indeed
O	it
O	never
O	came
O	into
O	my
O	head
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	now
O	got
O	among
O	people
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	stature
O	and
O	strength
O	.
O	The
O	carpenter
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	sawed
O	a
O	passage
O	about
O	four
O	feet
O	square
O	,
O	then
O	let
O	down
O	a
O	small
O	ladder
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	I
O	mounted
O	,
O	and
O	thence
O	was
O	taken
O	into
O	the
O	ship
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	weak
O	condition
O	.
O	The
O	sailors
O	were
O	all
O	amazement
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	me
O	a
O	thousand
O	questions
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	inclination
O	to
O	answer
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	equally
O	confounded
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	so
O	many
O	pygmies
O	,
O	for
O	such
O	I
O	took
O	them
O	to
O	be
O	,
O	after
O	having
O	so
O	long
O	accustomed
O	mine
O	eyes
O	to
O	the
O	monstrous
O	objects
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	Thomas
O	Wilcocks
O	,
O	an
O	honest
O	worthy
O	Shropshire
O	man
O	,
O	observing
O	I
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	faint
O	,
O	took
O	me
O	into
O	his
O	cabin
O	,
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	cordial
O	to
O	comfort
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	me
O	turn
O	in
O	upon
O	his
O	own
O	bed
O	,
O	advising
O	me
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	little
O	rest
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	great
O	need
O	.
O	Before
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	I
O	gave
O	him
O	to
O	understand
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	some
O	valuable
O	furniture
O	in
O	my
O	box
O	,
O	too
O	good
O	to
O	be
O	lost
O	:
O	a
O	fine
O	hammock
O	,
O	a
O	handsome
O	field-bed
O	,
O	two
O	chairs
O	,
O	a
O	table
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	cabinet;
O	that
O	my
O	closet
O	was
O	hung
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	,
O	or
O	rather
O	quilted
O	,
O	with
O	silk
O	and
O	cotton;
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	let
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	crew
O	bring
O	my
O	closet
O	into
O	his
O	cabin
O	I
O	would
O	open
O	it
O	there
O	before
O	him
O	and
O	show
O	him
O	my
O	goods
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	,
O	hearing
O	me
O	utter
O	these
O	absurdities
O	,
O	concluded
O	I
O	was
O	raving;
O	however
O	(
O	I
O	suppose
O	to
O	pacify
O	me
O	)
O	,
O	he
O	promised
O	to
O	give
O	order
O	as
O	I
O	desired
O	,
O	and
O	going
O	upon
O	deck
O	,
O	sent
O	some
O	of
O	his
O	men
O	down
O	into
O	my
O	closet
O	,
O	whence
O	(
O	as
O	I
O	afterward
O	found
O	)
O	they
O	drew
O	up
O	all
O	my
O	goods
O	,
O	and
O	stripped
O	off
O	the
O	quilting;
O	but
O	the
O	chairs
O	,
O	cabinet
O	,
O	and
O	bedstead
O	,
O	being
O	screwed
O	to
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	were
O	much
O	damaged
O	by
O	the
O	ignorance
O	of
O	the
O	seamen
O	,
O	who
O	tore
O	them
O	up
O	by
O	force
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	knocked
O	off
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	boards
O	for
O	the
O	use
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	got
O	all
O	they
O	had
O	a
O	mind
O	for
O	,
O	let
O	the
O	hull
O	drop
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	many
O	breaches
O	made
O	in
O	the
O	bottom
O	and
O	sides
O	,
O	sunk
O	outright
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	glad
O	not
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	spectator
O	of
O	the
O	havoc
O	they
O	made;
O	because
O	I
O	am
O	confident
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	sensibly
O	touched
O	me
O	,
O	by
O	bringing
O	former
O	passages
O	into
O	my
O	mind
O	which
O	I
O	would
O	rather
O	have
O	forgot
O	.
O	I
O	slept
O	some
O	hours
O	,
O	but
O	perpetually
O	disturbed
O	with
O	dreams
O	of
O	the
O	place
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dangers
O	I
O	had
O	escaped
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	upon
O	waking
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	much
O	recovered
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	now
O	about
O	eight
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	ordered
O	supper
O	immediately
O	,
O	thinking
O	I
O	had
O	already
O	fasted
O	too
O	long
O	.
O	He
O	entertained
O	me
O	with
O	great
O	kindness
O	,
O	observing
O	me
O	not
O	to
O	look
O	wildly
O	or
O	talk
O	inconsistently;
O	and
O	when
O	we
O	were
O	left
O	alone
O	,
O	desired
O	I
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	a
O	relation
O	of
O	my
O	travels;
O	and
O	by
O	what
O	accident
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	be
O	set
O	adrift
O	in
O	that
O	monstrous
O	wooden
O	chest
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	that
O	about
O	twelve
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	at
O	noon
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	looking
O	through
O	his
O	glass
O	,
O	he
O	spied
O	it
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	sail
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	mind
O	to
O	make
O	,
O	being
O	not
O	much
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	course
O	,
O	in
O	hopes
O	of
O	buying
O	some
O	biscuit
O	,
O	his
O	own
O	beginning
O	to
O	fall
O	short
O	.
O	That
O	upon
O	coming
O	nearer
O	,
O	and
O	finding
O	his
O	error
O	,
O	he
O	sent
O	out
O	his
O	long-boat
O	,
O	to
O	discover
O	what
O	it
O	was;
O	that
O	his
O	men
O	came
O	back
O	in
O	fright
O	,
O	swearing
O	they
O	had
O	seen
O	a
O	swimming
O	house
O	.
O	That
O	he
O	laughed
O	at
O	their
O	folly
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	ordering
O	his
O	men
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	strong
O	cable
O	along
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	That
O	the
O	weather
O	being
O	calm
O	,
O	he
O	rowed
O	round
O	me
O	several
O	times
O	,
O	observed
O	my
O	windows
O	and
O	wire
O	lattices
O	that
O	defended
O	them
O	.
O	That
O	he
O	discovered
O	two
O	staples
O	upon
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	all
O	of
O	boards
O	,
O	without
O	any
O	passage
O	for
O	light
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	commanded
O	his
O	men
O	to
O	row
O	up
O	to
O	that
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	fastening
O	a
O	cable
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	staples
O	,
O	ordered
O	them
O	to
O	tow
O	my
O	chest
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	called
O	it
O	,
O	toward
O	the
O	ship
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	there
O	he
O	gave
O	directions
O	to
O	fasten
O	another
O	cable
O	to
O	the
O	ring
O	fixed
O	in
O	the
O	cover
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	raise
O	up
O	my
O	chest
O	with
O	pulleys
O	,
O	which
O	all
O	the
O	sailors
O	were
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	do
O	above
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	feet
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	they
O	saw
O	my
O	stick
O	and
O	handkerchief
O	thrust
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	hole
O	,
O	and
O	concluded
O	that
O	some
O	unhappy
O	man
O	must
O	be
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	cavity
O	.
O	I
O	asked
O	whether
O	he
O	or
O	the
O	crew
O	had
O	seen
O	any
O	prodigious
O	birds
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	about
O	the
O	time
O	he
O	first
O	discovered
O	me
O	?
O	To
O	which
O	he
O	answered
O	,
O	that
O	discoursing
O	this
O	matter
O	with
O	the
O	sailors
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	asleep
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	said
O	he
O	had
O	observed
O	three
O	eagles
O	flying
O	toward
O	the
O	north
O	,
O	but
O	remarked
O	nothing
O	of
O	their
O	being
O	larger
O	than
O	the
O	usual
O	size;
O	which
O	I
O	suppose
O	must
O	be
O	imputed
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	height
O	they
O	were
O	at;
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	guess
O	the
O	reason
O	of
O	my
O	question
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	asked
O	the
O	captain
O	how
O	far
O	he
O	reckoned
O	we
O	might
O	be
O	from
O	land
O	?
O	He
O	said
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	best
O	computation
O	he
O	could
O	make
O	,
O	we
O	were
O	at
O	least
O	a
O	hundred
O	leagues
O	.
O	I
O	assured
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	be
O	mistaken
O	by
O	almost
O	half
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	left
O	the
O	country
O	whence
O	I
O	came
O	above
O	two
O	hours
O	before
O	I
O	dropped
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	he
O	began
O	again
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	my
O	brain
O	was
O	disturbed
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	hint
O	,
O	and
O	advised
O	me
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	bed
O	in
O	a
O	cabin
O	he
O	had
O	provided
O	.
O	I
O	assured
O	him
O	I
O	was
O	well
O	refreshed
O	with
O	his
O	good
O	entertainment
O	and
O	company
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	much
O	in
O	my
O	senses
O	as
O	ever
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	my
O	life
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	grew
O	serious
O	,
O	and
O	desired
O	to
O	ask
O	me
O	freely
O	whether
O	I
O	were
O	not
O	troubled
O	in
O	my
O	mind
O	by
O	the
O	consciousness
O	of
O	some
O	enormous
O	crime
O	,
O	for
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	punished
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	command
O	of
O	some
O	prince
O	,
O	by
O	exposing
O	me
O	in
O	that
O	chest;
O	as
O	great
O	criminals
O	,
O	in
O	other
O	countries
O	,
O	have
O	been
O	forced
O	to
O	sea
O	in
O	a
O	leaky
O	vessel
O	without
O	provisions
O	:
O	for
O	although
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	sorry
O	to
O	have
O	taken
O	so
O	ill
O	a
O	man
O	into
O	his
O	ship
O	,
O	yet
O	he
O	would
O	engage
O	his
O	word
O	to
O	set
O	me
O	safe
O	ashore
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	port
O	where
O	we
O	arrived
O	?
O	He
O	added
O	that
O	his
O	suspicions
O	were
O	much
O	increased
O	by
O	some
O	very
O	absurd
O	speeches
O	I
O	had
O	delivered
O	at
O	first
O	to
O	his
O	sailors
O	,
O	and
O	afterward
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	in
O	relation
O	to
O	my
O	closet
O	or
O	chest
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	by
O	my
O	odd
O	looks
O	and
O	behavior
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	at
O	supper
O	.
O	I
O	begged
O	his
O	patience
O	to
O	hear
O	me
O	tell
O	my
O	story
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	faithfully
O	did
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	last
O	time
O	I
O	left
O	England
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	moment
O	he
O	first
O	discovered
O	me
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	truth
O	always
O	forces
O	its
O	way
O	into
O	rational
O	minds
O	,
O	so
O	this
O	honest
O	worthy
O	gentleman
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	some
O	tincture
O	of
O	learning
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	good
O	sense
O	,
O	was
O	immediately
O	convinced
O	of
O	my
O	candor
O	and
O	veracity
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	further
O	to
O	confirm
O	all
O	I
O	had
O	said
O	,
O	I
O	entreated
O	him
O	to
O	give
O	order
O	that
O	my
O	cabinet
O	should
O	be
O	brought
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	key
O	in
O	my
O	pocket;
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	already
O	informed
O	me
O	how
O	the
O	seamen
O	disposed
O	of
O	my
O	closet
O	.
O	I
O	opened
O	it
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	presence
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	him
O	the
O	small
O	collection
O	of
O	rarities
O	I
O	made
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	from
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	strangely
O	delivered
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	the
O	comb
O	I
O	had
O	contrived
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	stumps
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	beard
O	,
O	and
O	another
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	materials
O	,
O	but
O	fixed
O	into
O	a
O	paring
O	of
O	her
O	Majesty
O	'
O	s
O	thumb-nail
O	,
O	which
O	served
O	for
O	the
O	back
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	collection
O	of
O	needles
O	and
O	pins
O	,
O	from
O	a
O	foot
O	to
O	half
O	a
O	yard
O	long;
O	four
O	wasp
O	stings
O	,
O	like
O	joiners
O	'
O	tacks;
O	some
O	combings
O	of
O	the
O	queen
O	'
O	s
O	hair;
O	a
O	gold
O	ring
O	which
O	one
O	day
O	she
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	present
O	of
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	most
O	obliging
O	manner
O	,
O	taking
O	it
O	from
O	her
O	little
O	finger
O	and
O	throwing
O	it
O	over
O	my
O	head
O	like
O	a
O	collar
O	.
O	I
O	desired
O	the
O	captain
O	would
O	please
O	to
O	accept
O	this
O	ring
O	in
O	return
O	of
O	his
O	civilities
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	absolutely
O	refused
O	.
O	I
O	showed
O	him
O	a
O	corn
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	cut
O	off
O	,
O	with
O	my
O	own
O	hand
O	,
O	from
O	a
O	maid
O	of
O	honor
O	'
O	s
O	toe;
O	it
O	was
O	about
O	the
O	bigness
O	of
O	a
O	Kentish
O	pippin
O	,
O	and
O	grown
O	so
O	hard
O	that
O	when
O	I
O	returned
O	to
O	England
O	I
O	got
O	it
O	hollowed
O	into
O	a
O	cup
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	it
O	in
O	silver
O	.
O	Lastly
O	,
O	I
O	desired
O	him
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	breeches
O	I
O	had
O	then
O	on
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	made
O	of
O	a
O	mouse
O	'
O	s
O	skin
O	.
O	I
O	could
O	force
O	nothing
O	on
O	him
O	but
O	a
O	footman
O	'
O	s
O	tooth
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	observed
O	him
O	to
O	examine
O	with
O	great
O	curiosity
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	fancy
O	for
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	received
O	it
O	with
O	abundance
O	of
O	thanks
O	,
O	more
O	than
O	such
O	a
O	trifle
O	could
O	deserve
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	drawn
O	by
O	an
O	unskilful
O	surgeon
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	mistake
O	,
O	from
O	one
O	of
O	Glumdalclitch
O	'
O	s
O	men
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	afflicted
O	with
O	the
O	toothache
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	sound
O	as
O	any
O	in
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	I
O	got
O	it
O	cleaned
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	into
O	my
O	cabinet
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	about
O	a
O	foot
O	long
O	and
O	four
O	inches
O	in
O	diameter
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	was
O	very
O	well
O	satisfied
O	with
O	this
O	plain
O	relation
O	I
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	he
O	hoped
O	,
O	when
O	we
O	returned
O	to
O	England
O	,
O	I
O	would
O	oblige
O	the
O	world
O	by
O	putting
O	it
O	on
O	paper
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	it
O	public
O	.
O	My
O	answer
O	was
O	that
O	I
O	thought
O	we
O	were
O	overstocked
O	with
O	books
O	of
O	travels;
O	that
O	nothing
O	could
O	now
O	pass
O	which
O	was
O	not
O	extraordinary;
O	wherein
O	I
O	doubted
O	some
O	authors
O	less
O	consulted
O	truth
O	than
O	their
O	own
O	vanity
O	,
O	or
O	interest
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	diversion
O	of
O	ignorant
O	readers;
O	that
O	my
O	story
O	could
O	contain
O	little
O	besides
O	common
O	events
O	,
O	without
O	those
O	ornamented
O	descriptions
O	of
O	strange
O	plants
O	,
O	trees
O	,
O	birds
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	animals;
O	or
O	of
O	the
O	barbarous
O	customs
O	and
O	idolatry
O	of
O	savage
O	people
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	most
O	writers
O	abound
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	I
O	thanked
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	good
O	opinion
O	,
O	and
O	promised
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	matter
O	into
O	my
O	thoughts
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	he
O	wondered
O	at
O	one
O	thing
O	very
O	much
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	to
O	hear
O	me
O	speak
O	so
O	loud;
O	asking
O	me
O	whether
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	of
O	that
O	country
O	were
O	thick
O	of
O	hearing
O	?
O	I
O	told
O	him
O	it
O	was
O	what
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	used
O	to
O	for
O	above
O	two
O	years
O	past
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	admired
O	as
O	much
O	at
O	the
O	voices
O	of
O	him
O	and
O	his
O	men
O	,
O	who
O	seemed
O	to
O	me
O	only
O	to
O	whisper
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	I
O	could
O	hear
O	them
O	well
O	enough
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	I
O	spoke
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	it
O	was
O	like
O	a
O	man
O	talking
O	in
O	the
O	streets
O	to
O	another
O	looking
O	out
O	from
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	steeple
O	,
O	unless
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	placed
O	on
O	a
O	table
O	or
O	held
O	in
O	any
O	person
O	'
O	s
O	hand
O	.
O	I
O	told
O	him
O	I
O	had
O	likewise
O	observed
O	another
O	thing
O	,
O	that
O	when
O	I
O	first
O	got
O	into
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sailors
O	stood
O	all
O	about
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	they
O	were
O	the
O	most
O	contemptible
O	little
O	creatures
O	I
O	had
O	ever
O	beheld
O	.
O	For
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	that
O	prince
O	'
O	s
O	country
O	,
O	I
O	could
O	never
O	endure
O	to
O	look
O	in
O	a
O	glass
O	after
O	mine
O	eyes
O	had
O	been
O	accustomed
O	to
O	such
O	prodigious
O	objects
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	comparisons
O	gave
O	me
O	so
O	despicable
O	a
O	conceit
O	of
O	myself
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	said
O	that
O	while
O	we
O	were
O	at
O	supper
O	he
O	observed
O	me
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	everything
O	with
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	wonder
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	often
O	seemed
O	hardly
O	able
O	to
O	contain
O	my
O	laughter
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	well
O	how
O	to
O	take
O	,
O	but
O	imputed
O	it
O	to
O	some
O	disorder
O	in
O	my
O	brain
O	.
O	I
O	answered
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	true;
O	and
O	I
O	wondered
O	how
O	I
O	could
O	forbear
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	saw
O	his
O	dishes
O	of
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	a
O	silver
O	threepence
O	,
O	a
O	leg
O	of
O	pork
O	hardly
O	a
O	mouthful
O	,
O	a
O	cup
O	not
O	so
O	big
O	as
O	a
O	nutshell;
O	and
O	so
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	,
O	describing
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	his
O	household
O	stuff
O	and
O	provisions
O	after
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	.
O	For
O	,
O	although
O	the
O	queen
O	had
O	ordered
O	a
O	little
O	equipage
O	of
O	all
O	things
O	necessary
O	for
O	me
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	her
O	service
O	,
O	yet
O	my
O	ideas
O	were
O	wholly
O	taken
O	up
O	with
O	what
O	I
O	saw
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	of
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	winked
O	at
O	my
O	own
O	littleness
O	as
O	people
O	do
O	at
O	their
O	own
O	faults
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	understood
O	my
O	raillery
O	very
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	merrily
O	replied
O	with
O	the
O	old
O	English
O	proverb
O	that
O	he
O	doubted
O	mine
O	eyes
O	were
O	bigger
O	than
O	my
O	belly
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	observe
O	my
O	stomach
O	so
O	good
O	,
O	although
O	I
O	had
O	fasted
O	all
O	day;
O	and
O	,
O	continuing
O	in
O	his
O	mirth
O	,
O	protested
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	gladly
O	given
O	a
O	hundred
O	pounds
O	to
O	have
O	seen
O	my
O	closet
O	in
O	the
O	eagle
O	'
O	s
O	bill
O	,
O	and
O	afterward
O	in
O	its
O	fall
O	from
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	height
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	:
O	which
O	would
O	certainly
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	most
O	astonishing
O	object
O	,
O	worthy
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	description
O	of
O	it
O	transmitted
O	to
O	future
O	ages
O	:
O	and
O	the
O	comparison
O	of
O	Phaeton
O	was
O	so
O	obvious
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	forbear
O	applying
O	it
O	,
O	although
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	much
O	admire
O	the
O	conceit
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	having
O	been
O	at
O	Tonquin
O	,
O	was
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	return
O	to
O	England
O	,
O	driven
O	northeastward
O	to
O	the
O	latitude
O	of
O	44
O	degrees
O	and
O	longitude
O	of
O	143
O	.
O	But
O	meeting
O	a
O	trade-wind
O	two
O	days
O	after
O	I
O	came
O	on
O	board
O	him
O	,
O	we
O	sailed
O	southward
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	coasting
O	New
O	Holland
O	,
O	kept
O	our
O	course
O	west-southwest
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	south-southwest
O	,
O	till
O	we
O	doubled
O	the
O	Cape
O	of
O	Good
O	Hope
O	.
O	Our
O	voyage
O	was
O	very
O	prosperous
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	shall
O	not
O	trouble
O	the
O	reader
O	with
O	a
O	journal
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	called
O	in
O	at
O	one
O	or
O	two
O	ports
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	in
O	his
O	longboat
O	for
O	provisions
O	and
O	fresh
O	water;
O	but
O	I
O	never
O	went
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	till
O	we
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	Downs
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	of
O	June
O	,
O	1706
O	,
O	about
O	nine
O	months
O	after
O	my
O	escape
O	.
O	I
O	offered
O	to
O	leave
O	my
O	goods
O	in
O	security
O	for
O	payment
O	of
O	my
O	freight
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	captain
O	protested
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	receive
O	one
O	farthing
O	.
O	We
O	took
O	a
O	kind
O	leave
O	of
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	made
O	him
O	promise
O	he
O	would
O	come
O	to
O	see
O	me
O	at
O	my
O	house
O	in
O	Redriff
O	.
O	I
O	hired
O	a
O	horse
O	and
O	guide
O	for
O	five
O	shillings
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	borrowed
O	of
O	the
O	captain
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	road
O	,
O	observing
O	the
O	littleness
O	of
O	the
O	houses
O	,
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	the
O	cattle
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	myself
O	in
O	Lilliput
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	trampling
O	on
O	every
O	traveller
O	I
O	met
O	,
O	and
O	often
O	called
O	aloud
O	to
O	them
O	to
O	have
O	them
O	stand
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	like
O	to
O	have
O	gotten
O	one
O	or
O	two
O	broken
O	heads
O	for
O	my
O	impertinence
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	my
O	own
O	house
O	,
O	for
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	inquire
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	servants
O	opening
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	I
O	bent
O	down
O	to
O	go
O	in
O	(
O	like
O	a
O	goose
O	under
O	a
O	gate
O	)
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	striking
O	my
O	head
O	.
O	My
O	wife
O	ran
O	out
O	to
O	embrace
O	me
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	stooped
O	lower
O	than
O	her
O	knees
O	,
O	thinking
O	she
O	could
O	otherwise
O	never
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	reach
O	my
O	mouth
O	.
O	My
O	daughter
O	kneeled
O	to
O	ask
O	my
O	blessing
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	her
O	till
O	she
O	arose
O	,
O	having
O	been
O	so
O	long
O	used
O	to
O	stand
O	with
O	my
O	head
O	and
O	eyes
O	erect
O	to
O	above
O	sixty
O	feet;
O	and
O	then
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	take
O	her
O	up
O	with
O	one
O	hand
O	by
O	the
O	waist
O	.
O	I
O	looked
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	servants
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	or
O	two
O	friends
O	who
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	pygmies
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	a
O	giant
O	.
O	I
O	told
O	my
O	wife
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	too
O	thrifty
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	found
O	she
O	had
O	starved
O	herself
O	and
O	daughter
O	to
O	nothing
O	.
O	In
O	short
O	,
O	I
O	behaved
O	myself
O	so
O	unaccountably
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	of
O	the
O	captain
O	'
O	s
O	opinion
O	when
O	he
O	first
O	saw
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	concluded
O	I
O	had
O	lost
O	my
O	wits
O	.
O	This
O	I
O	mention
O	as
O	an
O	instance
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	power
O	of
O	habit
O	and
O	prejudice
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	I
O	and
O	my
O	family
O	and
O	friends
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	right
O	understanding
O	:
O	but
O	my
O	wife
O	protested
O	I
O	should
O	never
O	go
O	to
O	sea
O	any
O	more;
O	although
O	my
O	evil
O	destiny
O	so
O	ordered
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	power
O	to
O	hinder
O	me
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	reader
O	may
O	know
O	hereafter
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	,
O	I
O	here
O	conclude
O	the
O	Second
O	Part
O	of
O	my
O	unfortunate
O	Voyages
O	.
