O	at

O	Sir

O	asked

O	,
O	and
O	they
O	have
O	made
O	this

O	They
O	hold

O	They

O	the

O	Beau

O	clad
O	himself
O	in

O	to
O	the

O	Lambard

O	made
O	Gyfflet
O	also
O	turn
O	back
O	with
O	the

O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	rode
O	alone
O	into
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	alighted
O	at
O	the
O	great
O	hall
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	minstrels
O	before
O	the

O	a
O	fire
O	burning
O	brightly
O	,

O	Le
O	Beau

O	went
O	further
O	,
O	seeking
O	those

O	he
O	should
O	fight
O	.
O	He
O	peered
O	into
O	all
O	the
O	corners
O	,

O	looked
O	on
O	wondrous
O	pillars

O	;
O	but
O	never
O	a

O	At

O	thus
O	dismayed
O	,
O	believing
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	betrayed
O	by
O	magic
O	,

O	He
O	looked
O	out
O	into
O	a
O	field
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	saw
O	two

O	;
O	their
O	armour

O	But
O	Le
O	Beau

O	was
O	aware

O	bore
O	down

O	with
O	his
O	spear
O	,
O	leaving
O	Mabon
O	where
O	he

O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	to
O	with
O	swords
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	fought
O	,
O	Mabon
O	rose
O	up
O	from

O	But
O	Le

O	fought
O	both
O	,

O	himself
O	back
O	warily
O	.
O	When
O	Irayn
O	saw
O	Mabon
O	,
O	he
O	smote
O	fiercely
O	at
O	Le
O	Beau

O	turned
O	swiftly
O	again
O	to
O	Mabon
O	;
O	and
O	Mabon
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	blow

O	a
O	little
