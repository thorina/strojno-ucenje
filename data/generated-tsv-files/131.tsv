O	Long
O	years
O	ago
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	poor
O	labouring
O	man
O	who
O	never
O	knew
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	sleep
O	in
O	peace
O	.
O	Whether
O	the
O	times
O	were
O	good
O	or
O	bad
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	haunted
O	by
O	fears
O	for
O	the
O	morrow
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	constant
O	worrying
O	caused
O	him
O	to
O	look
O	so
O	thin
O	and
O	worn
O	that
O	the
O	neighbouring
O	farmers
O	hesitated
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	work
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	steady
O	and
O	frugal
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	known
O	to
O	waste
O	his
O	time
O	in
O	the
O	village

O	fact
O	,
O	a
O	worthier
O	man
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	found
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	friends
O	agreed
O	in
O	saying
O	that
O	he
O	certainly
O	deserved
O	success
O	,
O	though
O	this
O	never
O	came
O	his
O	way
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	as

O	sat
O	by

O	,
O	a
O	kindly
O	and
O	charitable
O	doctor
O	from
O	the

O	close
O	by
O	stopped
O	his
O	carriage
O	to
O	ask
O	him
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter
O	.
O	``

O	John

O	things
O	,
O	and
O	words

O	not

O	quickly
O	when
O	one
O	is
O	deeply
O	moved
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	John
O	offered
O	the
O	stranger
O	a
O	tremulous
O	apology
O	for
O	the
O	disappointment
O	he
O	must
O	now
O	be
O	suffering
O	through
O	their
O	innocent
O	mistake
O	.
O	``
O	On
O	the
O	contrary
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	replied
O	warmly
O	,
O	``
O	the
O	lesson
O	that
O	bar
O	has
O	taught
O	me
O	is
O	worth
O	far
O	more
O	than
O	any
O	money
O	that
O	you
O	could
O	give
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	shall
O	make
O	a
O	new
O	start
O	in
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	remembering
O	that
O	we
O	fail
O	through
O	fear
O	,
O	will
O	henceforth
O	bear
O	myself
O	as
O	a
O	brave
O	man
O	should
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	saying
O	,
O	he
O	bade
O	them
O	adieu
O	,
O	and
O	passed
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	fragrant
O	twilight
O	.
