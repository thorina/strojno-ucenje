O	You
O	have
O	heard
O	,
O	I
O	dare
O	say
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	hunter
O	and
O	sportsman
O	'
O	s
O	saint
O	and
O	protector
O	,
O	St
O	.
O	Hubert
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	noble
O	stag
O	which
O	appeared
O	to
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	with
O	the
O	holy
O	cross
O	between
O	his
O	antlers
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	paid
O	my
O	homage
O	to
O	that
O	saint
O	every
O	year
O	in
O	good
O	fellowship
O	,
O	and
O	seen
O	this
O	stag
O	a
O	thousand
O	times
O	,
O	either
O	painted
O	in
O	churches
O	or
O	embroidered
O	in
O	the
O	stars
O	of
O	his
O	knights
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	honor
O	and
O	conscience
O	of
O	a
O	good
O	sportsman
O	,
O	I
O	hardly
O	know
O	whether
O	there
O	may
O	not
O	have
O	been
O	formerly
O	,
O	or
O	whether
O	there
O	are
O	not
O	such
O	crossed
O	stags
O	even
O	at
O	this
O	present
O	day
O	.
O	But
O	let
O	me
O	now
O	relate
O	that
O	which
O	happened
O	to
O	myself
O	some
O	little
O	time
O	ago
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	out
O	shooting
O	all
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	quite
O	expended
O	my
O	powder
O	and
O	shot
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	unexpectedly
O	in
O	presence
O	of
O	a
O	stately
O	stag
O	,
O	looking
O	at
O	me
O	as
O	unconcernedly
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	known
O	of
O	my
O	empty
O	pouches
O	.
O	I
O	charged
O	immediately
O	with
O	powder
O	,
O	and
O	upon
O	it
O	a
O	good
O	handful
O	of
O	cherrystones
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	sucked
O	the
O	fruit
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	the
O	hurry
O	would
O	permit
O	.
O	Thus
O	I
O	let
O	fly
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	hit
O	him
O	just
O	on
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	forehead
O	,
O	between
O	his
O	antlers
O	;
O	it
O	stunned
O	him
O	--
O	he
O	staggered
O	--
O	yet
O	he
O	made
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	lost
O	sight
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	to
O	my
O	chagrin
O	.
O	This
O	happened
O	to
O	me
O	in
O	France
O	.
O	Afterwards
O	I
O	visited
O	Russia
O	,
O	and
O	remained
O	there
O	for
O	about
O	a
O	year
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	there
O	being
O	no
O	immediate
O	prospect
O	of
O	war
O	with
O	Turkey
O	,
O	I
O	returned
O	to
O	France
O	on
O	leave
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	months
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	staying
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	chateau
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	when
O	I
O	had
O	fired
O	off
O	this
O	remarkable
O	charge
O	.
O	We
O	hunted
O	again
O	in
O	the
O	fine
O	forest
O	I
O	had
O	then
O	traversed
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	gay
O	party
O	of
O	French
O	nobles
O	and
O	sportsmen
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	separated
O	myself
O	somewhat
O	from
O	my
O	companions
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	opening
O	of
O	a
O	beautiful
O	glade
O	,
O	I
O	beheld
O	a
O	noble
O	stag
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	fine
O	full-grown
O	cherry-tree
O	above
O	ten
O	feet
O	high
O	between
O	his
O	antlers
O	.
O	I
O	immediately
O	recollected
O	my
O	former
O	adventure
O	,
O	looked
O	upon
O	him
O	as
O	my
O	property
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	by
O	one
O	shot
O	,
O	which
O	at
O	once
O	gave
O	me
O	the
O	haunch
O	and
O	cherry
O	sauce
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	tree
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	the
O	richest
O	fruit
O	,
O	the
O	like
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	never
O	tasted
O	before
O	.
