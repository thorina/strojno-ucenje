O	After
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	had
O	made
O	the
O	Red
O	Children
O	and
O	had
O	given
O	them
O	this
O	beautiful
O	land
O	in
O	which
O	to
O	live
O	,
O	he
O	sent
O	them
O	a
O	great
O	gift
O	,
O	--
O	the
O	gift
O	of
O	the
O	corn
O	.
O	_Ga
O	gaah_
O	,
O	the
O	Crow
O	,
O	claims
O	it
O	was
O	he
O	who
O	brought
O	this
O	gift
O	.
O	He
O	says
O	he
O	was
O	called
O	to
O	the
O	wigwam
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	A
O	grain
O	of
O	corn
O	was
O	placed
O	in
O	his
O	ear
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	told
O	to
O	carry
O	it
O	to
O	earth
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	Red
O	Children
O	.
O	Therefore
O	,
O	as
O	_Ga
O	gaah_
O	brought
O	the
O	gift
O	,
O	he
O	claims
O	he
O	has
O	a
O	right
O	to
O	pull
O	what
O	corn
O	he
O	needs
O	.
O	_Ga
O	gaah_
O	says
O	he
O	does
O	not
O	``
O	steal
O	``
O	corn
O	.
O	He
O	simply
O	takes
O	what
O	belongs
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	his
O	rightful
O	share
O	.
O	And
O	surely
O	_Ga
O	gaah_
O	is
O	not
O	greedy
O	!
O	He
O	never
O	takes
O	more
O	corn
O	than
O	he
O	wants
O	for
O	himself
O	.
O	He
O	never
O	hides
O	or
O	stores
O	it
O	away
O	.
O	He
O	takes
O	just
O	what
O	he
O	wishes
O	to
O	eat
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	more
O	,
O	for
O	crows
O	never
O	think
O	of
O	to-morrow
O	.
O	In
O	summer
O	,
O	they
O	are
O	happy
O	in
O	the
O	cornfields
O	,
O	guarding
O	the
O	roots
O	from
O	insect
O	enemies
O	,
O	and
O	pulling
O	the
O	tender
O	blades
O	whenever
O	they
O	are
O	hungry
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	winter
O	comes
O	,
O	the
O	crows
O	are
O	sad
O	.
O	Many
O	councils
O	are
O	held
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	a
O	council
O	tree
O	will
O	be
O	black
O	with
O	crows
O	.
O	All
O	are
O	so
O	poor
O	and
O	so
O	hungry
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	get
O	together
O	to
O	try
O	to
O	plan
O	a
O	better
O	way
O	to
O	live
O	.
O	There
O	is
O	much
O	noise
O	and
O	confusion
O	at
O	a
O	crow
O	council
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	crows
O	talk
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	All
O	are
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	No
O	bird
O	is
O	so
O	poor
O	as
O	the
O	crow
O	;
O	he
O	is
O	always
O	hungry
O	.
O	Next
O	summer
O	,
O	let
O	us
O	plant
O	and
O	raise
O	a
O	big
O	crop
O	of
O	corn
O	,
O	and
O	gather
O	and
O	save
O	it
O	for
O	the
O	winter
O	.
O	Next
O	winter
O	,
O	crows
O	will
O	not
O	be
O	hungry
O	;
O	they
O	will
O	have
O	food
O	.
O	``
O	We
O	will
O	no
O	longer
O	take
O	from
O	the
O	fields
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Children
O	just
O	enough
O	corn
O	for
O	a
O	meal
O	to-day
O	.
O	We
O	will
O	raise
O	our
O	own
O	corn
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	by
O	a
O	store
O	for
O	the
O	winter
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	having
O	agreed
O	that
O	this
O	is
O	a
O	wise
O	plan
O	,
O	the
O	council
O	ends
O	.
O	A
O	few
O	days
O	later
O	,
O	another
O	council
O	will
O	be
O	called
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	crows
O	will
O	plan
O	how
O	and
O	where
O	to
O	plant
O	the
O	corn
O	.
O	Some
O	will
O	be
O	appointed
O	to
O	select
O	a
O	field
O	,
O	others
O	to
O	find
O	seed
O	,
O	and
O	still
O	others
O	to
O	plant
O	and
O	tend
O	the
O	corn
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	alas
O	!
O	When
O	spring
O	comes
O	,
O	and
O	skies
O	are
O	blue
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sun
O	shines
O	warm
O	,
O	the
O	crows
O	forget
O	the
O	hunger
O	of
O	the
O	winter
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	councils
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	.
O	They
O	remember
O	only
O	that
O	the
O	skies
O	are
O	blue
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sun
O	shines
O	warm
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	there
O	is
O	plenty
O	of
O	corn
O	.
O	Happy
O	and
O	content
O	,
O	they
O	walk
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	fields
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Children
O	.
O	``
O	We
O	have
O	all
O	we
O	want
O	to-day
O	,
O	``
O	they
O	say
O	,
O	``
O	Why
O	should
O	we
O	think
O	of
O	to-morrow
O	,
O	or
O	next
O	winter
O	?
O	We
O	had
O	a
O	good
O	meal
O	this
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	are
O	sure
O	of
O	one
O	to-night
O	.
O	Is
O	not
O	this
O	enough
O	for
O	a
O	crow
O	?
O	What
O	more
O	can
O	he
O	ask
O	?
O	``
O	And
O	the
O	next
O	winter
O	comes
O	,
O	and
O	finds
O	the
O	crows
O	as
O	poor
O	and
O	as
O	hungry
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	the
O	last
O	.
O	Again
O	they
O	are
O	holding
O	noisy
O	councils
O	in
O	the
O	council
O	tree
O	.
O	Again
O	they
O	are
O	laying
O	plans
O	for
O	the
O	great
O	crop
O	of
O	corn
O	that
O	they
O	will
O	raise
O	next
O	summer
O	!
