O	Now
O	there
O	dwelt
O	in
O	a
O	castle
O	in
O	the
O	Netherland
O	a
O	certain
O	King
O	,
O	Siegmund
O	by
O	name
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	to
O	wife
O	a
O	fair
O	lady
O	Sieglind
O	.
O	These
O	two
O	had
O	a
O	son
O	whom
O	they
O	called
O	Siegfried
O	,
O	a
O	very
O	gallant
O	prince
O	.
O	Very
O	carefully
O	did
O	they
O	train
O	and
O	teach
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	root
O	of
O	the
O	matter
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	lad
O	himself
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	an
O	honest
O	and
O	good
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	in
O	all
O	things
O	a
O	very
O	perfect
O	knight
O	.
O	This
O	Siegfried
O	being
O	come
O	to
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	estate
O	,
O	and
O	being
O	well
O	practised
O	in
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	also
O	as
O	much
O	of
O	wealth
O	as
O	he
O	needed
O	,
O	turned
O	his
O	thoughts
O	to
O	marriage
O	,
O	desiring
O	to
O	win
O	a
O	fair
O	bride
O	for
O	himself
O	.
O	It
O	came
O	to
O	Prince
O	Siegfried
O	'
O	s
O	ears
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	fair
O	maiden
O	in
O	the
O	Rhineland
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	many
O	noble
O	knights
O	had
O	come
O	from
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	to
O	make
O	their
O	suits
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	none
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	Never
O	yet
O	had
O	she
O	seen
O	the
O	man
O	whom
O	she
O	would
O	take
O	for
O	her
O	husband
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	the
O	Prince
O	heard
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	This
O	Kriemhild
O	will
O	I
O	have
O	for
O	my
O	wife
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	King
O	Siegmund
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	of
O	his
O	son
O	'
O	s
O	purpose
O	,
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	little
O	troubled
O	thereat
O	;
O	and
O	Queen
O	Sieglind
O	wept
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	the
O	brother
O	of
O	Kriemhild
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	aware
O	of
O	the
O	strength
O	and
O	valour
O	of
O	his
O	warriors
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	Prince
O	,
O	``
O	Son
O	,
O	this
O	is
O	not
O	a
O	wise
O	wooing
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	Siegfried
O	made
O	answer
O	,
O	``
O	My
O	father
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	have
O	none
O	of
O	wedlock
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	may
O	not
O	marry
O	where
O	I
O	love
O	.
O	``
O	Thereupon
O	the
O	King
O	said
O	.
O	``
O	If
O	thou
O	canst
O	not
O	forego
O	this
O	maiden
O	,
O	then
O	thou
O	shalt
O	have
O	all
O	the
O	help
O	that
O	I
O	can
O	give
O	.
O	``
O	Queen
O	Sieglind
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	If
O	you
O	are
O	still
O	minded
O	to
O	go
O	,
O	then
O	I

O	prepare
O	for
O	you
O	and
O	your
O	companions
O	the
O	best
O	raiment
O	that
O	ever
O	warrior
O	wore
O	.
O	``
O	Siegfried
O	bowed
O	low
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	saying
O	:
O	``
O	So
O	be
O	it
O	;
O	only
O	remember
O	that
O	twelve
O	comrades

O	I
O	take
O	with
O	me
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	Queen
O	and
O	her
O	ladies
O	sat
O	stitching
O	night
O	and
O	day
O	,
O	taking
O	no
O	rest
O	till
O	the
O	raiment
O	was
O	ready
O	.
O	King
O	Siegmund
O	the
O	while
O	commanded
O	that
O	the
O	men
O	should
O	polish
O	their
O	war-gear
O	,
O	coats
O	of
O	mail
O	,
O	and
O	helmets
O	,
O	and
O	shields
O	.
O	The
O	thirteen
O	comrades
O	departed
O	and
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	seventh
O	day
O	,
O	they
O	rode
O	into
O	the
O	town
O	of
O	Worms
O	in
O	Rhineland
O	,
O	a
O	gallant
O	company
O	,
O	bravely
O	arrayed
O	,
O	for
O	their
O	garments
O	flashed
O	with
O	gold
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	war-gear
O	,
O	over
O	their
O	coats
O	of
O	mail
O	and
O	their
O	helmets
O	,
O	were
O	newly
O	polished
O	.
O	Their
O	long
O	swords
O	hung
O	down
O	by
O	their
O	sides
O	,
O	even
O	to
O	their
O	spurs
O	,
O	and
O	sharp
O	were
O	the
O	javelins
O	which
O	they
O	held
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	.
O	The
O	javelin
O	of
O	Siegfried
O	was
O	two
O	spans
O	broad
O	in
O	the
O	blade
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	double
O	edge
O	.
O	Terrible
O	were
O	the
O	wounds
O	that
O	it
O	made
O	.
O	Their
O	bridles
O	were
O	gilded
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	horse-girths
O	of
O	silk
O	.
O	A
O	comely
O	sight
O	they
O	were
O	to
O	see
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	came
O	from
O	all
O	round
O	to
O	gaze
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	Tidings
O	had
O	been
O	brought
O	to
O	King
O	Gunther
O	that
O	certain
O	warriors
O	were
O	come
O	,
O	very
O	gallant
O	to
O	look
O	upon
O	and
O	richly
O	clad
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	knew
O	who
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	and
O	whence
O	they
O	came
O	.
O	``
O	Now
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	``
O	this
O	troubles
O	me
O	much
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	can
O	tell
O	whence

O	come
O	.
O	``
O	To
O	him
O	Ortwein
O	,
O	the
O	High
O	Server
O	,
O	made
O	answer
O	,
O	``
O	Seeing
O	,

O	``
O	So
O	Hagen
O	went
O	to
O	the

O	had
O	never

O	So
O	he

O	It
O	had
O	been
O	newly

O	of
O	the

O	A
O	mighty
O	store

O	was
O	,
O	of

O	came
O	to
O	him
O	tidings
O	of
O	a
O	Queen
O	that
O	dwelt
O	beyond
O	the
O	sea
O	;
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	matched
O	was
O	she
O	for
O	beauty
O	,
O	nor
O	had
O	she
O	any
O	peer
O	for
O	strength
O	.
O	Her
O	love
O	she
O	proffered
O	to
O	any
O	warrior
O	who
O	could
O	vanquish
O	her
O	at
O	three
O	games
O	,
O	hurling
O	of
O	the
O	spear
O	,
O	and
O	putting
O	the
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	leaping
O	.
O	But
O	if
O	the
O	suitor
O	himself
O	should
O	be
O	vanquished
O	,
O	then
O	must
O	he
O	lose
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	Such
O	were
O	the
O	conditions
O	of
O	her
O	wooing
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	brave
O	warriors
O	had
O	died
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	On
O	a
O	certain
O	day
O	King
O	Gunther
O	and
O	his
O	chiefs
O	sat
O	in
O	council
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	matter
O	was
O	this
O	--
O	where
O	shall
O	the
O	King
O	seek
O	a
O	wife
O	who
O	shall
O	both
O	be
O	for
O	a
O	comfort
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	for
O	a
O	glory
O	to
O	the

O	?
O	Then
O	spake
O	the

O	,

O	maids
O	skilful
O	in
O	the

O	the

O	a

O	store
O	of

O	.
O	The
O	fair
O	Kriemhild
O	planned
O	them
O	and

O	to
O	just

O	with

O	hand
O	and
O	her

O	were
O	,
O	some
O	from
O	Arabia
O	,
O	white
O	as
O	snow
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	Lesser
O	Asia
O	others
O	,
O	green
O	as
O	grass
O	,
O	and
O	strange
O	skins
O	of
O	fishes
O	from
O	distant
O	seas
O	,
O	and
O	fur
O	of
O	the
O	ermine
O	,
O	with
O	black
O	spots
O	on
O	snowy
O	white
O	,
O	and
O	precious
O	stones
O	and
O	gold
O	of
O	Arabia
O	.
O	In
O	seven
O	weeks
O	all
O	was
O	prepared
O	,
O	both
O	apparel
O	and
O	also
O	arms
O	and
O	armour
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	that
O	was
O	either
O	over-long
O	or
O	over-short
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	could
O	be
O	surpassed
O	for
O	comeliness
O	.
O	Great
O	thanks
O	did
O	the
O	warriors
O	give
O	to
O	each
O	fair
O	seamstress
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	Kriemhild
O	the
O	beautiful
O	the
O	greatest
O	thanks

O	.
O	So
O	the
O	four
O	companions
O	embarked
O	on

O	Well

O	and
O	all

O	sailed
O	down
O	the

O	On
O	the

O	And
O	when

O	that
O	his
O	strong
O	ally
O	was
O	at
O	hand
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	the
O	Queen
O	threw
O	the
O	spear
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	might
O	against
O	the
O	shield
O	Siegfried
O	bore
O	upon
O	his
O	arm
O	.
O	New
O	was
O	the
O	shield
O	and
O	stout
O	of
O	make
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	spearhead
O	passed
O	clean
O	through
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	rang
O	on
O	the
O	hero
O	'
O	s
O	coat
O	of
O	mail
O	,
O	dealing
O	him
O	so
O	sore
O	a
O	blow
O	that
O	the
O	blood
O	gushed
O	forth
O	from
O	his
O	mouth
O	.
O	Of
O	a
O	truth
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	the
O	Hood
O	of
O	Darkness
O	,
O	that
O	hour
O	both
O	the
O	champions
O	had
O	died
O	.
O	Then
O	Siegfried
O	caught
O	the
O	great
O	spear
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	tore
O	it
O	from
O	the
O	shield
O	,
O	and
O	hurled
O	it
O	back
O	.
O	``
O	She
O	is
O	too
O	fair
O	to
O	slay
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	turned
O	the
O	spear
O	point
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	smote
O	the
O	maiden
O	with
O	the
O	shaft
O	on
O	the
O	silken
O	vest
O	that
O	she
O	wore
O	.
O	Loud
O	rang
O	the
O	blow
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fire-sparks
O	leapt
O	from
O	her
O	armour
O	.
O	Never
O	could
O	Gunther
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	his
O	strength
O	,
O	have
O	dealt
O	such
O	a
O	blow
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	felled
O	the
O	strong
O	Brunhild
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Lightly
O	did
O	she
O	leap
O	up
O	again
O	,
O	crying
O	,
O	``
O	King
O	Gunther

O	twas
O	shrewdly
O	given
O	,
O	``
O	for
O	she
O	thought
O	that

O	But
O	great
O	was
O	the
O	wrath
O	in
O	her
O	heart
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	her
O	spear
O	had
O	sped
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	she
O	turned
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	stone
O	where
O	it
O	lay
O	,
O	and
O	poised
O	it
O	in

O	having
O	hurled

O	after
O	it
O	.
O	Twelve
O	full
O	arms

O	hurtled
O	the
O	great
O	stone
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	so
O	mighty
O	was
O	the
O	maiden
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	herself
O	overpassed
O	it
O	by
O	a
O	pace
O	.
O	Then
O	came
O	Gunther
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	with
O	Siegfried
O	unseen
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	.
O	And
O	Siegfried
O	caught
O	the
O	stone
O	and
O	poised
O	it
O	--
O	but
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	all
O	as
O	if
O	Gunther
O	did
O	it
O	--
O	and
O	threw
O	it
O	yet
O	another

O	beyond
O	the
O	cast
O	of
O	the

O	passed
O	the

O	himself
O	,

O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	King
O	Gunther
O	along

O	him
O	,
O	so

O	was
O	he
O	!
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	Queen
O	saw
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	vanquished
O	,
O	she
O	flushed
O	with
O	shame
O	and
O	wrath
O	,
O	and
O	turning
O	to
O	her

O	,

O	spake
O	aloud
O	,
O	``

O	and
O	all

O	King
O	Gunther
O	was
O	married
O	to
O	the
O	fair
O	Brunhild
O	.
O	Nor
O	is
O	there
O	need
O	of
O	many
O	words
O	to
O	relate
O	how
O	Siegfried
O	also
O	took
O	to

O	the
O	beautiful
O	Kriemhild
O	,
O	as

O	.
O	Nor
O	were
O	there
O	any
O	to
O	gainsay
O	save
O	Brunhild
O	only
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	grudged
O	that
O	her
O	husband
O	'
O	s
O	sister
O	should
O	be
O	given
O	to
O	a

O	,
O	for
O	such
O	in
O	truth
O	she
O	deemed
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	.
O	Very
O	ill
O	content
O	she
O	was
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	King
O	would
O	fain
O	have
O	satisfied
O	her
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	noble
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	lord

O	,
O	and
O	had
O	great
O	store
O	of
O	gold
O	and
O	treasure
O	.
O	So
O	Siegfried
O	wedded
O	the
O	fair
O	Kriemhild
O	and
O	took
O	her
O	with

O	.
O	A
O	goodly
O	welcome
O	did
O	the
O	Netherlands
O	give
O	her
O	.
O	And
O	Siegmund
O	gave
O	up
O	his
O	kingdom
O	to
O	his
O	son
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	lived
O	in

O	together
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	in
O	the
O	tenth
O	year
O	a
O	son
O	was
O	born
O	to
O	them
O	,

O	Also
O	Gunther
O	and
O	Brunhild
O	lived
O	together
O	in
O	much
O	happiness
O	.
O	They
O	also
O	had
O	a
O	son
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	called
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Siegfried
O	.
O	But
O	Brunhild
O	was
O	ill
O	content
O	that
O	Siegfried
O	being
O	,
O	far
O	so
O	she
O	deemed

O	s
O	vassal
O	,
O	should
O	pay
O	no

O	do
O	no

O	.
O	And
O	she
O	was
O	very
O	urgent
O	with
O	her
O	husband
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	suffer
O	this
O	no
O	longer
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	King
O	was
O	fain
O	to
O	put
O	her
O	off
O	.
O	``
O	Nay

O	said
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	the

O	Hagen
O	went
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	company
O	of
O	hunters
O	and
O	hounds
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	forest
O	Siegfried
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Now
O	who
O	shall
O	begin
O	the
O	hunting
O	?
O	``
O	Hagen
O	made
O	answer
O	,
O	``
O	Let
O	us
O	divide
O	into
O	two
O	companies
O	ere
O	we
O	begin
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	shall
O	beat
O	the
O	coverts
O	as
O	he
O	will
O	;
O	so
O	shall
O	we
O	see
O	who
O	is
O	the
O	more
O	skilful
O	in
O	the
O	chase
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	I
O	need
O	no
O	pack
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Siegfried
O	;
O	``
O	give
O	me
O	one
O	well-trained
O	hound
O	that
O	can
O	track
O	the
O	game
O	through
O	the
O	coverts
O	.
O	That
O	will
O	suffice
O	for
O	me
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	a
O	lime-hound
O	was
O	given
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	All
O	that
O	the
O	good
O	hound
O	started
O	did
O	Siegfried
O	slay
O	;
O	no
O	beast
O	could
O	outrun
O	him
O	or
O	escape
O	him
O	.
O	A
O	wild
O	boar
O	first
O	he
O	slew
O	,
O	and
O	next
O	to
O	the
O	boar
O	a
O	lion
O	;
O	he
O	shot
O	an
O	arrow
O	through
O	the
O	beast
O	from
O	side
O	to
O	side
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	lion
O	he
O	slew
O	a
O	buffalo
O	and
O	four
O	elks
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	store
O	of
O	game
O	besides
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	huntsmen
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Leave
O	us
O	something
O	in
O	our
O	woods
O	,
O	Sir
O	Siegfried
O	.
O	``
O	King
O	Gunther
O	bade
O	blow
O	the
O	horn
O	for
O	breakfast
O	.
O	When
O	Siegfried
O	'
O	s
O	huntsman
O	heard
O	the
O	blast
O	he
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Our
O	hunting-time
O	is
O	over
O	;
O	we
O	must
O	back
O	to
O	our
O	comrades
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	they
O	went
O	with
O	all
O	speed
O	to
O	the
O	trysting-
O	place
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	company
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	their
O	meal
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	plenty
O	of
O	every
O	kind
O	,
O	but
O	wine
O	was
O	wanting
O	.
O	``
O	How
O	is
O	this
O	?
O	``
O	said
O	Siegfried
O	:
O	``
O	the
O	kitchen
O	is
O	plentiful
O	;
O	but
O	where
O	is
O	the
O	wine
O	?
O	``
O	Said
O	Gunther
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	``
O	'
O	Tis
O	Hagen
O	'
O	s
O	fault
O	,
O	who
O	makes
O	us
O	all
O	go
O	dry
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	True
O	,
O	Sir
O	King
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Hagen
O	,
O	``
O	my
O	fault
O	it
O	is
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	know
O	of
O	a
O	runnel
O	,
O	cold
O	and
O	clear
O	,
O	that
O	is
O	hard
O	by
O	.
O	Let
O	us
O	go
O	thither
O	and
O	quench
O	our
O	thirst
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	Siegfried
O	rose
O	from
O	his
O	place
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	thirst
O	was
O	sore
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	sought
O	the
O	place
O	.
O	Said
O	Hagen
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	him
O	rise
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	have
O	heard
O	say
O	that
O	there

O	no
O	man
O	in

O	the
O	land
O	so
O	fleet
O	of
O	foot
O	as
O	Siegfried
O	.
O	Will
O	he
O	deign
O	to
O	let
O	us
O	see
O	his
O	speed
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	With
O	all
O	my
O	heart
O	,
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	hero
O	.
O	``
O	Let
O	us
O	race
O	from
O	hence
O	to
O	the
O	runnel
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	'
O	Tis
O	agreed
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Hagen
O	the
O	traitor
O	.
O	``
O	Furthermore
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Siegfried
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	carry
O	all
O	the
O	equipment
O	that
O	I
O	bare
O	in
O	the
O	chase
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	Gunther
O	and
O	Hagen
O	stripped
O	them
O	to
O	their
O	shirts
O	,
O	but
O	Siegfried
O	carried
O	sword
O	and
O	spear
O	,
O	all
O	his
O	hunting-gear
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	was
O	far
O	before
O	the
O	two
O	at
O	the
O	runnel
O	.
O	Yet
O	,
O	such
O	was
O	his
O	courtesy
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	drink
O	before
O	the
O	King
O	had
O	quenched
O	his
O	thirst
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	ill
O	repaid
O	,
O	I
O	trow
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	grace
O	.
O	For
O	when
O	the
O	King
O	had
O	drunk
O	,
O	as
O	Siegfried
O	knelt
O	plunging
O	his
O	head
O	into
O	the
O	stream
O	,
O	Sir
O	Hagen
O	took
O	his
O	spear
O	and
O	smote
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	little
O	crosslet
O	mark
O	that
O	was
O	worked
O	on
O	his
O	cloak
O	between
O	his
O	shoulders
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	struck
O	the
O	blow
O	he
O	fled
O	in
O	mortal
O	fear
O	.
O	When
O	Siegfried
O	felt
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	wounded
O	,
O	he
O	rose
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	bound
O	from
O	his
O	knees
O	and
O	sought
O	for
O	his
O	weapons
O	.
O	But
O	these
O	the
O	false
O	Hagen
O	had
O	taken
O	and
O	laid
O	far
O	away
O	.
O	Only
O	the
O	shield
O	was
O	left
O	.
O	This
O	he
O	took
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	hurled
O	at
O	Hagen
O	with
O	such
O	might
O	that
O	it
O	felled
O	the
O	traitor
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	itself
O	broken
O	to
O	pieces
O	.
O	If
O	the
O	hero
O	had
O	but
O	had
O	his
O	good
O	sword
O	Balmung
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	the
O	murderer
O	had
O	not
O	escaped
O	with
O	his
O	life
O	that
O	day
O	.
O	Then
O	all
O	the
O	Rhineland
O	warriors
O	gathered
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	Among
O	them
O	was
O	King
O	Gunther
O	,
O	making
O	pretence
O	to
O	lament
O	.
O	To
O	him
O	said
O	Siegfried
O	,
O	``
O	Little
O	it
O	profits
O	to
O	bewail
O	the
O	man
O	whose
O	murder
O	you
O	have
O	plotted
O	.
O	Did
O	I
O	not
O	save
O	you
O	from
O	shame
O	and
O	defeat
O	?
O	Is
O	this
O	the
O	recompense
O	that
O	you
O	pay
O	?
O	And
O	yet
O	even
O	of
O	you
O	I
O	would
O	ask
O	one
O	favour
O	.
O	Have
O	some
O	kindness
O	for
O	my
O	wife
O	.
O	She
O	is
O	your
O	sister
O	;
O	if
O	you
O	have
O	any
O	knightly
O	faith
O	and
O	honour
O	remaining
O	,
O	guard
O	her
O	well
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	there
O	came
O	upon
O	him
O	the
O	anguish
O	of
O	death
O	.
O	Yet
O	one
O	more
O	word
O	he
O	spake
O	,
O	``
O	Be
O	sure
O	that
O	in
O	slaying
O	me
O	you
O	have
O	slain
O	yourselves
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	so
O	spoken
O	he
O	died
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	laid
O	his
O	body
O	on
O	a
O	shield
O	and
O	carried
O	it
O	back
O	,
O	having
O	agreed
O	among
O	themselves
O	to
O	tell
O	this
O	tale
O	,
O	that
O	Sir
O	Siegfried
O	having
O	chosen
O	to
O	hunt
O	by
O	himself
O	was
O	slain
O	by
O	robbers
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	.
