O	Once
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	,
O	the
O	Indian
O	fairies
O	,
O	ran
O	with
O	the
O	Red
O	Children
O	through
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	and
O	played
O	with
O	them
O	beside
O	the
O	streams
O	.
O	Now
O	they
O	are
O	not
O	often
O	seen
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	white
O	man
O	drove
O	them
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	woods
O	with
O	the
O	Indians
O	,
O	and
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	waters
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	big
O	steam
O	noises
O	.
O	But
O	before
O	steamboats
O	and
O	great
O	mills
O	were
O	on
O	the
O	streams
O	,
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	were
O	there
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	often
O	seen
O	paddling
O	their
O	tiny
O	canoes
O	,
O	or
O	sliding
O	down
O	the
O	great
O	rocks
O	on
O	the
O	banks
O	.
O	They
O	loved
O	to
O	slide
O	down
O	a
O	bank
O	where
O	one
O	rock
O	jutted
O	out
O	,
O	for
O	then
O	they
O	had
O	a
O	big
O	bounce
O	.
O	They
O	also
O	liked
O	to
O	sport
O	and
O	jump
O	with
O	the
O	fish
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	young
O	Indian
O	girl
O	whose
O	name
O	was
O	Morning
O	Star
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	called
O	Morning
O	Star
O	because
O	her
O	face
O	was
O	so
O	bright
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	always
O	up
O	early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	.
O	Morning
O	Star
O	lived
O	with
O	her
O	father
O	in
O	a
O	comfortable
O	wigwam
O	by
O	a
O	river
O	.
O	Every
O	day
O	she
O	would
O	get
O	up
O	with
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	and
O	run
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	river
O	where
O	the
O	great
O	rocks
O	were
O	,
O	to
O	catch
O	fish
O	for
O	breakfast
O	.
O	Morning
O	Star
O	caught
O	her
O	fish
O	in
O	a
O	basket
O	.
O	At
O	night
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	go
O	and
O	fasten
O	her
O	basket
O	between
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	narrow
O	place
O	of
O	the
O	stream
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	fish
O	swam
O	through
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	get
O	caught
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	Morning
O	Star
O	would
O	find
O	plenty
O	of
O	fish
O	waiting
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	take
O	the
O	basket
O	of
O	fish
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	wigwam
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	the
O	smell
O	of
O	fish
O	frying
O	on
O	hot
O	coals
O	would
O	come
O	from
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	Never
O	since
O	Morning
O	Star
O	began
O	to
O	fish
O	with
O	her
O	basket
O	,
O	had
O	Chief
O	Little
O	Wolf
O	,
O	her
O	father
O	,
O	had
O	to
O	wait
O	for
O	his
O	fish
O	breakfast
O	before
O	starting
O	on
O	the
O	chase
O	.
O	But
O	one
O	morning
O	,
O	neither
O	Chief
O	Little
O	Wolf
O	nor
O	Morning
O	Star
O	breakfasted
O	on
O	fish
O	.
O	This
O	is
O	how
O	it
O	happened
O	.
O	On
O	this
O	morning
O	,
O	the
O	Indian
O	girl
O	was
O	up
O	as
O	usual
O	with
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	She
O	ran
O	down
O	the
O	river
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	lifted
O	the
O	sun
O	'
O	s
O	smiling
O	face
O	.
O	Morning
O	Star
O	had
O	such
O	a
O	light
O	heart
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	glad
O	just
O	to
O	be
O	alive
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	sang
O	a
O	song
O	of
O	praise
O	as
O	she
O	ran
O	.
O	All
O	true
O	Indians
O	at
O	sunrise
O	lift
O	their
O	arms
O	and
O	faces
O	to
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	and
O	thank
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	that
O	he
O	has
O	smiled
O	upon
O	them
O	again
O	.
O	Happy
O	and
O	fleet
O	as
O	a
O	deer
O	,
O	Morning
O	Star
O	ran
O	on
O	until
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	rocks
O	.
O	There
O	she
O	saw
O	a
O	whole
O	tribe
O	of
O	tiny
O	little
O	folk
O	gathered
O	about
O	her
O	basket
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	them
O	were
O	perched
O	on
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	basket
O	,
O	laughing
O	and
O	singing
O	.
O	Others
O	were
O	lifting
O	the
O	fish
O	from
O	it
O	and
O	throwing
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	stream
O	.
O	Still
O	others
O	were
O	opening
O	and
O	closing
O	the
O	splints
O	of
O	the
O	basket
O	for
O	the
O	fish
O	to
O	slip
O	through
O	.
O	Morning
O	Star
O	knew
O	that
O	these
O	tiny
O	folk
O	were
O	the
O	_Jo
O	gah
O	oh_
O	.
O	She
O	knew
O	also
O	that
O	these
O	Little
O	People
O	were
O	friends
O	of
O	the
O	fish
O	.
O	They
O	know
O	every
O	twist
O	of
O	a
O	fish
O	net
O	and
O	every
O	turn
O	of
O	a
O	hook
O	.
O	Often
O	they
O	have
O	been
O	known
O	to
O	set
O	fish
O	free
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	guide
O	them
O	into
O	deep
O	,
O	quiet
O	places
O	,
O	far
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	men
O	who
O	fish
O	.
O	Morning
O	Star
O	called
O	to
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	and
O	begged
O	them
O	not
O	to
O	let
O	all
O	the
O	fish
O	go
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	climb
O	down
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	she
O	could
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	Chief
O	called
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	""""
O	Fish

O	like
O	Indian
O	girls
O	,
O	like

O	""""
O	Then
O	he
O	told
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	to
O	keep
O	on
O	setting
O	the
O	fish
O	free
O	.
O	When
O	Morning
O	Star
O	reached
O	her
O	basket
O	,
O	a
O	few
O	fish
O	were
O	still
O	in
O	it
O	.
O	She
O	put
O	out
O	her
O	hand
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	from
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	,
O	--and
O	not
O	a
O	fish
O	,
O	nor
O	a
O	_Jo
O	gah
O	oh_
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	The
O	Little
O	People
O	had
O	darted
O	into
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	go
O	through
O	anything
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fish
O	had
O	slipped
O	through
O	the
O	tiny
O	spaces
O	between
O	the
O	splints
O	of
O	the
O	basket
O	.
O	Morning
O	Star
O	heard
O	the
O	laughter
O	of
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	echo
O	deep
O	within
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	like
O	to
O	play
O	pranks
O	with
O	the
O	earth
O	children
O	.
O	And
O	far
O	down
O	the
O	stream
O	,
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	fish
O	leap
O	with
O	joy
O	at
O	being
O	still
O	alive
O	.
O	She
O	took
O	up
O	her
O	empty
O	basket
O	and
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	wigwam
O	.
O	That
O	morning
O	for
O	breakfast
O	,
O	Morning
O	Star
O	baked
O	corn
O	cakes
O	on

O	As

O	she
