O	I
O	.
O	HAPPY
O	DOMINIE
O	SAMPSON
O	IT
O	was
O	seventeen
O	long
O	years
O	after
O	the
O	murder
O	of
O	Frank
O	Kennedy
O	and
O	the
O	disappearance
O	of
O	little
O	Harry
O	Bertram
O	when
O	Guy
O	Mannering
O	,
O	now
O	a
O	soldier
O	famous
O	for
O	his
O	wars
O	in
O	the
O	East
O	,
O	penetrated
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	into
O	Galloway
O	.
O	His
O	object
O	was
O	to
O	visit
O	the
O	family
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	,
O	and
O	secretly
O	,
O	also
O	,
O	to
O	find
O	out
O	for
O	himself
O	in
O	what
O	way
O	his
O	random
O	prophesies
O	had
O	worked
O	out
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	arrived
O	at
O	an
O	unfortunate
O	time
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	that
O	,
O	chiefly
O	by
O	the
O	plotting
O	and
O	deceit
O	of
O	a
O	rascally
O	lawyer
O	,
O	one
O	Gilbert
O	Glossin
O	,
O	the
O	Bertrams
O	were
O	on
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	being
O	sold
O	out
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	.
O	All
O	their
O	money
O	had
O	been
O	lost
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sale
O	of
O	the
O	estate
O	was
O	being
O	forced
O	on
O	by
O	the
O	rascally
O	lawyer
O	Glossin
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	ends
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	man
O	Godfrey
O	Bertram
O	also
O	was
O	very
O	near
O	his
O	end
O	.
O	And
O	indeed
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	day
O	of
O	the
O	sale
O	,
O	and
O	while
O	Mannering
O	was
O	paying
O	his
O	respects
O	to
O	his
O	former
O	host
O	,
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	Glossin
O	so
O	enraged
O	the
O	feeble
O	old
O	man
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	taken
O	with
O	a
O	violent
O	passion
O	,
O	falling
O	back
O	in
O	his
O	chair
O	and
O	dying
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	.
O	Mannering
O	,
O	whose
O	heart
O	was
O	greatly
O	touched
O	,
O	was
O	most
O	anxious
O	to
O	do
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	to
O	assist
O	Lucy
O	Bertram
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	compelled
O	by
O	an
O	urgent
O	summons
O	to
O	return
O	into
O	England
O	.
O	It
O	had
O	been
O	his
O	intention
O	to
O	save
O	the
O	estate
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	from
O	the
O	clutches
O	of
O	the
O	scoundrel
O	Glossin
O	by
O	buying
O	it
O	himself
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	drunkenness
O	of
O	a
O	postboy
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	sent
O	with
O	a
O	letter
O	to
O	Mr
O	.
O	Mac-Morlan
O	,
O	the
O	lawyer
O	in
O	charge
O	of
O	the
O	sale
O	,
O	defeated
O	his
O	intentions
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	Ellangowan
O	became
O	the
O	property
O	of
O	the
O	traitor
O	.
O	So
O	young
O	Lucy
O	Bertram
O	and
O	Dominie
O	Sampson
O	(
O	who
O	refused
O	to
O	be
O	separated
O	from
O	her
O	)
O	became
O	for
O	the
O	moment
O	inmates
O	of
O	Mr
O	.
O	Mac-Morlan
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	.
O	The
O	Dominie
O	found
O	a
O	pupil
O	or
O	two
O	in
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	chargeable
O	to
O	his
O	dear
O	Lucy
O	or
O	her
O	friend
O	Mr
O	.
O	Mac-Morlan
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	twenty-first
O	year
O	after
O	the
O	birth
O	of
O	an
O	heir
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	Mannering
O	'
O	s
O	prophecy
O	concerning
O	him
O	,
O	there
O	seemed
O	an
O	end
O	to
O	the
O	ancient
O	house
O	of
O	the
O	Bertrams
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	.
O	During
O	these
O	years
O	,
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	also
O	had
O	a
O	tale
O	to
O	tell
O	.
O	Wedded
O	early
O	to
O	the
O	wife
O	of
O	his
O	youth
O	and
O	his
O	heart
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	India
O	in
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	the
O	Honourable
O	,
O	the
O	East
O	India
O	Company
O	.
O	There
O	by
O	his
O	valour
O	and
O	talent
O	he
O	had
O	rapidly
O	acquired
O	both
O	wealth
O	and
O	position
O	.
O	But
O	during
O	the
O	twenty-first
O	year
O	an
O	event
O	occurred
O	which
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	distaste
O	for
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	his
O	adoption
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	native
O	country
O	with
O	the
O	idea
O	of
O	settling
O	down
O	,
O	far
O	away
O	from
O	old
O	memories
O	and
O	new
O	entanglements
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	duel
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	fought
O	in
O	India
O	with
O	a
O	young
O	man
O	named
O	Brown--a
O	brave
O	youth
O	of
O	no
O	position
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	offended
O	Mannering
O	by
O	his
O	attentions
O	to
O	his
O	daughter
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	establishing
O	himself
O	in
O	his
O	house
O	as
O	a
O	friend
O	of
O	the
O	family--he
O	had
O	left
O	Brown
O	for
O	dead
O	on
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	hardly
O	escaping
O	himself
O	with
O	his
O	life
O	from
O	a
O	sudden
O	attack
O	of
O	the
O	armed
O	banditti
O	who
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	India
O	of
O	that
O	day
O	,
O	were
O	always
O	hovering
O	round
O	desert
O	places
O	.
O	The
O	shock
O	of
O	that
O	morning
O	had
O	so
O	told
O	on
O	the
O	health
O	of
O	Mannering
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	that
O	she
O	died
O	shortly
O	afterwards
O	,
O	leaving
O	him
O	with
O	one
O	daughter
O	,
O	Julia--a
O	proud
O	,
O	sprightly
O	,
O	sentimental
O	girl
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	under
O	the
O	care
O	of
O	a
O	friend
O	named
O	Mervyn
O	,
O	whose
O	house
O	stood
O	upon
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	Cumberland
O	lakes
O	.
O	So
O	it
O	came
O	about
O	that
O	when
O	Mannering
O	was
O	in
O	Scotland
O	,
O	he
O	received
O	a
O	letter
O	from
O	his
O	friend
O	which
O	took
O	him
O	to
O	Mervyn
O	Hall
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	horse-flesh
O	could
O	carry
O	him
O	.
O	His
O	friend
O	wrote
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	careful
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	without
O	his
O	wife
O	'
O	s
O	knowledge
O	.
O	Mr
O	.
O	Mervyn
O	told
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	certain
O	that
O	his
O	daughter
O	Julia
O	was
O	receiving
O	secret
O	visits
O	from
O	some
O	one
O	whom
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	dare
O	to
O	see
O	openly
O	.
O	Not
O	only
O	were
O	there
O	long
O	solitary
O	walks
O	and
O	hill-climbings
O	,
O	but
O	on
O	several
O	occasions
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	up
O	the
O	lake
O	at
O	midnight
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	under
O	her
O	windows
O	,
O	a
O	flageolet
O	playing
O	a
O	little
O	Indian
O	air
O	to
O	which
O	Julia
O	Mannering
O	was
O	partial
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	evidently
O	a
O	signal
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	boat
O	had
O	been
O	seen
O	hastily
O	crossing
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sash
O	of
O	Julia
O	'
O	s
O	window
O	had
O	been
O	heard
O	to
O	shut
O	down
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	alarm
O	.
O	Mr
O	.
O	Mervyn
O	said
O	that
O	,
O	little
O	as
O	he
O	liked
O	playing
O	the
O	part
O	of
O	tale-bearer
O	,
O	he
O	felt
O	that
O	Julia
O	was
O	under
O	his
O	care
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	deserve
O	his
O	old
O	name
O	of
O	Downright
O	Dunstable
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	inform
O	her
O	father
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	discovered
O	.
O	Julia
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	was
O	both
O	a
O	charming
O	and
O	high
O	spirited
O	girl
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	too
O	much
O	her
O	own
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	to
O	be
O	without
O	romantic
O	ideas
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	whole
O	,
O	concluded
O	Mr
O	.
O	Mervyn
O	,
O	it
O	behooved
O	the
O	Colonel
O	to
O	come
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	Mervyn
O	Hall
O	and
O	look
O	after
O	his
O	own
O	property
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	the
O	letter
O	which
O	,
O	put
O	into
O	his
O	hands
O	at
O	a
O	seaport
O	town
O	in
O	Scotland
O	,
O	lost
O	Mannering
O	the
O	estate
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	the
O	ancient
O	seat
O	of
O	many
O	generations
O	of
O	Bertrams
O	into
O	the
O	clutches
O	of
O	the
O	scoundrelly
O	Glossin
O	.
O	For
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	instantly
O	posted
O	off
O	to
O	the
O	south
O	,
O	having
O	first
O	of
O	all
O	sent
O	despatches
O	to
O	Mr
O	.
O	Mac-Morlan
O	by
O	the
O	untrustworthy
O	postilion--the
O	same
O	who
O	arrived
O	a
O	day
O	too
O	late
O	for
O	the
O	sale
O	.
O	When
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	first
O	went
O	to
O	Mervyn
O	Hall
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	make
O	nothing
O	of
O	the
O	case
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	he
O	believed
O	Brown
O	to
O	have
O	died
O	by
O	his
O	hand
O	in
O	India
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	no
O	traces
O	of
O	any
O	other
O	man
O	likely
O	to
O	be
O	making
O	love
O	to
O	his
O	daughter
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	back
O	a
O	plan
O	with
O	him
O	from
O	Scotland
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	,
O	would
O	put
O	an
O	end
O	to
O	all
O	future
O	difficulties
O	.
O	The
O	helplessness
O	of
O	Lucy
O	Bertram
O	had
O	moved
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	Besides
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	more
O	amused
O	than
O	he
O	cared
O	to
O	own
O	by
O	the
O	originality
O	of
O	the
O	Dominie
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	easily
O	obtained
O	,
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	Mr
O	.
O	Mac-Morlan
O	,
O	a
O	furnished
O	house
O	in
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	resolved
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	at
O	least
O	to
O	repose
O	himself
O	there
O	after
O	his
O	campaigns
O	.
O	His
O	daughter
O	Julia
O	would
O	thus
O	have
O	a
O	companion
O	in
O	Lucy
O	Bertram
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	easy
O	to
O	provide
O	the
O	Dominie
O	with
O	an
O	occupation
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	library
O	of
O	an
O	uncle
O	of
O	Mannering
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	learned
O	bishop
O	of
O	the
O	Church
O	of
O	England
O	,
O	had
O	been
O	willed
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	Dominie
O	was
O	the
O	very
O	man
O	to
O	put
O	the
O	books
O	in
O	order
O	.
O	So
O	indeed
O	it
O	was
O	arranged
O	,
O	after
O	some
O	saucy
O	remarks
O	from
O	Miss
O	Mannering
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	supposed
O	Scottish
O	accent
O	and
O	probable
O	red
O	hair
O	of
O	her
O	companion
O	.
O	Then
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	,
O	accustomed
O	to
O	do
O	nothing
O	by
O	halves
O	,
O	sent
O	down
O	his
O	directions
O	about
O	Dominie
O	Sampson
O	,
O	whose
O	heart
O	indeed
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	broken
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	separated
O	from
O	the
O	young
O	mistress
O	over
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	watched
O	from
O	childhood
O	.

O	The

O	was
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	easier
