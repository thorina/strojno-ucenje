O	There

O	He

O	The

O	Then
O	the
O	king
O	made
O	a
O	law
O	that
O	when
O	he
O	died
O	the
O	Prince

O	from

O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	soon
O	noticed
O	that
O	in
O	Eastroyal
O	the
O	people
O	became
O	discontented

O	quarrelsome
O	and
O	poor
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	always
O	finding

O	in
O	the

O	they
O	were
O	so
O	happy

O	so
O	great
O	a
O	difference
O	,
O	but
O	a
O	great
O	difference
O	there
O	was
O	.
O	Things
O	grew
O	worse

O	worse
O	in
O	Eastroyal
O	,
O	until

O	be
O	haunted
O	by
O	beings
O	of
O	strange
O	shape
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	stories
O	of
O	their
O	mysterious
O	power
O	and
O	evil
O	ways
O	.
O	Yet
O	go
O	she
O	must
O	,
O	if
O	going
O	meant
O	the
O	gaining
O	of
O	a
O	magic
O	mirror
O	for
O	her
O	son
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	must
O	go
O	alone
O	,
O	for
O	only
O	so
O	could
O	any
O	seeker
O	find
O	the
O	pathway
O	to
O	the
O	pool
O	,
O	so
O	it
O	was
O	said
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	before
O	my
O	courage
O	fails
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	left
O	her
O	sheltered
O	garden
O	and
O	set
O	off
O	across
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	many
O	weary
O	miles
O	to
O	travel
O	,
O	past
O	villages
O	and
O	towns
O	and
O	fields
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	footsore
O	and
O	faint
O	when
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	reached
O	the
O	winding
O	track
O	that
O	led
O	between
O	the
O	darkening
O	hills
O	.
O	Yet
O	on
O	she
O	went
O	,
O	following
O	the
O	murmur
O	of
O	a
O	tiny
O	stream
O	that
O	dropped
O	through
O	thick-set
O	bushes
O	into
O	a
O	shadowed
O	valley
O	.
O	On
O	she
O	went
O	still
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	the
O	darkness
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	had
O	lost
O	her
O	way
O	.
O	She
O	stumbled
O	over
O	fallen
O	logs
O	,
O	pushed
O	with
O	bleeding
O	hands
O	and
O	torn
O	clothes
O	through
O	bramble
O	wildernesses
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	at
O	last
O	her
O	way
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	narrow
O	track
O	beside
O	the
O	little
O	stream
O	that
O	murmured
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	.
O	On
O	she
O	went
O	,
O	and
O	down
O	.
O	The
O	stream
O	suddenly
O	widened
O	into
O	a
O	round
O	blackness
O	open
O	to
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	but
O	walled
O	in
O	by
O	jagged
O	rocks
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	pool
O	.
O	Utterly
O	spent
O	through
O	weariness
O	and
O	fear
O	,
O	she
O	sank
O	down
O	among
O	the
O	rocks
O	to
O	rest
O	,
O	and
O	waited
O	there
O	for
O	what
O	might
O	come
O	to
O	her
O	.
O	Strange
O	rustlings
O	sounded
O	round
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	strange
O	forms
O	loomed
O	close
O	beside
O	her
O	,
O	strange
O	voices
O	asked
O	her
O	:
O	``
O	What
O	are
O	you
O	?
O	Why
O	come
O	you
O	to
O	our
O	haunts
O	?
O	``
O	Though
O	her
O	heart
O	was
O	sick
O	with
O	dread
O	she
O	answered
O	boldly
O	in
O	a
O	firm
O	clear
O	voice
O	.
O	``
O	Give
O	me
O	a
O	magic
O	mirror
O	for
O	my
O	son
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	may
O	learn
O	to
O	rule
O	.
O	``
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	flash
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	pool
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	rocks
O	were
O	lit
O	by
O	a
O	light
O	brighter
O	and
O	softer
O	than
O	that
O	of
O	moon
O	or
O	stars
O	.
O	All
O	round
O	her
O	stood
O	the
O	beings
O	who
O	had
O	loomed
O	so
O	strangely
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	fairies
O	,
O	exquisite
O	in
O	shape
O	and
O	fineness
O	,
O	robed
O	in
O	flowing
O	gossamer
O	of
O	many
O	colours
O	.
O	They
O	smiled
O	at
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	touched
O	her
O	with
O	their
O	gentle
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	she
O	was
O	well
O	.
O	``
O	Your
O	love
O	has
O	brought
O	you
O	nobly
O	through
O	much
O	fear
O	and
O	hurt
O	,
O	``
O	they
O	said
O	.
O	``
O	You

O	Look
O	into
O	the
O	Deeps
O	.
O	``
O	One
O	took
O	her
O	hand
O	and
O	led
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	edge
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Queen-mother
O	,
O	fearless
O	and
O	smiling
O	now
O	,
O	looked
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	fathomless
O	water
O	of
O	the
O	pool
O	.
O	As
O	she
O	gazed
O	,
O	ripples
O	came
O	upon
O	its
O	surface
O	.
O	They
O	broke
O	away
O	into
O	shining
O	cascades
O	of
O	diamonds
O	and
O	pearls
O	,
O	and
O	between

O	the
O	face

O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	of
O	the
O	road
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	have
O	your

O	cried
O	.

O	.
O	``
O	She
O	sprang
O	out
O	and
O	trod
O	the
O	water
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	went
O	her
O	rags
O	fell
O	from
O	her
O	and
O	she
O	rose
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	a
O	shining
O	queen
O	of
O	fairies
O	,
O	more
O	beautiful

O	there
O	,
O	holding
O	in

O	hand
O	a
O	tiny
O	gleaming
O	mirror
O	.
O	``
O	Come
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	let
O	us
O	set
O	it
O	in
O	its
O	place
O	.
O	``
O	She
O	touched
O	the
O	Queen-mother
O	'
O	s
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	flash
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	at
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	within
O	the
O	young
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	sleeping
O	chamber
O	of
O	turquoise
O	and
O	gold
O	.
O	There
O	as
O	he
O	lay
O	asleep
O	the
O	fairies
O	set
O	the
O	mirror
O	in
O	its
O	place
O	with
O	magic
O	words
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	it
O	touched
O	the
O	wall
O	it
O	lengthened
O	out
O	and
O	widened
O	till
O	it
O	stood
O	as
O	large
O	as
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	queen
O	across
O	the
O	border
O	line
O	.
O	Over
O	the
O	polished
O	glass
O	began
O	to
O	float
O	the
O	pictures
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	'
O	s
O	life
O	.
O	``
O	How
O	can
O	I
O	show
O	my
O	gratitude
O	?
O	``
O	the
O	Queen-mother
O	asked
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	fairies
O	were
O	gone
O	.
O	Next
O	morning
O	when
O	the
O	little
O	king
O	awoke
O	he
O	ran
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	fine
O	new
O	mirror
O	in
O	his
O	room
O	.
O	He
O	gazed
O	and
O	gazed
O	upon
O	the
O	strange
O	entrancing
O	pictures
O	that
O	came
O	on
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	day
O	he
O	spent
O	long
O	hours
O	at
O	the
O	mirror
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	he
O	learned
O	to
O	recognise
O	the
O	hardships
O	and
O	the
O	sufferings
O	of
O	his
O	people
O	his
O	heart
O	grew
O	hot
O	to
O	give
O	relief
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	no
O	more
O	haughty
O	,
O	but
O	used
O	his
O	power
O	to
O	ease
O	their
O	woes
O	.
O	So
O	in
O	Eastroyal
O	as
O	in
O	Westroyal
O	there
O	was
O	content
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	loved
O	their
O	king
O	and
O	praised
O	him
O	through
O	all
O	his
O	days
O	until
O	the
O	end
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	the
O	kings
O	who
O	followed
O	after
O	him
O	ruled
O	wisely
O	and
O	were
O	loved
O	.
