O	said
O	Alice
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	coaxing
O	tone
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	tried
O	hard
O	to
O	whistle
O	to
O	it;
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	terribly
O	frightened
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	at
O	the
O	thought
O	that
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	hungry
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	case
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	very
O	likely
O	to
O	eat
O	her
O	up
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	all
O	her
O	coaxing
O	.
O	Hardly
O	knowing
O	what
O	she
O	did
O	,
O	she
O	picked
O	up
O	a
O	little
O	bit
O	of
O	stick
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	it
O	out
O	to
O	the
O	puppy
O	:
O	whereupon
O	the
O	puppy
O	jumped
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	off
O	all
O	its
O	feet
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	yelp
O	of
O	delight
O	,
O	and
O	rushed
O	at
O	the
O	stick
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	believe
O	to
O	worry
O	it
O	:
O	then
O	Alice
O	dodged
O	behind
O	a
O	great
O	thistle
O	,
O	to
O	keep
O	herself
O	from
O	being
O	run
O	over;
O	and
O	,
O	the
O	moment
O	she
O	appeared
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	,
O	the
O	puppy
O	made
O	another
O	rush
O	at
O	the
O	stick
O	,
O	and
O	tumbled
O	head
O	over
O	heels
O	in
O	its
O	hurry
O	to
O	get
O	hold
O	of
O	it
O	:
O	then
O	Alice
O	,
O	thinking
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	like
O	having
O	a
O	game
O	of
O	play
O	with
O	a
O	cart-horse
O	,
O	and
O	expecting
O	every
O	moment
O	to
O	be
O	trampled
O	under
O	its
O	feet
O	,
O	ran
O	round
O	the
O	thistle
O	again
O	:
O	then
O	the
O	puppy
O	began
O	a
O	series
O	of
O	short
O	charges
O	at
O	the
O	stick
O	,
O	running
O	a
O	very
O	little
O	way
O	forward
O	each
O	time
O	and
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	barking
O	hoarsely
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	it
O	sat
O	down
O	a
O	good
O	way
O	off
O	,
O	panting
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	tongue
O	hanging
O	out
O	of
O	its
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	great
O	eyes
O	half
O	shut

O	seemed
O	to
O	Alice
O	a
O	good
O	opportunity
O	for
O	making
O	her
O	escape
O	:
O	so
O	she
O	set
O	off
O	at
O	once
