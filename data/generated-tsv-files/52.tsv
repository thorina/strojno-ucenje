O	It
O	is
O	well
O	known
O	that
O	the
O	Good
O	People
O	can
O	not
O	abide
O	meanness
O	.
O	They
O	like
O	to
O	be
O	liberally
O	dealt
O	with
O	when
O	they
O	beg
O	or
O	borrow
O	of
O	the
O	human
O	race
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	hand
O	,
O	to
O	those
O	who
O	come
O	to
O	them
O	in
O	need
O	,
O	they
O	are
O	invariably
O	generous
O	.
O	Now
O	there
O	once
O	lived
O	a
O	certain
O	Housewife
O	who
O	had
O	a
O	sharp
O	eye
O	to
O	her
O	own
O	interests
O	in
O	temporal
O	matters
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	alms
O	of
O	what
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	use
O	for
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	good
O	of
O	her
O	soul
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	a
O	Hillman
O	knocked
O	at
O	her
O	door
O	.
O	``
O	Can
O	you
O	lend
O	us
O	a
O	saucepan
O	,
O	good
O	Mother
O	?
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	.
O	``
O	There
O	'
O	s
O	a
O	wedding
O	in
O	the
O	hill
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	pots
O	are
O	in
O	use
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Is
O	he
O	to
O	have
O	one
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	the
O	servant
O	lass
O	who
O	had
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	``
O	Aye
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	the
O	Housewife
O	.
O	``
O	One
O	must
O	be
O	neighbourly
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	maid
O	was
O	taking
O	a
O	saucepan
O	from
O	the
O	shelf
O	,
O	she
O	pinched
O	her
O	arm
O	,
O	and
O	whispered
O	sharply
O	--
O	``
O	Not
O	that
O	,
O	you
O	slut
O	!
O	Get
O	the
O	old
O	one
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	cupboard
O	.
O	It
O	leaks
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Hillmen
O	are
O	so
O	neat
O	,
O	and
O	such
O	nimble
O	workers
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	are
O	sure
O	to
O	mend
O	it
O	before
O	they
O	send
O	it
O	home
O	.
O	So
O	one
O	obliges
O	the
O	Good
O	People
O	,
O	and
O	saves
O	sixpence
O	in
O	tinkering
O	.
O	But
O	you
O	'
O	ll
O	never
O	learn
O	to
O	be
O	notable
O	whilst
O	your
O	head
O	is
O	on
O	your
O	shoulders
O	.
O	``
O	Thus
O	reproached
O	,
O	the
O	maid
O	fetched
O	the
O	saucepan
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	laid
O	by
O	till
O	the
O	tinker
O	'
O	s
O	next
O	visit
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	dwarf
O	,
O	who
O	thanked
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	away
O	.
O	In
O	due
O	time
O	the
O	saucepan
O	was
O	returned
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	Housewife
O	had
O	foreseen
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	neatly
O	mended
O	and
O	ready
O	for
O	use
O	.
O	At
O	supper-time
O	the
O	maid
O	filled
O	the
O	pan
O	with
O	milk
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	fire
O	for
O	the
O	children
O	'
O	s
O	supper
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	the
O	milk
O	was
O	so
O	burnt
O	and
O	smoked
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	could
O	touch
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	the
O	pigs
O	refused
O	the
O	wash
O	into
O	which
O	it
O	was
O	thrown
O	.
O	``
O	Ah
O	,
O	good-for-nothing
O	hussy

O	cried
O	the
O	Housewife
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	refilled
O	the
O	pan
O	herself
O	,
O	``
O	you

O	a

O	a

O	chimney
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	whining
O	tone

O	nattering
O	,
O	discontented
O	old
O	body
O	going
O	over
O	her
O	grievances
O	.
O	The
O	Housewife
O	had
O	not
O	left
O	the
O	saucepan
O	for
O	two
O	minutes
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	milk
O	boiled
O	over
O	,

O	``
