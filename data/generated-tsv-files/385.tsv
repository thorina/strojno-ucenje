O	If
O	we
O	could
O	have
O	stood
O	upon
O	the
O	shores
O	of
O	Matagorda
O	Bay
O	with
O	the
O	Indians
O	on
O	a
O	certain
O	day
O	over
O	two
O	hundred
O	years
O	ago
O	we
O	might
O	have
O	been
O	witness
O	to
O	a
O	strange
O	sight
O	.
O	Before
O	us
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	spread
O	out
O	the
O	waters
O	of
O	a
O	broad
O	and
O	sheltered
O	harbor
O	opening
O	towards
O	the
O	sea
O	through
O	a
O	narrow
O	passage
O	which
O	was
O	obstructed
O	by
O	sandbars
O	and
O	an
O	island
O	.
O	One
O	'
O	s
O	eyes
O	could
O	not
O	reach
O	to
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	bay
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	fifty
O	miles
O	long
O	;
O	nor
O	could
O	they
O	see
O	land
O	beyond
O	the
O	sea-passage
O	,
O	for
O	that
O	opens
O	into
O	the
O	broad
O	Gulf
O	of
O	Mexico
O	.
O	Let
O	us
O	take
O	our
O	stand
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	and
O	see
O	what
O	we
O	can
O	see
O	.
O	There
O	appear
O	to
O	us
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	by
O	magic
O	,
O	the
O	forms
O	of
O	two
O	French
O	gentlemen
O	accompanied
O	by
O	a
O	small
O	party
O	of
O	soldiers
O	,
O	who
O	come
O	from
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	bay
O	,
O	and
O	carefully
O	thread
O	their
O	way
O	along
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	a
O	strange
O	company
O	of
O	men
O	.
O	The
O	leader
O	is
O	a
O	native
O	of
O	Rouen
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	says
O	that
O	few
O	of
O	his
O	companions
O	are
O	fit
O	for
O	anything
O	but
O	eating
O	.
O	He
O	thought
O	that
O	his
O	band
O	comprised
O	creatures
O	of
O	all
O	sorts
O	,
O	like
O	Noah
O	'
O	s
O	ark
O	,
O	but
O	unlike
O	the
O	collection
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	patriarch
O	,
O	they
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	few
O	of
O	them
O	worth
O	saving
O	.
O	As
O	we
O	look
O	,
O	the
O	men
O	begin
O	to
O	gather
O	together
O	the
O	pieces
O	of
O	drift-wood
O	that
O	the
O	peaceful
O	waves
O	throw
O	up
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	They
O	are
O	evidently
O	planning
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	raft
O	;
O	but
O	as
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	casts
O	his
O	lazy
O	eyes
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	in
O	which
O	ours
O	were
O	at
O	first
O	thrown
O	,
O	he
O	exclaims
O	with
O	evident
O	joy
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	native
O	French
O	_
O	``
O	Voila

O	words
O	to
O	that
O	effect
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	has
O	descried
O	two
O	ships
O	entering
O	the
O	bay
O	from
O	the
O	Gulf
O	.
O	The
O	ships
O	slowly
O	keep
O	their
O	way
O	towards
O	the
O	inland
O	coast
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	there
O	lands
O	a
O	man
O	evidently
O	higher
O	in
O	authority
O	than
O	any
O	we
O	have
O	seen
O	.
O	His
O	air
O	is
O	calm
O	,
O	dignified
O	,
O	forceful
O	,
O	persistent
O	.
O	He
O	announces
O	to
O	those
O	about
O	him
O	that
O	they
O	are
O	at
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	mouths
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	Mississippi
O	,
O	or
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	well
O	calls
O	it
O	_
O	``
O	La
O	riviaere
O	fu-neste
O	,

O	long
O	,

O	towards
O	the
O	village

O	the

O	.
O	Just
O	as

O	entered
O	its
O	precincts

O	inhabitants
O	,

O	his

O	beat
O	quickly
O	as
O	he
O	looked
O	again
O	towards
O	the
O	water
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	_Aimable_
O	furling
O	its
O	sails
O	,
O	a
O	sure
O	token
O	to
O	him
O	that

O	indeed
O	struck
O	the
O	rock

O	the
O	stores
O	intended
O	for

O	.
O	Undaunted
O	by
O	the
O	prospect
O	,
O	or
O	even
O	by
O	the
O	dark
O	picture
O	that
O	his
O	imagination
O	conjured
O	up
O	,
O	he
O	pressed
O	onward
O	among
O	the
O	miserable
O	savages
O	,
O	until
O	his
O	man
O	had
O	been
O	recovered
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	returned
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	his
O	vessel
O	on
O	her
O	side
O	,
O	a
O	forlorn
O	spectacle
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	wind
O	rose
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sea
O	beat
O	upon
O	the
O	helpless
O	hulk
O	.
O	It
O	rocked
O	backwards
O	and
O	forwards
O	on
O	its
O	uneasy
O	bed
O	;
O	its
O	treasures
O	of
O	boxes
O	and
O	bales
O	and
O	casks
O	were
O	strewn
O	over
O	the
O	waters
O	;
O	the
O	greedy
O	Indians
O	made
O	haste
O	to
O	seize
O	what
O	they
O	could
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	night
O	approached
O	the
O	hurriedly
O	organized
O	patrol
O	of
O	soldiers
O	had
O	all
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	do
O	to
O	face
O	the
O	deepening
O	storm
O	and
O	protect
O	their
O	goods
O	from
O	the
O	treacherous
O	natives
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	less
O	treacherous
O	waves
O	cast
O	them
O	upon
O	the
O	sands
O	of
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	Who
O	were
O	these
O	men
O	,
O	thus
O	unceremoniously
O	thrust
O	upon
O	the
O	shores
O	of
O	the
O	New
O	World
O	?
O	How
O	did
O	it
O	happen
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	found
O	at
O	a
O	point
O	that
O	no
O	European
O	had
O	before
O	seen
O	?
O	Perhaps
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	necessary
O	to
O	ask
O	how
O	they
O	happened
O	to
O	mistake
O	the
O	entrance
O	to
O	Matagorda
O	Bay
O	for
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	broad
O	mouths
O	of
O	the
O	Mississippi
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	Frenchmen
O	.
O	So
O	much
O	their
O	speech
O	has
O	told
O	us
O	.
O	The
O	leader
O	was
O	Robert
O	Cavelier
O	,
O	Sieur
O	de
O	La
O	Salle
O	,
O	a
O	man
O	whom
O	the
O	historian
O	Bancroft
O	says
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	superior
O	among
O	his
O	countrymen
O	for
O	force
O	of
O	will
O	and
O	vast
O	conceptions
O	;
O	for
O	various
O	knowledge
O	,
O	and
O	quick
O	adaptation
O	of
O	his
O	genius
O	to
O	untried
O	circumstances
O	;
O	for
O	sublime
O	magnanimity
O	that
O	resigned
O	itself
O	to
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	Heaven
O	and
O	yet
O	triumphed
O	over
O	affliction
O	by
O	energy
O	of
O	purpose
O	and
O	unfaltering
O	hope
O	.
O	In
O	early
O	life
O	he
O	had
O	renounced
O	his
O	inheritance
O	and
O	devoted
O	himself
O	to
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	the
O	Church
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	soon
O	left
O	the
O	order
O	of
O	Jesuits
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	entered
O	,
O	because
O	,
O	as
O	Mr
O	.
O	Parkman
O	surmises
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	relish
O	being
O	all
O	his
O	life
O	the
O	moved
O	and
O	not
O	the
O	mover
O	;
O	because
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	give
O	up
O	his
O	individuality
O	and
O	remain
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	body
O	,
O	all
O	of
O	whom
O	were
O	compelled
O	to
O	march
O	in
O	a
O	track
O	pointed
O	out
O	to
O	them
O	by
O	a
O	superior
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	pleasant
O	to
O	know
O	that
O	he
O	left
O	the
O	order
O	with
O	good
O	feelings
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	.
O	In
O	1667
O	,
O	we
O	find
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	already
O	entered
O	upon
O	the
O	career
O	of
O	adventure
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	his
O	life
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	spent
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	sailed
O	to
O	Canada
O	,
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	attraction
O	for
O	ambitious
O	French
O	youth
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	remained
O	several
O	years
O	,
O	making
O	the
O	familiar
O	acquaintance
O	of
O	the
O	Indians
O	and
O	learning
O	their
O	language
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	dreaming
O	,
O	like
O	many
O	others
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	passage
O	to
O	China
O	through
O	the
O	rivers
O	that
O	came
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	westward
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	looked
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	vivid
O	imagination
O	over
O	the
O	vast
O	plains
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	West
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	become
O	filled
O	with
O	brilliant
O	visions
O	of
O	an
O	empire
O	that
O	he
O	hoped
O	some
O	day
O	to
O	see
O	established
O	there
O	for
O	France
O	.
O	We
O	have
O	already
O	learned
O	how
O	France
O	took
O	possession
O	of
O	the
O	region
O	,
O	at
O	this
O	very
O	period
O	.
O	In
O	such
O	state
O	of
O	mind
O	,
O	La
O	Salle
O	sailed
O	back
O	to
O	France
O	in
O	the
O	autumn
O	of
O	1674
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	well
O	received
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	year
O	returned
O	,
O	ennobled
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	than
O	ever
O	determined
O	to
O	push
O	his
O	grand
O	scheme
O	for
O	the
O	acquisition
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	West
O	.
O	His
O	was
O	no
O	plan
O	to
O	indulge
O	in
O	theatrical
O	spectacles
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	take
O	actual
O	possession
O	.
O	Year
O	after
O	year
O	we
O	see
O	him
O	steadily
O	pursuing
O	his
O	single
O	plan
O	.
O	He
O	thinks
O	nothing
O	of
O	crossing
O	the
O	Atlantic
O	,
O	of
O	pushing
O	his
O	course
O	through
O	the
O	trackless
O	woods
O	,
O	or
O	of
O	paddling
O	his
O	frail
O	canoe
O	over
O	the
O	wild
O	waters
O	of
O	the
O	broad
O	lakes
O	.
O	Indians
O	did
O	not
O	daunt
O	him
O	by
O	their
O	cruelty
O	,
O	nor
O	wild
O	beasts
O	affright
O	him
O	by
O	their
O	numbers
O	and
O	ferocity
O	.
O	Onward
O	,
O	ever
O	onward
O	,
O	He
O	pressed
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	year
O	1680
O	,
O	we
O	find
O	him
O	taking
O	possession
O	by
O	actual
O	occupation
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	region
O	now
O	comprising
O	the
O	State
O	of
O	Illinois
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	that
O	civilization
O	had
O	asserted
O	itself
O	there
O	.
O	La
O	Salle
O	built
O	a
O	fort
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	memory
O	of
O	the
O	trials
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	called
O	it
O	_Crevecoeur_
O	,
O	which
O	signified
O	Broken-heart
O	;
O	but
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	testify
O	to
O	any
O	broken
O	courage
O	on
O	his
O	part
O	;
O	--
O	rather
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	monument
O	to
O	the
O	obstacles
O	that
O	his
O	persistence
O	had
O	surmounted
O	.
O	Two
O	years
O	later
O	,
O	we
O	find
O	his
O	canoe
O	,
O	which
O	seems
O	to
O	our
O	eyes
O	now
O	the
O	emblem
O	of
O	an
O	aggressive
O	civilization
O	,
O	flitting
O	along
O	the
O	Illinois
O	River
O	,
O	entering
O	the
O	muddy
O	Mississippi
O	,
O	and
O	floating
O	down
O	its
O	thousand
O	miles
O	to
O	the
O	Gulf
O	.
O	This
O	is
O	not
O	the
O	whole
O	picture
O	,
O	however
O	.
O	We
O	see
O	the
O	party
O	start
O	from
O	the
O	Chicago
O	River
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	cold
O	weather
O	of
O	December
O	.
O	The
O	rivers
O	are
O	frozen
O	.
O	Canoes
O	must
O	be
O	dragged
O	over
O	their
O	snowy
O	and
O	icy
O	surfaces
O	,
O	and
O	baggage
O	can
O	be
O	transported
O	in
O	no
O	way
O	but
O	upon
O	rough
O	sledges
O	.
O	Can
O	you
O	not
O	see
O	the
O	slow
O	procession
O	of
O	fifty
O	persons
O	dragging
O	themselves
O	along
O	day
O	after
O	day
O	through
O	the
O	region
O	inhabited
O	but
O	by
O	savages
O	and
O	wild
O	beasts
O	,
O	suffering
O	from
O	cold
O	and
O	hunger
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	held
O	to
O	their
O	duty
O	by
O	the
O	persevering
O	leader
O	who
O	had
O	brought
O	them
O	there
O	?
O	There
O	are
O	twenty-three
O	Frenchmen
O	,
O	eighteen
O	Indian
O	braves
O	,
O	belonging
O	to
O	those
O	terrible
O	Abenakis
O	and
O	Mohegans
O	whose
O	``
O	midnight
O	yells
O	had
O	,
O	``
O	as
O	Mr
O	.
O	Parkman
O	says
O	,
O	``
O	startled
O	the
O	border
O	hamlets
O	of
O	New
O	England
O	;
O	who
O	had
O	danced
O	around
O	Puritan
O	scalps
O	,
O	and
O	whom
O	Puritan
O	imaginations
O	painted
O	as
O	incarnate
O	fiends
O	.
O	``
O	There
O	were
O	besides
O	,
O	ten
O	squaws
O	and
O	three
O	children
O	.
O	A
O	motley
O	collection
O	and
O	one
O	not
O	calculated
O	to
O	inspire
O	confidence
O	nor
O	hope
O	for
O	the
O	success
O	of
O	any
O	undertaking
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	until
O	they
O	had
O	passed
O	the
O	point
O	where
O	the
O	river
O	broadens
O	into
O	Lake
O	Peoria
O	that
O	they
O	found
O	water
O	in
O	which
O	they
O	could
O	float
O	their
O	canoes
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	continued
O	on
O	,
O	until
O	early
O	in
O	February
O	they
O	found
O	themselves
O	on
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	Mississippi
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	ice
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	canoe
O	could
O	navigate
O	it
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	delay
O	of
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	,
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	river
O	free
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	took
O	up
O	their
O	course
O	southwards
O	.
O	A
O	day
O	more
O	brought
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	confluence
O	of
O	the
O	muddy
O	Missouri
O	,
O	which
O	some
O	of
O	my
O	readers
O	have
O	probably
O	seen
O	,
O	where
O	a
O	mighty
O	stream
O	coming
O	down
O	from
O	distant
O	mountains
O	,
O	enters
O	another
O	not
O	so
O	mighty
O	as
O	itself
O	,
O	and
O	plowing
O	its
O	way
O	across
O	its
O	current
O	,
O	burrows
O	under
O	the
O	soil
O	on
O	the
O	opposite
O	shore
O	.
O	This
O	did
O	not
O	detain
O	the
O	voyagers
O	,
O	though
O	they
O	encamped
O	there
O	over
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	pursued
O	their
O	course
O	towards
O	the
O	unknown
O	.
O	A
O	few
O	days
O	showed
O	them
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	Ohio
O	,
O	but
O	still
O	they
O	pressed
O	onward
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	near
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	February
O	,
O	the
O	temperature
O	was
O	growing
O	perceptibly
O	warmer
O	as
O	they
O	approached
O	the
O	South
O	.
O	At
O	a
O	certain
O	point
O	they
O	encamped
O	and
O	sent
O	out
O	their
O	hunters
O	for
O	game
O	.
O	One
O	did
O	not
O	return
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	horror
O	seized
O	the
O	others
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	overtaken
O	and
O	killed
O	by
O	hostile
O	Indians
O	.
O	Day
O	after
O	day
O	the
O	woods
O	were
O	scoured
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	finding
O	the
O	missing
O	companion
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	seemed
O	vain
O	.
O	A
O	fort
O	was
O	erected
O	for
O	the
O	protection
O	of
O	the
O	party
O	on
O	a
O	high
O	bluff
O	,
O	and
O	named
O	for
O	the
O	lost
O	hunter
O	,
O	Prudhomme
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	they
O	met
O	some
O	Chickasaw
O	Indians
O	,
O	and
O	messages
O	of
O	amity
O	were
O	exchanged
O	through
O	them
O	with
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	their
O	village
O	,
O	not
O	far
O	distant
O	.
O	Soon
O	afterwards
O	Prudhomme
O	was
O	discovered
O	,
O	half-dead
O	from
O	exposure
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	lost
O	his
O	way
O	while
O	hunting
O	.
O	Thus
O	the
O	expedition
O	progressed
O	for
O	many
O	days
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	little
O	canoes
O	found
O	themselves
O	thrust
O	out
O	through
O	the
O	turbid
O	channels
O	of
O	the
O	delta
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	clear
O	salt
O	waters
O	of
O	the
O	Gulf
O	of
O	Mexico
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	stopped
O	on
O	the
O	way
O	after
O	leaving
O	Fort
O	Prudhomme
O	,
O	at
O	several
O	Indian
O	towns
O	,
O	had
O	been
O	well
O	treated
O	by
O	the
O	natives
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	mouths
O	of
O	the
O	Arkansas
O	and
O	the
O	Red
O	rivers
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	valley
O	of
O	the
O	Fatal
O	River
O	had
O	been
O	laid
O	bare
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	La
O	Salle
O	thought
O	the
O	time
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	take
O	formal
O	possession
O	for
O	his
O	sovereign
O	.
O	Near
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	the
O	party
O	came
O	together
O	on
O	the
O	ninth
O	of
O	April
O	,
O	1682
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	ceremony
O	took
O	place
O	that
O	was
O	very
O	similar
O	to
O	the
O	one
O	at
O	the
O	Sault
O	Ste
O	.
O	Marie
O	,
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	less
O	than
O	eleven
O	years
O	before
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	France
O	had
O	taken
O	possession
O	of
O	the
O	Northwest
O	.
O	It
O	did
O	not
O	rival
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	magnificence
O	with
O	which
O	it
O	was
O	conducted
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	ceremonial
O	was
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	elaborated
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	better
O	basis
O	of
O	fact
O	,
O	for
O	La
O	Salle
O	had
O	actually
O	passed
O	through
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	region
O	which
O	he
O	now
O	claimed
O	.
O	A
O	column
O	was
O	erected
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	tablet
O	of
O	lead
O	was
O	buried
O	near
O	it
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	those
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	placed
O	in
O	the
O	ground
O	at
O	various
O	other
O	places
O	by
O	Frenchmen
O	,
O	bearing
O	testimony
O	to
O	the
O	fact
O	that
O	Louis
O	the
O	Great
O	claimed
O	to
O	rule
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	nearly
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	November
O	of
O	the
O	following
O	year
O	,
O	when
O	La
O	Salle
O	reached
O	Quebec
O	,
O	after
O	having
O	retraced
O	his
O	route
O	by
O	long
O	and
O	tedious
O	stages
O	up
O	the
O	rivers
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	followed
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	Gulf
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	France
O	to
O	tell
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	his
O	travels
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	use
O	his
O	influence
O	to
O	induce
O	the
O	government
O	to
O	send
O	out
O	an
O	expedition
O	to
O	take
O	controlling
O	possession
O	of
O	the
O	Mississippi
O	region
O	.
O	He
O	argued
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	powers
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	by
O	fortifying
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	the
O	French
O	might
O	control
O	the
O	continent
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	really
O	a
O	grand
O	and
O	brilliant
O	proposition
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	his
O	minister
O	gave
O	more
O	than
O	was
O	demanded
O	.
O	Four
O	vessels
O	were
O	prepared
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	that
O	La
O	Salle
O	asked
O	for
O	.
O	The
O	expedition
O	comprised
O	a
O	hundred
O	soldiers
O	,
O	thirty
O	volunteers
O	,
O	many
O	mechanics
O	and
O	laborers
O	,
O	several
O	families
O	and
O	a
O	few
O	girls
O	,
O	who
O	looked
O	forward
O	to
O	certain
O	marriage
O	in
O	the
O	new
O	land
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	twenty-fourth
O	of
O	July
O	,
O	La
O	Salle
O	set
O	sail
O	from
O	Roehelle
O	,
O	with
O	four
O	hundred
O	men
O	in
O	his
O	four
O	vessels
O	,
O	leaving
O	an
O	affectionate
O	and
O	comforting
O	letter
O	as
O	his
O	last
O	farewell
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	at
O	Rouen
O	.
O	We
O	have
O	already
O	seen
O	how
O	he
O	was
O	thrown
O	upon
O	the
O	shores
O	of
O	the
O	New
O	World
O	.
O	There
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	sands
O	of
O	Matagorda
O	Bay
O	,
O	with
O	nothing
O	to
O	eat
O	but
O	oysters
O	and
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	porridge
O	made
O	of
O	the
O	flour
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	saved
O	,
O	the
O	homesick
O	party
O	of
O	downcast
O	men
O	and
O	sorrowing
O	women
O	encamped
O	until
O	their
O	leader
O	could
O	tell
O	them
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	They
O	did
O	not
O	even
O	know
O	where
O	they
O	were
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	intending
O	to
O	conquer
O	the
O	Spaniards
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	knew
O	nothing
O	of
O	their
O	whereabouts
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	attacked
O	by
O	Indians
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	,
O	some
O	three
O	weeks
O	after
O	the
O	wreck
O	,
O	the
O	commander
O	of
O	the
O	ships
O	sailed
O	away
O	for
O	France
O	leaving
O	La
O	Salle
O	and
O	his
O	forlorn
O	company
O	behind
O	!
O	A
O	site
O	was
O	soon
O	chosen
O	on
O	the
O	river
O	now
O	called
O	Lavaca
O	(
O	a
O	corruption
O	of
O	_La
O	Vache_
O	,
O	the
O	cow
O	,
O	a
O	name
O	given
O	it
O	because
O	buffaloes
O	had
O	been
O	seen
O	there
O	)
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	fort
O	was
O	built
O	called
O	St
O	.
O	Louis
O	.
O	La
O	Salle
O	had
O	scarcely
O	finished
O	this
O	establishment
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	determined
O	to
O	search
O	for
O	the
O	Mississippi
O	River
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	by
O	that
O	time
O	concluded
O	from
O	explorations
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	found
O	it
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	last
O	day
O	of
O	October
O	,
O	he
O	started
O	,
O	and
O	towards
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	March
O	,
O	the
O	party
O	returned
O	,
O	tattered
O	and
O	worn
O	,
O	almost
O	ready
O	to
O	die
O	;
O	but
O	though
O	the
O	strong
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	leader
O	had
O	given
O	away
O	,
O	his
O	stronger
O	spirit
O	was
O	still
O	unbroken
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	soon
O	determined
O	to
O	set
O	out
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	Illinois
O	region
O	where
O	he
O	left
O	a
O	colony
O	formerly
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	he
O	felt
O	sure
O	he
O	could
O	obtain
O	relief
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	chance
O	for
O	them
O	to
O	return
O	directly
O	to
O	France
O	since
O	their
O	vessels
O	were
O	all
O	gone
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	seemed
O	their
O	only
O	hope
O	.
O	A
O	party
O	of
O	twenty
O	was
O	formed
O	to
O	undertake
O	the
O	perilous
O	enterprise
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	twenty-second
O	of
O	April
O	,
O	1686
O	,
O	they
O	took
O	their
O	way
O	from
O	the
O	fort
O	,
O	bearing
O	on
O	their
O	persons
O	the
O	contributions
O	that
O	their
O	fellows
O	who
O	were
O	to
O	remain
O	had
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	bring
O	together
O	for
O	their
O	comfort
O	.
O	The
O	party
O	experienced
O	a
O	variety
O	of
O	hardships
O	,
O	quarrelled
O	among
O	themselves
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	morning
O	of
O	the
O	eighteenth
O	of
O	March
O	,
O	1687
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	shot
O	and
O	killed
O	the
O	brave
O	leader
O	.
O	The
O	remainder
O	kept
O	on
O	,
O	finally
O	reached
O	Canada
O	and
O	were
O	taken
O	to
O	their
O	native
O	land
O	.
O	To
O	the
O	colonists
O	at
O	Fort
O	St
O	.
O	Louis
O	,
O	no
O	ground
O	of
O	hope
O	ever
O	appeared
O	,
O	though
O	they
O	felt
O	that
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	France
O	must
O	have
O	an
O	interest
O	in
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	they
O	kept
O	a
O	look-out
O	over
O	the
O	water
O	for
O	a
O	ship
O	coming
O	to
O	their
O	relief
O	.
O	It
O	never
O	came
O	,
O	alas
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	one
O	knows
O	to
O	this
O	day
O	what
O	became
O	of
O	the
O	Lost
O	Exiles
O	of
O	Texas
O	!
