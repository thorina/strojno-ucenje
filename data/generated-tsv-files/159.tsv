O	After
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	his
O	fellows
O	,
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	rode
O	long
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	until
O	,
O	one
O	evening
O	,
O	he
O	reached
O	a
O	monastery
O	where
O	he
O	sought
O	shelter
O	for
O	the
O	night
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	chapel
O	to
O	hear
O	mass
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	espied
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	,
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	laid
O	on
O	a
O	richly
O	adorned
O	couch
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	aged
O	man
O	were
O	dead
O	,
O	but
O	presently
O	,
O	raising
O	himself
O	in
O	his
O	bed
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	off
O	his
O	crown
O	and
O	,
O	delivering
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	priest
O	,
O	bade
O	him
O	place
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	altar
O	.
O	So
O	when
O	the
O	service
O	was
O	concluded
O	,
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	asked
O	who
O	the
O	aged
O	king
O	might
O	be
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	was
O	told
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	none
O	other
O	than
O	King
O	Evelake
O	who
O	accompanied
O	Joseph
O	of
O	Arimathea
O	to
O	Britain
O	.
O	And
O	on
O	a
O	certain
O	occasion
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	approached
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	nigher
O	than
O	was
O	reverent
O	and
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	impiety
O	,
O	God
O	had
O	punished
O	him
O	with
O	blindness
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	he
O	repented
O	and
O	,
O	entreating
O	God
O	earnestly
O	,
O	had
O	obtained
O	his
O	petition
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	not
O	die
O	until
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	spotless
O	knight
O	who
O	should
O	be
O	descended
O	from
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	ninth
O	degree
O	.
O	(
O	This
O	his
O	desire
O	was
O	fulfilled
O	later
O	when
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	came
O	thither
O	;
O	after
O	which
O	,
O	he
O	died
O	and
O	was
O	buried
O	by
O	the
O	good
O	knight
O	.
O	)
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	continued
O	his
O	journey
O	and
O	presently
O	met
O	with
O	twenty
O	knights
O	who
O	bore
O	on
O	a
O	bier
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	a
O	dead
O	knight
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	espied
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	,
O	they
O	demanded
O	of
O	him
O	who
O	he
O	was
O	and
O	whence
O	he
O	came
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	told
O	them
O	,
O	whereupon
O	they
O	all
O	shouted
O	,
O	``
O	Slay
O	him
O	!
O	slay
O	him
O	!
O	``
O	and
O	setting
O	upon
O	him
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	they
O	killed
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	slain
O	him
O	but
O	that
O	the
O	good
O	knight
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahad
O	,
O	passing
O	that
O	way
O	by
O	chance
O	,
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	rescue
O	and
O	put
O	his
O	assailants
O	to
O	flight
O	.
O	Then
O	Galahad
O	rode
O	away
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	might
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	thanked
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	was
O	left
O	,
O	horseless
O	and
O	alone
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	So
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	continued
O	his
O	journey
O	on
O	foot
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	he
O	might
O	;
O	and
O	ever
O	the
O	way
O	became
O	lonelier
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	shores
O	of
O	a
O	vast
O	sea
O	.
O	There
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	abode
O	many
O	days
O	,
O	without
O	food
O	and
O	desolate
O	,
O	doubting
O	whether
O	he
O	should
O	ever
O	escape
O	thence
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
O	,
O	looking
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	,
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	descried
O	a
O	ship
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	drew
O	nearer
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	how
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	hung
O	with
O	satin
O	and
O	velvet
O	.
O	Presently
O	it
O	reached
O	the
O	land
O	and
O	out
O	of
O	it
O	there
O	stepped
O	a
O	lady
O	of
O	marvellous
O	beauty
O	,
O	who
O	asked
O	him
O	how
O	he
O	came
O	there
O	;
O	``
O	For
O	know
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	ye
O	are
O	like
O	to
O	die
O	here
O	by
O	hunger
O	or
O	mischance
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	He
O	whom
O	I
O	serve
O	will
O	protect
O	me
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	know
O	well
O	whom
O	ye
O	desire
O	most
O	to
O	see
O	,

O	said
O	the
O	lady
O	.
O	``
O	Ye
O	would
O	meet
O	with
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	who
O	bears
O	the
O	red-cross
O	shield
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Ah
O	!
O	lady
O	,
O	I
O	pray
O	you
O	tell
O	me
O	where
O	I
O	may
O	find
O	him
O	,
O	``
O	cried
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	.
O	``
O	With
O	a
O	good
O	will
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	damsel
O	;
O	``
O	if
O	ye
O	will
O	but
O	promise
O	me
O	your
O	service
O	when
O	I
O	shall
O	ask
O	for
O	it
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	lead
O	you
O	to
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	met
O	him
O	of
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	promised
O	gladly
O	to
O	serve
O	her
O	when
O	she
O	should
O	need
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	lady
O	asked
O	him
O	how
O	long
O	he
O	had
O	fasted
O	.
O	``
O	For
O	three
O	days
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	.
O	Immediately
O	she
O	gave
O	orders
O	to
O	her
O	attendants
O	forthwith
O	to
O	pitch
O	a
O	tent
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	a
O	table
O	with
O	all
O	manner
O	of
O	delicacies
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	these
O	she
O	invited
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	to
O	partake
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	pray
O	you
O	,
O	fair
O	lady
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	,
O	``
O	who
O	are
O	ye
O	that
O	show
O	me
O	such
O	kindness
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	Truly
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	lady
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	but
O	a
O	hapless
O	damsel
O	,
O	driven
O	forth
O	from
O	my
O	inheritance
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	lord
O	whom
O	I
O	have
O	chanced
O	to
O	displease
O	.
O	I
O	implore
O	you
O	,
O	sir
O	knight
O	,
O	by
O	your
O	vows
O	of
O	knighthood
O	,
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	your
O	aid
O	.
O	``
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	promised
O	her
O	all
O	the
O	aid
O	he
O	could
O	give
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	she
O	bade
O	him
O	lie
O	down
O	and
O	sleep
O	,
O	and
O	herself
O	took
O	off
O	his
O	helmet
O	,
O	and
O	unclasped
O	his
O	sword-belt
O	.
O	So
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	slept
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	waked
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	another
O	feast
O	prepared
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	given
O	the
O	rarest
O	and
O	the
O	strongest
O	wines
O	that
O	ever
O	he
O	had
O	tasted
O	.
O	Thus
O	they
O	made
O	merry
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	lady
O	begged
O	Percivale
O	to
O	rest
O	him
O	there
O	awhile
O	,
O	promising
O	him
O	all
O	that
O	ever
O	he
O	could
O	desire
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	vow
O	himself
O	to
O	her
O	service
O	,
O	almost
O	he
O	forgot
O	the
O	quest
O	to
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	vowed
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	consented
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	his
O	eye
O	fell
O	upon
O	his
O	sword
O	where
O	it
O	lay
O	.
O	Now
O	in
O	the
O	sword-hilt
O	there
O	was
O	set
O	a
O	red
O	cross
O	and
O	,
O	seeing
O	it
O	,
O	Percivale
O	called
O	to
O	mind
O	his
O	vow
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	thinking
O	on
O	it
O	,
O	he
O	signed
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	cross
O	on
O	his
O	forehead
O	.
O	Instantly
O	,
O	the
O	tent
O	was
O	overthrown
O	and
O	vanished
O	in
O	thick
O	smoke
O	;
O	and
O	she
O	who
O	had
O	appeared
O	a
O	lovely
O	woman
O	disappeared
O	from
O	his
O	sight
O	in
O	semblance
O	of
O	a
O	fiend
O	.
O	Then
O	was
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	sore
O	ashamed
O	that
O	almost
O	he
O	had
O	yielded
O	to
O	the
O	temptings
O	of
O	the
O	Evil
O	One
O	and
O	earnestly
O	he
O	prayed
O	that
O	his
O	sin
O	might
O	be
O	forgiven
O	him
O	.
O	Thus
O	he
O	remained
O	in
O	prayer
O	far
O	into
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	bewailing
O	his
O	weakness
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	dawn
O	appeared
O	,
O	a
O	ship
O	drew
O	nigh
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	Sir
O	Percivale
O	entered
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	find
O	no
O	one
O	there
O	;
O	so
O	commending
O	himself
O	to
O	God
O	,
O	he
O	determined
O	to
O	remain
O	thereon
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	borne
O	over
O	the
O	seas
O	for
O	many
O	days
O	,
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	whither
O	.
