O	There
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	stream
O	in
O	ancient
O	times
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	north
O	of
O	Italy
O	,
O	which
O	flowed
O	eastward
O	into
O	the
O	Adriatic
O	Sea
O	,
O	called
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	.
O	This
O	stream
O	has
O	been
O	immortalized
O	by
O	the
O	transactions
O	which
O	we
O	are
O	now
O	about
O	to
O	describe
O	.
O	The
O	Rubicon
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	important
O	boundary
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	itself
O	so
O	small
O	and
O	insignificant
O	that
O	it
O	is
O	now
O	impossible
O	to
O	determine
O	which
O	of
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	little
O	brooks
O	here
O	running
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	is
O	entitled
O	to
O	its
O	name
O	and
O	renown
O	.
O	In
O	history
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	is
O	a
O	grand
O	,
O	permanent
O	,
O	and
O	conspicuous
O	stream
O	,
O	gazed
O	upon
O	with
O	continued
O	interest
O	by
O	all
O	mankind
O	for
O	nearly
O	twenty
O	centuries
O	;
O	in
O	nature
O	it
O	is
O	an
O	uncertain
O	rivulet
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	doubtful
O	and
O	undetermined
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	lost
O	.
O	The
O	Rubicon
O	originally
O	derived
O	its
O	importance
O	from
O	the
O	fact
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	boundary
O	between
O	all
O	that
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	north
O	of
O	Italy
O	which
O	is
O	formed
O	by
O	the
O	valley
O	of
O	the
O	Po
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	richest
O	and
O	most
O	magnificent
O	countries
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	more
O	southern
O	Roman
O	territories
O	.
O	This
O	country
O	of
O	the
O	Po
O	constituted
O	what
O	was
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	called
O	the
O	hither
O	Gaul
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	a
O	Roman
O	province
O	.
O	It
O	belonged
O	now
O	to
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	jurisdiction
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	commander
O	in
O	Gaul
O	.
O	All
O	south
O	of
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	was
O	territory
O	reserved
O	for
O	the
O	immediate
O	jurisdiction
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	The
O	Romans
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	protect
O	themselves
O	from
O	any
O	danger
O	which
O	might
O	threaten
O	their
O	own
O	liberties
O	from
O	the
O	immense
O	armies
O	which
O	they
O	raised
O	for
O	the
O	conquest
O	of
O	foreign
O	nations
O	,
O	had
O	imposed
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	very
O	strict
O	limitations
O	and
O	restrictions
O	in
O	respect
O	to
O	the
O	approach
O	of
O	these
O	armies
O	to
O	the
O	capital
O	.
O	The
O	Rubicon
O	was
O	the
O	limit
O	on
O	this
O	northern
O	side
O	.
O	Generals
O	commanding
O	in
O	Gaul
O	were
O	never
O	to
O	pass
O	it
O	.
O	To
O	cross
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	with
O	an
O	army
O	on
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	Rome
O	was
O	rebellion
O	and
O	treason
O	.
O	Hence
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	became
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	,
O	the
O	visible
O	sign
O	and
O	symbol
O	of
O	civil
O	restriction
O	to
O	military
O	power
O	.
O	As
O	Caesar
O	found
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	his
O	service
O	in
O	Gaul
O	drawing
O	toward
O	a
O	conclusion
O	,
O	he
O	turned
O	his
O	thoughts
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	toward
O	Rome
O	,
O	endeavoring
O	to
O	strengthen
O	his
O	interest
O	there
O	by
O	every
O	means
O	in
O	his
O	power
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	circumvent
O	and
O	thwart
O	the
O	designs
O	of
O	Pompey
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	agents
O	and
O	partisans
O	in
O	Rome
O	who
O	acted
O	for
O	him
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	name
O	.
O	He
O	sent
O	immense
O	sums
O	of
O	money
O	to
O	these
O	men
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	employed
O	in
O	such
O	ways
O	as
O	would
O	most
O	tend
O	to
O	secure
O	the
O	favor
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	.
O	He
O	ordered
O	the
O	Forum
O	to
O	be
O	rebuilt
O	with
O	great
O	magnificence
O	.
O	He
O	arranged
O	great
O	celebrations
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	people
O	were
O	entertained
O	with
O	an
O	endless
O	succession
O	of
O	games
O	,
O	spectacles
O	,
O	and
O	public
O	feasts
O	.
O	When
O	his
O	daughter
O	Julia
O	,
O	Pompey
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	,
O	died
O	,
O	he
O	celebrated
O	her
O	funeral
O	with
O	indescribable
O	splendor
O	.
O	He
O	distributed
O	corn
O	in
O	immense
O	quantities
O	among
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	sent
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	captives
O	home
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	trained
O	as
O	gladiators
O	to
O	fight
O	in
O	the
O	theatres
O	for
O	their
O	amusement
O	.
O	In
O	many
O	cases
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	found
O	men
O	of
O	talents
O	and
O	influence
O	among
O	the
O	populace
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	become
O	involved
O	in
O	debt
O	by
O	their
O	dissipations
O	and
O	extravagance
O	,
O	he
O	paid
O	their
O	debts
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	secured
O	their
O	influence
O	on
O	his
O	side
O	.
O	Men
O	were
O	astounded
O	at
O	the
O	magnitude
O	of
O	these
O	expenditures
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	multitude
O	rejoiced
O	thoughtlessly
O	in
O	the
O	pleasures
O	thus
O	provided
O	for
O	them
O	,
O	the
O	more
O	reflecting
O	and
O	considerate
O	trembled
O	at
O	the
O	greatness
O	of
O	the
O	power
O	which
O	was
O	so
O	rapidly
O	rising
O	to
O	overshadow
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	It
O	increased
O	their
O	anxiety
O	to
O	observe
O	that
O	Pompey
O	was
O	gaining
O	the
O	same
O	kind
O	of
O	influence
O	and
O	ascendency
O	,
O	too
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	not
O	the
O	advantage
O	which
O	Caesar
O	enjoyed
O	in
O	the
O	prodigious
O	wealth
O	obtained
O	from
O	the
O	rich
O	countries
O	over
O	which
O	Caesar
O	ruled
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	possessed
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	the
O	advantage
O	of
O	being
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	at
O	Rome
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	securing
O	,
O	by
O	his
O	character
O	and
O	action
O	there
O	,
O	a
O	very
O	wide
O	personal
O	popularity
O	and
O	influence
O	.
O	Pompey
O	was
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	the
O	idol
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	.
O	At
O	one
O	time
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	absent
O	from
O	Rome
O	,
O	at
O	Naples
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	taken
O	sick
O	.
O	After
O	being
O	for
O	some
O	days
O	in
O	considerable
O	danger
O	,
O	the
O	crisis
O	passed
O	favorably
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	recovered
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	Naples
O	proposed
O	a
O	public
O	thanksgiving
O	to
O	the
O	gods
O	,
O	to
O	celebrate
O	his
O	restoration
O	to
O	health
O	.
O	The
O	plan
O	was
O	adopted
O	by
O	acclamation
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	example
O	thus
O	set
O	extended
O	from
O	city
O	to
O	city
O	,
O	until
O	it
O	had
O	spread
O	throughout
O	Italy
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	whole
O	country
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	processions
O	,
O	games
O	,
O	shows
O	,
O	and
O	celebrations
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	instituted
O	everywhere
O	in
O	honor
O	of
O	the
O	event
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Pompey
O	returned
O	from
O	Naples
O	to
O	Rome
O	the
O	towns
O	on
O	the
O	way
O	could
O	not
O	afford
O	room
O	for
O	the
O	crowds
O	that
O	came
O	forth
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	high
O	roads
O	,
O	the
O	villages
O	,
O	the
O	ports
O	,
O	says
O	Plutarch
O	,
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	sacrifices
O	and
O	entertainments
O	.
O	Many
O	received
O	him
O	with
O	garlands
O	on
O	their
O	heads
O	and
O	torches
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	conducted
O	him
O	along
O	,
O	strewed
O	the
O	way
O	with
O	flowers
O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	Pompey
O	considered
O	himself
O	as
O	standing
O	far
O	above
O	Caesar
O	in
O	fame
O	and
O	power
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	general
O	burst
O	of
O	enthusiasm
O	and
O	applause
O	educed
O	by
O	his
O	recovery
O	from
O	sickness
O	confirmed
O	him
O	in
O	this
O	idea
O	.
O	He
O	felt
O	no
O	solicitude
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	in
O	respect
O	to
O	Caesar
O	.
O	He
O	should
O	take
O	no
O	special
O	precautions
O	against
O	any
O	hostile
O	designs
O	which
O	he
O	might
O	entertain
O	on
O	his
O	return
O	from
O	Gaul
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	he
O	himself
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	that
O	had
O	raised
O	Caesar
O	up
O	to
O	whatever
O	of
O	elevation
O	he
O	had
O	attained
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	put
O	him
O	down
O	even
O	more
O	easily
O	than
O	he
O	had
O	exalted
O	him
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	,
O	the
O	period
O	was
O	drawing
O	near
O	in
O	which
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	command
O	in
O	the
O	provinces
O	was
O	to
O	expire
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	anticipating
O	the
O	struggle
O	with
O	Pompey
O	which
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	ensue
O	,
O	he
O	conducted
O	several
O	of
O	his
O	legions
O	through
O	the
O	passes
O	of
O	the
O	Alps
O	and
O	advanced
O	gradually
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	right
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	across
O	the
O	country
O	of
O	the
O	Po
O	toward
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	,
O	revolving
O	in
O	his
O	capacious
O	mind
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	came
O	,
O	the
O	various
O	plans
O	by
O	which
O	he
O	might
O	hope
O	to
O	gain
O	the
O	ascendency
O	over
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	his
O	mighty
O	rival
O	and
O	make
O	himself
O	supreme
O	.
O	He
O	concluded
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	his
O	wisest
O	policy
O	not
O	to
O	attempt
O	to
O	intimidate
O	Pompey
O	by
O	great
O	and
O	open
O	preparations
O	for
O	war
O	,
O	which
O	might
O	tend
O	to
O	arouse
O	him
O	to
O	vigorous
O	measures
O	of
O	resistance
O	,
O	but
O	rather
O	to
O	cover
O	and
O	conceal
O	his
O	designs
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	throw
O	his
O	enemy
O	off
O	his
O	guard
O	.
O	He
O	advanced
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	toward
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	with
O	a
O	small
O	force
O	.
O	He
O	established
O	his
O	headquarters
O	at
O	Ravenna
O	,
O	a
O	city
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	and
O	employed
O	himself
O	in
O	objects
O	of
O	local
O	interest
O	there
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	avert
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	possible
O	the
O	minds
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	from
O	imagining
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	contemplating
O	any
O	great
O	design
O	.
O	Pompey
O	sent
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	demand
O	the
O	return
O	of
O	a
O	certain
O	legion
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	lent
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	own
O	army
O	at
O	a
O	time
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	friends
O	.
O	Caesar
O	complied
O	with
O	this
O	demand
O	without
O	any
O	hesitation
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	the
O	legion
O	home
O	.
O	He
O	sent
O	with
O	this
O	legion
O	,
O	also
O	,
O	some
O	other
O	troops
O	which
O	were
O	properly
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	thus
O	evincing
O	a
O	degree
O	of
O	indifference
O	in
O	respect
O	to
O	the
O	amount
O	of
O	the
O	force
O	retained
O	under
O	his
O	command
O	which
O	seemed
O	wholly
O	inconsistent
O	with
O	the
O	idea
O	that
O	he
O	contemplated
O	any
O	resistance
O	to
O	the
O	authority
O	of
O	the
O	government
O	at
O	Rome
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	,
O	the
O	struggle
O	at
O	Rome
O	between
O	the
O	partisans
O	of
O	Caesar
O	and
O	Pompey
O	grew
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	violent
O	and
O	alarming
O	.
O	Caesar
O	,
O	through
O	his
O	friends
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	demanded
O	to
O	be
O	elected
O	consul
O	.
O	The
O	other

O	that
O	he
O	must
O	first
O	,
O	if
O	that
O	was
O	his
O	wish
O	,
O	resign
O	the
O	command
O	of
O	his
O	army
O	,
O	come
O	to
O	Rome
O	,
O	and
O	present
O	himself
O	as
O	a
O	candidate
O	in
O	the
O	character
O	of
O	a
O	private
O	citizen
O	.
O	This
O	the
O	constitution
O	of
O	the
O	state
O	very
O	properly
O	required
O	.
O	In
O	answer
O	to
O	this
O	requisition
O	,
O	Caesar
O	rejoined
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	Pompey
O	would
O	lay
O	down
O	his
O	military
O	commands
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	do
O	so
O	too
O	;
O	if
O	not
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	unjust
O	to
O	require
O	it
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	services
O	,
O	he
O	added
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	performed
O	for
O	his
O	country
O	demanded
O	some
O	recompense
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	moreover
O	,
O	they
O	ought
O	to
O	be
O	willing
O	to
O	award
O	even
O	if
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	do
O	it
O	it
O	were
O	necessary
O	to

O	somewhat
O	in

O	favor
O	the
O	strictness
O	of

O	.
O	To
O	a
O	large
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	these
O	demands
O	of
O	Caesar
O	appeared
O	reasonable
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	clamorous
O	to
O	have
O	them
O	allowed
O	.
O	The
O	partisans
O	of
O	Pompey
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	stern
O	and
O	inflexible
O	Cato
O	at
O	their
O	head
O	,
O	deemed
O	them
O	wholly
O	inadmissible
O	and
O	contended
O	with
O	the
O	most
O	determined
O	violence
O	against
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	city
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	the
O	excitement
O	of
O	this
O	struggle
O	,
O	into
O	which
O	all
O	the
O	active
O	and
O	turbulent
O	spirits
O	of
O	the
O	capital
O	plunged
O	with
O	the
O	most
O	furious
O	zeal
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	more
O	considerate
O	and
O	thoughtful
O	of
O	the
O	population
O	,
O	remembering
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	Marius
O	and
O	Sylla
O	,
O	trembled
O	at
O	the
O	impending
O	danger
O	.
O	Pompey
O	himself
O	had
O	no
O	fear
O	.
O	He
O	urged
O	the
O	Senate
O	to
O	resist
O	to
O	the
O	utmost
O	all
O	of
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	claims
O	,
O	saying
O	if
O	Caesar
O	should
O	be
O	so
O	presumptuous
O	as
O	to
O	attempt
O	to
O	march
O	to
O	Rome
O	he
O	could
O	raise
O	troops
O	enough
O	by
O	stamping
O	with
O	his
O	foot
O	to
O	put
O	him
O	down
O	.
O	It
O	would
O	require
O	a
O	volume
O	to
O	contain
O	a
O	full
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	disputes
O	and
O	tumults
O	,
O	the
O	manoeuvres
O	and
O	debates
O	,
O	the
O	votes
O	and
O	decrees
O	,
O	which
O	marked
O	the
O	successive
O	stages
O	of
O	this
O	quarrel
O	.
O	Pompey
O	himself
O	was
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	without
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	in
O	command
O	of
O	an
O	army
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	general
O	,
O	while
O	in
O	command
O	,
O	was
O	allowed
O	to
O	come
O	within
O	the
O	gates
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	an
O	exciting
O	debate
O	was
O	broken
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	Senate
O	by
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	consuls
O	rising
O	to
O	depart
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	hear
O	the
O	subject
O	discussed
O	no
O	longer
O	.
O	The
O	time
O	had
O	arrived
O	for
O	action
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	should
O	send
O	a
O	commander
O	,
O	with
O	an
O	armed
O	force
O	,
O	to
O	defend
O	the
O	country
O	from
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	threatened
O	invasion
O	.
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	leading
O	friends
O	,
O	two
O	tribunes
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	disguised
O	themselves
O	as
O	slaves
O	and
O	fled
O	to
O	the
O	north
O	to
O	join
O	their
O	master
O	.
O	The
O	country
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	commotion
O	and
O	panic
O	.
O	The
O	Commonwealth
O	had
O	obviously
O	more
O	fear
O	of
O	Caesar
O	than
O	confidence
O	in
O	Pompey
O	.
O	The
O	country
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	rumors
O	in
O	respect
O	to
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	power
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	threatening
O	attitude
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	assuming
O	,
O	while
O	they
O	who
O	had
O	insisted
O	on
O	resistance
O	seemed
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	,
O	to
O	have
O	provided
O	very
O	inadequate
O	means
O	with
O	which
O	to
O	resist
O	.
O	A
O	thousand
O	plans
O	were
O	formed
O	,
O	and
O	clamorously
O	insisted
O	upon
O	by
O	their
O	respective
O	advocates
O	,
O	for
O	averting
O	the
O	danger
O	.
O	This
O	only
O	added
O	to
O	the
O	confusion
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	city
O	became
O	at
O	length
O	pervaded
O	with
O	a
O	universal
O	terror
O	.
O	While
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	state
O	of
O	things
O	at
O	Rome
O	,
O	Caesar
O	was
O	quietly
O	established
O	at
O	Ravenna
O	,
O	thirty
O	or
O	forty
O	miles
O	from
O	the
O	frontier
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	erecting
O	a
O	building
O	for
O	a
O	fencing
O	school
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	mind
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	occupied
O	very
O	busily
O	with
O	the
O	plans
O	and
O	models
O	of
O	the
O	edifice
O	which
O	the
O	architects
O	had
O	formed
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	intended
O	march
O	to
O	Rome
O	,
O	his
O	reliance
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	much
O	on
O	the
O	force
O	which
O	he
O	should
O	take
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	as
O	on
O	the
O	cooperation
O	and
O	support
O	which
O	he
O	expected
O	to
O	find
O	there
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	his
O	policy
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	to
O	move
O	as
O	quietly
O	and
O	privately
O	as
O	possible
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	as
O	little
O	display
O	of
O	violence
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	avoid
O	everything
O	which
O	might
O	indicate
O	his
O	intended
O	march
O	to
O	any
O	spies
O	which
O	might
O	be
O	around
O	him
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	any
O	other
O	persons
O	who
O	might
O	be
O	disposed
O	to
O	report
O	what
O	they
O	observed
O	,
O	at
O	Rome
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	eve
O	of
O	his
O	departure
O	,
O	he
O	busied
O	himself
O	with
O	his
O	fencing
O	school
O	,
O	and
O	assumed
O	with
O	his
O	officers
O	and
O	soldiers
O	a
O	careless
O	and
O	unconcerned
O	air
O	,
O	which
O	prevented
O	any
O	one
O	from
O	suspecting
O	his
O	design
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	course
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	he
O	privately
O	sent
O	forward
O	some
O	cohorts
O	to
O	the
O	southward
O	,
O	with
O	orders
O	for
O	them
O	to
O	encamp
O	on
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	.
O	When
O	night
O	came
O	,
O	he
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	supper
O	as
O	usual
O	and
O	conversed
O	with
O	his
O	friends
O	in
O	his
O	ordinary
O	manner
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	with
O	them
O	afterward
O	to
O	a
O	public
O	entertainment
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	dark
O	and
O	the
O	streets
O	were
O	still
O	,
O	he
O	set
O	off
O	secretly
O	from
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	accompanied
O	by
O	a
O	very
O	few
O	attendants
O	.
O	Instead
O	of
O	making
O	use
O	of
O	his
O	ordinary
O	equipage
O	,
O	the
O	parading
O	of
O	which
O	would
O	have
O	attracted
O	attention
O	to
O	his
O	movements
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	some
O	mules
O	taken
O	from
O	a
O	neighboring
O	bakehouse
O	and
O	harnessed
O	into
O	his
O	chaise
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	torch-bearers
O	provided
O	to
O	light
O	the
O	way
O	.
O	The
O	cavalcade
O	drove
O	on
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	finding
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	hasty
O	preparations
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	made
O	inadequate
O	for
O	the
O	occasion
O	.
O	The
O	torches
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	the
O	guides
O	lost
O	their
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	future
O	conqueror
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	wandered
O	about
O	bewildered
O	and
O	lost
O	,
O	until
O	,
O	just
O	after
O	break
O	of
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	party
O	met
O	with
O	a
O	peasant
O	who
O	undertook
O	to
O	guide
O	them
O	.
O	Under
O	his
O	direction
O	they
O	made
O	their
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	main
O	road
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	advanced
O	then
O	without
O	further
O	difficulty
O	to
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	found
O	that
O	portion
O	of
O	the
O	army
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	forward
O	encamped
O	and
O	awaiting
O	their
O	arrival
O	.
O	Caesar
O	stood
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	upon
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	stream
O	,
O	musing
O	upon
O	the
O	greatness
O	of
O	the
O	undertaking
O	in
O	which
O	simply
O	passing
O	across
O	it
O	would
O	involve
O	him
O	.
O	His
O	officers
O	stood
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	.
O	``
O	We
O	can
O	retreat
O	_now_
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	but
O	once
O	across
O	that
O	river
O	,
O	we
O	must
O	go
O	on
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	paused
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	conscious
O	of
O	the
O	vast
O	importance
O	of
O	the
O	decision
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	thought
O	only
O	,
O	doubtless
O	,
O	of
O	its
O	consequences
O	to
O	himself
O	.
O	Taking
O	the
O	step
O	which
O	was
O	now
O	before
O	him
O	would
O	necessarily
O	end
O	either
O	in
O	his
O	realizing
O	the
O	loftiest
O	aspirations
O	of
O	his
O	ambition
O	,
O	or
O	in
O	his
O	utter
O	and
O	irreparable
O	ruin
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	vast
O	public
O	interests
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	at
O	stake
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	probably
O	thought
O	but
O	little
O	.
O	It
O	proved
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	end
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	history
O	of
O	the
O	whole
O	Roman
O	world
O	,
O	for
O	several
O	centuries
O	,
O	was
O	depending
O	upon
O	the
O	manner
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	question
O	now
O	in
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	mind
O	should
O	turn
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	bridge
O	across
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	at
O	the
O	point
O	where
O	Caesar
O	was
O	surveying
O	it
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	was
O	standing
O	there
O	,
O	the
O	story
O	is
O	,
O	a
O	peasant
O	or
O	shepherd
O	came
O	from
O	the
O	neighboring
O	fields
O	with
O	a
O	shepherd
O	'
O	s
O	pipe
O	--
O	a
O	simple
O	musical
O	instrument
O	made
O	of
O	a
O	reed
O	and
O	used
O	much
O	by
O	the
O	rustic
O	musicians
O	of
O	those
O	days
O	.
O	The
O	soldiers
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	officers
O	gathered
O	around
O	him
O	to
O	hear
O	him
O	play
O	.
O	Among
O	the
O	rest
O	came
O	some
O	of
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	trumpeters
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	trumpets
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	.
O	The
O	shepherd
O	took
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	martial
O	instruments
O	from
O	the
O	hands
O	of

O	bridge
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	officers
O	,
O	breaking
O	up
O	the
O	encampment
O	,
O	put
O	the
O	columns
O	in
O	motion
O	to
O	follow
O	him
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	shown
O	abundantly
O	,
O	on
O	many
O	occasions
O	in
O	the
O	course
O	of
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	life
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	faith
O	in
O	omens
O	.
O	There
O	are
O	equally
O	numerous
O	instances
O	to
O	show
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	always
O	ready
O	to
O	avail
O	himself
O	of
O	the
O	popular
O	belief
O	in
O	them
O	,
O	to
O	awaken
O	his
O	soldiers
O	'
O	ardor
O	or
O	to
O	allay
O	their
O	fears
O	.
O	Whether
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	in
O	respect
O	to
O	this
O	story
O	of
O	the
O	shepherd
O	trumpeter
O	it
O	was
O	an
O	incident
O	that
O	really
O	and
O	accidently
O	occurred
O	,
O	or
O	whether
O	Caesar
O	planned
O	and
O	arranged
O	it
O	himself
O	,
O	with
O	reference
O	to
O	its
O	effect
O	,
O	or
O	whether
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	,
O	the
O	most
O	probable
O	supposition
O	,
O	the
O	tale
O	was
O	only
O	an
O	embellishment
O	invented
O	out
O	of
O	something
O	or
O	nothing
O	by
O	the
O	story-tellers
O	of
O	those
O	days
O	to
O	give
O	additional
O	dramatic
O	interest
O	to
O	the
O	narrative
O	of
O	the
O	crossing
O	of
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	,
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	left
O	for
O	each
O	reader
O	to
O	decide
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	bridge
O	was
O	crossed
O	,
O	Caesar
O	called
O	an
O	assembly
O	of
O	his
O	troops
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	signs
O	of
O	great
O	excitement
O	and
O	agitation
O	,
O	made
O	an
O	address
O	to
O	them
O	on
O	the
O	magnitude
O	of
O	the
O	crisis
O	through
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	passing
O	.
O	He
O	showed
O	them
O	how
O	entirely
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	their
O	power
O	;
O	he
O	urged
O	them
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	most
O	eloquent
O	appeals
O	,
O	to
O	stand
O	by
O	him
O	,
O	faithful
O	and
O	true
O	,
O	promising
O	them
O	the
O	most
O	ample
O	rewards
O	when
O	he
O	should
O	have
O	attained
O	the
O	object
O	at
O	which
O	he
O	aimed
O	.
O	The
O	soldiers
O	responded
O	to
O	this
O	appeal
O	with
O	promises
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	unwavering
O	fidelity
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	town
O	on
O	the
O	Roman
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	was
O	Ariminum
O	.
O	Caesar
O	advanced
O	to
O	this
O	town
O	.
O	The
O	authorities
O	opened
O	its
O	gates
O	to
O	him
O	--
O	very
O	willing
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	appeared
O	,
O	to
O	receive
O	him
O	as
O	their
O	commander
O	.
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	force
O	was
O	yet
O	quite
O	small
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	accompanied
O	by
O	only
O	a
O	single
O	legion
O	in
O	crossing
O	the
O	river
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	sent
O	orders
O	for
O	the
O	other
O	legions
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	left
O	in
O	Gaul
O	,
O	to
O	join
O	him
O	without
O	any
O	delay
O	,
O	though
O	any
O	reinforcement
O	of
O	his
O	troops
O	seemed
O	hardly
O	necessary
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	found
O	no
O	indications
O	of
O	opposition
O	to
O	his
O	progress
O	.
O	He
O	gave
O	his
O	soldiers
O	the
O	strictest
O	injunctions
O	to
O	do
O	no
O	injury
O	to
O	any
O	property
O	,
O	public
O	or
O	private
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	advanced
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	to
O	assume
O	,
O	in
O	any
O	respect
O	,
O	a
O	hostile
O	attitude
O	toward
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	The
O	inhabitants
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	welcomed
O	him
O	wherever
O	he
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	cities
O	and
O	towns
O	followed
O	the
O	example
O	of
O	Ariminum
O	,
O	surrendering
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	faster
O	than
O	he
O	could
O	take
O	possession
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	confusion
O	of
O	the
O	debates
O	and
O	votes
O	in
O	the
O	Senate
O	at
O	Rome
O	before
O	Caesar
O	crossed
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	,
O	one
O	decree
O	had
O	been
O	passed
O	deposing
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	command
O	of
O	the
O	army
O	and
O	appointing
O	a
O	successor
O	.
O	The
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	general
O	thus
O	appointed
O	was
O	Domitius
O	.
O	The
O	only
O	real
O	opposition
O	which
O	Caesar
O	encountered
O	in
O	his
O	progress
O	toward
O	Rome
O	was
O	from
O	him
O	.
O	Domitius
O	had
O	crossed
O	the
O	Apennines
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	an
O	army
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	northward
O	to
O	supersede
O	Caesar
O	in
O	his
O	command
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	town
O	of
O	Corfinium
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	perhaps
O	one
O	third
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	between
O	Rome
O	and
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	.
O	Caesar
O	advanced
O	upon
O	him
O	here
O	and
O	shut
O	him
O	in
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	brief
O	siege
O	the
O	city
O	was
O	taken
O	,
O	and
O	Domitius
O	and
O	his
O	army
O	were
O	made
O	prisoners
O	.
O	Everybody
O	gave
O	them
O	up
O	for
O	lost
O	,
O	expecting
O	that
O	Caesar
O	would
O	wreak
O	terrible
O	vengeance
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	Instead
O	of
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	received
O	the
O	troops
O	at
O	once
O	into
O	his
O	own
O	service
O	and
O	let
O	Domitius
O	go
O	free
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	,
O	the
O	tidings
O	of
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	having
O	passed
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	triumphant
O	success
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	meeting
O	with
O	at
O	the
O	commencement
O	of
O	his
O	march
O	toward
O	Rome
O	,
O	reached
O	the
O	capital
O	,
O	and
O	added
O	greatly
O	to
O	the
O	prevailing
O	consternation
O	.
O	The
O	reports
O	of
O	the
O	magnitude
O	of
O	his
O	force
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	rapidity
O	of
O	his
O	progress
O	were
O	greatly
O	exaggerated
O	.
O	The
O	party
O	of
O	Pompey
O	and
O	the
O	Senate
O	had
O	done
O	everything
O	to
O	spread
O	among
O	the
O	people
O	the
O	terror
O	of
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	name
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	arouse
O	them
O	to
O	efforts
O	for
O	opposing
O	his
O	designs
O	;
O	and
O	now
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	broken
O	through
O	the
O	barriers
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	intended
O	to
O	restrain
O	him
O	and
O	was
O	advancing
O	toward
O	the
O	city
O	in
O	an
O	unchecked
O	and
O	triumphant
O	career
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	overwhelmed
O	with
O	dismay
O	.
O	Pompey
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	terrified
O	at
O	the
O	danger
O	which
O	was
O	impending
O	.
O	The
O	Senate
O	held
O	meetings
O	without
O	the
O	city
O	--
O	councils
O	of
O	war
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	they
O	looked
O	to
O	Pompey
O	in
O	vain
O	for
O	protection
O	from
O	the
O	danger
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	raise
O	an
O	army
O	sufficient
O	to
O	cope
O	with
O	Caesar
O	at
O	any
O	time
O	by
O	stamping
O	with
O	his
O	foot
O	.
O	They
O	told
O	him
O	they
O	thought
O	now
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	high
O	time
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	stamp
O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	Pompey
O	found
O	the
O	current
O	setting
O	everywhere
O	strongly
O	against
O	him
O	.
O	Some
O	recommended
O	that
O	commissioners
O	should
O	be
O	sent
O	to
O	Caesar
O	to
O	make
O	proposals
O	for
O	peace
O	.
O	The
O	leading
O	men
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	knowing
O	that
O	any
O	peace
O	made
O	with
O	him
O	under
O	such
O	circumstances
O	would
O	be
O	their
O	own
O	ruin
O	,
O	resisted
O	and
O	defeated
O	the
O	proposal
O	.
O	Cato
O	abruptly
O	left
O	the
O	city
O	and
O	proceeded
O	to
O	Sicily
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	assigned
O	him
O	as
O	his
O	province
O	.
O	Others
O	fled
O	in
O	other
O	directions
O	.
O	Pompey
O	himself
O	,
O	uncertain
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	daring
O	to
O	remain
O	,
O	called
O	upon
O	all
O	his
O	partisans
O	to
O	join
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	off
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	suddenly
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	very
O	little
O	preparation
O	and
O	small
O	supplies
O	,
O	to
O	retreat
O	across
O	the
O	country
O	toward
O	the
O	shores
O	of
O	the
O	Adriatic
O	Sea
O	.
O	His
O	destination
O	was
O	Brundusium
O	,
O	the
O	usual
O	port
O	of
O	embarkation
O	for
O	Macedon
O	and
O	Greece
O	.
O	Caesar
O	was
O	all
O	this
O	time
O	gradually
O	advancing
O	toward
O	Rome
O	.
O	His
O	soldiers
O	were
O	full
O	of
O	enthusiasm
O	in
O	his
O	cause
O	.
O	As
O	his
O	connection
O	with
O	the
O	government
O	at
O	home
O	was
O	sundered
O	the
O	moment
O	he
O	crossed
O	the
O	Rubicon
O	,
O	all
O	supplies
O	of
O	money
O	and
O	of
O	provisions
O	were
O	cut
O	off
O	in
O	that
O	quarter
O	until
O	he
O	should
O	arrive
O	at
O	the
O	capital
O	and
O	take
O	possession
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	soldiers
O	voted
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	serve
O	him
O	without
O	pay
O	.
O	The
O	officers
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	assembled
O	together
O	and
O	tendered
O	him
O	the
O	aid
O	of
O	their
O	contributions
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	always
O	observed
O	a
O	very
O	generous
O	policy
O	in
O	his
O	dealings
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	now
O	greatly
O	gratified
O	at
O	receiving
O	their
O	requital
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	further
O	he
O	advanced
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	the
O	more
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	through
O	which
O	he
O	passed
O	disposed
O	to
O	espouse
O	his
O	cause
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	struck
O	with
O	his
O	generosity
O	in
O	releasing
O	Domitius
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	true
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	sagacious
O	policy
O	that
O	prompted
O	him
O	to
O	release
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	generosity
O	too
O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	there
O	must
O	be
O	something
O	of
O	a
O	generous
O	spirit
O	in
O	the
O	soul
O	to
O	enable
O	a
O	man
O	even
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	policy
O	of
O	generous
O	actions
O	.
O	Among
O	the
O	letters
O	of
O	Caesar
O	that
O	remain
O	to
O	the
O	present
O	day
O	,
O	there
O	is
O	one
O	written
O	about
O	this
O	time
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	friends
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	speaks
O	of
O	this
O	subject
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	glad
O	,
O	``
O	says
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	that
O	you
O	approve
O	of
O	my

O	I

O	satisfied
O	that
O	such
O	a
O	course
O	is
O	the
O	best

O	of
O	all
O	parties
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	secure
O	a
O	permanent
O	victory
O	.
O	Most
O	conquerors
O	have
O	incurred
O	the
O	hatred
O	of
O	mankind
O	by
O	their

O	awakened

O	been
O	prevented
O	from
O	long
O	enjoying
O	their
O	power
O	.
O	Sylla
O	was
O	an
O	exception
O	;
O	but
O	his
O	example
O	of
O	successful

O	generosity
O	occurred
O	which

O	more
O	remarkable
O	than
O	this
O	.
O	It
O	seems
O	that
O	among
O	the
O	officers
O	of
O	his
O	army
O	there
O	were
O	some
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	appointed
O	at
O	the
O	recommendation
O	of
O	Pompey
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	when
O	he
O	and
O	Pompey
O	were
O	friends
O	.
O	These
O	men
O	would
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	feel
O	under
O	obligations
O	of
O	gratitude
O	to
O	Pompey
O	as

O	owed
O	their
O	military
O	rank
O	to
O	his
O	friendly
O	interposition
O	in
O	their
O	behalf
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	war
O	broke
O	out
O	Caesar
O	gave
O	them
O	all
O	his
O	free
O	permission
O	to
O	go
O	over
O	to
O	Pompey
O	'
O	s
O	side
O	if
O	they
O	chose
O	to
O	do
O	so
O	.
O	Caesar
O	acted
O	thus
O	very
O	liberally
O	in
O	all
O	respects
O	.
O	He
O	surpassed
O	Pompey
O	very
O	much
O	in
O	the
O	spirit
O	of
O	generosity
O	and
O	mercy
O	with
O	which
O	he
O	entered
O	upon
O	the
O	great
O	contest
O	before
O	them
O	.
O	Pompey
O	ordered
O	every
O	citizen
O	to
O	join
O	his
O	standard
O	,
O	declaring
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	consider
O	all
O	neutrals
O	as
O	his
O	enemies
O	.
O	Caesar
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	hand
O	,
O	gave
O	free
O	permission
O	to
O	every
O	one
O	to
O	decline
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	chose
O	,
O	taking
O	any
O	part
O	in
O	the
O	contest
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	consider
O	all
O	who
O	did
O	not
O	act
O	against
O	him
O	as
O	his
O	friends
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	political
O	contests
O	of
O	our
O	day
O	it
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	observed
O	that
O	the
O	combatants
O	are
O	much
O	more
O	prone
O	to
O	imitate
O	the
O	bigotry
O	of
O	Pompey
O	than
O	the
O	generosity
O	of
O	Caesar
O	,
O	condemning
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	often
O	do
O	,
O	those
O	who
O	choose
O	to
O	stand
O	aloof
O	from
O	electioneering
O	struggles
O	,
O	more
O	than
O	they
O	do
O	their
O	most
O	determined
O	opponents
O	and
O	enemies
O	.
O	When
O	,
O	at
O	length
O	,
O	Caesar
O	arrived
O	at
O	Brundusium
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	Pompey
O	had
O	sent
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	his
O	army
O	across
O	the
O	Adriatic
O	into
O	Greece
O	and
O	was
O	waiting
O	for
O	the
O	transports
O	to
O	return
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	go
O	over
O	himself
O	with
O	the
O	remainder
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	fortified
O	himself
O	strongly
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	Caesar
O	immediately
O	laid
O	siege
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	commenced
O	some
O	works
O	to
O	block
O	up
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	harbor
O	.
O	He
O	built
O	piers
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	,
O	extending
O	out
O	as
O	far
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	as
O	the
O	depth
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	would
O	allow
O	them
O	to
O	be
O	built
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	constructed
O	a
O	series
O	of
O	rafts
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	anchored
O	on
O	the
O	deep
O	water
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	line
O	extending
O	from
O	one
O	pier
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	He
O	built
O	towers
O	upon
O	these
O	rafts
O	,
O	and
O	garrisoned
O	them
O	with
O	soldiers
O	,
O	in
O	hopes
O	by
O	this
O	means
O	to
O	prevent
O	all
O	egress
O	from
O	the
O	fort
O	.
O	He
O	thought
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	this
O	work
O	was
O	completed
O	,
O	Pompey
O	would
O	be
O	entirely
O	shut
O	in
O	,
O	beyond
O	all
O	possibility
O	of
O	escape
O	.
O	The
O	transports
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	returned
O	before
O	the
O	work
O	was
O	completed
O	.
O	Its
O	progress
O	was
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	slow
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	constructions
O	were
O	the
O	scene
O	of
O	a
O	continued
O	conflict
O	;
O	for
O	Pompey
O	sent
O	out
O	rafts
O	and
O	galleys
O	against
O	them
O	every
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	workmen
O	had
O	thus
O	to
O	build
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	continual
O	interruptions
O	,
O	sometimes
O	from
O	showers
O	of
O	darts
O	,
O	arrows
O	,
O	and
O	javelins
O	,
O	sometimes
O	from
O	the
O	conflagrations
O	of
O	fireships
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	from
O	the
O	terrible
O	concussions
O	of
O	great
O	vessels
O	of
O	war
O	,
O	impelled
O	with
O	prodigious
O	force
O	against
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	transports
O	returned
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	before
O	the
O	defences
O	were
O	complete
O	,
O	and
O	contrived
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	the
O	harbor
O	.
O	Pompey
O	immediately
O	formed
O	his
O	plan
O	for
O	embarking
O	the
O	remainder
O	of
O	his
O	army
O	.
O	He
O	filled
O	the
O	streets
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	with
O	barricades
O	and
O	pitfalls
O	excepting
O	two
O	streets
O	which
O	led
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	embarkation
O	.
O	The
O	object
O	of
O	these
O	obstructions
O	was
O	to
O	embarrass
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	progress
O	through
O	the
O	city
O	in
O	case
O	he
O	should
O	force
O	an
O	entrance
O	while
O	his
O	men
O	were
O	getting
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	ships
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	divert
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	attention
O	from
O	his
O	design
O	,
O	doubled
O	the
O	guards
O	stationed
O	upon
O	the
O	walls
O	on
O	the
O	evening
O	of
O	his
O	intended
O	embarkation
O	,
O	and
O	ordered
O	them
O	to
O	make
O	vigorous
O	attacks
O	upon
O	all
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	forces
O	outside
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	darkness
O	came
O	on
O	,
O	he
O	marched
O	his
O	troops
O	through
O	the
O	two
O	streets
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	left
O	open
O	to
O	the
O	landing-place
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	them
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	possible
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	transports
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	contrived
O	to
O	make
O	known
O	to
O	Caesar
O	'
O	s
O	army
O	what
O	was
O	going
O	on
O	,
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	signals
O	from
O	the
O	walls
O	;
O	the
O	army
O	immediately
O	brought
O	scaling
O	ladders
O	in
O	great
O	numbers
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	mounting
O	the
O	walls
O	with
O	great
O	ardor
O	and
O	impetuosity
O	,
O	they
O	drove
O	all
O	before
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	broke
O	open
O	the
O	gates
O	and
O	got
O	possession
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	barricades
O	and
O	pitfalls
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	the
O	darkness
O	,
O	so
O	embarrassed
O	their
O	movements
O	that
O	Pompey
O	succeeded
O	in
O	completing
O	his
O	embarkation
O	and
O	sailing
O	away
O	.
O	Caesar
O	had
O	no
O	ships
O	in
O	which
O	to
O	follow
O	.
O	He
O	returned
O	to
O	Rome
O	.
O	He
O	met
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	with
O	no
O	opposition
O	.
O	He
O	re-established
O	the
O	government
O	there
O	,
O	organized
O	the
O	Senate
O	anew
O	,
O	and
O	obtained
O	supplies
O	of
O	corn
O	from
O	the
O	public
O	granaries
O	and
O	of
O	money
O	from
O	the
O	city
O	treasury
O	in
O	the
O	capital
O	.
O	In
O	going
O	to
O	the
O	Capitoline
O	Hill
O	after
O	this
O	treasure
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	officer
O	who
O	had
O	charge
O	of
O	the
O	money
O	stationed
O	there
O	to
O	defend
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	Caesar
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	contrary
O	to
O	law
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	enter
O	.
O	Caesar
O	said
O	that
O	,
O	for
O	men
O	with
O	swords
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	law
O	.
O	The
O	officer
O	still
O	refused
O	to
O	admit
O	him
O	.
O	Caesar
O	then
O	told
O	him
O	to
O	open
O	the
O	doors
O	or
O	he
O	would
O	kill
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	spot
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	you
O	must
O	understand
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	added
O	,
O	``
O	that
O	it
O	will
O	be
O	easier
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	do
O	it
O	than
O	it
O	has
O	been
O	to
O	say
O	it
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	officer
O	resisted
O	no
O	longer
O	,
O	and
O	Caesar
O	went
O	in
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	,
O	Caesar
O	spent
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	vigorous
O	campaigns
O	in
O	Italy
O	,
O	Spain
O	,
O	Sicily
O	,
O	and
O	Gaul
O	,
O	wherever
O	there
O	was
O	manifested
O	any
O	opposition
O	to
O	his
O	sway
O	.
O	When
O	this
O	work
O	was
O	accomplished
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	these
O	countries
O	were
O	completely
O	subjected
O	to
O	his
O	dominion
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	turn
O	his
O	thoughts
O	to
O	the
O	plan
O	of
O	pursuing
O	Pompey
O	across
O	the
