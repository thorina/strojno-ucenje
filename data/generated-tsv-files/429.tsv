O	An
O	Indian
O	hunter
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	game
O	.
O	The
O	forest
O	was
O	so
O	large
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	taken
O	three
O	days
O	to
O	journey
O	through
O	it
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	he
O	followed
O	the
O	track
O	of
O	the
O	deer
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	arrows
O	brought
O	him
O	no
O	food
O	.
O	At
O	night
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	dark
O	,
O	swift-running
O	stream
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	tired
O	and
O	hungry
O	.
O	``
O	Here
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	lie
O	down
O	and
O	rest
O	until
O	sunrise
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	began
O	to
O	search
O	for
O	a
O	bed
O	of
O	pine
O	needles
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	Indian
O	loves
O	the
O	pine
O	tree
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	his
O	friend
O	by
O	day
O	and
O	by
O	night
O	.
O	By
O	day
O	it
O	is
O	his
O	forest
O	guide
O	.
O	At
O	night
O	it
O	gives
O	him
O	a
O	soft
O	,
O	sweet-smelling
O	bed
O	on
O	which
O	to
O	sleep
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	shields
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	storm
O	.
O	The
O	hunter
O	ran
O	along
O	the
O	stream
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	very
O	dark
O	.
O	He
O	felt
O	no
O	soft
O	pine
O	needles
O	under
O	his
O	moccasined
O	feet
O	,
O	only
O	the
O	knotted
O	roots
O	of
O	trees
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	the
O	great
O	roots
O	of
O	an
O	oak
O	tree
O	reached
O	out
O	and
O	caught
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	free
O	his
O	foot
O	from
O	the
O	oak
O	'
O	s
O	grasp
O	.
O	The
O	sun
O	rose
O	and
O	set
O	.
O	The
O	great
O	tree
O	still
O	held
O	the
O	hunter
O	fast
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	weak
O	from
O	pain
O	and
O	hunger
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	now
O	two
O	days
O	since
O	he
O	had
O	tasted
O	food
O	.
O	Four
O	notches
O	had
O	been
O	cut
O	in
O	his
O	stick
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	Indian
O	measures
O	time
O	in
O	this
O	way
O	.
O	Each
O	sunrise
O	and
O	sunset
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	is
O	on
O	the
O	trail
O	,
O	is
O	marked
O	by
O	a
O	notch
O	on
O	a
O	small
O	stick
O	which
O	he
O	carries
O	.
O	Three
O	times
O	did
O	the
O	sun
O	again
O	rise
O	and
O	set
O	,
O	yet
O	the
O	tree
O	did
O	not
O	let
O	go
O	its
O	hold
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	now
O	ten
O	notches
O	on
O	the
O	stick
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hunter
O	was
O	so
O	weak
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	scarcely
O	cut
O	the
O	last
O	one
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	sun
O	rose
O	on
O	the
O	fifth
O	day
O	,
O	a
O	bird
O	flew
O	into
O	the
O	tree
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	the
O	hunter
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	close
O	and
O	spoke
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	hunter
O	understood
O	,
O	for
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	men
O	and
O	birds
O	could
O	talk
O	together
O	.
O	The
O	bird
O	asked
O	the
O	man
O	what
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hunter
O	whispered
O	,
O	``
O	You
O	are
O	strong
O	.
O	You
O	can
O	fly
O	a
O	long
O	trail
O	.
O	Go
O	and
O	tell
O	the
O	chief
O	of
O	my
O	people
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	bird
O	flew
O	swiftly
O	away
O	with
O	the
O	message
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	wait
O	until
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	high
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	stop
O	to
O	eat
O	one
O	berry
O	or
O	one
O	worm
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	fly
O	high
O	,
O	nor
O	fly
O	low
O	to
O	talk
O	with
O	other
O	birds
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	straight
O	to
O	the
O	people
O	the
O	hunter
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	of
O	.
O	The
O	West
O	Wind
O	tried
O	to
O	blow
O	him
O	back
O	.
O	A
O	black
O	cloud
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	frighten
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	went
O	through
O	it
O	.
O	On
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	.
O	Straight
O	to
O	the
O	wigwam
O	of
O	the
O	chief
O	,
O	he
O	carried
O	his
O	message
O	.
O	The
O	chief
O	had
O	called
O	together
O	the
O	young
O	men
O	who
O	were
O	fleet
O	of
O	foot
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	send
O	them
O	forth
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	lost
O	hunter
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	asking
O	the
O	chief
O	what
O	trails
O	they
O	had
O	best
O	take
O	.
O	Before
O	the
O	chief
O	could
O	reply
O	,
O	a
O	beautiful
O	dove-colored
O	bird
O	had
O	flown
O	close
O	to
O	his
O	ear
O	and
O	had
O	spoken
O	to
O	him
O	in
O	soft
O	,
O	low
O	tones
O	.
O	The
O	chief
O	told
O	the
O	young
O	men
O	what
O	the
O	bird
O	had
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	set
O	off
O	on
O	the
O	trail
O	the
O	bird
O	had
O	named
O	.
O	Before
O	sunset
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	found
O	the
O	lost
O	hunter
O	.
O	Carefully
O	they
O	freed
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	grasp
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	oak
O	and
O	bore
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	people
O	.
O	That
O	night
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	feast
O	and
O	a
O	dance
O	in
O	his
O	honor
O	.
O	Ever
O	since
O	,
O	the
O	Indians
O	have
O	loved
O	the
O	birds
O	that
O	carry
O	the
O	messages
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	never
O	shoot
O	a
O	pigeon
O	.
