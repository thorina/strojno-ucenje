O	In
O	that
O	time
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	portion
O	of
O	Tuscany
O	called
O	Casentino
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	subject
O	to
O	the
O	Florentines
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	ruled
O	by

O	,
O	in
O	the
O	lands
O	of
O	Poppi
O	,

O	place
O	in
O	that
O	valley
O	through

O	the

O	,

O	from

O	source
O	,
O	a
O	son
O	was
O	born
O	to
O	a
O	certain
O	good
O	man
O	named
O	Paolo
O	,
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	gave
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Torello
O	,
O	and
O	whom
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	suitable
O	age
O	,
O	he
O	not
O	only
O	taught
O	to
O	fear
O	God
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	lead
O	a
O	Christian
O	life
O	,
O	but
O	sent
O	to
O	school
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	learn
O	the
O	first
O	principles
O	of

O	--

O	life
O	,
O	and

O	,
O	for

O	.

O	our

O	,
O	who
O	always
O	goes
O	about
O	seeking
O	whom

O	,
O	he
O	so

O	Torello
O	--
O	God
O	permitting
O	it
O	,
O	for
O	future
O	and
O	greater
O	good
O	--
O	that
O	he
O	abandoned
O	a
O	virtuous
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	himself
O	to
O	the
O	pursuit
O	of
O	the
O	pleasures
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	;
O	so
O	that

O	of
O	being
O	praised
O	for
O	his
O	blameless
O	and
O	religious
O	life
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	censured
O	by
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	become
O	the
O	very
O	opposite
O	of
O	what

O	to

O	,
O	in

O	permit
O	him
O	to
O	become
O	a
O	true
O	mirror
O	of
O	penitence
O	--
O	called
O	him
O	to
O	himself
O	in
O	this
O	manner
O	;
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	one
O	day
O	wandering
O	and
O	seeking
O	amusement
O	with
O	his
O	idle
O	companions
O	,
O	a
O	cock
O	that
O	was
O	on
O	a
O	perch
O	outside
O	a
O	window
O	suddenly
O	fell
O	,
O	and
O	alighted
O	on
O	his
O	shoulder
O	,
O	and
O	crowed
O	three
O	times
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	flew
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	perch
O	.
O	Torello
O	,
O	calling
O	to
O	mind
O	how
O	the
O	Apostle
O	Peter
O	had
O	in
O	a
O	similar
O	manner
O	been
O	made
O	to
O	gee
O	his
O	guilt
O	,
O	awaked
O	from
O	his
O	sleep
O	of
O	vice
O	and
O	sin
O	in
O	a
O	state
O	of
O	wonder
O	and
O	fear
O	;
O	and
O	thinking
O	that
O	this
O	could
O	have
O	happened
O	only
O	by
O	divine
O	Providence
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	show
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	the
O	devil
O	,
O	left
O	his
O	companions
O	instantly
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	penitence
O	and
O	tears
O	sought
O	the
O	Abbot
O	of
O	Poppi
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	order
O	of
O	Vallombrosa
O	;
O	and
O	commending
O	himself
O	to
O	his
O	prayers
O	,
O	threw
O	himself
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	,
O	humbly
O	begging
O	for
O	the
O	robe
O	of
O	a
O	mendicant
O	friar
O	,
O	since
O	he
O	desired
O	to
O	serve
O	God
O	in
O	the
O	humblest
O	manner
O	.
O	The
O	abbot
O	wondered
O	much
O	,
O	knowing
O	by
O	common
O	report
O	Torello
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	youth
O	of
O	most
O	incorrect
O	life
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	thus
O	kneeling
O	in
O	contrition
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	endeavoured
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	the
O	monks
O	,
O	to
O	persuade
O	him
O	to
O	take
O	their
O	habit
O	of
O	St
O	.
O	John
O	Gualberto
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	seeing
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	heart
O	for
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	remained
O	constant
O	to
O	his
O	first
O	request
O	,
O	he
O	at
O	last
O	granted
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	became
O	a
O	poor
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	almost
O	a
O	desert
O	hermit
O	,
O	for
O	having
O	received
O	the
O	benediction
O	of
O	the
O	abbot
O	,
O	without
O	communicating
O	with
O	either
O	his
O	family
O	or
O	friends
O	,
O	he
O	left
O	that
O	country
O	and
O	took
O	his
O	way
O	toward
O	the
O	most
O	desert
O	and
O	savage
O	places
O	of
O	the
O	mountains
O	,
O	wandering
O	among
O	them
O	for
O	eight
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	passing
O	the
O	night
O	wherever
O	it
O	chanced
O	to
O	overtake
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	having
O	at
O	last
O	come
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	rock
O	,
O	near
O	a
O	place
O	called
O	Avellanato
O	,
O	he
O	remained
O	there
O	,
O	adopting
O	it
O	for
O	a
O	cell
O	eight
O	days
O	more
O	,
O	weeping
O	for
O	his
O	sins
O	,
O	praying
O	,
O	and
O	imploring
O	God
O	to
O	pardon
O	him
O	;
O	living
O	all
O	this
O	time
O	on
O	three
O	small
O	loaves
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	wild
O	herbs
O	like
O	the
O	animals
O	;
O	and
O	being
O	much
O	pleased
O	with
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	he
O	determined
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	cell
O	under
O	that
O	great
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	spend
O	all
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	this
O	life
O	,
O	serving
O	God
O	with
O	fasts
O	,
O	vigils
O	,
O	discipline
O	,
O	and
O	prayers
O	,
O	and
O	bitterly
O	lamenting
O	his
O	past
O	sins
O	and
O	evil
O	life
O	.
O	Having
O	taken
O	this
O	resolution
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	country
O	to
O	put
O	his
O	affairs
O	in
O	order
O	;
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	relatives
O	and
O	friends
O	came
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	praying
O	him
O	with
O	much
O	earnestness
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	sought
O	to
O	serve
O	God
O	,
O	to
O	leave
O	this
O	life
O	of
O	a
O	wild
O	beast
O	and
O	join
O	some
O	order
O	,
O	living
O	like
O	other
O	monks
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	was
O	of
O	no
O	avail
O	;
O	and
O	selling
O	all
O	his
O	goods
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	the
O	price
O	to
O	the
O	poor
O	,
O	reserving
O	to
O	himself
O	only
O	a
O	small
O	sum
O	of
O	money
O	to
O	build
O	a
O	cell
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	solitude
O	with
O	a
O	mason
O	,
O	who
O	made
O	for
O	him
O	a
O	miserable
O	cell
O	under
O	that
O	same
O	rock
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	bought
O	near
O	it
O	enough
O	land
O	for
O	a
O	small
O	garden
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	established
O	himself
O	,
O	practising
O	the
O	most
O	severe
O	austerities
O	.
O	Having
O	now
O	spoken
O	of
O	the
O	penitence
O	and
O	life
O	of
O	the
O	Beato
O	Torello
O	,
O	we
O	must
O	make
O	mention
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	gifts
O	and
O	grace
O	which
O	he
O	received
O	from
O	God
O	during
O	his
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	were
O	often
O	granted
O	to
O	him
O	in
O	behalf
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	commended
O	themselves
O	to
O	him
O	in
O	faith
O	and
O	devotion
O	.
O	A
O	poor
O	woman
O	of
O	Poppi
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	only
O	one
O	son
O	,
O	three
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	going
O	to
O	the
O	spring
O	to
O	wash
O	her
O	clothes
O	,
O	took
O	him
O	with
O	her
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	having
O	strayed
O	from
O	her
O	a
O	little
O	way
O	while
O	she
O	was
O	washing
O	,
O	a
O	savage
O	wolf
O	seized
O	him
O	and
O	carried
O	him
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	poor
O	woman
O	'
O	s
O	shrieks
O	could
O	be
O	heard
O	almost
O	at
O	Poppi
O	,
O	while
O	she
O	could
O	do
O	nothing
O	but
O	commend
O	the
O	child
O	to
O	God
O	.
O	While
O	the
O	wolf
O	was
O	escaping
O	with
O	his
O	prey
O	between
O	his
O	teeth
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	pleased
O	God
O	--
O	who
O	thus
O	began
O	to
O	make
O	known
O	the
O	reward
O	of
O	his
O	service
O	--
O	to
O	the
O	cell
O	of
O	the
O	Beato
O	Torello
O	;
O	who
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	this
O	,
O	instantly
O	ordered
O	the
O	wolf
O	,
O	in
O	God
O	'
O	s
O	name
O	,
O	to
O	lay
O	the
O	child
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	safe
O	and
O	sound
O	;
O	which
O	command
O	the
O	wolf
O	no
O	sooner
O	heard
O	than
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	immediately
O	,
O	and
O	laid
O	the
O	child
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	.
O	And
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	,
O	with
O	evident
O	humility
O	,
O	received
O	the
O	directions
O	of
O	the
O	holy
O	father
O	,
O	that
O	neither
O	he
O	,
O	nor
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	wolves
O	his
O	companions
O	,
O	should
O	do
O	any
O	harm
O	to
O	any
O	person
O	of
O	that
O	country
O	,
O	he
O	departed
O	,
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	forest
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	servant
O	of
O	God
O	took
O	the
O	half-dead
O	child
O	into
O	his
O	cell
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	prayer
O	to
O	the
O	Lord
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	immediately
O	healed
O	of
O	the
O	wounds
O	the
O	wolf
O	'
O	s
O	teeth
O	had
O	made
O	in
O	his
O	throat
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	his
O	mother
O	came
O	seeking
O	him
O	with
O	great
O	lamentation
O	and
O	sorrow
O	,
O	he
O	graciously
O	restored
O	him
O	to
O	her
O	alive
O	and
O	well
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	the
O	command
O	that
O	while
O	he
O	lived
O	she
O	should
O	never
O	reveal
O	this
O	miracle
O	.
O	Carlo
O	,
O	Count
O	of
O	Poppi
O	,
O	being
O	very
O	fond
O	of
O	the
O	Beato
O	Torello
O	,
O	sent
O	him
O	by
O	his
O	steward
O	,
O	one
O	evening
O	in
O	Carnival
O	,
O	a
O	basket
O	full
O	of
O	provisions
O	,
O	praying
O	the
O	good
O	father
O	to
O	accept
O	it
O	for
O	love
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	steward
O	also
O	carried
O	him
O	many
O	other
O	gifts
O	,
O	which
O	some
O	good
O	ladies
O	,
O	knowing
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	,
O	took
O	the
O	opportunity
O	to
O	send
O	by
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	Having
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	cell
O	,
O	he
O	presented
O	them
O	all
O	to
O	the
O	padre
O	,
O	who
O	thanked
O	him
O	much
O	,
O	and
O	returned
O	him
O	the
O	empty
O	baskets
O	;
O	when
O	he
O	took
O	occasion
O	to
O	enquire
O	,
O	how
O	he
O	,
O	being
O	alone
O	,
O	could
O	possibly
O	eat
O	so
O	much
O	in
O	one
O	evening
O	.
O	And
O	Torello
O	,
O	seeing
O	that
O	the
O	steward
O	thought
O	him
O	a
O	great
O	eater
O	,
O	answered
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	alone
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	suppose
O	;
O	my
O	companion
O	will
O	come
O	from
O	the
O	woods
O	before
O	long
O	,
O	who
O	has
O	a
O	great
O	appetite
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	will
O	help
O	me
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	the
O	steward
O	,
O	hearing
O	this
O	,
O	hid
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	hermitage
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	who
O	this
O	could
O	be
O	who
O	the
O	padre
O	said
O	had
O	such
O	a
O	fine
O	appetite
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	not
O	waited
O	long
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	wolf
O	go
O	straight
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	saint
O	'
O	s
O	cell
O	,
O	who
O	opened
O	it
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	fed
O	him
O	until
O	he
O	had
O	devoured
O	everything
O	that
O	the
O	steward
O	had
O	brought
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	then
O	began
O	to
O	caress
O	the
O	saint
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	faithful
O	and
O	affectionate
O	dog
O	would
O	his
O	master
O	;
O	and
O	this
O	he
O	continued
O	to
O	do
O	until
O	Torello
O	gave
O	him
O	permission
O	to
O	go
O	,
O	and
O	reminded
O	him
O	that
O	neither
O	he
O	,
O	nor
O	any
O	of
O	his
O	companions
O	,
O	should
O	do
O	any
O	harm
O	to
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	that
O	place
O	until
O	they
O	were
O	at
O	such
O	a
O	distance
O	as
O	to
O	be
O	out
O	of
O	hearing
O	of
O	the
O	bell
O	of
O	the
O	monastery
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	wolf
O	promised
O	to
O	do
O	and
O	obey
O	,
O	by
O	bowing
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	The
O	servant
O	,
O	having
O	seen
O	and
O	heard
O	this
O	,
O	returned
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	related
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	count
O	and
O	the
O	others
O	,
O	to
O	their
O	great
O	amazement
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	lady
O	of
O	Bologna
O	,
O	named
O	Vittoriana
O	,
O	who
O	made
O	a
O	pilgrimage
O	to
O	the
O	holy
O	place
O	in
O	Vernia
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	glorious
O	St
O	.
O	Francis
O	received
O	the
O	stigmata
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	her
O	two
O	children
O	fell
O	ill
O	with
O	a
O	violent
O	and
O	dangerous
O	fever
O	;
O	and
O	being
O	,
O	in
O	consequence
O	,
O	much
O	distressed
O	and
O	afflicted
O	,
O	she
O	consulted
O	with
O	some
O	ladies
O	from
O	Poppi
O	,
O	whose
O	devotion
O	had
O	also
O	brought
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	same
O	place
O	,
O	who
O	advised
O	her
O	to
O	take
O	her
O	children
O	,
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	possible
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	blessed
O	Torello
O	,
O	and
O	commend
O	them
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	that
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	his
O	prayers
O	God
O	would
O	restore
O	their
O	health
O	.
O	And
O	going
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	she
O	commended
O	them
O	to
O	him
O	with
O	faith
O	and
O	tears
O	and
O	hope
O	beyond
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	words
O	to
O	describe
O	.
O	And
O	truly
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	in
O	vain
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	holy
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	most
O	pitiful
O	,
O	kneeled
O	down
O	and
O	prayed
O	to
O	the
O	Lord
O	for
O	her
O	and
O	her
O	children
O	as
O	only
O	the
O	true
O	servants
O	of
O	God
O	pray
O	;
O	and
O	having
O	so
O	done
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	some
O	water
O	from
O	the
O	spring
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	usually
O	drank
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	children
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	entirely
O	cured
O	and
O	delivered
O	from
O	that
O	fever
O	.
O	And
O	what
O	is
O	more
O	,
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	that
O	fountain
O	is
O	to
O	this
O	day
O	called
O	the
O	fountain
O	of
O	St
O	.
O	Torello
O	,
O	and
O	is
O	a
O	sovereign
O	remedy
O	against
O	every
O	kind
O	of
O	fever
O	to
O	those
O	who
O	drink
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	as
O	experience
O	has
O	testified
O	and
O	still
O	testifies
O	.
