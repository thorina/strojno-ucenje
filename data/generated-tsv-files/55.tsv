O	The
O	Adventure
O	had
O	a
O	very
O	prosperous
O	gale
O	,
O	till
O	we
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	Cape
O	of
O	Good
O	Hope
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	landed
O	for
O	fresh
O	water;
O	but
O	discovering
O	a
O	leak
O	,
O	we
O	unshipped
O	our
O	goods
O	,
O	and
O	wintered
O	there;
O	for
O	the
O	captain
O	falling
O	sick
O	of
O	an
O	ague
O	,
O	we
O	could
O	not
O	leave
O	the
O	Cape
O	till
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	March
O	.
O	We
O	then
O	set
O	sail
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	good
O	voyage
O	till
O	we
O	passed
O	the
O	straits
O	of
O	Madagascar;
O	but
O	having
O	got
O	northward
O	of
O	that
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	about
O	five
O	degrees
O	south
O	latitude
O	,
O	the
O	winds
O	,
O	which
O	in
O	those
O	seas
O	are
O	observed
O	to
O	blow
O	a
O	constant
O	equal
O	gale
O	between
O	the
O	north
O	and
O	west
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	December
O	to
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	May
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	9th
O	of
O	April
O	began
O	to
O	blow
O	with
O	much
O	greater
O	violence
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	westerly
O	than
O	usual
O	,
O	continuing
O	so
O	for
O	twenty
O	days
O	together
O	:
O	during
O	which
O	time
O	,
O	we
O	were
O	driven
O	a
O	little
O	to
O	the
O	east
O	of
O	the
O	Molucca
O	Islands
O	,
O	and
O	about
O	three
O	degrees
O	northward
O	of
O	the
O	line
O	,
O	as
O	our
O	captain
O	found
O	by
O	an
O	observation
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	2d
O	of
O	May
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	time
O	the
O	wind
O	ceased
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	perfect
O	calm
O	,
O	whereat
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	little
O	rejoiced
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	being
O	a
O	man
O	well
O	experienced
O	in
O	the
O	navigation
O	of
O	those
O	seas
O	,
O	bid
O	us
O	all
O	prepare
O	against
O	a
O	storm
O	,
O	which
O	accordingly
O	happened
O	on
O	the
O	day
O	following;
O	for
O	the
O	southern
O	wind
O	,
O	called
O	the
O	southern
O	monsoon
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	set
O	in
O	.
O	Finding
O	it
O	was
O	likely
O	to
O	overblow
O	,
O	we
O	took
O	in
O	our
O	sprit-sail
O	,
O	and
O	stood
O	by
O	to
O	hand
O	the
O	foresail;
O	but
O	,
O	making
O	foul
O	weather
O	,
O	we
O	looked
O	the
O	guns
O	were
O	all
O	fast
O	,
O	and
O	handed
O	the
O	mizzen
O	.
O	The
O	ship
O	lay
O	very
O	broad
O	off
O	,
O	so
O	we
O	thought
O	it
O	better
O	spooning
O	before
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	than
O	trying
O	or
O	hulling
O	.
O	We
O	reefed
O	the
O	foresail
O	and
O	set
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	hauled
O	aft
O	the
O	foresheet;
O	the
O	helm
O	was
O	hard-a-weather
O	.
O	The
O	ship
O	wore
O	bravely
O	.
O	We
O	belayed
O	the
O	fore
O	downhaul;
O	but
O	the
O	sail
O	was
O	split
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	hauled
O	down
O	the
O	yard
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	the
O	sail
O	into
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	unbound
O	all
O	the
O	things
O	clear
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	fierce
O	storm;
O	the
O	sea
O	broke
O	strange
O	and
O	dangerous
O	.
O	We
O	hauled
O	off
O	upon
O	the
O	lanyard
O	of
O	the
O	whip-staff
O	,
O	and
O	helped
O	the
O	man
O	at
O	the
O	helm
O	.
O	We
O	would
O	not
O	get
O	down
O	our
O	topmast
O	,
O	but
O	let
O	all
O	stand
O	,
O	because
O	she
O	scudded
O	before
O	the
O	sea
O	very
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	topmast
O	being
O	aloft
O	,
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	the
O	wholesomer
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	better
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	seeing
O	we
O	had
O	sea-room
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	storm
O	was
O	over
O	,
O	we
O	set
O	foresail
O	and
O	mainsail
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	the
O	ship
O	to
O	.
O	Then
O	we
O	set
O	the
O	mizzen
O	,
O	maintopsail
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	foretopsail
O	.
O	Our
O	course
O	was
O	east-
O	northeast
O	,
O	the
O	wind
O	was
O	at
O	southwest
O	.
O	We
O	got
O	the
O	starboard
O	tacks
O	aboard
O	,
O	we
O	cast
O	off
O	our
O	weather
O	braces
O	and
O	lifts;
O	we
O	set
O	in
O	the
O	lee
O	braces
O	,
O	and
O	hauled
O	forward
O	by
O	the
O	weather-bowlings
O	,
O	and
O	hauled
O	them
O	tight
O	,
O	and
O	belayed
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	hauled
O	over
O	the
O	mizzen
O	tack
O	to
O	windward
O	,
O	and
O	kept
O	her
O	full
O	and
O	by
O	as
O	near
O	as
O	she
O	would
O	lie
O	.
O	During
O	this
O	storm
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	followed
O	by
O	a
O	strong
O	wind
O	west-
O	southwest
O	,
O	we
O	were
O	carried
O	,
O	by
O	my
O	computation
O	,
O	about
O	five
O	hundred
O	leagues
O	to
O	the
O	east
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	oldest
O	sailor
O	on
O	board
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	in
O	what
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	we
O	were
O	.
O	Our
O	provisions
O	held
O	out
O	well
O	,
O	our
O	ship
O	was
O	stanch
O	,
O	and
O	our
O	crew
O	all
O	in
O	good
O	health;
O	but
O	we
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	utmost
O	distress
O	for
O	water
O	.
O	We
O	thought
O	it
O	best
O	to
O	hold
O	on
O	the
O	same
O	course
O	,
O	rather
O	than
O	turn
O	more
O	northerly
O	,
O	which
O	might
O	have
O	brought
O	us
O	to
O	the
O	northwest
O	part
O	of
O	Great
O	Tartary
O	,
O	and
O	into
O	the
O	Frozen
O	Sea
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	16th
O	day
O	of
O	June
O	,
O	1703
O	,
O	a
O	boy
O	on
O	the
O	topmast
O	discovered
O	land
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	17th
O	,
O	we
O	came
O	in
O	full
O	view
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	island
O	,
O	or
O	continent
O	(
O	for
O	we
O	knew
O	not
O	whether
O	)
O	;
O	on
O	the
O	south
O	side
O	whereof
O	was
O	a
O	small
O	neck
O	of
O	land
O	jutting
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	creek
O	too
O	shallow
O	to
O	hold
O	a
O	ship
O	of
O	above
O	one
O	hundred
O	tons
O	.
O	We
O	cast
O	anchor
O	within
O	a
O	league
O	of
O	the
O	creek
O	,
O	and
O	our
O	captain
O	sent
O	a
O	dozen
O	of
O	his
O	men
O	well
O	armed
O	in
O	the
O	long-boat
O	,
O	with
O	vessels
O	for
O	water
O	,
O	if
O	any
O	could
O	be
O	found
O	.
O	I
O	desired
O	his
O	leave
O	to
O	go
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	might
O	see
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	make
O	what
O	discoveries
O	I
O	could
O	.
O	When
O	we
O	came
O	to
O	land
O	,
O	we
O	saw
O	no
O	river
O	,
O	or
O	spring
O	,
O	nor
O	any
O	sign
O	of
O	inhabitants
O	.
O	Our
O	men
O	therefore
O	wandered
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	to
O	find
O	out
O	some
O	fresh
O	water
O	near
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	walked
O	alone
O	about
O	a
O	mile
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	observed
O	the
O	country
O	all
O	barren
O	and
O	rocky
O	.
O	I
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	weary
O	,
O	and
O	seeing
O	nothing
O	to
O	entertain
O	my
O	curiosity
O	,
O	I
O	returned
O	gently
O	down
O	toward
O	the
O	creek;
O	and
O	the
O	sea
O	being
O	full
O	in
O	my
O	view
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	our
O	men
O	already
O	got
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	rowing
O	for
O	life
O	to
O	the
O	ship
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	holla
O	after
O	them
O	,
O	although
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	to
O	little
O	purpose
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	observed
O	a
O	huge
O	creature
O	walking
O	after
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	:
O	he
O	waded
O	not
O	much
O	deeper
O	than
O	his
O	knees
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	prodigious
O	strides
O	:
O	but
O	our
O	men
O	had
O	the
O	start
O	of
O	him
O	half
O	a
O	league
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sea
O	thereabout
O	being
O	full
O	of
O	sharp-pointed
O	rocks
O	,
O	the
O	monster
O	was
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	overtake
O	the
O	boat
O	.
O	This
O	I
O	was
O	afterward
O	told
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	durst
O	not
O	stay
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	issue
O	of
O	the
O	adventure
O	,
O	but
O	ran
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	the
O	way
O	I
O	first
O	went
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	climbed
O	up
O	a
O	steep
O	hill
O	,
O	which
O	gave
O	me
O	some
O	prospect
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	it
O	fully
O	cultivated;
O	but
O	that
O	which
O	first
O	surprised
O	me
O	was
O	the
O	length
O	of
O	the
O	grass
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	in
O	those
O	grounds
O	that
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	kept
O	for
O	hay
O	,
O	was
O	about
O	twenty
O	feet
O	high
O	.
O	I
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	highroad
O	,
O	for
O	so
O	I
O	took
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	,
O	though
O	it
O	served
O	to
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	only
O	as
O	a
O	footpath
O	through
O	a
O	field
O	of
O	barley
O	.
O	Here
O	I
O	walked
O	on
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	see
O	little
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	,
O	it
O	being
O	now
O	near
O	harvest
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	corn
O	rising
O	at
O	least
O	forty
O	feet
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	an
O	hour
O	walking
O	to
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	this
O	field
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	fenced
O	in
O	with
O	a
O	hedge
O	of
O	at
O	least
O	one
O	hundred
O	and
O	twenty
O	feet
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	trees
O	so
O	lofty
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	make
O	no
O	computation
O	of
O	their
O	altitude
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	stile
O	to
O	pass
O	from
O	this
O	field
O	into
O	the
O	next
O	.
O	It
O	had
O	four
O	steps
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	stone
O	to
O	cross
O	over
O	when
O	you
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	uppermost
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	impossible
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	climb
O	this
O	stile
O	,
O	because
O	every
O	step
O	was
O	six
O	feet
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	upper
O	stone
O	about
O	twenty
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	endeavoring
O	to
O	find
O	some
O	gap
O	in
O	the
O	hedge
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	discovered
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	in
O	the
O	next
O	field
O	,
O	advancing
O	toward
O	the
O	stile
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	size
O	with
O	him
O	whom
O	I
O	saw
O	in
O	the
O	sea
O	pursuing
O	our
O	boat
O	.
O	He
O	appeared
O	as
O	tall
O	as
O	an
O	ordinary
O	spire
O	steeple
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	about
O	ten
O	yards
O	at
O	every
O	stride
O	,
O	as
O	near
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	guess
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	struck
O	with
O	the
O	utmost
O	fear
O	and
O	astonishment
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	to
O	hide
O	myself
O	in
O	the
O	corn
O	,
O	whence
O	I
O	saw
O	him
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	stile
O	looking
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	next
O	field
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	right
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	him
O	call
O	in
O	a
O	voice
O	many
O	degrees
O	louder
O	than
O	a
O	speaking-
O	trumpet;
O	but
O	the
O	noise
O	was
O	so
O	high
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	that
O	at
O	first
O	I
O	certainly
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	thunder
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	seven
O	monsters
O	,
O	like
O	himself
O	,
O	came
O	toward
O	him
O	,
O	with
O	reaping-hooks
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	,
O	each
O	hook
O	about
O	the
O	largeness
O	of
O	six
O	scythes
O	.
O	These
O	people
O	were
O	not
O	so
O	well
O	clad
O	as
O	the
O	first
O	,
O	whose
O	servants
O	or
O	laborers
O	they
O	seemed
O	to
O	be;
O	for
O	,
O	upon
O	some
O	words
O	he
O	spoke
O	,
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	reap
O	the
O	corn
O	in
O	the
O	field
O	where
O	I
O	lay
O	.
O	I
O	kept
O	from
O	them
O	at
O	as
O	great
O	a
O	distance
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	move
O	with
O	extreme
O	difficulty
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	stalks
O	of
O	corn
O	were
O	sometimes
O	not
O	above
O	a
O	foot
O	distant
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	hardly
O	squeeze
O	my
O	body
O	between
O	them
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	shift
O	to
O	go
O	forward
O	,
O	till
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	field
O	where
O	the
O	corn
O	had
O	been
O	laid
O	by
O	the
O	rain
O	and
O	wind
O	.
O	Here
O	it
O	was
O	impossible
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	advance
O	a
O	step;
O	for
O	the
O	stalks
O	were
O	so
O	interwoven
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	creep
O	through
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	beards
O	of
O	the
O	fallen
O	ears
O	so
O	strong
O	and
O	pointed
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	pierced
O	through
O	my
O	clothes
O	into
O	my
O	flesh
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	I
O	heard
O	the
O	reapers
O	not
O	above
O	a
O	hundred
O	yards
O	behind
O	me
O	.
O	Being
O	quite
O	dispirited
O	with
O	toil
O	,
O	and
O	wholly
O	overcome
O	by
O	grief
O	and
O	despair
O	,
O	I
O	lay
O	down
O	between
O	two
O	ridges
O	,
O	and
O	heartily
O	wished
O	I
O	might
O	there
O	end
O	my
O	days
O	.
O	I
O	bemoaned
O	my
O	desolate
O	widow
O	and
O	fatherless
O	children
O	.
O	I
O	lamented
O	my
O	own
O	folly
O	and
O	wilfulness
O	,
O	in
O	attempting
O	a
O	second
O	voyage
O	,
O	against
O	the
O	advice
O	of
O	all
O	my
O	friends
O	and
O	relations
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	terrible
O	agitation
O	of
O	mind
O	,
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	forbear
O	thinking
O	of
O	Lilliput
O	,
O	whose
O	inhabitants
O	looked
O	upon
O	me
O	as
O	the
O	greatest
O	prodigy
O	that
O	ever
O	appeared
O	in
O	the
O	world;
O	where
O	I
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	draw
O	an
O	imperial
O	fleet
O	in
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	perform
O	those
O	other
O	actions
O	,
O	which
O	will
O	be
O	recorded
O	forever
O	in
O	the
O	chronicles
O	of
O	that
O	empire
O	,
O	while
O	posterity
O	shall
O	hardly
O	believe
O	them
O	,
O	although
O	attested
O	by
O	millions
O	.
O	I
O	reflected
O	what
O	a
O	mortification
O	it
O	must
O	prove
O	to
O	me
O	to
O	appear
O	as
O	inconsiderable
O	in
O	this
O	nation
O	,
O	as
O	one
O	single
O	Lilliputian
O	would
O	be
O	among
O	us
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	I
O	conceived
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	least
O	of
O	my
O	misfortunes;
O	for
O	,
O	as
O	human
O	creatures
O	are
O	observed
O	to
O	be
O	more
O	savage
O	and
O	cruel
O	in
O	proportion
O	to
O	their
O	bulk
O	,
O	what
O	could
O	I
O	expect
O	but
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	morsel
O	in
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	among
O	these
O	enormous
O	barbarians
O	that
O	should
O	happen
O	to
O	seize
O	me
O	?
O	Undoubtedly
O	philosophers
O	are
O	in
O	the
O	right
O	when
O	they
O	tell
O	us
O	that
O	nothing
O	is
O	great
O	or
O	little
O	otherwise
O	than
O	by
O	comparison
O	.
O	It
O	might
O	have
O	pleased
O	fortune
O	,
O	to
O	have
O	let
O	the
O	Lilliputians
O	find
O	some
O	nation
O	where
O	the
O	people
O	were
O	as
O	diminutive
O	with
O	respect
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	to
O	me
O	.
O	And
O	who
O	knows
O	but
O	that
O	even
O	this
O	prodigious
O	race
O	of
O	mortals
O	might
O	be
O	equally
O	overmatched
O	in
O	some
O	distant
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	whereof
O	we
O	have
O	yet
O	no
O	discovery
O	.
O	Scared
O	and
O	confounded
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	,
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	forbear
O	going
O	on
O	with
O	these
O	reflections
O	,
O	when
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	reapers
O	approaching
O	within
O	ten
O	yards
O	of
O	the
O	ridge
O	where
O	I
O	lay
O	,
O	made
O	me
O	apprehend
O	that
O	with
O	the
O	next
O	step
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	squashed
O	to
O	death
O	under
O	his
O	foot
O	,
O	or
O	cut
O	in
O	two
O	with
O	his
O	reaping-hook
O	.
O	And
O	therefore
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	again
O	about
O	to
O	move
O	,
O	I
O	screamed
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	fear
O	could
O	make
O	me;
O	whereupon
O	the
O	huge
O	creature
O	trod
O	short
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	round
O	about
O	under
O	him
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	espied
O	me
O	as
O	I
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	He
O	considered
O	awhile
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	caution
O	of
O	one
O	who
O	endeavors
O	to
O	lay
O	hold
O	on
O	a
O	small
O	dangerous
O	animal
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	manner
O	that
O	it
O	shall
O	not
O	be
O	able
O	either
O	to
O	scratch
O	or
O	bite
O	him
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	myself
O	have
O	sometimes
O	done
O	with
O	a
O	weasel
O	in
O	England
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	he
O	ventured
O	to
O	take
O	me
O	behind
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	middle
O	,
O	between
O	his
O	forefinger
O	and
O	thumb
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	me
O	within
O	three
O	yards
O	of
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	behold
O	my
O	shape
O	more
O	perfectly
O	.
O	I
O	guessed
O	his
O	meaning
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	good
O	fortune
O	gave
O	me
O	so
O	much
O	presence
O	of
O	mind
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	resolved
O	not
O	to
O	struggle
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	as
O	he
O	held
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	above
O	sixty
O	feet
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	although
O	he
O	grievously
O	pinched
O	my
O	sides
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	I
O	should
O	slip
O	through
O	his
O	fingers
O	.
O	All
O	I
O	ventured
O	was
O	to
O	raise
O	mine
O	eyes
O	toward
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	and
O	place
O	my
O	hands
O	together
O	in
O	a
O	supplicating
O	posture
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	speak
O	some
O	words
O	in
O	an
O	humble
O	melancholy
O	tone
O	,
O	suitable
O	to
O	the
O	condition
O	I
O	then
O	was
O	in
O	:
O	for
O	I
O	apprehended
O	every
O	moment
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	dash
O	me
O	against
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	as
O	we
O	usually
O	do
O	any
O	little
O	hateful
O	animal
O	which
O	we
O	have
O	a
O	mind
O	to
O	destroy
O	.
O	But
O	my
O	good
O	star
O	would
O	have
O	it
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	appeared
O	pleased
O	with
O	my
O	voice
O	and
O	gestures
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	look
O	upon
O	me
O	as
O	a
O	curiosity
O	,
O	much
O	wondering
O	to
O	hear
O	me
O	pronounce
O	articulate
O	words
O	,
O	although
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	understand
O	them
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	forbear
O	groaning
O	and
O	shedding
O	tears
O	,
O	and
O	turning
O	my
O	head
O	toward
O	my
O	sides;
O	letting
O	him
O	know
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	how
O	cruelly
O	I
O	was
O	hurt
O	by
O	the
O	pressure
O	of
O	his
O	thumb
O	and
O	finger
O	.
O	He
O	seemed
O	to
O	apprehend
O	my
O	meaning;
O	for
O	,
O	lifting
O	up
O	the
O	lappet
O	of
O	his
O	coat
O	,
O	he
O	put
O	me
O	gently
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	ran
O	along
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	his
O	master
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	substantial
O	farmer
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	same
O	person
O	I
O	had
O	first
O	seen
O	in
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	The
O	farmer
O	having
O	(
O	as
O	I
O	suppose
O	by
O	their
O	talk
O	)
O	received
O	such
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	me
O	as
O	his
O	servant
O	could
O	give
O	him
O	,
O	took
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	a
O	small
O	straw
O	,
O	about
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	a
O	walking-staff
O	,
O	and
O	therewith
O	lifted
O	up
O	the
O	lappets
O	of
O	my
O	coat
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	it
O	seems
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	to
O	be
O	some
O	kind
O	of
O	covering
O	that
O	nature
O	had
O	given
O	me
O	.
O	He
O	blew
O	my
O	hair
O	aside
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	better
O	view
O	of
O	my
O	face
O	.
O	He
O	called
O	his
O	hinds
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	them
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	afterward
O	learned
O	,
O	whether
O	they
O	had
O	ever
O	seen
O	in
O	the
O	fields
O	any
O	little
O	creature
O	that
O	resembled
O	me
O	?
O	He
O	then
O	placed
O	me
O	softly
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	on
O	all
O	fours
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	immediately
O	got
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	walked
O	slowly
O	backward
O	and
O	forward
O	,
O	to
O	let
O	those
O	people
O	see
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	intent
O	to
O	run
O	away
O	.
O	They
O	all
O	sat
O	down
O	in
O	a
O	circle
O	about
O	me
O	,
O	the
O	better
O	to
O	observe
O	my
O	motions
O	.
O	I
O	pulled
O	off
O	my
O	hat
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	low
O	bow
O	toward
O	the
O	farmer
O	.
O	I
O	fell
O	on
O	my
O	knees
O	,
O	and
O	lifted
O	up
O	my
O	hands
O	and
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	spoke
O	several
O	words
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	I
O	could;
O	I
O	took
O	a
O	purse
O	of
O	gold
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	pocket
O	,
O	and
O	humbly
O	presented
O	it
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	received
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	palm
O	of
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	applied
O	it
O	close
O	to
O	his
O	eye
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	afterward
O	turned
O	it
O	several
O	times
O	with
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	a
O	pin
O	(
O	which
O	he
O	took
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	sleeve
O	)
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	make
O	nothing
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	place
O	his
O	hand
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	took
O	the
O	purse
O	,
O	and
O	opening
O	it
O	,
O	poured
O	all
O	the
O	gold
O	into
O	his
O	palm
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	six
O	Spanish
O	pieces
O	of
O	four
O	pistoles
O	each
O	,
O	besides
O	twenty
O	or
O	thirty
O	smaller
O	coins
O	.
O	I
O	saw
O	him
O	wet
O	the
O	tip
O	of
O	his
O	little
O	finger
O	upon
O	his
O	tongue
O	,
O	and
O	take
O	up
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	largest
O	pieces
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	another;
O	but
O	he
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	wholly
O	ignorant
O	what
O	they
O	were
O	.
O	He
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	sign
O	to
O	put
O	them
O	again
O	into
O	my
O	purse
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	purse
O	again
O	into
O	my
O	pocket
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	after
O	offering
O	it
O	to
O	him
O	several
O	times
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	it
O	best
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	The
O	farmer
O	,
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	was
O	convinced
O	I
O	must
O	be
O	a
O	rational
O	creature
O	.
O	He
O	spoke
O	often
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	his
O	voice
O	pierced
O	my
O	ears
O	like
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	watermill
O	,
O	yet
O	his
O	words
O	were
O	articulate
O	enough
O	.
O	I
O	answered
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	in
O	several
O	languages
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	often
O	laid
O	his
O	ear
O	within
O	two
O	yards
O	of
O	me;
O	but
O	all
O	in
O	vain
O	,
O	for
O	we
O	were
O	wholly
O	unintelligible
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	sent
O	his
O	servants
O	to
O	their
O	work
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	his
O	handkerchief
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	pocket
O	,
O	he
O	doubled
O	and
O	spread
O	it
O	on
O	his
O	left
O	hand
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	placed
O	flat
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	with
O	the
O	palm
O	upward
O	,
O	making
O	me
O	a
O	sign
O	to
O	step
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	easily
O	do
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	above
O	a
O	foot
O	in
O	thickness
O	.
O	I
O	thought
O	it
O	my
O	part
O	to
O	obey
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	falling
O	,
O	laid
O	myself
O	at
O	full
O	length
O	upon
O	the
O	handkerchief
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	remainder
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	lapped
O	me
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	head
O	for
O	further
O	security
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	this
O	manner
O	carried
O	me
O	home
O	to
O	his
O	house
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	called
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	me
O	to
O	her;
O	but
O	she
O	screamed
O	and
O	ran
O	back
O	,
O	as
O	women
O	in
O	England
O	do
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	a
O	toad
O	or
O	a
O	spider
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	awhile
O	seen
O	my
O	behavior
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	well
O	I
O	observed
O	the
O	signs
O	her
O	husband
O	made
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	soon
O	reconciled
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	degrees
O	grew
O	extremely
O	tender
O	of
O	me
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	about
O	twelve
O	at
O	noon
O	and
O	a
O	servant
O	brought
O	in
O	dinner
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	only
O	one
O	substantial
O	dish
O	of
O	meat
O	(
O	fit
O	for
O	the
O	plain
O	condition
O	of
O	a
O	husbandman
O	)
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	dish
O	of
O	about
O	four-and-twenty
O	feet
O	in
O	diameter
O	.
O	The
O	company
O	were
O	,
O	the
O	farmer
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	three
O	children
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	old
O	grandmother
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	were
O	sat
O	down
O	,
O	the
O	farmer
O	placed
O	me
O	at
O	some
O	distance
O	from
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	thirty
O	feet
O	high
O	from
O	the
O	floor
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	terrible
O	fright
O	,
O	and
O	kept
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	from
O	the
O	edge
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	falling
O	.
O	The
O	wife
O	minced
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	meat
O	,
O	then
O	crumbled
O	some
O	bread
O	on
O	a
O	trencher
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	it
O	before
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	made
O	her
O	a
O	low
O	bow
O	,
O	took
O	out
O	my
O	knife
O	and
O	fork
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	which
O	gave
O	them
O	exceeding
O	delight
O	.
O	The
O	mistress
O	sent
O	her
O	maid
O	for
O	a
O	small
O	dram
O	cup
O	,
O	which
O	held
O	about
O	two
O	gallons
O	,
O	and
O	filled
O	it
O	with
O	drink;
O	I
O	took
O	up
O	the
O	vessel
O	with
O	much
O	difficulty
O	in
O	both
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	most
O	respectful
O	manner
O	drank
O	to
O	her
O	ladyship
O	'
O	s
O	health
O	,
O	expressing
O	the
O	words
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	in
O	English
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	the
O	company
O	laugh
O	so
O	heartily
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	almost
O	deafened
O	with
O	the
O	noise
O	.
O	This
O	liquor
O	tasted
O	like
O	a
O	small
O	cider
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	not
O	unpleasant
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	master
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	sign
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	his
O	trencher
O	side;
O	but
O	as
O	I
O	walked
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	,
O	being
O	at
O	great
O	surprise
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	indulgent
O	reader
O	will
O	easily
O	conceive
O	and
O	excuse
O	,
O	I
O	happened
O	to
O	stumble
O	against
O	a
O	crust
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	flat
O	on
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	but
O	received
O	no
O	hurt
O	.
O	I
O	got
O	up
O	immediately
O	,
O	and
O	observing
O	the
O	good
O	people
O	to
O	be
O	in
O	much
O	concern
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	my
O	hat
O	(
O	which
O	I
O	held
O	under
O	my
O	arm
O	out
O	of
O	good
O	manners
O	)
O	,
O	and
O	waving
O	it
O	over
O	my
O	head
O	,
O	gave
O	three
O	huzzas
O	,
O	to
O	show
O	I
O	had
O	got
O	no
O	mischief
O	by
O	my
O	fall
O	.
O	But
O	advancing
O	forward
O	toward
O	my
O	master
O	,
O	(
O	as
O	I
O	shall
O	henceforth
O	call
O	him
O	)
O	,
O	his
O	youngest
O	son
O	,
O	who
O	sat
O	next
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	an
O	arch
O	boy
O	of
O	about
O	ten
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	legs
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	me
O	so
O	high
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	that
O	I
O	trembled
O	in
O	every
O	limb;
O	but
O	his
O	father
O	snatched
O	me
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	gave
O	him
O	such
O	a
O	box
O	on
O	the
O	left
O	ear
O	as
O	would
O	have
O	felled
O	an
O	European
O	troop
O	of
O	horse
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	ordering
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	taken
O	from
O	the
O	table
O	.
O	But
O	being
O	afraid
O	the
O	boy
O	might
O	owe
O	me
O	a
O	spite
O	,
O	and
O	well
O	remembering
O	how
O	mischievous
O	all
O	children
O	among
O	us
O	naturally
O	are
O	to
O	sparrows
O	,
O	rabbits
O	,
O	young
O	kittens
O	,
O	and
O	puppy
O	dogs
O	,
O	I
O	fell
O	on
O	my
O	knees
O	,
O	and
O	pointing
O	to
O	the
O	boy
O	,
O	made
O	my
O	master
O	to
O	understand
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	desired
O	his
O	son
O	might
O	be
O	pardoned
O	.
O	The
O	father
O	complied
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	lad
O	took
O	his
O	seat
O	again
O	,
O	whereupon
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	kissed
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	which
O	my
O	master
O	took
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	him
O	stroke
O	me
O	gently
O	with
O	it
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	dinner
O	,
O	my
O	mistress
O	'
O	s
O	favorite
O	cat
O	leaped
O	into
O	her
O	lap
O	,
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	noise
O	behind
O	me
O	like
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	dozen
O	stocking-
O	weavers
O	at
O	work;
O	and
O	turning
O	my
O	head
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	it
O	proceeded
O	from
O	the
O	purring
O	of
O	that
O	animal
O	,
O	who
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	three
O	times
O	larger
O	than
O	an
O	ox
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	computed
O	by
O	the
O	view
O	of
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	paws
O	,
O	while
O	her
O	mistress
O	was
O	feeding
O	and
O	stroking
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	fierceness
O	of
O	this
O	creature
O	'
O	s
O	countenance
O	altogether
O	discomposed
O	me;
O	though
O	I
O	stood
O	at
O	the
O	further
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	table
O	,
O	above
O	fifty
O	feet
O	off;
O	and
O	though
O	my
O	mistress
O	held
O	her
O	fast
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	she
O	might
O	give
O	a
O	spring
O	,
O	and
O	seize
O	me
O	in
O	her
O	talons
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	happened
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	danger
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	cat
O	took
O	not
O	the
O	least
O	notice
O	of
O	me
O	,
O	when
O	my
O	master
O	placed
O	me
O	within
O	three
O	yards
O	of
O	her
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	been
O	always
O	told
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	true
O	by
O	experience
O	in
O	my
O	travels
O	,
O	that
O	flying
O	or
O	discovering
O	fear
O	before
O	a
O	fierce
O	animal
O	is
O	a
O	certain
O	way
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	pursue
O	or
O	attack
O	you
O	,
O	so
O	I
O	resolved
O	,
O	in
O	this
O	dangerous
O	juncture
O	,
O	to
O	show
O	no
O	manner
O	of
O	concern
O	.
O	I
O	walked
O	with
O	intrepidity
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	times
O	before
O	the
O	very
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	cat
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	within
O	half
O	a
O	yard
O	of
O	her;
O	whereupon
O	she
O	drew
O	herself
O	back
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	more
O	afraid
O	of
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	less
O	apprehension
O	concerning
O	the
O	dogs
O	,
O	whereof
O	three
O	or
O	four
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	as
O	is
O	usual
O	in
O	farmers
O	?
O	houses;
O	one
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	mastiff
O	,
O	equal
O	in
O	bulk
O	to
O	four
O	elephants
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	greyhound
O	somewhat
O	taller
O	than
O	the
O	mastiff
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	so
O	large
O	.
O	When
O	dinner
O	was
O	almost
O	done
O	,
O	the
O	nurse
O	came
O	in
O	with
O	a
O	child
O	of
O	a
O	year
O	old
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	,
O	who
O	immediately
O	spied
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	a
O	squall
O	that
O	you
O	might
O	have
O	heard
O	from
O	London
O	Bridge
O	to
O	Chelsea
O	,
O	after
O	the
O	usual
O	oratory
O	of
O	infants
O	,
O	to
O	get
O	me
O	for
O	a
O	plaything
O	.
O	The
O	mother
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	pure
O	indulgence
O	,
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	me
O	toward
O	the
O	child
O	,
O	who
O	presently
O	seized
O	me
O	by
O	the
O	middle
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	my
O	head
O	into
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	roared
O	so
O	loud
O	that
O	the
O	urchin
O	was
O	frighted
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	me
O	drop
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	should
O	infallibly
O	have
O	broke
O	my
O	neck
O	,
O	if
O	the
O	mother
O	had
O	not
O	held
O	her
O	apron
O	under
O	me
O	.
O	The
O	nurse
O	,
O	to
O	quiet
O	her
O	babe
O	,
O	made
O	use
O	of
O	a
O	rattle
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	hollow
O	vessel
O	filled
O	with
O	great
O	stones
O	,
O	and
O	fastened
O	by
O	a
O	cable
O	to
O	the
O	child
O	'
O	s
O	waist
O	.
O	I
O	remember
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	at
O	Lilliput
O	,
O	the
O	complexions
O	of
O	those
O	diminutive
O	people
O	appeared
O	to
O	me
O	the
O	fairest
O	in
O	the
O	world;
O	and
O	talking
O	upon
O	the
O	subject
O	with
O	a
O	person
O	of
O	learning
O	there
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	an
O	intimate
O	friend
O	of

O	hundred

O	My

O	about
O	her
O	household
O	affairs
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	locked
O	me
O	in
O	.
O	The
O	bed
O	was
O	eight
O	yards
O	from
O	the
O	floor
O	.
O	I
O	durst
O	not
O	presume
O	to
O	call;
O	and
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	in
O	vain
O	,
O	with
O	such
O	a
O	voice
O	as
O	mine
O	,
O	at
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	distance
O	as
O	from
O	the
O	room
O	where
O	I
O	lay
O	to
O	the
O	kitchen
O	where
O	the
O	family
O	kept
O	.
O	While
O	I
O	was
O	under
O	these
O	circumstances
O	,
O	two
O	rats
O	crept
O	up
O	the
O	curtains
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	smelling
O	backward
O	and
O	forward
O	on
O	the
O	bed
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	came
O	up
O	almost
O	to
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	whereupon
O	I
O	rose
O	in
O	a
O	fright
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	out
O	my
O	hanger
O	to
O	defend
O	myself
O	.
O	These
O	horrible
O	animals
O	had
O	the
O	boldness
O	to
O	attack
O	me
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	held
O	his
O	forefeet
O	at
O	my
O	collar;
O	but
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	fortune
O	to
O	rip
O	up
O	his
O	belly
O	before
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	me
O	any
O	mischief
O	.
O	He
O	fell
O	down
O	at
O	my
O	feet;
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	seeing
O	the
O	fate
O	of
O	his
O	comrade
O	,
O	made
O	his
O	escape
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	without
O	one
O	good
O	wound
O	on
O	the
O	back
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	gave
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	fled
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	the
O	blood
O	run
O	trickling
O	from
O	him
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	exploit
O	,
O	I
O	walked
O	gently
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	on
O	the
O	bed
O	,
O	to
O	recover
O	my
O	breath
O	and
O	loss
O	of
O	spirits
O	.
O	These
O	creatures
O	were
O	of
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	a
O	large
O	mastiff
O	,
O	but
O	infinitely
O	more
O	nimble
O	and
O	fierce;
O	so
O	that
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	taken
O	off
O	my
O	belt
O	before
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	,
O	I
O	must
O	have
O	infallibly
O	been
O	torn
O	to
O	pieces
O	and
O	devoured
O	.
O	I
O	measured
O	the
O	tail
O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	rat
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	two
O	yards
O	long
O	,
O	wanting
O	an
O	inch;
O	but
O	it
O	went
O	against
O	my
O	stomach
O	to
O	draw
O	the
O	carcass
O	off
O	the
O	bed
O	,
O	where
O	it
O	lay
O	still
O	bleeding
O	.
O	I
O	observed
O	it
O	had
O	yet
O	some
O	life
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	a
O	strong
O	slash
O	across
O	the
O	neck
O	,
O	I
O	thoroughly
O	despatched
O	it
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	,
O	my
O	mistress
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	who
O	seeing
O	me
O	all
O	bloody
O	,
O	ran
O	and
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	.
O	I
O	pointed
O	to
O	the
O	dead
O	rat
O	,
O	smiling
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	other
O	signs
O	,
O	to
O	show
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	hurt;
O	whereat
O	she
O	was
O	extremely
O	rejoiced
O	,
O	calling
O	the
O	maid
O	to
O	take
O	up
O	the
O	dead
O	rat
O	with
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	tongs
O	,
O	and
O	throw
O	it
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	set
O	me
O	on
O	a
O	table
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	showed
O	her
O	my
O	hanger
O	all
O	bloody
O	,
O	and
O	wiping
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	lappet
O	of
O	my
O	coat
O	returned
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	scabbard
O	.
O	I
O	hope
O	the
O	gentle
O	reader
O	will
O	excuse
O	me
O	for
O	dwelling
O	on
O	these
O	and
O	the
O	like
O	particulars
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	however
O	insignificant
O	they
O	may
O	appear
O	to
O	grovelling
O	vulgar
O	minds
O	,
O	yet
O	will
O	certainly
O	help
O	a
O	philosopher
O	to
O	enlarge
O	his
O	thoughts
O	and
O	imagination
O	,
O	and
O	apply
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	benefit
O	of
O	public
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	private
O	life
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	my
O	sole
O	design
O	in
O	presenting
O	this
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	accounts
O	of
O	my
O	travels
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	world;
O	wherein
O	I
O	have
O	been
O	chiefly
O	studious
O	of
O	truth
O	,
O	without
O	affecting
O	any
O	ornaments
O	of
O	learning
O	or
O	of
O	style
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	whole
O	scene
O	of
O	this
O	voyage
O	made
O	so
O	strong
O	an
O	impression
O	on
O	my
O	mind
O	,
O	and
O	is
O	so
O	deeply
O	fixed
O	in
O	my
O	memory
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	committing
O	it
O	to
O	paper
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	omit
O	one
O	material
O	circumstance;
O	however
O	,
O	upon
O	strict
O	review
O	,
O	I
O	blotted
O	out
O	several
O	passages
O	of
O	less
O	moment
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	in
O	my
O	first
O	copy
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	being
O	censured
O	as
O	tedious
O	and
O	trifling
O	,
O	whereof
O	travellers
O	are
O	often
O	,
O	perhaps
O	not
O	without
O	justice
O	,
O	accused
O	.
