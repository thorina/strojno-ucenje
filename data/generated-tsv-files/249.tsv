O	An
O	old
O	man
O	was
O	sitting
O	alone
O	in
O	his
O	lodge
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	a
O	frozen
O	stream
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	close
O	of
O	winter
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	fire
O	was
O	almost
O	out
O	.
O	He
O	appeared
O	very
O	old
O	and
O	very
O	desolate
O	.
O	His
O	locks
O	were
O	white
O	with
O	age
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	trembled
O	in
O	every
O	joint
O	.
O	Day
O	after
O	day
O	passed
O	in
O	solitude
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	heard
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	sounds
O	of
O	the
O	tempest
O	,
O	sweeping
O	before
O	it
O	the
O	new-fallen
O	snow
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	as
O	his
O	fire
O	was
O	just
O	dying
O	,
O	a
O	handsome
O	young
O	man
O	approached
O	and
O	entered
O	his
O	dwelling
O	.
O	His
O	cheeks
O	were
O	red
O	with
O	the
O	blood
O	of
O	youth;
O	his
O	eyes
O	sparkled
O	with
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	smile
O	played
O	upon
O	his
O	lips
O	.
O	He
O	walked
O	with
O	a
O	light
O	and
O	quick
O	step
O	.
O	His
O	forehead
O	was
O	bound
O	with
O	a
O	wreath
O	of
O	sweet
O	grass
O	,
O	in
O	place
O	of
O	the
O	warrior
O	'
O	s
O	frontlet
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	carried
O	a
O	bunch
O	of
O	flowers
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
