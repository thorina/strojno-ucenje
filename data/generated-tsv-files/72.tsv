O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time

O	was
O	a
O	little
O	lamb
O	frisking
O	gaily
O	about
O	the
O	pasture
O	.
O	The
O	bright
O	sunshine
O	and
O	the
O	soft
O	breezes
O	made
O	him
O	very
O	happy
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	just
O	finished
O	a
O	hearty
O	meal
O	and
O	that
O	made
O	him
O	happy
O	too
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	the
O	very
O	happiest
O	little
O	lamb
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	and
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	wonderful
O	little
O	lamb
O	.
O	A
O	big
O	toad
O	sat
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	watched
O	him
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	while
O	the
O	toad
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	O
O	,
O	little
O	lamb
O	,

O	feeling
O	today

O	``
O	The
O	lamb

O	said
O	the
O	toad
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	lamb
O	laughed
O	and
O	laughed
O	until
O	he
O	rolled
O	over
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	``
O	Just

O	.
O	The
O	lamb
O	took
O	hold
O	of

O	rope
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	toad
O	said
O	,
O	``

O	The
O	lamb
O	waited
O	and
O	the
O	toad
O	hopped
O	down
O	to
O	the

O	.
O	He
O	hopped
O	up

O	he
O	hopped
O	on
O	to

O	He
O	fastened
O	the
O	end

O	the
O	whale
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	called
O	out

O	the
O	lamb
O	:
O	``

O	``
O	When
O	the
O	whale
O	felt
O	the
O	lamb
O	pulling
O	at
O	the
O	rope
O	he
O	swam
O	away

O	.
O	No

O	the
O	lamb
O	pulled
O	or
O	how
O	much
O	force
O	he
O	exerted
O	it
O	did
O	not

O	the
O	lamb

O	After

O	One
O	day
O	not

O	bright
O	and
O	the
O	little

O	again
O	feeling

O	He
O	was
O	so

O	The

O	Then
O	the
O	toad
O	and
O	the

O	The

O	the

O	to

O	``
O	The
O	little

O	hen
O	was
O	roughly
O	seized
O	by
O	the

O	royal
O	attendant
O	and
O	carried
O	down
O	the

O	to
O	the

O	.
O	When
O	the

O	poultry

O	all
O	the

O	at

O	Some

O	One
O	pulled
O	off
O	the
O	cover

O	the

O	brown
O	basket
O	.
O	Out
O	sprang
O	the

O	little
O	brown
O	basket
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	twinkling

O	fell
O	upon
O	the

O	.
O	Not
O	a
O	single
O	fowl
O	was
O	left
O	alive
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	great
O	commotion
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	the
O	royal
O	attendants
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	royal
O	servants
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	came
O	rushing
O	out
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter
O	.
O	The
O	fox
O	had
O	already
O	taken
O	to
O	his
O	heels
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	white
O	hen
O	lost
O	no
O	time
O	in
O	running
O	away
O	too
O	.
O	She
O	did
O	not
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	forget
O	to
O	take
O	her
O	little
O	brown
O	basket
O	with

O	.
O	The
O	royal
O	household
O	all
O	ran
O	after
O	her
O	in
O	swift
O	pursuit
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	almost
O	caught
O	her
O	when
O	the
O	river
O	suddenly
O	sprang
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	brown
O	basket
O	and
O	flowed
O	between
O	the
O	little
O	white
O	hen
O	and
O	her
O	royal
O	pursuers
O	.
O	They
O	couldn
O	'
O	t
O	get
O	across
O	without
O	canoes
O	.
O	While
O	they
O	were
O	getting
O	the
O	canoes
O	and
O	climbing
O	into
O	them
O	the
O	little
O	white
O	hen
O	had
O	time
O	to
O	run
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	almost
O	reached
O	a
O	thick
O	forest
O	where
O	she
O	could
O	easily
O	hide
O	herself
O	when
O	the
O	royal
O	pursuers
O	again
O	drew
O	near
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	fire
O	which
O	had
O	changed
O	itself
O	into
O	hot
O	ashes
O	jumped
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	brown
O	basket
O	.
O	It
O	immediately
O	became
O	dark
O	,
O	so
O	dark
O	that
O	the
O	royal
O	household
O	could
O	not
O	even
O	see
O	each
O	other
O	'
O	s
O	faces
O	and
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	in
O	which
O	direction
O	the
O	little
O	white
O	hen
O	was
O	running
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	nothing
O	for
O	them
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	royal
O	palace
O	and
O	live
O	on
O	beef
O	and
O	mutton
O	.
O	The
O	fire
O	which
O	had
O	turned
O	itself
O	into
O	ashes
O	sprang
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	brown
O	basket
O	so
O	suddenly
O	that
O	it
O	scattered
O	ashes
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	little
O	white
O	hen
O	.
O	From
O	that
O	day
O	she
O	was
O	always
O	speckled
O	where
O	the
O	ashes
O	fell
O	upon
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	chickens
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	white
O	hen
O	(
O	who
O	was
O	now
O	a
O	little
O	speckled
O	hen
O	)
O	were
O	all
O	speckled
O	too
O	.
O	So
O	were
O	their
O	chickens
O	and
O	their
O	chickens
O	and
O	their
O	chickens
O	'
O	chickens
O	,
O	even
O	down
O	to
O	this
O	very
O	day
O	.
O	Whenever
O	you
O	see
O	a
O	speckled
O	hen
O	you
O	may
O	know
O	that
O	she
O	is
O	descended
O	from
O	the
O	little
O	white
O	hen
O	who
O	carried
O	a
O	letter
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	,
O	in
O	her
O	adventures
O	,
O	became
O	the
O	first
O	speckled
O	hen
O	.
O	VIII
O	How
O	the
O	Monkey
O	Became
O	a
O	Trickster
O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	beautiful
O	garden
O	in
O	which
O	grew
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	fruits
O	.
O	Many
O	beasts
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	garden
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	permitted
O	to
O	eat
O	of
O	the
O	fruits
O	whenever
O	they
O	wished
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	were
O	asked
O	to
O	observe
O	one
O	rule
O	.
O	They
O	must
O	make
O	a
O	low
O	,
O	polite
O	bow
O	to
O	the
O	fruit
O	tree
O	,
O	call
O	it
O	by
O	its
O	name
O	,
O	and
O	say
O	,
O	``
O	Please
O	give
O	me
O	a
O	taste
O	of
O	your
O	fruit
O	.
O	``
O	They
O	had
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	careful
O	to
O	remember
O	the
O	tree
O	'
O	s
O	correct
O	name
O	and
O	not
O	to
O	forget
O	to
O	say
O	``
O	please
O	.
O	``
O	It
O	was
O	also
O	very
O	important
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	remember
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	greedy
O	.
O	They
O	must
O	always
O	leave
O	plenty
O	of
O	fruit
O	for
O	the
O	other
O	beasts
O	who
O	might
O	pass
O	that
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	plenty
O	to
O	adorn
O	the
O	tree
O	itself
O	and
O	to
O	furnish
O	seed
O	so
O	that
O	other
O	trees
O	might
O	grow
O	.
O	If
O	they
O	wished
O	to
O	eat
O	figs
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	``
O	O
O	,
O	fig
O	tree
O	,
O	O
O	,
O	fig
O	tree
O	,
O	please
O	give
O	me
O	a
O	taste
O	of
O	your
O	fruit
O	;
O	``
O	or
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	wished
O	to
O	eat
O	oranges
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	``
O	O
O	,
O	orange
O	tree
O	,
O	O
O	,
O	orange
O	tree
O	,
O	please
O	give
O	me
O	a
O	taste
O	of
O	your
O	fruit
O	.
O	``
O	In
O	one
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	garden
O	grew
O	the
O	most
O	splendid
O	tree
O	of
O	all
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	tall
O	and
O	beautiful
O	and
O	the
O	rosy-cheeked
O	fruit
O	upon
O	its
O	wide
O	spreading
O	branches
O	looked
O	wonderfully
O	tempting
O	.
O	No
O	beast
O	had
O	ever
O	tasted
O	of
O	that
O	fruit
O	,
O	for
O	no
O	beast
O	could
O	ever
O	remember
O	its
O	name
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	tiny
O	house
O	near
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	garden
O	dwelt
O	a
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	who
O	knew
O	the
O	names
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	fruit
O	trees
O	which
O	grew
O	in
O	the
O	garden
O	.
O	The
O	beasts
O	often
O	went
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	asked
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	wonderful
O	fruit
O	tree
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	tree
O	was
O	so
O	far
O	distant
O	from
O	the
O	tiny
O	house
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	that
O	no
O	beast
O	could
O	ever
O	remember
O	the
O	long
O	,
O	hard
O	name
O	by
O	the
O	time
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	fruit
O	tree
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	monkey
O	thought
O	of
O	a
O	trick
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	monkey
O	can
O	play
O	the
O	guitar
O	.
O	He
O	always
O	played
O	when
O	the
O	beasts
O	gathered
O	together
O	in
O	the
O	garden
O	to
O	dance
O	.
O	The
O	monkey
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	tiny
O	house
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	,
O	carrying
O	his
O	guitar
O	under
O	his
O	arm
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	the
O	long
O	hard
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	wonderful
O	fruit
O	tree
O	he
O	made
O	up
O	a
O	little
O	tune
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	all
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	sang
O	it
O	over
O	and
O	over
O	again
O	all
O	the
O	way
O	from
O	the
O	tiny
O	house
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	to
O	the
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	garden
O	where
O	the
O	wonderful
O	fruit
O	tree
O	grew
O	.
O	When
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	beasts
O	met
O	him
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	what
O	new
O	song
O	he
O	was
O	singing
O	to
O	his
O	guitar
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	never
O	a
O	word
O	.
O	He
O	marched
O	straight
O	on
O	,
O	playing
O	his
O	little
O	tune
O	over
O	and
O	over
O	again
O	on
O	his
O	guitar
O	and
O	singing
O	softly
O	the
O	long
O	hard
O	name
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	garden
O	where
O	the
O	wonderful
O	fruit
O	tree
O	grew
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	it
O	look
O	so
O	beautiful
O	.
O	The
O	rosy-cheeked
O	fruit
O	glowed
O	in
O	the
O	bright
O	sunlight
O	.
O	The
O	monkey
O	could
O	hardly
O	wait
O	to
O	make
O	his
O	bow
O	,
O	say
O	the
O	long
O	hard
O	name
O	over
O	twice
O	and
O	ask
O	for
O	the
O	fruit
O	with
O	a
O	``
O	please
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	a
O	beautiful
O	colour
O	and
O	what
O	a
O	delicious
O	odour
O	that
O	fruit
O	had
O	!
O	The
O	monkey
O	had
O	never
O	in
O	all
O	his
O	life
O	been
O	so
O	near
O	to
O	anything
O	which
O	smelled
O	so
O	good
O	.
O	He
O	took
O	a
O	big
O	bite
O	.
O	What
O	a
O	face
O	he
O	made
O	!
O	That
O	beautiful
O	sweet
O	smelling
O	fruit
O	was
O	bitter
O	and
O	sour
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	had
O	a
O	nasty
O	taste
O	.
O	He
O	threw
O	it
O	away
O	from
O	him
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	.
O	The
O	monkey
O	never
O	forgot
O	the
O	tree
O	'
O	s
O	long
O	hard
O	name
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	tune
O	he
O	had
O	sung
O	.
O	Nor
O	did
O	he
O	forget
O	how
O	the
O	fruit
O	tasted
O	.
O	He
O	never
O	took
O	a
O	bite
O	of
O	it
O	again
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	after
O	that
O	,
O	his
O	favourite
O	trick
O	was
O	to
O	treat
O	the
O	other
O	beasts
O	to
O	the
O	wonderful
O	fruit
O	just
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	make
O	faces
O	when
O	they
O	tasted
O	it
O	.
O	IX
O	How
O	the
O	Monkey
O	and
O	the
O	Goat
O	Earned
O	Their
O	Reputations
O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	the
O	tiger
O	sent
O	an
O	invitation
O	to
O	the
O	goat
O	asking
O	the
O	goat
O	to
O	accompany
O	him
O	on
O	a
O	visit
O	.
O	The
O	goat
O	promptly
O	accepted
O	the
O	invitation
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	appointed
O	day
O	they
O	started
O	on
O	their
O	journey
O	to
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	the
O	tiger
O	'
O	s
O	friend
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	way
O	there
O	they
O	came
O	to

O	without

O	could

O	big
O	drinking
O	place
O	.

O	Got

O	Hungry

O	I

O	in
O	Brazil
O	who
O	was
O	very
O	,
O	very
O	fond
O	of
O	bananas
O	.
O	He
O	always

O	If

O	This

O	tell
O	to
O	show
O	us
O	how
O	it
O	all
O	came

O	.
O	Once
O	upon

O	time
O	when
O	the

O	had
O	just
O	been
O	made
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	only
O	one

O	very

O	of

O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	who
O	had
O	a
O	big
O	garden
O	full
O	of
O	banana
O	trees
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	very
O	difficult
O	for
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	to
O	gather
O	the
O	bananas
O	herself
O	,
O	so
O	she
O	made
O	a
O	bargain
O	with
O	the
O	largest
O	monkey
O	.
O	She
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	gather
O	the
O	bunches
O	of
O	bananas
O	for
O	her
O	she
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	half
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	monkey
O	gathered
O	the
O	bananas
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	half
O	he
O	gave
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	the
O	bananas
O	which
O	grow
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	bunch
O	and
O	are
O	small
O	and
O	wrinkled
O	.
O	The
O	nice
O	big
O	fat
O	ones
O	he
O	kept
O	for
O	himself
O	and
O	carried
O	them
O	home
O	to
O	let
O	them
O	ripen
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	was
O	very
O	angry
O	.
O	She
O	lay
O	awake
O	all
O	night
O	trying
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	some
O	way
O	by
O	which
O	she
O	could
O	get
O	even
O	with
O	the
O	monkey
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	thought
O	of
O	a
O	trick
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	she
O	made
O	an
O	image
O	of
O	wax
O	which
O	looked
O	just
O	like
O	a
O	little
O	black
O	boy
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	placed
O	a
O	large
O	flat
O	basket
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	image
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	basket
O	she
O	placed
O	the
O	best
O	ripe
O	bananas
O	she
O	could
O	find
O	.
O	They
O	certainly
O	looked
O	very
O	tempting
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	the
O	biggest
O	monkey
O	passed
O	that
O	way
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	the
O	image
O	of
O	wax
O	and
O	thought
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	boy
O	peddling
O	bananas
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	often
O	pushed
O	over

O	banana
O	peddlers
O	,
O	upset
O	their
O	baskets
O	and
O	then
O	had
O	run
O	away
O	with
O	the
O	bananas
O	.
O	This
O	morning
O	he
O	was
O	feeling
O	very
O	good-natured
O	so
O	he
O	thought
O	that

O	would
O	first

O	monkey
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	pull
O	out
O	his
O	two
O	hands
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	could
O	pull
O	out
O	one
O	foot
O	,
O	then
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	his
O	body
O	,
O	too
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	was
O	free
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	saw
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	she
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	discouraged
O	about
O	raising
O	bananas
O	.
O	She
O	decided
O	to
O	move
O	to
O	another
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	where
O	she
O	raised
O	cabbages
O	instead
O	of
O	bananas
O	.
O	The
O	monkeys
O	were
O	left
O	in
O	possession
O	of
O	the
O	big
O	garden
O	full
O	of
O	banana
O	trees
O	.
O	From
O	that
O	day
O	to
O	this
O	the
O	monkeys
O	have
O	thought
O	that
O	they
O	own
O	all
O	the
O	bananas
O	.
O	XIII
O	How
O	the
O	Monkey
O	Escaped
O	Being
O	Eaten
O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	ages
O	and
O	ages
O	ago
O	,
O	people
O	ate
O	fruits
O	and
O	nuts
O	.
O	Then
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	time
O	when
O	the
O	fruits
O	and
O	nuts
O	became
O	scarce
O	.
O	People
O	had
O	to
O	eat
O	meat
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	began
O	killing
O	the
O	various
O	beasts
O	to
O	see
O	which
O	ones
O	were
O	the
O	best
O	to
O	eat
O	.
O	They
O	skinned
O	them
O	and
O	cut
O	them
O	in
O	pieces
O	and
O	cooked
O	them
O	over
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	beasts
O	were
O	good
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	others
O	were
O	not
O	good
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	The
O	ox
O	was
O	found
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	good
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	was
O	the
O	sheep
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	armadillo
O	.
O	Then
O	one
O	day
O	a
O	man
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	try
O	to
O	eat
O	the
O	monkey
O	.
O	The
O	monkey
O	was
O	playing
O	his
O	guitar
O	.

O	in
O	that

O	XIV
O	Why
O	the
O	Monkey
O	Still
O	Has
O	a
O	Tail
O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	the
O	monkey
O	and
O	the
O	rabbit
O	made
O	a
O	contract
O	.
O	The
O	monkey
O	was
O	to
O	kill
O	all
O	the
O	butterflies
O	and
O	the
O	rabbit
O	was
O	to
O	kill
O	all
O	the
O	snakes
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	the
O	rabbit
O	was
O	taking
O	a
O	nap
O	when
O	the
O	monkey
O	passed
O	that
O	way
O	.
O	The
O	monkey
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	play
O	a
O	trick
O	on
O	the
O	rabbit
O	so
O	he
O	pulled
O	the
O	rabbit
O	'
O	s
O	ears
O	,
O	pretending
O	that
O	he
O	thought
O	they
O	were
O	butterflies
O	.
O	The
O	rabbit
O	awoke
O	very
O	angry
O	at
O	the
O	monkey
O	and
O	he
O	plotted
O	how
O	he
O	might
O	revenge
O	himself
O	on
O	the
O	monkey
O	.
O	The
O	rabbit
O	and
O	the
O	armadillo
O	are
O	very
O	good
O	friends
O	.
O	The
O	armadillo
O	is
O	very
O	,
O	very
O	strong
O	,
O	you
O	know
O	,
O	so
O	it
O	was
O	he
O	whom
O	the
O	rabbit
O	asked
O	to
O	help
O	him
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	the
O	rabbit
O	caught
O	the
O	monkey
O	napping
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	watched
O	and
O	waited
O	a
O	long
O	,
O	long
O	time
O	to
O	catch
O	the
O	monkey
O	napping
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	succeeded
O	.
O	Even
O	the
O	monkey
O	sometimes
O	takes
O	a
O	nap
O	.
O	The
O	rabbit
O	called
O	the
O	armadillo
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	together
O	they
O	rolled
O	a
O	big
O	stone
O	upon
O	the
O	monkey
O	'
O	s
O	tail
O	.
O	The
O	monkey
O	pulled
O	so
O	hard
O	to
O	get
O	his
O	tail
O	out
O	from
O	under
O	the
O	stone
O	that
O	it
O	broke
O	off
O	.
O	The
O	cat
O	,
O	who
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	had
O	no
O	tail
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	,
O	spied
O	the
O	tail
O	and
O	ran
O	away
O	with
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	monkey
O	was
O	very
O	angry
O	at
O	the
O	rabbit
O	.
O	``
O	O
O	,
O	we
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	just
O	a

O	,

O	said
O	the

O	.

O	How

O	he
O	to
