O	Nowhere
O	does
O	the
O	continent
O	of
O	Europe
O	approach
O	Great
O	Britain
O	so
O	closely
O	as
O	at
O	the
O	Straits
O	of
O	Dover
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	English
O	sovereigns
O	were
O	full
O	of
O	the
O	vain
O	hope
O	of
O	obtaining
O	the
O	crown
O	of
O	France
O	,
O	or
O	at
O	least
O	of
O	regaining
O	the
O	great
O	possessions
O	that
O	their
O	forefathers
O	had
O	owned
O	as
O	French
O	nobles
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	spot
O	so
O	coveted
O	by
O	them
O	as
O	the
O	fortress
O	of
O	Calais
O	,
O	the
O	possession
O	of
O	which
O	gave
O	an
O	entrance
O	into
O	France
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	when
O	,
O	in
O	1346
O	,
O	Edward
O	III
O	had
O	beaten
O	Philippe
O	VI
O	at
O	the
O	battle
O	of
O	Crecy
O	,
O	the
O	first
O	use
O	he
O	made
O	of
O	his
O	victory
O	was
O	to
O	march
O	upon
O	Calais
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	siege
O	to
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	walls
O	were
O	exceedingly
O	strong
O	and
O	solid
O	,
O	mighty
O	defenses
O	of
O	masonry
O	,
O	of
O	huge
O	thickness
O	and
O	like
O	rocks
O	for
O	solidity
O	,
O	guarded
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	knew
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	useless
O	to
O	attempt
O	a
O	direct
O	assault
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	during
O	all
O	the
O	middle
O	ages
O	,
O	the
O	modes
O	of
O	protecting
O	fortifications
O	were
O	far
O	more
O	efficient
O	than
O	the
O	modes
O	of
O	attacking
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	walls
O	could
O	be
O	made
O	enormously
O	massive
O	,
O	the
O	towers
O	raised
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	height
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	defenders
O	so
O	completely
O	sheltered
O	by
O	battlements
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	easily
O	be
O	injured
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	take
O	aim
O	from
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	their
O	turrets
O	,
O	or
O	from
O	their
O	loophole
O	windows
O	.
O	The
O	gates
O	had
O	absolute
O	little
O	castles
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	,
O	a
O	moat
O	flowed
O	round
O	the
O	walls
O	full
O	of
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	only
O	capable
O	of
O	being
O	crossed
O	by
O	a
O	drawbridge
O	,
O	behind
O	which
O	the
O	portcullis
O	,
O	a
O	grating
O	armed
O	beneath
O	with
O	spikes
O	,
O	was
O	always
O	ready
O	to
O	drop
O	from
O	the
O	archway
O	of
O	the
O	gate
O	and
O	close
O	up
O	the
O	entrance
O	.
O	The
O	only
O	chance
O	of
O	taking
O	a
O	fortress
O	by
O	direct
O	attack
O	was
O	to
O	fill
O	up
O	the
O	moat
O	with
O	earth
O	and
O	faggots
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	raise
O	ladders
O	against
O	the
O	walls;
O	or
O	else
O	to
O	drive
O	engines
O	against
O	the
O	defenses
O	,
O	battering-rams
O	which
O	struck
O	them
O	with
O	heavy
O	beams
O	,
O	mangonels
O	which
O	launched
O	stones
O	,
O	sows
O	whose
O	arched
O	wooden
O	backs
O	protected
O	troops
O	of
O	workmen
O	who
O	tried
O	to
O	undermine
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	and
O	moving
O	towers
O	consisting
O	of
O	a
O	succession
O	of
O	stages
O	or
O	shelves
O	,
O	filled
O	with
O	soldiers
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	bridge
O	with
O	iron
O	hooks
O	,
O	capable
O	of
O	being
O	launched
O	from
O	the
O	highest
O	story
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	battlements
O	.
O	The
O	besieged
O	could
O	generally
O	disconcert
O	the
O	battering-ram
O	by
O	hanging
O	beds
O	or
O	mattresses
O	over
O	the
O	walls
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	brunt
O	of
O	the
O	blow
O	,
O	the
O	sows
O	could
O	be
O	crushed
O	with
O	heavy
O	stones
O	,
O	the
O	towers
O	burnt
O	by
O	well
O	directed
O	flaming
O	missiles
O	,
O	the
O	ladders
O	overthrown
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	general
O	the
O	besiegers
O	suffered
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	more
O	damage
O	than
O	they
O	could
O	inflict
O	.
O	Cannon
O	had
O	indeed
O	just
O	been
O	brought
O	into
O	use
O	at
O	the
O	battle
O	of
O	Crecy
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	only
O	consisted
O	of
O	iron
O	bars
O	fastened
O	together
O	with
O	hoops
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	as
O	yet
O	of
O	little
O	use
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	there
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	little
O	danger
O	to
O	a
O	well
O	guarded
O	city
O	from
O	any
O	enemy
O	outside
O	the
O	walls
O	.
O	King
O	Edward
O	arrived
O	before
O	the
O	place
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	victorious
O	army
O	early
O	in
O	August
O	,
O	his
O	good
O	knights
O	and
O	squires
O	arrayed
O	in
O	glittering
O	steel
O	armor
O	,
O	covered
O	with
O	surcoats
O	richly
O	embroidered
O	with
O	their
O	heraldic
O	bearings;
O	his
O	stout
O	men-at-arms
O	,
O	each
O	of
O	whom
O	was
O	attended
O	by
O	three
O	bold
O	followers;
O	and
O	his
O	archers
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	cross-bows
O	to
O	shoot
O	bolts
O	,
O	and
O	long-bows
O	to
O	shoot
O	arrows
O	of
O	a
O	yard
O	long
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	used
O	to
O	be
O	said
O	that
O	each
O	went
O	into
O	battle
O	with
O	three
O	men
O	'
O	s
O	lives
O	under
O	his
O	girdle
O	,
O	namely
O	the
O	three
O	arrows
O	he
O	kept
O	there
O	ready
O	to
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	With
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	his
O	son
O	,
O	Edward
O	,
O	Prince
O	of
O	Wales
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	just
O	won
O	the
O	golden
O	spurs
O	of
O	knighthood
O	so
O	gallantly
O	at
O	Crecy
O	when
O	only
O	in
O	his
O	seventeenth
O	year
O	,
O	and
O	likewise
O	the
O	famous
O	Hainault
O	knight
O	,
O	Sir
O	Walter
O	Mauny
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	that
O	was
O	noblest
O	and
O	bravest
O	in
O	England
O	.
O	This
O	whole
O	glittering
O	army
O	,
O	at
O	their
O	head
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	great
O	royal
O	standard
O	bearing
O	the
O	golden
O	lilies
O	of
O	France
O	quartered
O	with
O	the
O	lions
O	of
O	England
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	troop
O	guided
O	by
O	the
O	square
O	banner
O	,
O	swallow-tailed
O	pennon
O	or
O	pointed
O	pennoncel
O	of
O	their
O	leader
O	,
O	came
O	marching
O	to
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	Calais
O	,
O	above
O	which
O	floated
O	the
O	blue
O	standard
O	of
O	France
O	with
O	its
O	golden
O	flowers
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	it
O	the
O	banner
O	of
O	the
O	governor
O	,
O	Sir
O	Jean
O	de
O	Vienne
O	.
O	A
O	herald
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	rich
O	long
O	robe
O	embroidered
O	with
O	the
O	arms
O	of
O	England
O	,
O	rode
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	a
O	trumpet
O	sounding
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	upon
O	Sir
O	Jean
O	de
O	Vienne
O	to
O	give
O	up
O	the
O	place
O	to
O	Edward
O	,
O	King
O	of
O	England
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	France
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	claimed
O	to
O	be
O	.
O	Sir
O	Jean
O	made
O	answer
O	that
O	he
O	held
O	the
O	town
O	for
O	Philippe
O	,
O	King
O	of
O	France
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	defend
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	last;
O	the
O	herald
O	rode
O	back
O	again
O	and
O	the
O	English
O	began
O	the
O	siege
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	they
O	only
O	encamped
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	Calais
O	must
O	have
O	seen
O	the
O	whole
O	plain
O	covered
O	with
O	the
O	white
O	canvas
O	tents
O	,
O	marshalled
O	round
O	the
O	ensigns
O	of
O	the
O	leaders
O	,
O	and
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	a
O	more
O	gorgeous
O	one
O	displaying
O	the
O	colors
O	of
O	the
O	owner
O	.
O	Still
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	attack
O	upon
O	the
O	walls
O	.
O	The
O	warriors
O	were
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	walking
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	leathern
O	suits
O	they
O	wore
O	under
O	their
O	armor;
O	or
O	if
O	a
O	party
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	with
O	their
O	coats
O	of
O	mail
O	on
O	,
O	helmet
O	on
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	lance
O	in
O	hand
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	against
O	Calais
O	that
O	they
O	came;
O	they
O	rode
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	and
O	by
O	might
O	be
O	seen
O	driving-back
O	before
O	them
O	herds
O	of
O	cattle
O	and
O	flocks
O	of
O	sheep
O	or
O	pigs
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	seized
O	and
O	taken
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	poor
O	peasants;
O	and
O	at
O	night
O	the
O	sky
O	would
O	show
O	red
O	lights
O	where
O	farms
O	and
O	homesteads
O	had
O	been
O	set
O	on
O	fire
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	tents
O	,
O	the
O	English
O	were
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	hard
O	at
O	work
O	with
O	beams
O	and
O	boards
O	,
O	setting
O	up
O	huts
O	for
O	themselves
O	,
O	and
O	thatching
O	them
O	over
O	with
O	straw
O	or
O	broom
O	.
O	These
O	wooden
O	houses
O	were
O	all
O	ranged
O	in
O	regular
O	streets
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	market-place
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	,
O	whither
O	every
O	Saturday
O	came
O	farmers
O	and
O	butchers
O	to
O	sell
O	corn
O	and
O	meat
O	,
O	and
O	hay
O	for
O	the
O	horses;
O	and
O	the
O	English
O	merchants
O	and
O	Flemish
O	weavers
O	would
O	come
O	by
O	sea
O	and
O	by
O	land
O	to
O	bring
O	cloth
O	,
O	bread
O	,
O	weapons
O	,
O	and
O	everything
O	that
O	could
O	be
O	needed
O	to
O	be
O	sold
O	in
O	this
O	warlike
O	market
O	.
O	The
O	governor
O	,
O	Sir
O	Jean
O	de
O	Vienne
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	perceive
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	did
O	not
O	mean
O	to
O	waste
O	his
O	men
O	by
O	making
O	vain
O	attacks
O	on
O	the
O	strong
O	walls
O	of
O	Calais
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	shut
O	up
O	the
O	entrance
O	by
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	watch
O	the
O	coast
O	by
O	sea
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	prevent
O	any
O	provisions
O	from
O	being
O	taken
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	to
O	starve
O	him
O	into
O	surrendering
O	.
O	Sir
O	Jean
O	de
O	Vienne
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	hoped
O	that
O	before
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	entirely
O	reduced
O	by
O	famine
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	France
O	would
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	get
O	together
O	another
O	army
O	and
O	come
O	to
O	his
O	relief
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	any
O	rate
O	he
O	was
O	determined
O	to
O	do
O	his
O	duty
O	,
O	and
O	hold
O	out
O	for
O	his
O	master
O	to
O	the
O	last
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	food
O	was
O	already
O	beginning
O	to
O	grow
O	scarce
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	turn
O	out
O	such
O	persons
O	as
O	could
O	not
O	fight
O	and
O	had
O	no
O	stores
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	one
O	Wednesday
O	morning
O	he
O	caused
O	all
O	the
O	poor
O	to
O	be
O	brought
O	together
O	,
O	men
O	,
O	women
O	,
O	and
O	children
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	them
O	all
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	1
O	,
O	700
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	probably
O	the
O	truest
O	mercy
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	food
O	to
O	give
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	could
O	only
O	have
O	starved
O	miserably
O	within
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	or
O	have
O	hindered
O	him
O	from
O	saving
O	it
O	for
O	his
O	sovereign;
O	but
O	to
O	them
O	it
O	was
O	dreadful
O	to

O	out
O	of
O	house
O	and
O	home
O	,
O	straight
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	enemy
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	went
O	along
O	weeping
O	and
O	wailing
O	,
O	till
O	the
O	English
O	soldiers
O	met
O	them
O	and
O	asked
O	why
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	out
O	.
O	They
O	answered
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	put
O	out
O	because
O	they
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	sorrowful
O	famished
O	looks
O	gained
O	pity
O	for
O	them
O	.
O	King
O	Edward
O	sent
O	orders
O	that
O	not
O	only
O	should
O	they
O	go
O	safely
O	through
O	his
O	camp
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	all
O	rest
O	,
O	and
O	have
O	the
O	first
O	hearty
O	dinner
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	eaten
O	for
O	many
O	a
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	sent
O	every
O	one
O	a
O	small
O	sum
O	of
O	money
O	before
O	they
O	left
O	the
O	camp
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	many
O	of
O	them
O	went
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	praying
O	aloud
O	for
O	the
O	enemy
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	kind
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	deal
O	happened
O	whilst
O	King
O	Edward
O	kept
O	watch
O	in
O	his
O	wooden
O	town
O	and
O	the
O	citizens
O	of

O	guarded
O	their

O	England

O	many

O	Very

O	,
O	and
O	Sir

O	de
O	Vienne
O	and
O	his
O	garrison
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	quite
O	starved
O	but
O	for
O	two
O	sailors
O	of
O	Abbeville
O	,
O	named
O	Marant
O	and
O	Mestriel
O	,
O	who
O	knew
O	the
O	coast
O	thoroughly
O	,
O	and
O	often
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	autumn
O	evenings
O	,
O	would
O	guide
O	in
O	a
O	whole

O	of

O	meat
O	for
O	the
O	starving
O	men
O	within

O	They
O	were
O	often
O	chased
O	by
O	King
O	Edward
O	'
O	s
O	vessels
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	sometimes
O	very

O	they

O	thus
O	they
O	still
O	enabled
O	the
O	garrison
O	to
O	hold
O	out
O	.
O	So
O	all
O	the
O	winter
O	passed
O	,
O	Christmas
O	was
O	kept
O	with
O	brilliant
O	feasting
O	and
O	high
O	merriment
O	by
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	his
O	queen
O	in
O	their
O	wooden
O	palace
O	outside
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	lean
O	cheeks
O	and
O	scanty
O	fare
O	by
O	the
O	besieged
O	within
O	.
O	Lent
O	was
O	strictly
O	observed
O	perforce
O	by
O	the
O	besieged
O	,
O	and
O	Easter
O	brought
O	a
O	betrothal
O	in
O	the
O	English
O	camp;
O	a
O	very
O	unwilling
O	one
O	on
O	the
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	bridegroom
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	Count
O	of
O	Flanders
O	,
O	who
O	loved
O	the
O	French
O	much
O	better
O	than
O	the
O	English
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	only
O	been
O	tormented
O	into
O	giving
O	his
O	consent
O	by
O	his
O	unruly
O	vassals
O	because
O	they
O	depended
O	on
O	the
O	wool
O	of
O	English
O	sheep
O	for
O	their
O	cloth
O	works
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	though
O	King
O	Edward
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	Isabel
O	was
O	a
O	beautiful
O	fair-haired
O	girl
O	of
O	fifteen
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	count
O	would
O	scarcely
O	look

O	and
O	in
O	the
O	last
O	week
O	before
O	the
O	marriage-day
O	,
O	while
O	her
O	robes

O	jewels
O	were
O	being
O	prepared
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	father

O	were
O	arranging
O	the
O	presents
O	they
O	should
O	make
O	to
O	all
O	their
O	court
O	on
O	the
O	wedding-day
O	,
O	the
O	bridegroom
O	,
O	when
O	out
O	hawking
O	,
O	gave
O	his
O	attendants
O	the
O	slip
O	,
O	and
O	galloped
O	off
O	to
O	Paris
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	welcomed
O	by
O	King
O	Philippe
O	.
O	This
O	made
O	Edward
O	very
O	wrathful
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	than
O	ever
O	determined
O	to
O	take
O	Calais
O	.
O	About
O	Whitsuntide
O	he
O	completed
O	a
O	great
O	wooden
O	castle
O	upon
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	in
O	it
O	numerous
O	warlike
O	engines
O	,
O	with
O	forty
O	men-at-arms
O	and
O	200
O	archers
O	,
O	who
O	kept
O	such
O	a
O	watch
O	upon
O	the
O	harbor
O	that
O	not
O	even
O	the
O	two
O	Abbeville
O	sailors
O	could
O	enter
O	it
O	,
O	without
O	having
O	their
O	boats
O	crushed
O	and
O	sunk
O	by
O	the
O	great
O	stones
O	that
O	the
O	mangonels
O	launched
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	townspeople
O	began
O	to
O	feel
O	what
O	hunger
O	really
O	was
O	,
O	but
O	their
O	spirits
O	were
O	kept
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	hope
O	that
O	their
O	king
O	was
O	at
O	last
O	collecting
O	an
O	army
O	for
O	their
O	rescue
O	.
O	And
O	Philippe
O	did
O	collect
O	all
O	his
O	forces
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	and
O	noble
O	army
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	one
O	night
O	to
O	the
O	hill
O	of
O	Sangate
O	,
O	just
O	behind
O	the
O	English
O	army
O	,
O	the
O	knights
O	'
O	armor
O	glancing
O	and
O	their
O	pennons
O	flying
O	in
O	the
O	moonlight
O	,
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	beautiful
O	sight
O	to
O	the
O	hungry
O	garrison
O	who
O	could
O	see
O	the
O	white
O	tents
O	pitched
O	upon
O	the
O	hillside
O	.
O	Still
O	there
O	were
O	but
O	two
O	roads
O	by
O	which
O	the
O	French
O	could
O	reach
O	their
O	friends
O	in
O	the
O	town--one
O	along
O	the
O	seacoast
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	by
O	a
O	marshy
O	road
O	higher
O	up
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	but
O	one
O	bridge
O	by
O	which
O	the
O	river
O	could
O	be
O	crossed
O	.
O	The
O	English
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	fleet
O	could
O	prevent
O	any
O	troops
O	from
O	passing
O	along
O	the
O	coast
O	road
O	,
O	the
O	Earl
O	of
O	Derby
O	guarded
O	the
O	bridge
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	tower
O	,
O	strongly
O	fortified
O	,
O	close
O	upon
O	Calais
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	a
O	few
O	skirmishes
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	French
O	king
O	,
O	finding
O	it
O	difficult
O	to
O	force
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	relieve
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	sent
O	a
O	party
O	of
O	knights
O	with
O	a
O	challenge
O	to
O	King
O	Edward
O	to
O	come
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	camp
O	and
O	do
O	battle
O	upon
O	a
O	fair
O	field
O	.
O	To
O	this
O	Edward
O	made
O	answer
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	nearly
O	a
O	year
O	before
O	Calais
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	spent
O	large
O	sums
O	of
O	money
O	on
O	the
O	siege
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	nearly
O	become
O	master
O	of
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	intention
O	of
O	coming
O	out
O	only
O	to
O	gratify
O	his
O	adversary
O	,

O	were
O	,
O	it
O	appears
O	,
O	granted
O	to
O	the
O	queen--perhaps
O	,
O	because
O	she
O	considered
O	the
O	man

O	as
O	her

O	,
O	and
O	wished

O	Indeed
O	,
O	as
O	this
O	story
O	is
O	told
O	by
O	no
O	chronicler
O	but
O	Froissart
O	,
O	some
O	have
O	doubted
O	of

O	thought
O	the
O	violent
O	resentment
O	thus
O	imputed
O	to
O	Edward
O	III
O	inconsistent
O	with
O	his
O	general
O	character;
O	but
O	it
O	is
O	evident
O	that
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Calais
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	strong
O	provocation
O	by
O	attacks
O	on
O	his
O	shipping--piracies
O	which
O	are
O	not
O	easily
O	forgiven--and
O	that
O	he
O	considered
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	right
O	to
O	make
O	an
O	example
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	not
O	unlikely
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	,
O	have
O	intended
O	to
O	forgive
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	have
O	given
O	the
O	queen
O	the
O	grace
O	of
O	obtaining
O	their
O	pardon
O	,
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	excuse
O	himself
O	from
O	the
O	fulfillment
O	of
O	some
O	over-hasty
O	threat
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	however
O	this

O	been

O	nothing

O	,
O	prevented
O	her
O	from
O	driving
O	the
O	English
O	quite
O	out
O	of
O	France
O	.
O	These

O	,

O	,
O	cowardly
O	,
O	disbelieving;
O	in

O	by

O	in
O	the

O	deserted
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	the

O	to

O	doom
O	.
O	Weeks
O	had
O	passed
O	,
O	and
O	Joan
O	had
O	never
O	yet
O	seen
O	a
O	blow
O	struck
O	in
O	war
O	.
O	She
O	used

O	,
O	and
O	knightly
O	sports
O	of

O	,
O	and
O	it

O	that
O	a

O	became
O	,
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	best
O	riders
O	among
O	the
O	chivalry
O	of
O	France
O	.
O	The

O	It

O	.
O	There
O	was
O	good

O	It
O	was
O	plain
O	to

O	and

O	that
O	the

O	Maid

O	and
O	women
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	Voices
O	,
O	her
O	visions
O	,
O	her
O	prophecies
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	powers
O	.
O	All
O	agreed
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	some
O	strange
O	help
O	given
O	to
O	her;
O	but
O	who
O	gave
O	it
O	?
O	This
O	aid
O	must
O	come
O	,
O	people
O	thought
O	then
O	,
O	either

O	that

O	If

O	,
O	then
O	her

O	,
O	and
O	so
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	legally
O	shut
O	out
O	from
O	his
O	kingdom
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	necessary
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	that
O	Joan
O	should
O	be
O	examined
O	by
O	learned

O	.
O	They
O	must
O	find

O	always
O	agreed
O	in
O	everything

O	.
O	Otherwise

O	They
O	,

O	deceived
O	her
O	,

O	The
