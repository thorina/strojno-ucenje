O	In
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	things
O	,
O	before

O	was
O	any
O	world
O	or
O	sun
O	,
O	moon
O	,
O	and
O	stars
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	the
O	giants
O	;
O	for
O	these
O	were
O	the
O	oldest
O	creatures
O	that
O	ever
O	breathed
O	.
O	They
O	lived
O	in
O	Jotunheim
O	,
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	frost
O	and
O	darkness
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	hearts
O	were
O	evil
O	.
O	Next
O	came
O	the
O	gods
O	,
O	the
O	good
O	AEsir
O	,
O	who
O	made
O	earth
O	and
O	sky
O	and
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	dwelt
O	in
O	Asgard
O	,
O	above
O	the
O	heavens
O	.
O	Then
O	were
O	created
O	the
O	queer
O	little
O	dwarfs
O	,
O	who
O	lived
O	underground
O	in
O	the
O	caverns
O	of
O	the
O	mountains
O	,
O	working
O	at
O	their
O	mines
O	of
O	metal
O	and
O	precious
O	stones
O	.
O	Last
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	the
O	gods
O	made
O	men
O	to
O	dwell
O	in
O	Midgard
O	,
O	the
O	good
O	world
O	that
O	we
O	know
O	,
O	between
O	which
O	and
O	the
O	glorious
O	home
O	of
O	the
O	AEsir
O	stretched
O	Bifröst
O	,
O	the
O	bridge
O	of
O	rainbows
O	.
O	In
O	those
O	days
O	,
O	folk
O	say
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	mighty
O	ash
O	tree
O	named
O	Yggdrasil
O	,
O	so
O	vast
O	that
O	its
O	branches
O	shaded
O	the
O	whole
O	earth
O	and
O	stretched
O	up
O	into
O	heaven
O	where
O	the
O	AEsir
O	dwelt
O	,
O	while
O	its
O	roots
O	sank
O	far
O	down
O	below
O	the
O	lowest
O	depth
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	branches
O	of
O	the
O	big
O	ash
O	tree
O	lived
O	a
O	queer
O	family
O	of
O	creatures
O	.
O	First
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	eagle
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	wiser
O	than
O	any
O	bird
O	that
O	ever
O	lived
O	--
O	except
O	the
O	two
O	ravens
O	,
O	Thought
O	and
O	Memory
O	,
O	who
O	sat
O	upon
O	Father
O	Odin
O	'
O	s
O	shoulders
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	the
O	secrets
O	which
O	they
O	learned
O	in
O	their
O	flight
O	over
O	the
O	wide
O	world
O	.
O	Near
O	the
O	great
O	eagle
O	perched
O	a
O	hawk
O	,
O	and
O	four
O	antlered
O	deer
O	browsed
O	among
O	the
O	buds
O	of
O	Yggdrasil
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	coiled
O	a
O	huge
O	serpent
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	always
O	gnawing
O	hungrily
O	at
O	its
O	roots
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	whole
O	colony
O	of
O	little
O	snakes
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	company
O	--
O	so
O	many
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	never
O	be
O	counted
O	.
O	The
O	eagle
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	the
O	serpent
O	at
O	its
O	foot
O	were
O	enemies
O	,
O	always
O	saying
O	hard
O	things
O	of
O	each
O	other
O	.
O	Between
O	the
O	two
O	skipped
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	a
O	little
O	squirrel
O	,
O	a
O	tale
O	bearer
O	and
O	a
O	gossip
O	,
O	who
O	repeated
O	each
O	unkind
O	remark
O	and
O	,
O	like
O	the
O	malicious
O	neighbour
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	kept
O	their
O	quarrel
O	ever
O	fresh
O	and
O	green
O	.
O	In
O	one
O	place
O	at
O	the
O	roots
O	of
O	Yggdrasil
O	was
O	a
O	fair
O	fountain
O	called
O	the
O	Urdar-well
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	three
O	Norn
O	maidens
O	,
O	who
O	knew
O	the
O	past
O	,
O	present
O	,
O	and
O	future
O	,
O	dwelt
O	with
O	their
O	pets
O	,
O	the
O	two
O	white
O	swans
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	magic
O	water
O	in
O	the
O	fountain
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	Norns
O	sprinkled
O	every
O	day
O	upon
O	the
O	giant
O	tree
O	to
O	keep
O	it
O	green
O	--
O	water
O	so
O	sacred
O	that
O	everything
O	which
O	entered
O	it
O	became
O	white
O	as
O	the
O	film
O	of
O	an
O	eggshell
O	.
O	Close
O	beside
O	this
O	sacred
O	well
O	the
O	AEsir
O	had
O	their
O	council
O	hall
O	,
O	to
O	which
O	they
O	galloped
O	every
O	morning
O	over
O	the
O	rainbow
O	bridge
O	.
O	But
O	Father
O	Odin
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	AEsir
O	,
O	knew
O	of
O	another
O	fountain
O	more
O	wonderful
O	still
O	;
O	the
O	two
O	ravens
O	whom
O	he
O	sent
O	forth
O	to
O	bring
O	him
O	news
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	.
O	This
O	also
O	was
O	below
O	the
O	roots
O	of
O	Yggdrasil
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	the
O	sky
O	and
O	ocean
O	met
O	.
O	Here
O	for
O	centuries
O	and
O	centuries
O	the
O	giant
O	Mimer
O	had
O	sat
O	keeping
O	guard
O	over
O	his
O	hidden
O	well
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	which
O	lay
O	such
O	a
O	treasure
O	of
O	wisdom
O	as
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	nowhere
O	else
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	Every
O	morning
O	Mimer
O	dipped
O	his
O	glittering
O	horn
O	Giöll
O	into
O	the
O	fountain
O	and
O	drew
O	out
O	a
O	draught
O	of
O	the
O	wondrous
O	water
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	drank
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	wise
O	.
O	Every
O	day
O	he
O	grew
O	wiser
O	and
O	wiser
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	this
O	had
O	been
O	going
O	on
O	ever
O	since
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	things
O	,
O	you
O	can
O	scarcely
O	imagine
O	how
O	wise
O	Mimer
O	was
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	seem
O	right
O	to
O	Father
O	Odin
O	that
O	a
O	giant
O	should
O	have
O	all
O	this
O	wisdom
O	to
O	himself
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	giants
O	were
O	the
O	enemies
O	of
O	the
O	AEsir
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wisdom
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	hoarding
O	for
O	ages
O	before
O	the
O	gods
O	were
O	made
O	was
O	generally
O	used
O	for
O	evil
O	purposes
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	Odin
O	longed
O	and
O	longed
O	to
O	become
O	the
O	wisest
O	being
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	win
O	a
O	draught
O	from
O	Mimer
O	'
O	s
O	well
O	,
O	if
O	in
O	any

O	One

O	the
O	sun
O	had
O	set
O	behind
O	the

O	Odin
O	put
O	on

O	broad-brimmed
O	hat
O	and
O	his
O	striped
O	cloak
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	his
O	famous
O	staff
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	trudged
O	down

O	And
O	wise
O	Mimer
O	foretold
O	the
O	truth
O	.
O	Odin
O	thought
O	merely
O	of
O	the
O	wisdom
O	which
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	his
O	.
O	He
O	seized
O	the
O	horn
O	eagerly
O	,
O	and
O	emptied
O	it
O	without
O	delay
O	.
O	From
O	that
O	moment
O	he
O	became
O	wiser
O	than
O	anyone
O	else
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	except
O	Mimer
O	himself
O	.
O	Now
O	he
O	had
O	the
O	price
O	to
O	pay
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	pleasant
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	went
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	grotto
O	,
O	he
O	left
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	dark
O	pool
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	fiery
O	eyes
O	,
O	which
O	twinkled
O	and
O	winked
O	up
O	through
O	the
O	magic
O	depths
O	like
O	the
O	reflection
O	of
O	a
O	star
O	.
O	This
O	is
O	how
O	Odin
O	lost
O	his
O	eye
O	,
O	and
O	why
O	from
O	that
O	day
O	he
O	was
O	careful
O	to
O	pull
O	his
O	gray
O	hat
O	low
O	over
O	his
O	face
O	when
O	he
O	wanted
O	to
O	pass
O	unnoticed
O	.
O	For
O	by
O	this
O	oddity
O	folk
O	could
O	easily
O	recognise
O	the
O	wise
O	lord
O	of
O	Asgard
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	bright
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	sun
O	rose
O	over
O	the
O	mountains
O	of
O	Midgard
O	,
O	old
O	Mimer
O	drank
O	from
O	his
O	bubbly
O	well
O	a
O	draught
O	of
O	the
O	wise
O	water
O	that
O	flowed
O	over
O	Odin
O	'
O	s
O	pledge
O	.
O	Doing
O	so
O	,
O	from
O	his
O	underground
O	grotto
O	he
O	saw
O	all
O	that
O	befell
O	in
O	heaven
O	and
O	on
O	earth
O	.
O	So
O	that
O	he
O	also
O	was
O	wiser
O	by
O	the
O	bargain
O	.
O	Mimer
O	seemed
O	to
O	have
O	secured
O	rather
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	it
O	;
O	for
O	he
O	lost
O	nothing
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	spare
O	,
O	while
O	Odin
O	lost
O	what
O	no
O	man
O	can
O	well
O	part
O	with
O	--
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	good
O	windows
O	wherethrough
O	his
O	heart
O	looks
O	out
O	upon
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	sequel
O	to
O	these
O	doings
O	which
O	made
O	the
O	balance
O	swing
O	down
O	in
O	Odin
O	'
O	s
O	favour
O	.
O	Not
O	long
O	after
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	AEsir
O	quarrelled
O	with
O	the
O	Vanir
O	,
O	wild
O	enemies
O	of
O	theirs
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	terrible
O	battle
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	the
O	end
O	the
O	two
O	sides
O	made
O	peace
O	;
O	and
O	to
O	prove
O	that
O	they
O	meant
O	never
O	to
O	quarrel
O	again
O	,
O	they
O	exchanged
O	hostages
O	.
O	The
O	Vanir
O	gave
O	to
O	the
O	AEsir
O	old
O	Niörd
O	the
O	rich
O	,
O	the
O	lord
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	the
O	ocean
O	wind
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	two
O	children
O	,
O	Frey
O	and
O	Freia
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	indeed
O	a
O	gracious
O	gift
O	;
O	for
O	Freia
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	maid
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	twin
O	brother
O	was
O	almost
O	as
O	fair
O	.
O	To
O	the
O	Vanir
O	in
O	return
O	Father
O	Odin
O	gave
O	his
O	own
O	brother
O	Hoenir
O	.
O	And
O	with
O	Hoenir
O	he
O	sent
O	Mimer
O	the
O	wise
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	took
O	from
O	his
O	lonely
O	well
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	Vanir
O	made
O	Hoenir
O	their
O	chief
O	,
O	thinking
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	be
O	very
O	wise
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	brother
O	of
O	great
O	Odin
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	lately
O	become
O	famous
O	for
O	his
O	wisdom
O	.
O	They
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	the
O	secret
O	of
O	Mimer
O	'
O	s
O	well
O	,
O	how
O	the
O	hoary
O	old
O	giant
O	was
O	far
O	more
O	wise
O	than
O	anyone
O	who
O	had
O	not
O	quaffed
O	of
O	the
O	magic
O	water
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	true
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	assemblies
O	of
O	the
O	Vanir
O	Hoenir
O	gave
O	excellent
O	counsel
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	was
O	because
O	Mimer
O	whispered
O	in
O	Hoenir
O	'
O	s
O	ear
O	all
O	the
O	wisdom
O	that
O	he
O	uttered
O	.
O	Witless
O	Hoenir
O	was
O	quite
O	helpless
O	without
O	his
O	aid
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	or
O	say
O	.
O	Whenever
O	Mimer
O	was
O	absent
O	he
O	would
O	look
O	nervous
O	and
O	frightened
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	folk
O	questioned
O	him
O	he
O	always
O	answered
O	:
O	``
O	Yes
O	,
O	ah
O	yes
O	!
O	Now
O	go
O	and
O	consult
O	someone
O	else
O	.
O	``
O	Of
O	course
O	the
O	Vanir
O	soon
O	grew
O	very
O	angry
O	at
O	such
O	silly
O	answers
O	from
O	their
O	chief
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	suspect
O	the
O	truth
O	.
O	``
O	Odin
O	has
O	deceived
O	us
O	,
O	``
O	they
O	said
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	has
O	sent
O	us
O	his
O	foolish
O	brother
O	with
O	a
O	witch
O	to
O	tell
O	him
O	what
O	to
O	say
O	.
O	Ha
O	!
O	We
O	will
O	show
O	him
O	that
O	we
O	understand
O	the
O	trick
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	they
O	cut
O	off
O	poor
O	old
O	Mimer
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	and
O	sent
O	it
O	to
O	Odin
O	as
O	a
O	present
O	.
O	The
O	tales
O	do
O	not
O	say
O	what
O	Odin
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	gift
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	he
O	was
O	glad
O	that
O	now
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	one
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	world
O	who
O	could
O	be
O	called
O	so
O	wise
O	as
O	himself
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	he
O	was
O	sorry
O	for
O	the
O	danger
O	into
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	thrust
O	a
O	poor
O	old
O	giant
O	who
O	had
O	never
O	done
O	him
O	any
O	wrong
O	,
O	except
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	giant
O	of
O	the
O	race
O	which
O	the
O	AEsir
O	hated
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	ashamed
O	of
O	the
O	trick
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	played
O	the
O	Vanir
O	.
O	Odin
O	'
O	s
O	new
O	wisdom
O	showed
O	him
O	how
O	to
O	prepare
O	Mimer
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	with
O	herbs
O	and
O	charms
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	stood
O	up
O	by
O	itself
O	quite
O	naturally
O	and
O	seemed
O	not
O	dead
O	.
O	Thenceforth
O	Odin
O	kept
O	it
O	near
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	learned
O	from
O	it
O	many
O	useful
O	secrets
O	which
O	it
O	had
O	not
O	forgotten
O	.
O	So
O	in
O	the
O	end
O	Odin
O	fared
O	better
O	than
O	the
O	unhappy
O	Mimer
O	,
O	whose
O	worst
O	fault
O	was
O	that
O	he
O	knew
O	more
O	than
O	most
O	folk
O	.
O	That
O	is
O	a
O	dangerous
O	fault
O	,
O	as
O	others
O	have
O	found
O	;
O	though
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	one
O	for
O	which
O	many
O	of
O	us
O	need
O	fear
O	being
O	punished
O	.
