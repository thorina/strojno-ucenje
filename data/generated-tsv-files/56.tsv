O	Justly
O	may
O	I
O	say
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	lived
O	happy
O	enough
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	if
O	my
O	littleness
O	had
O	not
O	exposed
O	me
O	to
O	several
O	ridiculous
O	and
O	troublesome
O	accidents;
O	some
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	shall
O	venture
O	to
O	relate
O	.
O	Glumdalclitch
O	often
O	carried
O	me
O	into
O	the
O	gardens
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	in
O	my
O	smaller
O	box
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	sometimes
O	take
O	me
O	out
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	hold
O	me
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	or
O	set
O	me
O	down
O	to
O	walk
O	.
O	I
O	remember
O	,
O	before
O	the
O	dwarf
O	left
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	he
O	followed
O	us
O	one
O	day
O	into
O	those
O	gardens
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	nurse
O	having
O	set
O	me
O	down
O	,
O	he
O	and
O	I
O	being
O	close
O	together
O	,
O	near
O	some
O	dwarf
O	apple-trees
O	,
O	I
O	must
O	needs
O	show
O	my
O	wit
O	,
O	by
O	a
O	silly
O	allusion
O	between
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	which
O	happens
O	to
O	hold
O	in
O	their
O	language
O	as
O	it
O	does
O	in
O	ours
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	,
O	the
O	malicious
O	rogue
O	,
O	watching
O	his
O	opportunity
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	walking
O	under
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	shook
O	it
O	directly
O	over
O	my
O	head
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	a
O	dozen
O	apples
O	,
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	near
O	as
O	large
O	as
O	a
O	Bristol
O	barrel
O	,
O	came
O	tumbling
O	about
O	my
O	ears;
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	hit
O	me
O	on
O	the
O	back
O	as
O	I
O	chanced
O	to
O	stoop
O	,
O	and
O	knocked
O	me
O	down
O	flat
O	on
O	my
O	face;
O	but
O	I
O	received
O	no
O	other
O	hurt
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dwarf
O	was
O	pardoned
O	at
O	my
O	desire
O	,
O	because
O	I
O	had
O	given
O	the
O	provocation
O	.
O	Another
O	day
O	,
O	Glumdalelitch
O	left
O	me
O	on
O	a
O	smooth
O	grass
O	plot
O	to
O	divert
O	myself
O	,
O	while
O	she
O	walked
O	at
O	some
O	distance
O	with
O	her
O	governess
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	,
O	there
O	suddenly
O	fell
O	such
O	a
O	violent
O	shower
O	of
O	hail
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	immediately
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	force
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	struck
O	to
O	the
O	ground;
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	down
O	,
O	the
O	hailstones
O	gave
O	me
O	such
O	cruel
O	bangs
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	body
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	pelted
O	with
O	tennis-balls;
O	however
O	,
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	shift
O	to
O	creep
O	on
O	all
O	fours
O	,
O	and
O	shelter
O	myself
O	,
O	by
O	lying
O	flat
O	on
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	lee-side
O	of
O	a
O	border
O	of
O	lemon-thyme;
O	but
O	so
O	bruised
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	go
O	abroad
O	in
O	ten
O	days
O	.
O	Neither
O	is
O	that
O	at
O	all
O	to
O	be
O	wondered
O	at
O	,
O	because
O	nature
O	,
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	,
O	observing
O	the
O	same
O	proportion
O	through
O	all
O	her
O	operations
O	,
O	a
O	hailstone
O	is
O	near
O	eighteen
O	hundred
O	times
O	as
O	large
O	as
O	one
O	in
O	Europe;
O	which
O	I
O	can
O	assert
O	upon
O	experience
O	,
O	having
O	been
O	so
O	curious
O	to
O	weigh
O	and
O	measure
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	a
O	more
O	dangerous
O	accident
O	happened
O	to
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	garden
O	,
O	when
O	my
O	little
O	nurse
O	,
O	believing
O	she
O	had
O	put
O	me
O	in
O	a
O	secure
O	place
O	(
O	which
O	I
O	often
O	entreated
O	her
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	might
O	enjoy
O	my
O	own
O	thoughts
O	)
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	left
O	my
O	box
O	at
O	home
O	,
O	to
O	avoid
O	the
O	trouble
O	of
O	carrying
O	it
O	,
O	went
O	to
O	another
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	garden
O	with
O	her
O	governess
O	and
O	some
O	ladies
O	of
O	her
O	acquaintance
O	.
O	While
O	she
O	was
O	absent
O	and
O	out
O	of
O	hearing
O	,
O	a
O	small
O	white
O	spaniel
O	that
O	belonged
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	chief
O	gardeners
O	,
O	having
O	got
O	by
O	accident
O	into
O	the
O	garden
O	,
O	happened
O	to
O	range
O	near
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	lay
O	:
O	the
O	dog
O	,
O	following
O	the
O	scent
O	,
O	came
O	directly
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	me
O	in
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	ran
O	straight
O	to
O	his
O	master
O	wagging
O	his
O	tail
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	me
O	gently
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	By
O	good
O	fortune
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	well
O	taught
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	carried
O	between
O	his
O	teeth
O	without
O	the
O	least
O	hurt
O	,
O	or
O	even
O	tearing
O	my
O	clothes
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	poor
O	gardener
O	,
O	who
O	knew
O	me
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	great
O	kindness
O	for
O	me
O	,
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	terrible
O	fright;
O	he
O	gently
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	in
O	both
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	me
O	how
O	I
O	did;
O	but
O	I
O	was
O	so
O	amazed
O	and
O	out
O	of
O	breath
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	speak
O	a
O	word
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	myself
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	carried
O	me
O	safe
O	to
O	my
O	little
O	nurse
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	had
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	she
O	left
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	in
O	cruel
O	agonies
O	when
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	,
O	nor
O	answer
O	when
O	she
O	called
O	.
O	She
O	severely
O	reprimanded
O	the
O	gardener
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	dog
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	thing
O	was
O	hushed
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	known
O	at
O	court
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	girl
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	the
O	queen
O	'
O	s
O	anger;
O	and
O	truly
O	,
O	as
O	to
O	myself
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	it
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	for
O	my
O	reputation
O	that
O	such
O	a
O	story
O	should
O	go
O	about
O	.
O	This
O	accident
O	absolutely
O	determined
O	Glumdalclitch
O	never
O	to
O	trust
O	me
O	abroad
O	for
O	the
O	future
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	sight
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	long
O	afraid
O	of
O	this
O	resolution
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	concealed
O	from
O	her
O	some
O	little
O	unlucky
O	adventures
O	,
O	that
O	happened
O	in
O	those
O	times
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	left
O	by
O	myself
O	.
O	Once
O	a
O	kite
O	,
O	hovering
O	over
O	the
O	garden
O	,
O	made
O	a
O	stoop
O	at
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	resolutely
O	drawn
O	my
O	hanger
O	,
O	and
O	run
O	under
O	a
O	thick
O	espalier
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	certainly
O	carried
O	me
O	away
O	in
O	his
O	talons
O	.
O	Another
O	time
O	,
O	walking
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	fresh
O	molehill
O	,
O	I
O	fell
O	to
O	my
O	neck
O	in
O	the
O	hole
O	,
O	through
O	which
O	that
O	animal
O	had
O	cast
O	up
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	and
O	coined
O	some
O	lie
O	,
O	not
O	worth
O	remembering
O	,
O	to
O	excuse
O	myself
O	for
O	spoiling
O	my
O	clothes
O	.
O	I
O	likewise
O	broke
O	my
O	right
O	shin
O	against
O	the
O	shell
O	of
O	a
O	snail
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	happened
O	to
O	stumble
O	over
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	walking
O	alone
O	and
O	thinking
O	of
O	poor
O	England
O	.
O	I
O	cannot
O	tell
O	whether
O	I
O	were
O	more
O	pleased
O	or
O	mortified
O	to
O	observe
O	,
O	in
O	those
O	solitary
O	walks
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	smaller
O	birds
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	to
O	be
O	at
O	all
O	afraid
O	of
O	me
O	,
O	but
O	would
O	hop
O	about
O	within
O	a
O	yard
O	'
O	s
O	distance
O	,
O	looking
O	for
O	worms
O	and
O	other
O	food
O	,
O	with
O	as
O	much
O	indifference
O	and
O	security
O	as
O	if
O	no
O	creature
O	at
O	all
O	were
O	near
O	them
O	.
O	I
O	remember
O	,
O	a
O	thrush
O	had
O	the
O	confidence
O	to
O	snatch
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	bill
O	,
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	cake
O	that
O	Glumdalclitch
O	had
O	just
O	given
O	me
O	for
O	my
O	breakfast
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	attempted
O	to
O	catch
O	any
O	of
O	these
O	birds
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	boldly
O	turn
O	against
O	me
O	,
O	endeavoring
O	to
O	peck
O	my
O	fingers
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	durst
O	not
O	venture
O	within
O	their
O	reach;
O	and
O	then
O	they
O	would
O	hop
O	back
O	unconcerned
O	,
O	to
O	hunt
O	for
O	worms
O	or
O	snails
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	did
O	before
O	.
O	But
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	a
O	thick
O	cudgel
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	it
O	with
O	all
O	my
O	strength
O	so
O	luckily
O	,
O	at
O	a
O	linnet
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	knocked
O	him
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	seizing
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	neck
O	with
O	both
O	my
O	hands
O	,
O	ran
O	with
O	him
O	in
O	triumph
O	to
O	my
O	nurse
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	the
O	bird
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	only
O	been
O	stunned
O	,
O	recovering
O	himself
O	,
O	gave
O	me
O	so
O	many
O	boxes
O	with
O	his
O	wings
O	,
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	of
O	my
O	head
O	and
O	body
O	,
O	though
O	I
O	held
O	him
O	at
O	arm
O	'
O	s
O	length
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	reach
O	of
O	his
O	claws
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	twenty
O	times
O	thinking
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	go
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	was
O	soon
O	relieved
O	by
O	one
O	of
O	our
O	servants
O	,
O	who
O	wrung
O	off
O	the
O	bird
O	'
O	s
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	him
O	next
O	day
O	for
O	dinner
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	queen
O	'
O	s
O	command
O	.
O	This
O	linnet
O	,
O	as
O	near
O	as
O	I
O	can
O	remember
O	,
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	somewhat
O	larger
O	than
O	an
O	English
O	swan
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	a
O	young
O	gentleman
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	nephew
O	to
O	my
O	nurse
O	'
O	s
O	governess
O	,
O	came
O	and
O	pressed
O	them
O	both
O	to
O	see
O	an
O	execution
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	had
O	murdered
O	one
O	of
O	that
O	gentleman
O	'
O	s
O	intimate
O	acquaintance
O	.
O	Glumdalclitch
O	was
O	prevailed
O	on
O	to
O	be
O	of
O	the
O	company
O	,
O	very
O	much
O	against
O	her
O	inclination
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	naturally
O	tender-
O	hearted;
O	and
O	as
O	for
O	myself
O	,
O	although
O	I
O	abhorred
O	such
O	kind
O	of
O	spectacles
O	,
O	yet
O	my
O	curiosity
O	tempted
O	me
O	to
O	see
O	something
O	that
O	I
O	thought
O	must
O	be
O	extraordinary
O	.
O	The
O	malefactor
O	was
O	fixed
O	on
O	a
O	chair
O	upon
O	a
O	scaffold
O	erected
O	for
O	that
O	purpose
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	head
O	cut
O	off
O	at
O	one
O	blow
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	sword
O	of
O	about
O	forty
O	feet
O	long
O	.
O	The
O	veins
O	and
O	arteries
O	spouted
O	up
O	such
O	a
O	prodigious
O	quantity
O	of
O	blood
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	high
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	great
O	fountain
O	at
O	Versailles
O	was
O	not
O	equal
O	for
O	the
O	time
O	it
O	lasted;
O	and
O	the
O	head
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	fell
O	on
O	the
O	scaffold
O	floor
O	,
O	gave
O	such
O	a
O	bounce
O	as
O	made
O	me
O	start
O	,
O	although
O	I
O	were
O	at
O	least
O	half
O	an
O	English
O	mile
O	distant
O	.
O	The
O	queen
O	,
O	who
O	often
O	used
O	to
O	hear
O	me
O	talk
O	of
O	my
O	sea-voyages
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	all
O	occasions
O	to
O	divert
O	me
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	melancholy
O	,
O	asked
O	me
O	whether
O	I
O	understood
O	how
O	to
O	handle
O	a
O	sail
O	or
O	an
O	oar
O	,
O	and
O	whether
O	a
O	little
O	exercise
O	of
O	rowing
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	convenient
O	for
O	my
O	health
O	?
O	I
O	answered
O	that
O	I
O	understood
O	both
O	very
O	well
O	:
O	for
O	although
O	my
O	proper
O	employment
O	had
O	been
O	to
O	be
O	surgeon
O	or
O	doctor
O	to
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	yet
O	often
O	,
O	upon
O	a
O	pinch
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	work
O	like
O	a
O	common
O	mariner
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	how
O	this
O	could
O	be
O	done
O	in
O	their
O	country
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	smallest
O	wherry
O	was
O	equal
O	to
O	a
O	first-rate
O	man-of-war
O	among
O	us;
O	and
O	such
O	a
O	boat
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	manage
O	would
O	never
O	live
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	their
O	rivers
O	.
O	Her
O	Majesty
O	said
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	would
O	contrive
O	a
O	boat
O	,
O	her
O	own
O	joiner
O	should
O	make
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	would
O	provide
O	a
O	place
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	sail
O	in
O	.
O	The
O	fellow
O	was
O	an
O	ingenious
O	workman
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	my
O	instructions
O	,
O	in
O	ten
O	days
O	,
O	finished
O	a
O	pleasure-boat
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	its
O	tackling
O	,
O	able
O	conveniently
O	to
O	hold
O	eight
O	Europeans
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	finished
O	,
O	the
O	queen
O	was
O	so
O	delighted
O	that
O	she
O	ran
O	with
O	it
O	in
O	her
O	lap
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	who
O	ordered
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	put
O	into
O	a
O	cistern
O	full
O	of
O	water
O	,
O	with
O	me
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	by
O	way
O	of
O	trial;
O	where
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	manage
O	my
O	two
O	sculls
O	,
O	or
O	little
O	oars
O	,
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	room
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	queen
O	had
O	before
O	contrived
O	another
O	project
O	.
O	She
O	ordered
O	the
O	joiner
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	wooden
O	trough
O	of
O	three
O	hundred
O	feet
O	long
O	,
O	fifty
O	broad
O	,
O	and
O	eight
O	deep;
O	which
O	,
O	being
O	well
O	pitched
O	to
O	prevent
O	leaking
O	,
O	was
O	placed
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	along
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	in
O	an
O	outer
O	room
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	It
O	had
O	a
O	cock
O	near
O	the
O	bottom
O	to
O	let
O	out
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	began
O	to
O	grow
O	stale;
O	and
O	two
O	servants
O	could
O	easily
O	fill
O	it
O	in
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	.
O	Here
O	I
O	often
O	used
O	to
O	row
O	for
O	my
O	own
O	diversion
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	queen
O	and
O	her
O	ladies
O	,
O	who
O	thought
O	themselves
O	well
O	entertained
O	with
O	my
O	skill
O	and
O	agility
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	I
O	would
O	put
O	up
O	my
O	sail
O	and
O	then
O	my
O	business
O	was
O	only
O	to
O	steer
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	ladies
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	gale
O	with
O	their
O	fans;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	weary
O	,
O	some
O	of
O	their
O	pages
O	would
O	blow
O	my
O	sail
O	forward
O	with
O	their
O	breath
O	,
O	while
O	I
O	showed
O	my
O	art
O	by
O	steering
O	starboard
O	or
O	larboard
O	as
O	I
O	pleased
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	done
O	,
O	Glumdalclitch
O	always
O	carried
O	back
O	my
O	boat
O	into
O	her
O	closet
O	,
O	and
O	hung
O	it
O	on
O	a
O	nail
O	to
O	dry
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	exercise
O	I
O	once
O	met
O	an
O	accident
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	like
O	to
O	have
O	cost
O	me
O	my
O	life;
O	for
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	pages
O	having
O	put
O	my
O	boat
O	into
O	the
O	trough
O	,
O	the
O	governess
O	who
O	attended
O	Glumdalclitch
O	very
O	officiously
O	lifted
O	me
O	up
O	,
O	to
O	place
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	boat;
O	but
O	I
O	happened
O	to
O	slip
O	through
O	her
O	fingers
O	,
O	and
O	should
O	infallibly
O	have
O	fallen
O	down
O	forty
O	feet
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	if
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	luckiest
O	chance
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	stopped
O	by
O	a
O	corking-pin
O	that
O	stuck
O	in
O	the
O	good
O	gentlewoman
O	'
O	s
O	stomacher;
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	pin
O	passed
O	between
O	my
O	shirt
O	and
O	the
O	waistband
O	of
O	my
O	breeches
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	I
O	was
O	held
O	by
O	the
O	middle
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	till
O	Glumdalclitch
O	ran
O	to
O	my
O	relief
O	.
O	Another
O	time
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	servants
O	,
O	whose
O	office
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	fill
O	my
O	trough
O	every
O	third
O	day
O	with
O	fresh
O	water
O	,
O	was
O	so
O	careless
O	to
O	let
O	a
O	huge
O	frog
O	(
O	not
O	perceiving
O	it
O	)
O	slip
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	pail
O	.
O	The
O	frog
O	lay
O	concealed
O	till
O	I
O	was
O	put
O	into
O	my
O	boat
O	,
O	but
O	then
O	seeing
O	a
O	resting-
O	place
O	,
O	climbed
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	it
O	to
O	lean
O	so
O	much
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	balance
O	it
O	with
O	all
O	my
O	weight
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	to
O	prevent
O	overturning
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	frog
O	was
O	got
O	in
O	,
O	it
O	hopped
O	at
O	once
O	half
O	the
O	length
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	over
O	my
O	head
O	,
O	backward
O	and
O	forward
O	,
O	daubing
O	my
O	face
O	and
O	clothes
O	with
O	its
O	odious
O	slime
O	.
O	The
O	largeness
O	of
O	its
O	features
O	made
O	it
O	appear
O	the
O	most
O	deformed
O	animal
O	that
O	can
O	be
O	conceived
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	I
O	desired
O	Glumdalclitch
O	to
O	let
O	me
O	deal
O	with
O	it
O	alone
O	.
O	I
O	banged
O	it
O	a
O	good
O	while
O	with
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	sculls
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	forced
O	it
O	to
O	leap
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	greatest
O	danger
O	I
O	underwent
O	in
O	that
O	kingdom
O	was
O	from
O	a
O	monkey
O	,
O	who
O	belonged
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	clerks
O	of
O	the
O	kitchen
O	.
O	Glumdalclitch
O	had
O	locked
O	me
O	up
O	in
O	her
O	closet
O	,
O	while
O	she
O	went
O	somewhere
O	upon
O	business
O	,
O	or
O	a
O	visit
O	.
O	The
O	weather
O	being
O	very
O	warm
O	,
O	the
O	closet
O	window
O	was
O	left
O	open
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	windows
O	and
O	door
O	of
O	my
O	bigger
O	box
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	usually
O	lived
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	its
O	largeness
O	and
O	conveniency
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	sat
O	quietly
O	meditating
O	at
O	my
O	table
O	,
O	I
O	heard
O	something
O	bounce
O	in
O	at
O	the
O	closet-window
O	,
O	and
O	skip
O	about
O	from
O	one
O	side
O	to
O	the
O	other;
O	whereat
O	,
O	although
O	I
O	was
O	much
O	alarmed
O	,
O	yet
O	I
O	ventured
O	to
O	look
O	out
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	stirring
O	from
O	my
O	seat;
O	and
O	then
O	I
O	saw
O	this
O	frolicsome
O	animal
O	frisking
O	and
O	leaping
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	my
O	box
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	seemed
O	to
O	view
O	with
O	great
O	pleasure
O	and
O	curiosity
O	,
O	peeping
O	in
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	every
O	window
O	.
O	I
O	retreated
O	to
O	the
O	further
O	corner
O	of
O	my
O	room
O	,
O	or
O	box;
O	but
O	the
O	monkey
O	,
O	looking
O	in
O	at
O	every
O	side
O	,
O	put
O	me
O	into
O	such
O	a
O	fright
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	wanted
O	presence
O	of
O	mind
O	to
O	conceal
O	myself
O	under
O	the
O	bed
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	might
O	easily
O	have
O	done
O	.
O	After
O	some
O	time
O	spent
O	in
O	peeping
O	,
O	grinning
O	,
O	and
O	chattering
O	,
O	he
O	at
O	last
O	espied
O	me;
O	and
O	reaching
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	paws
O	in
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	cat
O	does
O	when
O	she
O	plays
O	with
O	a
O	mouse
O	,
O	although
O	I
O	often
O	shifted
O	place
O	to
O	avoid
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	at
O	length
O	seized
O	the
O	lappet
O	of
O	my
O	coat
O	(
O	which
O	being
O	made
O	of
O	that
O	country
O	silk
O	,
O	was
O	very
O	thick
O	and
O	strong
O	)
O	,
O	and
O	dragged
O	me
O	out
O	.
O	He
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	in
O	his
O	right
O	forefoot
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	me
O	as
O	a
O	nurse
O	does
O	a
O	child;
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	offered
O	to
O	struggle
O	,
O	he
O	squeezed
O	me
O	so
O	hard
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	thought
O	it
O	more
O	prudent
O	to
O	submit
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	good
O	reason
O	to
O	believe
O	that
O	he
O	took
O	me
O	for
O	a
O	young
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	species
O	,
O	by
O	his
O	often
O	stroking
O	my
O	face
O	very
O	gently
O	with
O	his
O	other
O	paw
O	.
O	In
O	these
O	diversions
O	he
O	was
O	interrupted
O	by
O	a
O	noise
O	at
O	the
O	closet
O	door
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	somebody
O	were
O	opening
O	it;
O	whereupon
O	he
O	suddenly
O	leaped
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	thence
O	upon
O	the
O	leads
O	and
O	gutters
O	,
O	walking
O	upon
O	three
O	legs
O	,
O	and
O	holding
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	fourth
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	clambered
O	up
O	to
O	a
O	roof
O	that
O	was
O	next
O	to
O	ours
O	.
O	I
O	heard
O	Glumdalclitch
O	give
O	a
O	shriek
O	the
O	moment
O	he
O	was
O	carrying
O	me
O	out
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	girl
O	was
O	almost
O	distracted;
O	that
O	quarter
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	was
O	all
O	in
O	an
O	uproar;
O	the
O	servants
O	ran
O	for
O	ladders;
O	the
O	monkey
O	was
O	seen
O	by
O	hundreds
O	in
O	the
O	court
O	,
O	sitting
O	upon
O	the
O	ridge
O	of
O	a
O	building
O	,
O	holding
O	me
O	like
O	a
O	baby
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	fore-paws
O	,
O	and
O	feeding
O	me
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	by
O	cramming
O	into
O	my
O	mouth
O	some
O	victuals
O	he
O	had
O	squeezed
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	bag
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	his
O	chaps
O	,
O	and
O	patting
O	me
O	when
O	I
O	would
O	not
O	eat;
O	whereat
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	rabble
O	below
O	could
O	not
O	forbear
O	laughing;
O	neither
O	do
O	I
O	think
O	they
O	justly
O	ought
O	to
O	be
O	blamed
O	,
O	for
O	,
O	without
O	question
O	,
O	the
O	sight
O	was
O	ridiculous
O	enough
O	to
O	everybody
O	but
O	myself
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	threw
O	up
O	stones
O	,
O	hoping
O	to
O	drive
O	the
O	monkey
O	down;
O	but
O	this
O	was
O	strictly
O	forbidden
O	,
O	or
O	else
O	,
O	very
O	probably
O	,
O	my
O	brains
O	had
O	been
O	dashed
O	out
O	.
O	The
O	ladders
O	were
O	now
O	applied
O	,
O	and
O	mounted
O	by
O	several
O	men;
O	which
O	the
O	monkey
O	observing
O	,
O	and
O	finding
O	himself
O	almost
O	encompassed
O	,
O	not
O	being
O	able
O	to
O	make
O	speed
O	enough
O	with
O	his
O	three
O	legs
O	,
O	let
O	me
O	drop
O	on
O	a
O	ridge
O	tile
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	his
O	escape
O	.
O	Here
O	I
O	sat
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	five
O	hundred
O	yards
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	expecting
O	every
O	moment
O	to
O	be
O	blown
O	down
O	by
O	the
O	wind
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	fall
O	by
O	my
O	own
O	giddiness
O	,
O	and
O	come
O	tumbling
O	over
O	and
O	over
O	from
O	the
O	ridge
O	to
O	the
O	eaves
O	:
O	but
O	an
O	honest
O	lad
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	nurse
O	'
O	s
O	footmen
O	,
O	climbed
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	putting
O	me
O	into
O	his
O	breeches
O	pocket
O	,
O	brought
O	me
O	down--safe
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	almost
O	choked
O	with
O	the
O	filthy
O	stuff
O	the
O	monkey
O	had
O	crammed
O	down
O	my
O	throat;
O	but
O	my
O	dear
O	little
O	nurse
O	picked
O	it
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	mouth
O	with
O	a
O	small
O	needle
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	I
O	fell
O	a-vomiting
O	,
O	which
O	gave
O	me
O	great
O	relief
O	.
O	Yet
O	I
O	was
O	so
O	weak
O	and
O	bruised
O	in
O	the
O	sides
O	with
O	the
O	squeezes
O	given
O	me
O	by
O	this
O	odious
O	animal
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	keep
O	my
O	bed
O	a
O	fortnight
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	,
O	queen
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	court
O	,
O	sent
O	every
O	day
O	to
O	inquire
O	after
O	my
O	health
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	Majesty
O	made
O	me
O	several
O	visits
O	during
O	my
O	sickness
O	.
O	The
O	monkey
O	was
O	killed
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	order
O	made
O	that
O	no
O	such
O	animal
O	should
O	be
O	kept
O	about
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	attended
O	the
O	king
O	after
O	my
O	recovery
O	,
O	to
O	return
O	him
O	thanks
O	for
O	his
O	favors
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	pleased
O	to
O	rally
O	me
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	upon
O	this
O	adventure
O	.
O	He
O	asked
O	me
O	,
O	what
O	my
O	thoughts
O	and
O	speculations
O	were
O	while
O	I
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	monkey
O	'
O	s
O	paw
O	?
O	how
O	I
O	liked
O	the
O	victuals
O	he
O	gave
O	me
O	?
O	his
O	manner
O	of
O	feeding
O	?
O	and
O	whether
O	the
O	fresh
O	air
O	on
O	the
O	roof
O	had
O	sharpened
O	my
O	stomach
O	?
O	He
O	desired
O	to
O	know
O	what
O	I
O	would
O	have
O	done
O	upon
O	such
O	an
O	occasion
O	in
O	my
O	own
O	country
O	?
O	I
O	told
O	his
O	Majesty
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	Europe
O	we
O	had
O	no
O	monkeys
O	except
O	such
O	as
O	were
O	brought
O	for
O	curiosities
O	from
O	other
O	places
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	small
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	deal
O	with
O	a
O	dozen
O	of
O	them
O	together
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	presumed
O	to
O	attack
O	me
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	for
O	that
O	monstrous
O	animal
O	,
O	with
O	whom
O	I
O	was
O	so
O	lately
O	engaged
O	(
O	it
O	was
O	indeed
O	as
O	large
O	as
O	an
O	elephant
O	)
O	,
O	if
O	my
O	fears
O	had
O	suffered
O	me
O	to
O	think
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	to
O	make
O	use
O	of
O	my
O	hanger
O	(
O	looking
O	fiercely
O	,
O	and
O	clapping
O	my
O	hand
O	upon
O	the
O	hilt
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	spoke
O	)
O	when
O	he
O	poked
O	his
O	paw
O	into
O	my
O	chamber
O	,
O	perhaps
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	given
O	him
O	such
O	a
O	wound
O	,
O	as
O	would
O	have
O	made
O	him
O	glad
O	to
O	withdraw
O	it
O	,
O	with
O	more
O	haste
O	than
O	he
O	put
O	it
O	in
O	.
O	This
O	I
O	delivered
O	in
O	a
O	firm
O	tone
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	person
O	who
O	was
O	jealous
O	lest
O	his
O	courage
O	should
O	be
O	called
O	in
O	question
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	my
O	speech
O	produced
O	nothing
O	else
O	beside
O	a
O	loud
O	laughter
O	,
O	which
O	all
O	the
O	respect
O	due
O	to
O	his
O	Majesty
O	from
O	those
O	about
O	him
O	could
O	not
O	make
O	them
O	contain
O	.
O	This
O	made
O	me
O	reflect
O	,
O	how
O	vain
O	an
O	attempt
O	it
O	is
O	for
O	a
O	man
O	to
O	endeavor
O	to
O	do
O	himself
O	honor
O	among
O	those
O	who
O	are
O	out
O	of
O	all
O	degree
O	of
O	equality
O	or
O	comparison
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	yet
O	I
O	have
O	seen
O	the
O	moral
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	behavior
O	very
O	frequently
O	in
O	England
O	since
O	my
O	return;
O	where
O	a
O	little
O	contemptible
O	varlet
O	,
O	without
O	the
O	least
O	title
O	to
O	birth
O	,
O	person
O	,
O	wit
O	,
O	or
O	common-sense
O	,
O	shall
O	presume
O	to
O	look
O	with
O	importance
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	himself
O	upon
O	a
O	foot
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	persons
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	.
