O	Prospero
O	,
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Milan
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	learned
O	and
O	studious
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	lived
O	among
O	his
O	books
O	,
O	leaving
O	the
O	management
O	of
O	his
O	dukedom
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	Antonio
O	,
O	in
O	whom
O	indeed
O	he
O	had
O	complete
O	trust
O	.
O	But
O	that
O	trust
O	was
O	ill-rewarded
O	,
O	for
O	Antonio
O	wanted
O	to
O	wear
O	the
O	duke
O	'
O	s
O	crown
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	to
O	gain
O	his
O	ends
O	,
O	would
O	have
O	killed
O	his
O	brother
O	but
O	for
O	the
O	love
O	the
O	people
O	bore
O	him
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	Prospero
O	'
O	s
O	great
O	enemy
O	,
O	Alonso
O	,
O	King
O	of
O	Naples
O	,
O	he
O	managed
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	his
O	hands
O	the
O	dukedom
O	with
O	all
O	its
O	honor
O	,
O	power
O	,
O	and
O	riches
O	.
O	For
O	they
O	took
O	Prospero
O	to
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	far
O	away
O	from
O	land
O	,
O	forced
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	little
O	boat
O	with
O	no
O	tackle
O	,
O	mast
O	,
O	or
O	sail
O	.
O	In
O	their
O	cruelty
O	and
O	hatred
O	they
O	put
O	his
O	little
O	daughter
O	,
O	Miranda
O	(
O	not
O	yet
O	three
O	years
O	old
O	)
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	sailed
O	away
O	,
O	leaving
O	them
O	to
O	their
O	fate
O	.
O	But
O	one
O	among
O	the
O	courtiers
O	with
O	Antonio
O	was
O	true
O	to
O	his
O	rightful
O	master
O	,
O	Prospero
O	.
O	To
O	save
O	the
O	duke
O	from
O	his
O	enemies
O	was
O	impossible
O	,
O	but
O	much
O	could
O	be
O	done
O	to
O	remind
O	him
O	of
O	a
O	subject
O	'
O	s
O	love
O	.
O	So
O	this
O	worthy
O	lord
O	,
O	whose
O	name
O	was
O	Gonzalo
O	,
O	secretly
O	placed
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	some
O	fresh
O	water
O	,
O	provisions
O	,
O	and
O	clothes
O	,
O	and
O	what
O	Prospero
O	valued
O	most
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	some
O	of
O	his
O	precious
O	books
O	.
O	The
O	boat
O	was
O	cast
O	on
O	an
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	Prospero
O	and
O	his
O	little
O	one
O	landed
O	in
O	safety
O	.
O	Now
O	this
O	island
O	was
O	enchanted
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	years
O	had
O	lain
O	under
O	the
O	spell
O	of
O	a
O	fell
O	witch
O	,
O	Sycorax
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	imprisoned
O	in
O	the
O	trunks
O	of
O	trees
O	all
O	the
O	good
O	spirits
O	she
O	found
O	there
O	.
O	She
O	died
O	shortly
O	before
O	Prospero
O	was
O	cast
O	on
O	those
O	shores
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	spirits
O	,
O	of
O	whom
O	Ariel
O	was
O	the
O	chief
O	,
O	still
O	remained
O	in
O	their
O	prisons
O	.
O	Prospero
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	magician
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	devoted
O	himself
O	almost
O	entirely
O	to
O	the
O	study
O	of
O	magic
O	during
O	the
O	years
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	allowed
O	his
O	brother
O	to
O	manage
O	the
O	affairs
O	of
O	Milan
O	.
O	By
O	his
O	art
O	he
O	set
O	free
O	the
O	imprisoned
O	spirits
O	,
O	yet
O	kept
O	them
O	obedient
O	to
O	his
O	will
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	more
O	truly
O	his
O	subjects
O	than
O	his
O	people
O	in
O	Milan
O	had
O	been
O	.
O	For
O	he
O	treated
O	them
O	kindly
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	they
O	did
O	his
O	bidding
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	exercised
O	his
O	power
O	over
O	them
O	wisely
O	and
O	well
O	.
O	One
O	creature
O	alone
O	he
O	found
O	it
O	necessary
O	to
O	treat
O	with
O	harshness
O	:
O	this
O	was
O	Caliban
O	,
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	wicked
O	old
O	witch
O	,
O	a
O	hideous
O	,
O	deformed
O	monster
O	,
O	horrible
O	to
O	look
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	vicious
O	and
O	brutal
O	in
O	all
O	his
O	habits
O	.
O	When
O	Miranda
O	was
O	grown
O	up
O	into
O	a
O	maiden
O	,
O	sweet
O	and
O	fair
O	to
O	see
O	,
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
O	Antonio
O	and
O	Alonso
O	,
O	with
O	Sebastian
O	,
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	Ferdinand
O	,
O	his
O	son
O	,
O	were
O	at
O	sea
O	together
O	with
O	old
O	Gonzalo
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	ship
O	came
O	near
O	Prospero
O	'
O	s
O	island
O	.
O	Prospero
O	,
O	knowing
O	they
O	were
O	there
O	,
O	raised
O	by
O	his
O	art
O	a
O	great
O	storm
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	even
O	the
O	sailors
O	on
O	board
O	gave
O	themselves
O	up
O	for
O	lost;
O	and
O	first
O	among
O	them
O	all
O	Prince
O	Ferdinand
O	leaped
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	his
O	father
O	thought
O	in
O	his
O	grief
O	,
O	was
O	drowned
O	.
O	But
O	Ariel
O	brought
O	him
O	safe
O	ashore;
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	crew
O	,
O	although
O	they
O	were
O	washed
O	overboard
O	,
O	were
O	landed
O	unhurt
O	in
O	different
O	parts
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	good
O	ship
O	herself
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	all
O	thought
O	had
O	been
O	wrecked
O	,
O	lay
O	at
O	anchor
O	in
O	the
O	harbor
O	whither
O	Ariel
O	had
O	brought
O	her
O	.
O	Such
O	wonders
O	could
O	Prospero
O	and
O	his
O	spirits
O	perform
O	.
O	While
O	yet
O	the
O	tempest
O	was
O	raging
O	,
O	Prospero
O	showed
O	his
O	daughter
O	the
O	brave
O	ship
O	laboring
O	in
O	the
O	trough
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	living
O	human
O	beings
O	like
O	themselves
O	.
O	She
O	,
O	in
O	pity
O	of
O	their
O	lives
O	,
O	prayed
O	him
O	who
O	had
O	raised
O	this
O	storm
O	to
O	quell
O	it
O	.
O	Then
O	her
O	father
O	bade
O	her
O	to
O	have
O	no
O	fear
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	intended
O	to
O	save
O	every

O	of
O	them
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	first

O	,
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	the
O	story

O	hers

O	that
