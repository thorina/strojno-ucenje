O	Some
O	Indian
O	hunters
O	once
O	made
O	their
O	way
O	north
O	,
O	to
O	hunt
O	for
O	moose
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	Falling
O	Leaves
O	.
O	They
O	journeyed
O	for
O	several
O	days
O	,
O	until
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	lake
O	.
O	Close
O	by
O	the
O	lake
O	they
O	built
O	a
O	log
O	cabin
O	.
O	Moss
O	was
O	placed
O	between
O	the
O	logs
O	to
O	keep
O	out
O	the
O	wind
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	thick
O	roof
O	was
O	made
O	from
O	hemlock
O	boughs
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	center
O	of
O	the
O	roof
O	,
O	a
O	small
O	opening
O	was
O	left
O	for
O	the
O	smoke
O	from
O	the
O	lodge
O	fire
O	to
O	pass
O	out
O	.
O	Here
O	the
O	hunters
O	lived
O	during
O	the
O	Moon
O	of
O	Falling
O	Leaves
O	.
O	Every
O	day
O	they
O	went
O	on
O	the
O	moose
O	trail
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	found
O	no
O	moose
O	.
O	Their
O	arrows
O	brought
O	them
O	little
O	game
O	of
O	any
O	kind
O	.
O	They
O	became
O	discouraged
O	and
O	sick
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	the
O	hunters
O	lay
O	down
O	and
O	died
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	there
O	was
O	but
O	one
O	hunter
O	left
O	.
O	He
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	was
O	sick
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	grew
O	weaker
O	day
O	by
O	day
O	.
O	His
O	food
O	was
O	nearly
O	gone
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	growing
O	cold
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	little
O	wood
O	in
O	the
O	cabin
O	to
O	burn
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	man
O	did
O	not
O	give
O	up
O	.
O	Again
O	and
O	again
O	he
O	cried
O	aloud
O	,
O	``
O	Some
O	one
O	will
O	come
O	and
O	help
O	me
O	!
O	Some
O	one
O	will
O	come
O	and
O	help
O	me
O	!
O	``
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	lay
O	there
O	too
O	weak
O	to
O	rise
O	,
O	the
O	fire
O	flickered
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	die
O	.
O	But
O	even
O	then
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	give
O	up
O	.
O	Again
O	and
O	again
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	weak
O	voice
O	he
O	cried
O	,
O	``
O	Some
O	one
O	will
O	come
O	and
O	help
O	me
O	!
O	Some
O	one
O	will
O	come
O	and
O	help
O	me
O	!
O	``
O	And
O	some
O	one
O	did
O	come
O	and
O	help
O	him
O	.
O	His
O	cry
O	was
O	heard
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	bird
O	came
O	flying
O	in
O	through
O	the
O	smoke
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	The
O	bird
O	had
O	such
O	a
O	cheery
O	,
O	brave
O	voice
O	that
O	the
O	man
O	felt
O	better
O	the
O	moment
O	he
O	flew
O	in
O	.
O	The
O	bird
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	man
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	was
O	near
O	;
O	I
O	heard
O	you
O	calling
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	come
O	to
O	help
O	you
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	bird
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	fire
O	was
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	man
O	was
O	cold
O	.
O	He
O	fluttered
O	among
O	the
O	ashes
O	until
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	live
O	coal
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	glad
O	chirp
O	,
O	he
O	flew
O	out
O	through
O	the
O	roof
O	.
O	Soon
O	he
O	was
O	back
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	bill
O	full
O	of
O	dried
O	twigs
O	.
O	He
O	placed
O	them
O	on
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	fan
O	them
O	into
O	flame
O	with
O	his
O	wings
O	.
O	Soon
O	the
O	twigs
O	were
O	blazing
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	flew
O	out
O	for
O	more
O	twigs
O	,
O	--
O	and
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	.
O	The
O	brave
O	little
O	bird
O	kept
O	on
O	carrying
O	twigs
O	until
O	the
O	fire
O	burned
O	hot
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	lodge
O	was
O	warm
O	once
O	more
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	bird
O	had
O	flown
O	into
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	had
O	a
O	clean
O	,
O	white
O	breast
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	fire
O	was
O	built
O	,
O	his
O	breast
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	red
O	and
O	brown
O	spots
O	.
O	He
O	tried
O	to
O	pick
O	them
O	off
O	with
O	his
O	bill
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	come
O	off
O	.
O	Instead
O	,
O	they
O	seemed
O	to
O	spread
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	whole
O	breast
O	became
O	red-brown
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	bird
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	have
O	burned
O	his
O	breast
O	to
O	a
O	red-brown
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	fanning
O	the
O	fire
O	into
O	flame
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	little
O	bird
O	did
O	not
O	care
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	soiled
O	his
O	white
O	breast
O	,
O	and
O	burned
O	it
O	red-brown
O	.
O	Had
O	he
O	not
O	brought
O	cheer
O	and
O	life
O	to
O	a
O	dying
O	man
O	?
O	He
O	chirped
O	a
O	few
O	glad
O	notes
O	,
O	then
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	man
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	now
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	shall
O	be
O	near
O	your
O	lodge
O	.
O	When
O	you
O	need
O	me
O	,
O	call
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	come
O	again
O	.
O	``
O	Later
O	in
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	man
O	again
O	called
O	for
O	help
O	.
O	The
O	fire
O	was
O	getting
O	low
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	strong
O	enough
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	and
O	gather
O	twigs
O	.
O	Again
O	the
O	bird
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	aid
O	.
O	In
O	and
O	out
O	he
O	flew
O	,
O	many
O	times
O	,
O	after
O	small
O	branches
O	and
O	twigs
O	,
O	until
O	they
O	were
O	piled
O	high
O	on
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	once
O	more
O	it
O	crackled
O	and
O	burned
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	wood
O	in
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	The
O	man
O	placed
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	warmth
O	healed
O	the
O	man
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	soon
O	he
O	was
O	well
O	and
O	strong
O	again
O	.
O	Every
O	day
O	the
O	man
O	talked
O	with
O	the
O	bird
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	always
O	near
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	cheery
O	voice
O	and
O	brave
O	words
O	gave
O	the
O	man
O	courage
O	.
O	Once
O	more
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	the
O	moose
O	trail
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	time
O	his
O	arrows
O	brought
O	him
O	moose
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	the
O	hunter
O	had
O	all
O	the
O	meat
O	,
O	skins
O	,
O	and
O	moose
O	hair
O	he
O	wanted
O	.
O	The
O	moose
O	hair
O	he
O	was
O	taking
O	to
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	to
O	work
O	into
O	pretty
O	forms
O	on
O	moccasins
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	snow
O	was
O	falling
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	hunter
O	started
O	south
O	on
O	the
O	home
O	trail
O	.
O	The
O	bird
O	hopped
O	along
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	for
O	a
O	little
O	way
O	,
O	then
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	must
O	leave
O	you
O	now
O	.
O	Winter
O	is
O	coming
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	must
O	be
O	on
O	my
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	Southland
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	snow
O	will
O	catch
O	me
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	spring
O	you
O	will
O	see
O	me
O	again
O	.
O	``
O	When
O	spring
O	came
O	,
O	the
O	bird
O	with
O	the
O	red-brown
O	breast
O	came
O	with
O	his
O	mate
O	,
O	and
O	built
O	a
O	nest
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	hunter
O	'
O	s
O	home
O	lodge
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	nest
O	,
O	that
O	summer
O	,
O	there
O	grew
O	up
O	five
O	little
O	birds
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	had
O	red
O	and
O	brown
O	breasts
O	.
O	And
O	ever
O	since
O	,
O	Robin
O	Redbreast
O	has
O	continued
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	build
O	his
O	nest
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	lodges
O	of
O	men
O	,
O	for
O	Robin
O	Redbreast
O	is
O	a
O	friend
O	to
O	man
O	.
