O	In
O	the
O	reign
O	of
O	King
O	Edward
O	the
O	Third
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	poor
O	orphan
O	boy
O	,
O	named
O	Dick
O	Whittington
O	,
O	living
O	in
O	a
O	country
O	village
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	from
O	London
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	sharp
O	little
O	lad
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	stories
O	that
O	he
O	heard
O	of
O	London
O	being
O	paved
O	with
O	gold
O	made
O	him
O	long
O	to
O	visit
O	that
O	city
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	a
O	large
O	wagon
O	and
O	eight
O	horses
O	,
O	with
O	bells
O	at
O	their
O	heads
O	,
O	drove
O	through
O	the
O	village
O	.
O	Dick
O	thought
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	going
O	to
O	London
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	asked
O	the
O	driver
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	walk
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	wagon
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	driver
O	heard
O	that
O	poor
O	Dick
O	had
O	neither
O	father
O	nor
O	mother
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	by
O	his
O	ragged
O	clothes
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	worse
O	off
O	than
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	he
O	told
O	him
O	he
O	might
O	go
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	;
O	so
O	they
O	set
O	off
O	together
O	.
O	Dick
O	got
O	safely
O	to
O	London
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	hurry
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	fine
O	streets
O	paved
O	with
O	gold
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	ran
O	through
O	many
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	thinking
O	every
O	moment
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	those
O	that
O	were
O	paved
O	with
O	gold
O	;
O	for
O	Dick
O	had
O	seen
O	a
O	guinea
O	three
O	times
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	little
O	village
O	,
O	and
O	remembered
O	what
O	a
O	lot
O	of
O	money
O	it
O	brought
O	in
O	change
O	;
O	so
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	to
O	take
O	up
O	some
O	little
O	bits
O	of
O	pavement
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	would
O	then
O	have
O	as
O	much
O	money
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	wish
O	for
O	.
O	Poor
O	Dick
O	ran
O	till
O	he
O	was
O	tired
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	quite
O	forgotten
O	his
O	friend
O	the
O	driver
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	finding
O	it
O	grow
O	dark
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	every
O	way
O	he
O	turned
O	he
O	saw
O	nothing
O	but
O	dirt
O	instead
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	he
O	sat
O	down
O	in
O	a
O	dark
O	corner
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	himself
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	Next
O	morning
O	,
O	being
O	very
O	hungry
O	,
O	he
O	got
O	up
O	and
O	walked
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	everybody
O	he
O	met
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	a
O	halfpenny
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	from
O	starving
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	a
O	good-natured-looking
O	gentleman
O	saw
O	how
O	hungry
O	he
O	looked
O	.
O	``
O	Why
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	you
O	go
O	to
O	work
O	,
O	my
O	lad
O	?
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	would
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	Dick
O	,
O	``
O	but
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	to
O	get
O	any
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	If
O	you
O	are
O	willing
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	gentleman
O	,
O	``
O	come
O	with
O	me
O	;
O	``
O	and
O	so
O	saying
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	hayfield
O	,
O	where
O	Dick
O	worked
O	briskly
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	merrily
O	till
O	the
O	hay
O	was
O	all
O	made
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	as
O	badly
O	off
O	as
O	before
O	;
O	and
O	being
O	almost
O	starved
O	again
O	,
O	he
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	,
O	a
O	rich
O	merchant
O	.
O	Here
O	the
O	cook
O	,
O	an
O	ill-tempered
O	woman
O	,
O	called
O	out
O	to
O	poor
O	Dick
O	:
O	``
O	What
O	business
O	have
O	you
O	there
O	,
O	you
O	lazy
O	rogue
O	?
O	If
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	take
O	yourself
O	away
O	,
O	we
O	will
O	see
O	how
O	you
O	like
O	a
O	sousing
O	of
O	some
O	dish-water
O	I
O	have
O	here
O	,
O	that
O	is
O	hot
O	enough
O	to
O	make
O	you
O	jump
O	.
O	``
O	At
O	this
O	time
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	himself
O	came
O	home
O	to
O	dinner
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	dirty
O	ragged
O	boy
O	lying
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	kind
O	and
O	gentle
O	voice
O	:
O	``
O	Why
O	do
O	you
O	lie
O	there
O	,
O	my
O	lad
O	?
O	you
O	seem
O	old
O	enough
O	to
O	work
O	;
O	I
O	am
O	afraid
O	you
O	are
O	lazy
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	No
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Dick
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	would
O	work
O	with
O	all
O	my
O	heart
O	;
O	but
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	anybody
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	am
O	sick
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	food
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Poor
O	fellow
O	!
O	``
O	answered
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	;
O	``
O	get
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	me
O	see
O	what
O	ails
O	you
O	.
O	``
O	Dick
O	tried
O	to
O	rise
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	too
O	weak
O	to
O	stand
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	eaten
O	anything
O	for
O	three
O	days
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	kind
O	merchant
O	ordered
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	taken
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	have
O	a
O	good
O	dinner
O	given
O	to
O	him
O	;
O	and
O	to
O	be
O	kept
O	to
O	do
O	what
O	dirty
O	work
O	he
O	could
O	for
O	the
O	cook
O	.
O	Dick
O	would
O	have
O	lived
O	happily
O	in
O	this
O	good
O	family
O	,
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	for
O	the
O	ill-natured
O	cook
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	finding
O	fault
O	and
O	scolding
O	him
O	from
O	morning
O	till
O	night
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	besides
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	fond
O	of
O	basting
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	roast
O	meat
O	to
O	baste
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	basting
O	poor
O	Dick
O	.
O	But
O	though
O	the
O	cook
O	was
O	so
O	ill-tempered
O	,
O	the
O	footman
O	was
O	quite
O	different
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	family
O	many
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	an
O	elderly
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	kind-hearted
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	once
O	a
O	little
O	son
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	who
O	died
O	when
O	about
O	the
O	age
O	of
O	Dick
O	;
O	so
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	feeling
O	pity
O	for
O	the
O	poor
O	boy
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	halfpenny
O	to
O	buy
O	gingerbread
O	or
O	a
O	top
O	.
O	The
O	footman
O	was
O	fond
O	of
O	reading
O	,
O	and
O	used
O	often
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	to
O	entertain
O	the
O	other
O	servants
O	with
O	some
O	amusing
O	book
O	.
O	Little
O	Dick
O	took
O	pleasure
O	in
O	hearing
O	this
O	good
O	man
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	wish
O	very
O	much
O	to
O	learn
O	to
O	read
O	too
O	;
O	so
O	the
O	next
O	time
O	the
O	footman
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	halfpenny
O	,
O	he
O	bought
O	a
O	little
O	book
O	with
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	footman
O	'
O	s
O	help
O	,
O	Dick
O	soon
O	learnt
O	his
O	letters
O	,
O	and
O	afterwards
O	to
O	read
O	.
O	About
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	Miss
O	Alice
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	,
O	was
O	going
O	out
O	one
O	morning
O	for
O	a
O	walk
O	,
O	and
O	Dick
O	was
O	told
O	to
O	put
O	on
O	a
O	suit
O	of
O	good
O	clothes
O	that
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	gave
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	walk
O	behind
O	her
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	went
O	,
O	Miss
O	Alice
O	saw
O	a
O	poor
O	woman
O	with
O	one
O	child
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	and
O	another
O	on
O	her
O	back
O	.
O	She
O	pulled
O	out
O	her
O	purse
O	and
O	gave
O	the
O	woman
O	some
O	money
O	;
O	but
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	putting
O	it
O	into
O	her
O	pocket
O	again
O	,
O	she
O	dropped
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	walked
O	on
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	lucky
O	that
O	Dick
O	was
O	behind
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	what
O	she
O	had
O	done
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	picked
O	up
O	the
O	purse
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	to
O	her
O	again
O	.
O	Another
O	time
O	,
O	when
O	Miss
O	Alice
O	was
O	sitting
O	with
O	the
O	window
O	open
O	and
O	amusing
O	herself
O	with
O	a
O	favorite
O	parrot
O	,
O	it
O	suddenly
O	flew
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	branch
O	of
O	a
O	high
O	tree
O	,
O	where
O	all
O	the
O	servants
O	were
O	afraid
O	to
O	venture
O	after
O	it
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	Dick
O	heard
O	of
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	pulled
O	off
O	his
O	coat
O	,
O	and
O	climbed
O	up
O	the
O	tree
O	as
O	nimbly
O	as
O	a
O	squirrel
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	trouble
O	,
O	caught
O	her
O	and
O	brought
O	her
O	down
O	safely
O	to
O	his
O	mistress
O	.
O	Miss
O	Alice
O	thanked
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	liked
O	him
O	ever
O	after
O	for
O	this
O	.
O	The
O	ill-humored
O	cook
O	was
O	now
O	a
O	little
O	kinder
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	besides
O	this
O	,
O	Dick
O	had
O	another
O	hardship
O	to
O	get
O	over
O	.
O	His
O	bed
O	stood
O	in
O	a
O	garret
O	,
O	where
O	there
O	were
O	so
O	many
O	holes
O	in
O	the
O	floor
O	and
O	the
O	walls
O	,
O	that
O	every
O	night
O	he
O	was
O	waked
O	in
O	his
O	sleep
O	by
O	the
O	rats
O	and
O	mice
O	,
O	which
O	ran
O	over
O	his
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	such
O	a
O	noise
O	that
O	he
O	sometimes
O	thought
O	the
O	walls
O	were
O	tumbling
O	down
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	a
O	gentleman
O	who
O	came
O	to
O	see
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	wanted
O	his
O	shoes
O	polished
O	;
O	Dick
O	took
O	great
O	pains
O	to
O	make
O	them
O	shine
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	gentleman
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	penny
O	.
O	With
O	this
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	buy
O	a
O	cat
O	;
O	so
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	seeing
O	a
O	little
O	girl
O	with
O	a
O	cat
O	under
O	her
O	arm
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	if
O	she
O	would
O	let
O	him
O	have
O	it
O	for
O	a
O	penny
O	.
O	The
O	girl
O	said
O	she
O	would
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	mouser
O	.
O	Dick
O	hid
O	the
O	cat
O	in
O	the
O	garret
O	,
O	and
O	always
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	carry
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	his
O	dinner
O	to
O	her
O	;
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	more
O	trouble
O	from
O	the
O	rats
O	and
O	mice
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	,
O	his
O	master
O	had
O	a
O	ship
O	ready
O	to
O	sail
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	right
O	all
O	his
O	servants
O	should
O	have
O	some
O	chance
O	for
O	good
O	fortune
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	himself
O	,
O	he
O	called
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	parlor
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	them
O	if
O	they
O	wanted
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	share
O	in
O	the
O	trading
O	trip
O	.
O	They
O	all
O	had
O	some
O	money
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	willing
O	to
O	venture
O	,
O	except
O	poor
O	Dick
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	neither
O	money
O	nor
O	goods
O	.
O	For
O	this
O	reason
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	come
O	into
O	the
O	parlor
O	with
O	the
O	rest
O	;
O	but
O	Miss
O	Alice
O	guessed
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter
O	,
O	and
O	ordered
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	called
O	in
O	.
O	She
O	then
O	said
O	she
O	would
O	put
O	in
O	money
O	for
O	him
O	from
O	her
O	own
O	purse
O	;
O	but
O	her
O	father
O	told
O	her
O	this
O	would
O	not
O	do
O	,
O	for
O	Dick
O	must
O	send
O	something
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	.
O	When
O	poor
O	Dick
O	heard
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	he
O	had
O	nothing
O	but
O	a
O	cat
O	.
O	``
O	Fetch
O	your
O	cat
O	then
O	,
O	my
O	good
O	boy
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	let
O	her
O	go
O	.
O	``
O	Dick
O	went
O	upstairs
O	and
O	brought
O	down
O	poor
O	puss
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	captain
O	with
O	tears
O	in
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	company
O	laughed
O	at
O	Dick
O	'
O	s
O	odd
O	venture
O	;
O	and
O	Miss
O	Alice
O	,
O	who
O	felt
O	pity
O	for
O	the
O	poor
O	boy
O	,
O	gave
O	him
O	some
O	halfpence
O	to
O	buy
O	another
O	cat
O	.
O	This
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	marks
O	of
O	kindness
O	shown
O	him
O	by
O	Miss
O	Alice
O	,
O	made
O	the
O	ill-tempered
O	cook
O	jealous
O	of
O	poor
O	Dick
O	;
O	and
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	use
O	him
O	more
O	cruelly
O	than
O	ever
O	,
O	and
O	always
O	made
O	fun
O	of
O	him
O	for
O	sending
O	his
O	cat
O	to
O	sea
O	.
O	She
O	asked
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	thought
O	his
O	cat
O	would
O	sell
O	for
O	as
O	much
O	money
O	as
O	would
O	buy
O	a
O	stick
O	to
O	beat
O	him
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	poor
O	Dick
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	this
O	any
O	longer
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	run
O	away
O	from
O	his
O	place
O	;
O	so
O	he
O	packed
O	up
O	his
O	few
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	very
O	early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	on
O	the
O	first
O	of
O	November
O	.
O	He
O	walked
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	Highgate
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	a
O	stone
O	,
O	which
O	to
O	this
O	day
O	is
O	called
O	Whittington
O	'
O	s
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	which
O	road
O	he
O	should
O	take
O	farther
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	was
O	thinking
O	what
O	he
O	should
O	do
O	,
O	the
O	bells
O	of
O	Bow
O	Church
O	began
O	to
O	ring
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	fancied
O	their
O	sounds
O	seemed
O	to
O	say
O	:
O	``
O	Turn
O	again

O	``

O	cuffing
O	and
O	scolding
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	cook
O	,

O	Dick
O	went
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	lucky
O	enough
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	set
O	about
O	his
O	work
O	before
O	the
O	cook
O	came
O	down
O	.
O	The
O	ship
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	cat
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	at
O	sea
O	;
O	and
O	was
O	at
O	last
O	driven
O	by
O	the
O	winds
O	on
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	Barbary
O	.
O	The
O	people
O	came
O	in
O	great
O	numbers
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	sailors
O	,
O	and
O	treated
O	them
O	very
O	civilly
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	became
O	better
O	acquainted
O	,
O	were
O	eager
O	to
O	buy
O	the
O	fine
O	things
O	with
O	which
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	laden
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	captain
O	saw
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	sent
O	patterns
O	of
O	the
O	best
O	things
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	of

O	was
O	so
O	much
O	pleased
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	sent
O	for
O	the
O	captain
O	and
O	the
O	chief
O	mate
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	Here
O	they
O	were
O	placed
O	,
O	as
O	is
O	the
O	custom
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	on
O	rich
O	carpets
O	,
O	marked
O	with
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	flowers
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	and

O	were
O	seated
O	at
O	the
O	upper
O	end
O	of
O	the

O	a
O	number
O	of

O	,
O	of
O	the

O	rarities
O	,
O	were
O	brought
O	in

O	a
O	minute
O	,
O	a

O	The

O	The

O	He
O	thought
O	of

O	kill
O	all
O	the

O	The

O	was
O	still
O	more
O	glad
O	than

O	captain
O	.
O	``
O	Bring
O	this

O	another
O	dinner

O	got
O	ready

O	in
O	a
O	few

O	laid
O	almost
O	all
O	the
O	rats

O	dead
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	.
O	The
O	rest
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	fright
O	,
O	scampered
O	away
O	to
O	their
O	holes

O	The
O	King

O	were
O	delighted
O	to
O	get
O	rid
O	of
O	such

O	They
O	desired

O	when

O	she
O	was
O	at

O	of

O	cat
O	,

O	showed
O	the
O	rich
O	present
O	that
O	the
O	King
O	had
O	sent
O	to
O	Dick
O	for
O	her
O	;
O	upon
O	which
O	the
O	merchantman
O	called
O	out
O	to
O	his
O	servants
O	:
O	``
O	Go
O	fetch
O	him
O	,
O	we

O	Whittington
O	by
O	name
O	.
O	``
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	now
O	showed
O	himself
O	a
O	really
O	good
O	man
O	,
O	for
O	while
O	some
O	of
O	his
O	clerks
O	said
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	treasure
O	was
O	too
O	much
O	for
O	such
O	a
O	boy
O	as
O	Dick
O	,
O	he
O	answered
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	keep
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	a
O	single

O	!
O	It

O	.
O	``
O	He
O	sent
O	for
O	Dick
O	,
O	who
O	happened
O	to
O	be
O	scouring
O	the
O	cook
O	'
O	s
O	kettles
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	quite
O	dirty
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	wanted
O	to
O	excuse
O	himself
O	from
O	going
O	to
O	his
O	master
O	.
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	made
O	him
O	come
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	ordered
O	a
O	chair
O	to
O	be
O	set
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	poor
O	Dick
O	thought
O	they
O	were
O	making
O	fun
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	beg
O	his
O	master
O	not
O	to
O	play
O	tricks
O	with
O	a
O	poor
O	boy
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	go
O	again
O	to
O	his
O	work
O	.
O	``
O	Indeed
O	,
O	Mr

O	Whittington
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	merchant
O	,
O	``
O	we
O	are
O	all
O	in
O	earnest
O	with
O	you

O	I
O	heartily
O	rejoice
O	in
O	the
O	news
O	these
O	gentlemen
O	have
O	brought
O	you
O	;
O	for
O	the

O	sold
O	your
O	cat
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Barbary
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	you
O	,
O	in
O	return
O	for

O	,
O	more

O	than
O	I

O	I
O	wish
O	you
O	may
O	long
O	enjoy
O	them
O	!
O	``
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	then
O	told
O	the
O	men
O	to
O	open
O	the
O	great
O	treasure
O	they
O	had
O	brought
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Mr
O	.
O	Whittington
O	has
O	now
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	to
O	put
O	it
O	in
O	some
O	place
O	of
O	safety
O	.
O	``
O	Poor
O	Dick
O	hardly
O	knew
O	how
O	to
O	behave
O	himself
O	for
O	joy
O	.
O	He
O	begged
O	his
O	master
O	to
O	take
O	what
O	part
O	of
O	it
O	he
O	pleased
O	,
O	since
O	he
O	owed
O	it
O	all
O	to
O	his
O	kindness
O	.
O	``
O	No
O	,
O	no
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	,
O	``
O	this
O	is
O	all
O	your
O	own
O	;
O	and
O	I
O	have
O	no
O	doubt
O	you
O	will
O	use
O	it
O	well
O	.
O	``
O	Dick
O	next
O	asked
O	his
O	mistress
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	Miss
O	Alice
O	,
O	to
O	accept
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	his
O	good
O	fortune
O	;
O	but
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	his
O	success
O	afforded
O	them
O	great
O	pleasure
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	poor
O	fellow
O	was
O	too
O	kind-hearted
O	to
O	keep
O	it
O	all
O	to
O	himself
O	;
O	so
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	handsome
O	present
O	to
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	the
O	mate
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	sailors
O	,
O	and
O	afterwards
O	to
O	his
O	good
O	friend
O	the
O	footman
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	'
O	s
O	servants
O	;
O	and
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	ill-natured
O	cook
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	advised
O	him
O	to
O	get
O	himself
O	dressed
O	like
O	a
O	gentleman
O	;
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	he
O	was
O	welcome
O	to
O	live
O	in
O	his
O	house
O	till
O	he
O	could
O	provide
O	himself
O	with
O	a
O	better
O	.
O	When
O	Whittington
O	'
O	s
O	face
O	was
O	washed
O	,
O	his
O	hair
O	curled
O	,
O	his
O	hat
O	cocked
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	dressed
O	in
O	a
O	nice
O	suit
O	of
O	clothes
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	handsome
O	as
O	any
O	young
O	man
O	who
O	visited
O	at
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	'
O	s
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	Miss
O	Alice
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	kind
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	of
O	him
O	with
O	pity
O	,
O	now
O	looked
O	upon
O	him
O	as
O	fit
O	to
O	be
O	her
O	sweetheart
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	more
O	so
O	,
O	no
O	doubt
O	,
O	because
O	Whittington
O	was
O	now
O	always
O	thinking
O	what
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	to
O	oblige
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	her
O	the
O	prettiest
O	presents
O	that
O	could
O	be
O	.
O	Mr
O	.
O	Fitzwarren
O	soon
O	saw
O	their
O	love
O	for
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	proposed
O	to
O	join
O	them
O	in
O	marriage
O	;
O	and
O	to
O	this
O	they
O	both
O	readily
O	agreed
O	.
O	A
O	day
O	for
O	the
O	wedding
O	was
O	soon
O	fixed
O	;
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	attended
O	to

O	Lord
O	Mayor
O	,
O	the
O	Court
O	of

O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	the
O	richest
O	merchants
O	in
O	London
O	,
O	whom
O	they
O	afterwards
O	treated
O	with
O	a
O	fine
O	feast
O	.
O	History
O	tells
O	us
O	that
O	Mr

O	Whittington
O	and
O	his
O	lady
O	lived
O	in
