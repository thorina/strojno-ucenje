O	Having
O	lived
O	almost
O	four
O	years
O	in
O	the
O	Brazils
O	,
O	and
O	beginning
O	to
O	thrive
O	and
O	prosper
O	very
O	well
O	upon
O	my
O	plantation
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	only
O	learned
O	the
O	language
O	,
O	but
O	had
O	contracted
O	acquaintance
O	and
O	friendship
O	among
O	my
O	fellow-planters
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	among
O	the
O	merchants
O	at
O	St
O	.
O	Salvador
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	our
O	port;
O	and
O	in
O	my
O	discourses
O	among
O	them
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	frequently
O	given
O	them
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	my
O	two
O	voyages
O	to
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	Guinea
O	,
O	the
O	manner
O	of
O	trading
O	with
O	the
O	negroes
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	easy
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	purchase
O	upon
O	the
O	coast
O	for
O	trifles
O	,
O	such

O	,
O	but
O	negroes
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	the
O	Brazils
O	,
O	in
O	great
O	numbers
O	.
O	They
O	listened
O	very
O	attentively
O	to
O	my
O	discourses
O	on
O	these
O	heads
O	,
O	but
O	especially
O	to
O	that
O	part
O	which
O	related
O	to
O	the
O	buying
O	of
O	negroes
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	trade
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	not
O	far
O	entered
O	into
O	.
O	Being
O	in
O	company
O	with
O	some
O	merchants
O	and
O	planters
O	of
O	my
O	acquaintance
O	,
O	and
O	talking
O	of
O	things
O	very
O	earnestly
O	,
O	three
O	of
O	them
O	came
O	to
O	me
O	next
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	me
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	musing
O	very
O	much
O	upon
O	what
O	I
O	had
O	discoursed
O	with
O	them
O	of
O	the
O	last
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	secret
O	proposal
O	to
O	me;
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	enjoining
O	me
O	secrecy
O	,
O	they
O	told
O	me
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	a
O	mind
O	to
O	fit
O	out
O	a
O	ship
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	Guinea;
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	all
O	plantations
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	I
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	which
O	they
O	needed
O	nothing
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	servants;
O	that
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	trade
O	that
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	carried
O	on
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	publicly
O	sell
O	the
O	negroes
O	when
O	they
O	came
O	home
O	,
O	so
O	they
O	desired
O	to
O	make
O	but
O	one
O	voyage
O	,
O	to
O	bring
O	the
O	negroes
O	on
O	shore
O	privately
O	,
O	and
O	divide
O	them
O	among
O	their
O	own
O	plantations;
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	the
O	question
O	was
O	,
O	whether
O	I
O	would
O	go
O	to
O	manage
O	the
O	trading
O	part
O	upon
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	Guinea;
O	and
O	they
O	offered
O	me
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	my
O	equal
O	share
O	of
O	the
O	negroes
O	,
O	without
O	providing
O	any
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	stock
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	fair
O	proposal
O	,
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	confessed
O	,
O	had
O	it
O	been
O	made
O	to
O	any
O	one
O	that
O	had
O	not
O	had
O	a
O	settlement
O	and
O	a
O	plantation
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	to
O	look
O	after
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	fair
O	way
O	of
O	coming
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	considerable
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	good
O	stock
O	upon
O	it;
O	but
O	for
O	me
O	,
O	that
O	was
O	thus
O	entered
O	and
O	established
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	begun
O	for
O	three
O	or
O	four
O	years
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	have
O	sent
O	for
O	the
O	other
O	hundred
O	pounds
O	from
O	England
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	in
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	that
O	little
O	addition
O	,
O	could
O	scarce
O	have
O	failed
O	of
O	being
O	worth
O	three
O	or
O	four
O	thousand
O	pounds
O	sterling
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	increasing
O	,
O	too;
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	voyage
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	preposterous
O	thing
O	that
O	ever
O	man
O	in
O	such
O	circumstances
O	could
O	be
O	guilty
O	of
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	,
O	that
O	was
O	born
O	to
O	be
O	my
O	own
O	destroyer
O	,
O	could
O	no
O	more
O	resist
O	the
O	offer
O	than
O	I
O	could
O	restrain
O	my
O	first
O	rambling
O	designs
O	when
O	my
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	good
O	counsel
O	was
O	lost
O	upon
O	me
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	I
O	told
O	them
O	I
O	would
O	go
O	with
O	all
O	my
O	heart
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	undertake
O	to
O	look
O	after
O	my
O	plantation
O	in
O	my
O	absence
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	dispose
O	of
O	it
O	to
O	such
O	as
O	I
O	should
O	direct
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	miscarried
O	.
O	This
O	they
O	all
O	engaged
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	and
O	entered
O	into
O	writings
O	or
O	covenants
O	to
O	do
O	so;
O	and
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	formal
O	will
O	disposing
O	of
O	my
O	plantation
O	and
O	effects
O	in
O	case
O	of
O	my
O	death
O	,
O	making
O	the
O	captain
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	that
O	had
O	saved
O	my
O	life
O	,
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	my
O	universal
O	heir
O	,
O	but
O	obliging
O	him
O	to
O	dispose
O	of
O	my
O	effects
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	directed
O	in
O	my
O	will
O	,
O	one-half
O	of
O	the
O	produce
O	being
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	to
O	be
O	shipped
O	to
O	England
O	.
O	In
O	short
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	all
O	possible
O	caution
O	to
O	preserve
O	my
O	effects
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	keep
O	up
O	my
O	plantation;
O	had
O	I
O	used
O	half
O	as
O	much
O	prudence
O	to
O	have
O	looked
O	into
O	my
O	own
O	interest
O	,
O	and
O	have
O	made
O	a
O	judgment
O	of
O	what
O	I
O	ought
O	to
O	have
O	done
O	and
O	ought
O	not
O	to
O	have
O	done
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	certainly
O	never
O	gone
O	away
O	from
O	so
O	prosperous
O	an
O	undertaking
O	,
O	and
O	gone
O	upon
O	a
O	voyage
O	to
O	sea
O	,
O	attended
O	with
O	all
O	its
O	hazards
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	was
O	hurried
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	obeyed
O	blindly
O	the
O	dictates
O	of
O	my
O	fancy
O	rather
O	than
O	my
O	reason;
O	and
O	,
O	accordingly
O	,
O	the
O	ship
O	being
O	fitted
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	cargo
O	furnished
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	things
O	done
O	as
O	by
O	agreement
O	,
O	by
O	my
O	partners
O	in
O	the
O	voyage
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	in
O	an
O	evil
O	hour
O	,
O	the
O	lst
O	of
O	September
O	,
O	1659
O	,
O	being
O	the
O	same
O	day
O	eight
O	years
O	that
O	I
O	went
O	from
O	my
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	at
O	Hull
O	.
O	Our
O	ship
O	was
O	about
O	120
O	tons
O	burden
O	,
O	carried
O	six
O	guns
O	,
O	and
O	fourteen
O	men
O	,
O	besides
O	the
O	master
O	,
O	his
O	boy
O	,
O	and
O	myself;
O	we
O	had
O	on
O	board
O	no
O	large
O	cargo
O	of
O	goods
O	,
O	except
O	of
O	such
O	toys
O	as
O	were
O	fit
O	for
O	our
O	trade
O	with
O	the
O	negroes
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	beads
O	,
O	bits
O	of
O	glass
O	,
O	shells
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	trifles
O	,
O	especially
O	little
O	looking-glasses
O	,
O	knives
O	,
O	scissors
O	,
O	hatchets
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	like
O	.
O	The
O	same
O	day
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	we
O	set
O	sail
O	,
O	standing
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	northward
O	upon
O	our
O	own
O	coast
O	,
O	with
O	design
O	to
O	stretch
O	over
O	for
O	the
O	African
O	coast
O	when
O	we
O	came
O	about
O	ten
O	or
O	twelve
O	degrees
O	of
O	northern
O	latitude
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	it
O	seems
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	manner
O	of
O	their
O	course
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	.
O	We
O	had
O	very
O	good
O	weather
O	,
O	only
O	excessively
O	hot
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	way
O	upon
O	our
O	own
O	coast
O	,
O	till
O	we
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	height
O	of
O	Cape
O	St
O	.
O	Augustino;
O	from
O	whence
O	,
O	keeping
O	further
O	off
O	at
O	sea
O	,
O	we
O	lost
O	sight
O	of
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	steered
O	as
O	if
O	we
O	were
O	bound
O	for
O	the
O	isle
O	Fernando
O	de
O	Noronha
O	,
O	holding
O	our
O	course
O	N
O	.
O	E
O	.
O	by
O	N
O	.
O	,
O	and
O	leaving
O	those
O	isles
O	on
O	the
O	east
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	course
O	we
O	passed
O	the
O	line
O	in
O	about
O	twelve
O	days
O	'
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	,
O	by
O	our
O	last
O	observation
O	,
O	in
O	7
O	degrees
O	22
O	'
O	northern
O	latitude
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	violent
O	tornado
O	,
O	or
O	hurricane
O	,
O	took
O	us
O	quite
O	out
O	of
O	our
O	knowledge
O	.
O	It
O	blew
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	terrible
O	manner
O	,
O	that
O	for
O	twelve
O	days
O	together
O	we
O	could
O	do
O	nothing
O	but
O	drive;
O	and
O	,
O	scudding
O	away
O	before
O	it
O	,
O	let
O	it
O	carry
O	us
O	wherever
O	fate
O	and
O	the
O	fury
O	of
O	the
O	winds
O	directed;
O	and
O	during
O	these
O	twelve
O	days
O	,
O	I
O	need
O	not
O	say
O	that
O	I
O	expected
O	every
O	day
O	to
O	be
O	swallowed
O	up;
O	nor
O	did
O	any
O	in
O	the
O	ship
O	expect
O	to
O	save
O	their
O	lives
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	distress
O	we
O	had
O	,
O	besides
O	the
O	terror
O	of
O	the
O	storm
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	our
O	men
O	die
O	of
O	the
O	calenture
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	man
O	and
O	a
O	boy
O	washed
O	overboard
O	.
O	About
O	the
O	twelfth
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	weather
O	abating
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	the
O	master
O	made
O	an
O	observation
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	about
O	eleven
O	degrees
O	of
O	north
O	latitude
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	twenty-two
O	degrees
O	of
O	longitude
O	difference
O	west
O	from
O	Cape
O	St
O	.
O	Augustino;
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	found
O	he
O	was
O	gotten
O	upon
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	Guiana
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	north
O	part
O	of
O	Brazil
O	,
O	beyond
O	the
O	river
O	Amazon
O	,
O	toward
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	Orinoco
O	,
O	commonly
O	called
O	the
O	Great
O	River;
O	and
O	now
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	consult
O	with
O	me
O	what
O	course
O	he
O	should
O	take;
O	for
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	leaky
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	much
O	disabled
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	for
O	going
O	directly
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	Brazil
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	positively
O	against
O	that;
O	and
O	looking
O	over
O	the
O	charts
O	of
O	the
O	sea-coast
O	of
O	America
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	we
O	concluded
O	there
O	was

O	so
O	there

O	We

O	but
O	how
O	to
O	get

O	was
O	a
O	doubtful

O	,
O	there
O	was
O	no

O	to

O	,
O	for
O	we
O	fancied
O	the

O	s
O	side;
O	and
O	getting
O	all
O	into
O	her
O	,
O	we
O	let
O	go
O	,
O	and
O	committed
O	ourselves

O	being
O	eleven
O	in

O	,
O	to
O	God
O	'
O	s

O	and
O	the
O	wild
O	sea
O	:
O	for
O	though
O	the
O	storm
O	was
O	abated
O	considerably
O	,
O	yet
O	the
O	sea
O	went
O	dreadfully
O	high
O	upon
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	might
O	be
O	well
O	called
O	_den
O	wild
O	zee_
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	Dutch
O	call
O	the
O	sea
O	in
O	a
O	storm
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	our
O	case
O	was
O	very
O	dismal
O	indeed;
O	for
O	we
O	all
O	saw
O	plainly
O	that
O	the
O	sea
O	went
O	so
O	high
O	that
O	the
O	boat
O	could
O	not
O	escape
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	we
O	should
O	be
O	inevitably
O	drowned
O	.
O	As
O	to
O	making
O	sail
O	,
O	we
O	had
O	none
O	,
O	nor
O	,
O	if
O	we
O	had
O	,
O	could
O	we
O	have
O	done
O	anything
O	with
O	it;
O	so
O	we
O	worked
O	at
O	the
O	oar
O	toward
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	though
O	with
O	heavy
O	hearts
O	,
O	like
O	men
O	going
O	to
O	execution;
O	for
O	we
O	all
O	knew
O	that
O	when
O	the
O	boat
O	came
O	near
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	dashed
O	in
O	a
O	thousand
O	pieces
O	by
O	the
O	breach
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	we
O	committed
O	our
O	souls
O	to
O	God
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	earnest
O	manner;
O	and
O	the
O	wind
O	driving
O	us
O	toward
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	we
O	hastened
O	our
O	destruction
O	with
O	our
O	own
O	hands
O	,
O	pulling
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	we
O	could

O	What
O	the

O	was
O	,
O	whether
O	rock
O	or
O	sand
O	,
O	whether
O	steep
O	or
O	shoal
O	,
O	we
O	knew
O	not;
O	the
O	only
O	hope
O	that
O	could
O	rationally
O	give
O	us
O	the
O	least
O	shadow
O	of
O	expectation
O	was
O	,
O	if
O	we
O	might
O	happen
O	into
O	some
O	bay
O	or
O	gulf
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	some
O	river
O	,
O	where
O	by
O	great
O	chance
O	we
O	might
O	have
O	run
O	our
O	boat
O	in
O	,
O	or
O	got
O	under
O	the
O	lee
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	made
O	smooth

O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	nothing

O	,
O	the
O	land
O	looked
O	more

O	After

O	me
O	at
O	once
O	twenty
O	or
O	thirty
O	feet
O	deep
O	in
O	its
O	own
O	body
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	could
O	feel
O	myself
O	carried
O	with
O	a
O	mighty
O	force
O	and
O	swiftness
O	toward
O	the
O	shore
O	a
O	very
O	great
O	way;
O	but
O	I
O	held
O	my
O	breath
O	and
O	assisted
O	myself
O	to
O	swim
O	still
O	forward
O	with
O	all
O	my
O	might
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	burst
O	with
O	holding
O	my
O	breath
O	when
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	felt
O	myself
O	rising
O	up
O	,
O	so
O	,
O	to
O	my
O	immediate
O	relief
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	my
O	head
O	and
O	hands
O	shoot
O	out
O	above
O	the
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	water;
O	and
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	two
O	seconds
O	of
O	time
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	keep
O	myself
O	so
O	,
O	yet
O	it
O	relieved
O	me
O	greatly
O	,
O	gave
O	me
O	breath
O	and
O	new
O	courage
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	covered
O	again
O	with
O	water
O	a
O	good
O	while
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	so
O	long
O	but
O	I
O	held
O	it
O	out;
O	and
O	finding
O	the
O	water
O	had
O	spent
O	itself
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	return
O	,
O	I
O	struck
O	forward
O	against
O	the
O	return
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	and
O	felt
O	ground
O	again
O	with
O	my
O	feet
O	.
O	I
O	stood
O	still
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	to
O	recover
O	breath
O	,
O	and
O	till
O	the
O	waters
O	went
O	from
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	took
O	to
O	my
O	heels
O	and
O	ran
O	with
O	what
O	strength
O	I
O	had
O	farther
O	toward
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	But
O	neither
O	would
O	this
O	deliver
O	me
O	from
O	the
O	fury
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	which
O	came
O	pouring
O	in
O	after
O	me
O	again;
O	and
O	twice
O	more
O	I
O	was
O	lifted
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	waves
O	and
O	carried
O	forward
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	the
O	shore
O	being
O	very
O	flat
O	.
O	The
O	last
O	time
O	of
O	these
O	two
O	had
O	wellnigh
O	been
O	fatal
O	to
O	me;
O	for
O	the
O	sea
O	having
O	hurried
O	me
O	along
O	,
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	landed
O	me
O	,
O	or
O	rather
O	dashed
O	me
O	,
O	against
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	with
O	such
O	force
O	as
O	it
O	left
O	me
O	senseless
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	helpless
O	as
O	to
O	my
O	own
O	deliverance;
O	for
O	the
O	blow
O	,
O	taking
O	my
O	side
O	and
O	breast
O	,
O	beat
O	the
O	breath
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	quite
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	body;
O	and
O	had
O	it
O	returned
O	again
O	immediately
O	,
O	I
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	strangled
O	in
O	the
O	water;
O	but
O	I
O	recovered
O	a
O	little
O	before
O	the
O	return
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	and
O	seeing
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	covered
O	again
O	with
O	water
O	,
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	hold
O	fast
O	by
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	to
O	hold
O	my
O	breath
O	,
O	if
O	possible
O	,
O	till
O	the
O	wave
O	went
O	back
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	waves
O	were
O	not
O	so
O	high
O	as
O	at
O	first
O	,
O	being
O	nearer
O	land
O	,
O	I
O	held
O	my
O	hold
O	till
O	the
O	wave
O	abated
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	fetched
O	another
O	run
O	,
O	which
O	brought
O	me
O	so
O	near
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	next
O	wave
O	,
O	though
O	it
O	went
O	over
O	me
O	,
O	yet
O	did
O	not
O	so
O	swallow
O	me
O	up
O	as
O	to
O	carry
O	me
O	away;
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	run
O	I
O	took
O	I
O	got
O	to
O	the
O	mainland;
O	where
O	,
O	to
O	my
O	great
O	comfort
O	,
O	I
O	clambered
O	up
O	the
O	clifts
O	and
O	sat
O	upon
O	the
O	grass
O	,
O	free
O	from
O	danger
O	and
O	quite
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	reach
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	now
O	landed
O	and
O	safe
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	look
O	up
O	and
O	thank
O	God
O	that
O	my
O	life
O	was
O	saved
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	case
O	wherein
O	there
O	was
O	some
O	minutes
O	before
O	scarce
O	any
O	room
O	to
O	hope
O	.
O	I
O	believe
O	it
O	is
O	impossible
O	to
O	express
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	life
O	,
O	what
O	the
O	ecstasies
O	and
O	transports
O	of
O	the
O	soul
O	are
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	is
O	so
O	saved
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	may
O	say
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	very
O	grave
O	:
O	and
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	wonder
O	now
O	at
O	that
O	custom
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	malefactor
O	,
O	who
O	has
O	the
O	halter
O	about
O	his
O	neck
O	,
O	is
O	tied
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	just
O	going
O	to
O	be
O	turned
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	has
O	a
O	reprieve
O	brought
O	to
O	him--I
O	say
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	wonder
O	that
O	they
O	bring
O	a
O	surgeon
O	with
O	it
O	,
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	bleed
O	that
O	very
O	moment
O	they
O	tell
O	him
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	surprise
O	may
O	not
O	drive
O	the
O	animal
O	spirits
O	from
O	the
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	overwhelm
O	him
O	,
O	For
O	sudden
O	joys
O	,
O	like
O	griefs
O	,
O	confound
O	at
O	first
O	.
O	I
O	walked
O	about
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	lifting
O	up
O	my
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	whole
O	being
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	may
O	say
O	,
O	wrapped
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	contemplation
O	of
O	my
O	deliverance;
O	making
O	a
O	thousand
O	gestures
O	and
O	motions
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	cannot
O	describe;
O	reflecting
O	upon
O	all
O	my
O	comrades
O	that
O	were
O	drowned
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	there
O	should
O	not
O	be
O	one
O	soul
O	saved
O	but
O	myself;
O	for
O	,
O	as
O	for
O	them
O	,
O	I
O	never
O	saw
O	them
O	afterward
O	,
O	or
O	any
O	sign
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	except
O	three
O	of
O	their
O	hats
O	,
O	one
O	cap
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	shoes
O	that
O	were
O	not
O	fellows
O	.
O	I
O	cast
O	my
O	eyes
O	to
O	the
O	stranded
O	vessel
O	when
O	,
O	the
O	breach
O	and
O	froth
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	being
O	so
O	big
O	,
O	I
O	could
O	hardly
O	see
O	it
O	,
O	it
O	lay
O	so
O	far
O	off;
O	and
O	considered
O	,
O	Lord
O	!
O	how
O	was
O	it
O	possible
O	I
O	could
O	get
O	on
O	shore
O	?
O	After
O	I
O	had
O	solaced
O	my
O	mind
O	with
O	the
O	comfortable
O	part
O	of
O	my
O	condition
O	,
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	look
O	round
O	me
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	kind
O	of
O	place
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	what
O	was
O	next
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	:
O	and
O	I
O	soon
O	found
O	my
O	comforts
O	abate
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	dreadful
O	deliverance
O	:
O	for
O	I
O	was
O	wet
O	,
O	had
O	no
O	clothes
O	to
O	shift
O	me
O	,
O	nor
O	anything
O	either
O	to
O	eat
O	or
O	drink
O	,
O	to
O	comfort
O	me;
O	neither
O	did
O	I
O	see
O	any
O	prospect
O	before
O	me
O	but
O	that
O	of
O	perishing
O	with
O	hunger
O	,
O	or
O	being
O	devoured
O	by
O	wild
O	beasts
O	:
O	and
O	that
O	which
O	was
O	particularly
O	afflicting
O	to
O	me
O	was
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	weapon
O	,
O	either
O	to
O	hunt
O	and
O	kill
O	any
O	creature
O	for
O	my
O	sustenance
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	defend
O	myself
O	against
O	any
O	other
O	creature
O	that
O	might
O	desire
O	to
O	kill
O	me
O	for
O	theirs
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	nothing
O	about
O	me
O	but
O	a
O	knife
O	,
O	a
O	tobacco-pipe
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	little
O	tobacco
O	in
O	a
O	box
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	all
O	my
O	provision;
O	and
O	this
O	threw
O	me
O	into
O	terrible
O	agonies
O	of
O	mind
O	,
O	that
O	for
O	a
O	while
O	I
O	ran
O	about
O	like
O	a
O	madman
O	.
O	Night
O	coming
O	upon
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	began
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	heavy
O	heart
O	,
O	to
O	consider
O	what
O	would
O	be
O	my
O	lot
O	if
O	there
O	were
O	any
O	ravenous
O	beasts
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	,
O	seeing
O	at
O	night
O	they
O	always
O	come
O	abroad
O	for
O	their
O	prey
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	remedy
O	that
O	offered
O	to
O	my
O	thoughts
O	,
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	was
O	to
O	get
O	up
O	into
O	a
O	thick
O	,
O	bushy
O	tree
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	fir
O	,
O	but
O	thorny
O	,
O	which
O	grew
O	near
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	sit
O	all
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	consider
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	what
O	death
O	I
O	should
O	die
O	,
O	for
O	as
O	yet
O	I
O	saw
O	no
O	prospect
O	of
O	life
O	.
O	I
O	walked
O	about
O	a
O	furlong
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	I
O	could
O	find
O	any
O	fresh
O	water
O	to
O	drink
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	did
O	,
O	to
O	my
O	great
O	joy;
O	and
O	having
O	drunk
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	a
O	little
O	tobacco
O	in
O	my
O	mouth
O	to
O	prevent
O	hunger
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	getting
O	up
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	endeavored
O	to
O	place
O	myself
O	so
O	that
O	if
O	I
O	should
O	sleep
O	I
O	might
O	not
O	fall
O	.
O	And
O	having
O	cut
O	me
O	a
O	short
O	stick
O	like
O	a
O	truncheon
O	,
O	for
O	my
O	defence
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	up
O	my
O	lodging;
O	and
O	being
O	excessively
O	fatigued
O	,
O	I
O	fell
O	fast
O	asleep
O	,
O	and
O	slept
O	as
O	comfortably
O	as
O	,
O	I
O	believe
O	,
O	few
O	could
O	have
O	done
O	in
O	my
O	condition
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	myself
O	more
O	refreshed
O	with
O	it
O	than
O	I
O	think
O	I
O	ever
O	was
O	on
O	such
O	an
O	occasion
O	.
