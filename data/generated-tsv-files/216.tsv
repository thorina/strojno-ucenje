O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	certain
O	village
O	in
O	a
O	province
O	of
O	Spain
O	called
O	the
O	Mancha
O	,
O	a
O	gentleman
O	named
O	Quixada
O	or
O	Queseda
O	,
O	whose
O	house
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	old
O	lances
O	,
O	halberds
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	weapons
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	,
O	besides
O	,
O	the
O	owner
O	of
O	an
O	ancient
O	target
O	or
O	shield
O	,
O	a
O	raw-boned
O	steed
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	swift
O	greyhound
O	.
O	His
O	food
O	consisted
O	daily
O	of
O	common
O	meats
O	,
O	some
O	lentils
O	on
O	Fridays
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	a
O	roast
O	pigeon
O	for
O	Sunday
O	'
O	s
O	dinner
O	.
O	His
O	dress
O	was
O	a
O	black
O	suit
O	with
O	velvet
O	breeches
O	,
O	and
O	slippers
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	colour
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	kept
O	for
O	holidays
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	suit
O	of
O	homespun
O	which
O	he
O	wore
O	on
O	week-days
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	purchase
O	of
O	these
O	few
O	things
O	he
O	spent
O	the
O	small
O	rents
O	that
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	every
O	year
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	in
O	his
O	house
O	a
O	woman-servant
O	about
O	forty
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	a
O	niece
O	not
O	yet
O	twenty
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	lad
O	that
O	served
O	him
O	both
O	in
O	field
O	and
O	at
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	saddle
O	his
O	horse
O	or
O	manage
O	a
O	pruning-hook
O	.
O	The
O	master
O	himself
O	was
O	about
O	fifty
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	a
O	strong
O	,
O	hard-featured
O	man
O	with
O	a
O	withered
O	face
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	an
O	early
O	riser
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	once
O	been
O	very
O	fond
O	of
O	hunting
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	for
O	a
O	great
O	portion
O	of
O	the
O	year
O	he
O	applied
O	himself
O	wholly
O	to
O	reading
O	the
O	old
O	books
O	of
O	knighthood
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	with
O	such
O	keen
O	delight
O	that
O	he
O	forgot
O	all
O	about
O	the
O	pleasures
O	of
O	the
O	chase
O	,
O	and
O	neglected
O	all
O	household
O	matters
O	.
O	His
O	mania
O	and
O	folly
O	grew
O	to
O	such
O	a
O	pitch
O	that
O	he
O	sold
O	many
O	acres
O	of
O	his
O	lands
O	to
O	buy
O	books
O	of
O	the
O	exploits
O	and
O	adventures
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	of
O	old
O	.
O	These
O	he
O	took
O	for
O	true
O	and
O	correct
O	histories
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	his
O	friends
O	the
O	curate
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	or
O	Mr
O	.
O	Nicholas
O	the
O	worthy
O	barber
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	came
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	dispute
O	with
O	them
O	as
O	to
O	which
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	of
O	romance
O	had
O	done
O	the
O	greatest
O	deeds
O	.
O	So
O	eagerly
O	did
O	he
O	plunge
O	into
O	the
O	reading
O	of
O	these
O	books
O	that
O	he
O	many
O	times
O	spent
O	whole
O	days
O	and
O	nights
O	poring
O	over
O	them
O	;
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	end
O	,
O	through
O	little
O	sleep
O	and
O	much
O	reading
O	,
O	his
O	brain
O	became
O	tired
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	fairly
O	lost
O	his
O	wits
O	.
O	His
O	fancy
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	those
O	things
O	that
O	he
O	read
O	,
O	of
O	enchantments
O	,
O	quarrels
O	,
O	battles
O	,
O	challenges
O	,
O	wounds
O	,
O	wooings
O	,
O	loves
O	,
O	tempests
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	impossible
O	follies
O	,
O	and
O	those
O	romantic
O	tales
O	so
O	firmly
O	took
O	hold
O	of
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	believed
O	no
O	history
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	truthful
O	and
O	sincere
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	.
O	Finally
O	he
O	was
O	seized
O	with
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	strangest
O	whims
O	that
O	ever
O	madman
O	stumbled
O	on
O	in
O	this
O	world
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	him
O	right
O	and
O	necessary
O	that
O	he
O	himself
O	should
O	become
O	a
O	knight-errant
O	,
O	and
O	ride
O	through
O	the
O	world
O	to
O	seek
O	adventures
O	and
O	practise
O	in
O	person
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	read
O	about
O	the
O	knights
O	of
O	old
O	.
O	Therefore
O	he
O	resolved
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	make
O	a
O	name
O	for
O	himself
O	by
O	revenging
O	the
O	injuries
O	of
O	others
O	,
O	and
O	courting
O	all
O	manner
O	of
O	dangers
O	and
O	difficulties
O	,
O	until
O	in
O	the
O	end
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	rewarded
O	for
O	his
O	valour
O	in
O	arms
O	by
O	the
O	crown
O	of
O	some
O	mighty
O	empire
O	.
O	And
O	first
O	of
O	all
O	he
O	caused
O	certain
O	old
O	rusty
O	arms
O	that
O	belonged
O	to
O	his
O	great-grandfather
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	lain
O	for
O	many
O	years
O	neglected
O	and
O	forgotten
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	of
O	his
O	house
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	brought
O	out
O	and
O	well
O	scoured
O	.
O	He
O	fixed
O	them
O	up
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	saw
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	something
O	wanting
O	,
O	for
O	instead
O	of
O	a
O	proper
O	helmet
O	they
O	had
O	only
O	a
O	morion
O	or
O	headpiece
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	steel
O	bonnet
O	without
O	any
O	visor
O	.
O	This
O	his
O	industry
O	supplied
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	visor
O	for
O	his
O	helmet
O	by
O	patching
O	and
O	pasting
O	certain
O	papers
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	pasteboard
O	fitted
O	to
O	the
O	morion
O	gave
O	it
O	all
O	the
O	appearance
O	of
O	a
O	real
O	helmet
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	sure
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	strong
O	enough
O	,
O	he
O	out
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	a
O	blow
O	or
O	two
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	very
O	first
O	blow
O	he
O	spoiled
O	that
O	which
O	had
O	cost
O	him
O	a
O	week
O	to
O	make
O	.
O	To
O	make
O	things
O	better
O	he
O	placed
O	certain
O	iron
O	bars
O	within
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	feeling
O	sure
O	it
O	was
O	now
O	sound
O	and
O	strong
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	put
O	it
O	to
O	a
O	second
O	trial
O	.
O	He
O	next
O	examined
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	who
O	though
O	he
O	had
O	nothing
O	on
O	him
O	but
O	skin
O	and
O	bone
O	,
O	yet
O	he
O	seemed
O	to
O	him
O	a
O	better
O	steed
O	than
O	Bucephalus
O	,
O	the
O	noble
O	animal
O	that
O	carried
O	Alexander
O	the
O	Great
O	when
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	battle
O	.
O	He
O	spent
O	four
O	days
O	inventing
O	a
O	name
O	for
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	saying
O	to
O	himself
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	fit
O	that
O	so
O	famous
O	a
O	knight
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	good
O	a
O	beast
O	,
O	should
O	want
O	a
O	known
O	name
O	.
O	Therefore
O	he
O	tried
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	name
O	that
O	should
O	both
O	give
O	people
O	some
O	notion
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	before
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	steed
O	of
O	a
O	knight-errant
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	what
O	he
O	now
O	was
O	;
O	for
O	,
O	seeing
O	that
O	his
O	lord
O	and
O	master
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	change
O	his
O	calling
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	right
O	that
O	his
O	horse
O	should
O	have
O	a
O	new
O	name
O	,
O	famous
O	and
O	high-sounding
O	,
O	and
O	worthy
O	of
O	his
O	new
O	position
O	in
O	life
O	.
O	And
O	after
O	having
O	chosen
O	,
O	made
O	up
O	,
O	put
O	aside
O	,
O	and
O	thrown
O	over
O	any
O	number
O	of
O	names
O	as
O	not
O	coming
O	up
O	to
O	his
O	idea
O	,
O	he
O	finally
O	hit
O	upon
O	Rozinante
O	,
O	a
O	name
O	in
O	his
O	opinion
O	sublime
O	and
O	well-sounding
O	,
O	expressing
O	in
O	a
O	word
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	simple
O	carriage
O	horse
O	,
O	arid
O	what
O	was
O	expected
O	of
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	new
O	dignity
O	.
O	The
O	name
O	being
O	thus
O	given
O	to
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	up
O	his
O	mind
O	to
O	give
O	himself
O	a
O	name
O	also
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	that
O	thought
O	laboured
O	another
O	eight
O	days
O	.
O	Finally
O	he
O	determined
O	to
O	call
O	himself
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	,
O	and
O	remembering
O	that
O	the
O	great
O	knights
O	of
O	olden
O	time
O	were
O	not
O	satisfied
O	with
O	a
O	mere
O	dry
O	name
O	,
O	but
O	added
O	to
O	it
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	their
O	kingdom
O	or
O	country
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	like
O	a
O	good
O	knight
O	added
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	that
O	of
O	his
O	province
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	himself
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	of
O	the
O	Mancha
O	,
O	whereby
O	he
O	declared
O	his
O	birthplace
O	and
O	did
O	honour
O	to
O	his
O	country
O	by
O	taking
O	it
O	for
O	his
O	surname
O	.
O	His
O	armour
O	being
O	scoured
O	,
O	his
O	morion
O	transformed
O	into
O	a
O	helmet
O	,
O	his
O	horse
O	named
O	,
O	and
O	himself
O	furnished
O	with
O	a
O	new
O	name
O	,
O	he
O	considered
O	that
O	now
O	he
O	wanted
O	nothing
O	but
O	a
O	lady
O	on
O	whom
O	he
O	might
O	bestow
O	his
O	service
O	and
O	affection
O	.
O	``
O	For
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	remembering
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	read
O	in
O	the
O	books

O	knightly
O	adventures

O	he
O	was
O	sometime
O	in
O	love
O	,
O	though
O	for
O	the
O	matter
O	of
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	never
O	known
O	of
O	it
O	or
O	taken
O	any
O	notice
O	of
O	him
O	whatever
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	called
O	Aldonca
O	Lorenso
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	he
O	thought
O	fittest
O	to
O	honour
O	as
O	the
O	Lady
O	of
O	his
O	Fancy
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	search
O	about
O	in
O	his
O	mind
O	for
O	a
O	name
O	that
O	should
O	not
O	vary
O	too
O	much
O	from
O	her
O	own
O	,
O	but
O	should
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	show
O	people
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	princess
O	or
O	lady
O	of
O	quality
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	he
O	called
O	her
O	Dulcinea
O	of
O	Toboso
O	,
O	a
O	name
O	sufficiently
O	strange
O	,
O	romantic
O	,
O	and
O	musical
O	for
O	the
O	lady
O	of
O	so
O	brave
O	a
O	knight
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	,
O	having
O	taken
O	to
O	himself
O	both
O	armour
O	,
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	lady
O	fair
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	go
O	forth
O	and
O	seek
O	adventures
O	.
