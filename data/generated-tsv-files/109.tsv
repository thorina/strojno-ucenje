O	The
O	20th
O	of
O	December
O	came
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	bringing
O	with
O	it
O	the
O	perfection
O	of
O	winter
O	weather
O	.
O	All
O	over
O	the
O	level
O	landscape
O	lay
O	the
O	warm
O	sunlight
O	.
O	It
O	tried
O	its
O	power
O	on
O	lake
O	,
O	canal
O	,
O	and
O	river
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	ice
O	flashed
O	defiance
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	no
O	sign
O	of
O	melting
O	.
O	The
O	very
O	weather-cocks
O	stood
O	still
O	to
O	enjoy
O	the
O	sight
O	.
O	This
O	gave
O	the
O	windmills
O	a
O	holiday
O	.
O	Nearly
O	all
O	the
O	past
O	week
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	whirling
O	briskly
O	:
O	now
O	,
O	being
O	rather
O	out
O	of
O	breath
O	,
O	they
O	rocked
O	lazily
O	in
O	the
O	clear
O	,
O	still
O	air
O	.
O	Catch
O	a
O	windmill
O	working
O	when
O	the
O	weather-cocks
O	have
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	!
O	There
O	was
O	an
O	end
O	to
O	grinding
O	,
O	crushing
O	,
O	and
O	sawing
O	for
O	that
O	day
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	thing
O	for
O	the
O	millers
O	near
O	Broek
O	.
O	Long
O	before
O	noon
O	,
O	they
O	concluded
O	to
O	take
O	in
O	their
O	sails
O	,
O	and
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	race
O	.
O	Everybody
O	would
O	be
O	there
O	.
O	Already
O	the
O	north
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	frozen
O	Y
O	was
O	bordered
O	with
O	eager
O	spectators
O	:
O	the
O	news
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	skating-match
O	had
O	travelled
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	.
O	Men
O	,
O	women
O	,
O	and
O	children
O	,
O	in
O	holiday
O	attire
O	,
O	were
O	flocking
O	toward
O	the
O	spot
O	.
O	Some
O	wore
O	furs
O	,
O	and
O	wintry
O	cloaks
O	or
O	shawls
O	;
O	but
O	many
O	,
O	consulting
O	their
O	feelings
O	rather
O	than
O	the
O	almanac
O	,
O	were
O	dressed
O	as
O	for
O	an
O	October
O	day
O	.
O	The
O	site
O	selected
O	for
O	the
O	race
O	was
O	a
O	faultless
O	plain
O	of
O	ice
O	near
O	Amsterdam
O	,
O	on
O	that
O	great
O	_arm_
O	of
O	the
O	Zuyder-Zee
O	,
O	which
O	Dutchmen
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	must
O	call
O	the
O	Eye
O	.
O	The
O	townspeople
O	turned
O	out
O	in
O	large
O	numbers
O	.
O	Strangers
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	deemed
O	it
O	a
O	fine
O	chance
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	Many
O	a
O	peasant
O	from
O	the
O	northward
O	had
O	wisely
O	chosen
O	the
O	20th
O	as
O	the
O	day
O	for
O	the
O	next
O	city-trading
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	that
O	everybody
O	,
O	young
O	and
O	old
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	wheels
O	,
O	skates
O	,
O	or
O	feet
O	at
O	command
O	,
O	had
O	hastened
O	to
O	the
O	scene
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	the
O	gentry
O	in
O	their
O	coaches
O	,
O	dressed
O	like
O	Parisians

O	Holland
O	is
O	famous
O	for

O	There
O	were
O	old-fashioned
O	gentlemen
O	in

O	velvet

O	;
O	old-fashioned

O	These
O	were
O	accompanied
O	by
O	servants

O	foot-stoves
O	and
O	cloaks
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	the

O	long

O	jackets
O	,
O	wide
O	trousers
O	,
O	and
O	steeple-crowned
O	hats

O	There
O	were
O	beautiful
O	Friesland
O	girls
O	in
O	wooden
O	shoes
O	and
O	coarse
O	petticoats
O	,
O	with

O	and
O	ear-rings
O	of
O	the

O	Many
O	were
O	content
O	with
O	gilt
O	,
O	or
O	even
O	with
O	brass
O	;
O	but
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	an
O	uncommon
O	thing
O	for
O	a
O	Friesland
O	woman
O	to
O	have
O	all
O	the
O	family
O	treasure
O	in
O	her
O	head-gear
O	.
O	More
O	than
O	one
O	rustic
O	lass
O	displayed
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	two
O	thousand
O	guilders
O	upon

O	head
O	that
O	day

O	Scattered
O	throughout
O	the
O	crowd
O	were
O	peasants
O	from
O	the
O	Island
O	of
O	Marken
O	,
O	with
O	sabots
O	,
O	black
O	stockings
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	widest
O	of
O	breeches
O	;
O	also
O	women
O	from
O	Marken
O	,
O	with
O	short
O	blue
O	petticoats
O	,
O	and
O	black
O	jackets
O	gayly
O	figured
O	in

O	wore
O	red
O	sleeves
O	,
O	white
O	aprons
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	cap
O	like
O	a
O	bishop
O	'
O	s
O	mitre
O	over
O	their
O	golden
O	hair
O	.
O	The
O	children
O	,
O	often
O	,
O	were
O	as
O	quaint
O	and
O	odd-looking
O	as
O	their
O	elders
O	.
O	In
O	short
O	,
O	one-third
O	of
O	the
O	crowd
O	seemed
O	to
O	have
O	stepped
O	bodily
O	from
O	a
O	collection
O	of
O	Dutch
O	paintings
O	.
O	Everywhere
O	could
O	be
O	seen
O	tall
O	women
O	,
O	and
O	stumpy
O	men
O	,
O	lively-faced
O	girls
O	,
O	and
O	youths
O	whose
O	expression
O	never
O	changed
O	from
O	sunrise
O	to
O	sunset
O	.
O	There
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	at
O	least
O	one
O	specimen
O	from
O	every
O	known
O	town
O	in
O	Holland
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	Utrecht
O	water-bearers
O	,
O	Gouda
O	cheese-makers
O	,
O	Delft
O	pottery-men
O	,
O	Schiedam
O	distillers
O	,
O	Amsterdam
O	diamond-cutters
O	,
O	Rotterdam
O	merchants
O	,
O	dried-up
O	herring-packers
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	sleepy-eyed
O	shepherds
O	from
O	Texel
O	.
O	Every
O	man
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	his
O	pipe
O	and
O	tobacco-pouch
O	.
O	Some
O	carried
O	what
O	might
O	be
O	called
O	the
O	smoker
O	'
O	s
O	complete
O	outfit
O	,
O	--
O	a
O	pipe
O	,
O	tobacco
O	,
O	a
O	pricker
O	with
O	which
O	to
O	clean
O	the
O	tube
O	,
O	a
O	silver
O	net
O	for
O	protecting
O	the
O	bowl
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	box
O	of
O	the
O	strongest
O	of
O	brimstone-matches
O	.
O	A
O	true
O	Dutchman
O	,
O	you
O	must
O	remember
O	,
O	is
O	rarely
O	without
O	his
O	pipe
O	on
O	any
O	possible
O	occasion
O	.
O	He
O	may
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	,
O	neglect
O	to
O	breathe
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	pipe
O	is
O	forgotten
O	,
O	he
O	must
O	be
O	dying
O	,
O	indeed
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	no
O	such
O	sad
O	cases
O	here
O	.
O	Wreaths
O	of
O	smoke
O	were
O	rising
O	from
O	every
O	possible
O	quarter
O	.
O	The
O	more
O	fantastic
O	the
O	smoke-wreath
O	,
O	the
O	more
O	placid
O	and
O	solemn
O	the
O	smoker
O	.
O	Look
O	at
O	those
O	boys
O	and
O	girls
O	on
O	stilts
O	!
O	That
O	is
O	a
O	good
O	idea
O	.
O	They
O	can
O	see
O	over
O	the
O	heads
O	of
O	the
O	tallest
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	strange
O	to
O	see
O	those
O	little
O	bodies
O	high
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	carried
O	about
O	on
O	mysterious
O	legs
O	.
O	They
O	have
O	such
O	a
O	resolute
O	look
O	on
O	their
O	round

O	what

O	that
O	nervous
O	old
O	gentlemen
O	,

O	while
O	the
O	long-legged
O	little

O	will
O	read

O	books
O	,
O	that

O	are
O	generally
O	.

O	hear
O	such

O	voices

O	even
O	the
O	baby
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	little
O	creature
O	is
O	swaddled
O	very
O	much
O	after
O	the
O	manner
O	of
O	an
O	Egyptian
O	mummy
O	;
O	but
O	it
O	can
O	crow
O	with
O	delight
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	band
O	is
O	playing
O	,
O	open
O	and
O	shut
O	its
O	animated
O	mittens
O	in
O	perfect
O	time
O	to
O	the
O	music
O	.
O	Grandfather
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	pipe
O	and
O	spectacles
O	and
O	fur
O	cap
O	,
O	makes
O	quite
O	a
O	picture
O	as
O	he
O	holds
O	baby
O	upon
O	his
O	knee
O	.
O	Perched
O	high
O	upon
O	their
O	canopied
O	platforms
O	,
O	the
O	party
O	can
O	see
O	all
O	that
O	is
O	going
O	on
O	.
O	No
O	wonder
O	the
O	ladies
O	look
O	complacently
O	at
O	the
O	glassy
O	ice
O	:
O	with
O	a
O	stove
O	for
O	a
O	footstool
O	,
O	one
O	might
O	sit
O	cosily
O	beside
O	the
O	North
O	Pole
O	.
O	There
O	is
O	a
O	gentleman
O	with
O	them
O	who
O	somewhat
O	resembles
O	St
O	.
O	Nicholas
O	as
O	he
O	appeared
O	to
O	the
O	young
O	Van
O	Glecks
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	fifth
O	of
O	December
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	saint
O	had
O	a
O	flowing
O	white
O	beard
O	;
O	and
O	this
O	face
O	is
O	as
O	smooth
O	as
O	a
O	pippin
O	.
O	His
O	saintship
O	was
O	larger
O	around
O	the
O	body
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	and
O	(
O	between
O	ourselves
O	)
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	thimbles
O	in
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	which
O	this
O	gentleman
O	certainly
O	has
O	not
O	.
O	It
O	can
O	not
O	be
O	St
O	.
O	Nicholas
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	.
O	Near
O	by
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	next
O	pavilion
O	,
O	sit
O	the
O	Van
O	Holps
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	son
O	and
O	daughter
O	(
O	the
O	Van
O	Gends
O	)
O	from
O	The
O	Hague
O	.
O	Peter
O	'
O	s
O	sister
O	is
O	not
O	one
O	to
O	forget
O	her
O	promises
O	.
O	She
O	has
O	brought
O	bouquets
O	of
O	exquisite
O	hot-house
O	flowers
O	for
O	the
O	winners
O	.
O	These
O	pavilions
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	are
O	others
O	beside
O	,
O	have
O	all
O	been
O	erected
O	since
O	daylight
O	.
O	That
O	semicircular
O	one
O	,
O	containing
O	Mynheer
O	Korbes
O	'
O	s
O	family
O	,
O	is
O	very
O	pretty
O	,
O	and
O	proves
O	that
O	the
O	Hollanders
O	are
O	quite
O	skilled
O	at
O	tent-making
O	;
O	but
O	I
O	like
O	the
O	Van
O	Gleck
O	'
O	s
O	best
O	,
O	--
O	the
O	centre
O	one
O	,
O	--
O	striped
O	red
O	and
O	white
O	,
O	and
O	hung
O	with
O	evergreens
O	.
O	The
O	one
O	with
O	the
O	blue
O	flags
O	contains
O	the
O	musicians
O	.
O	Those
O	pagoda-like
O	affairs
O	,
O	decked
O	with
O	sea-shells
O	,
O	and
O	streamers
O	of
O	every
O	possible
O	hue
O	,
O	are
O	the
O	judges
O	'
O	stands
O	;
O	and
O	those
O	columns
O	and
O	flagstaffs
O	upon
O	the
O	ice
O	mark
O	the
O	limit
O	of
O	the
O	race-course
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	white
O	columns
O	,
O	twined
O	with
O	green
O	,
O	connected
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	by
O	that
O	long
O	,
O	floating
O	strip
O	of
O	drapery
O	,
O	form
O	the
O	starting-point
O	.
O	Those
O	flagstaffs
O	,
O	half
O	a
O	mile
O	off
O	,
O	stand
O	at
O	each
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	boundary
O	line
O	,
O	cut
O	sufficiently
O	deep
O	to
O	be
O	distinct
O	to
O	the
O	skaters
O	,
O	though
O	not
O	enough
O	so
O	to
O	trip
O	them
O	when
O	they
O	turn
O	to
O	come
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	starting-point
O	.
O	The
O	air
O	is
O	so
O	clear
O	,
O	it
O	seems
O	scarcely
O	possible
O	that
O	the
O	columns
O	and
O	flagstaffs
O	are
O	so
O	far
O	apart
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	,
O	the
O	judges
O	'
O	stands
O	are
O	but
O	little
O	nearer
O	together
O	.
O	Half
O	a
O	mile
O	on
O	the
O	ice
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	atmosphere
O	is
O	like
O	this
O	,
O	is
O	but
O	a
O	short
O	distance
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	,
O	especially
O	when
O	fenced
O	with
O	a
O	living
O	chain
O	of
O	spectators
O	.
O	The
O	music
O	has
O	commenced
O	.
O	How
O	melody
O	seems
O	to
O	enjoy
O	itself
O	in
O	the
O	open
O	air
O	!
O	The
O	fiddles
O	have
O	forgotten
O	their
O	agony
O	;
O	and
O	every
O	thing
O	is
O	harmonious
O	.
O	Until
O	you
O	look
O	at
O	the
O	blue
O	tent
O	,
O	it
O	seems
O	that
O	the
O	music
O	springs
O	from
O	the
O	sunshine
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	so
O	boundless
O	,
O	so
O	joyous
O	.
O	Only
O	when
O	you
O	see
O	the
O	staid-faced
O	musicians
O	,
O	you
O	realize
O	the
O	truth
O	.
O	Where
O	are
O	the
O	racers
O	?
O	All
O	assembled
O	together
O	near
O	the
O	white
O	columns
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	a
O	beautiful
O	sight
O	,
O	--
O	forty
O	boys
O	and
O	girls
O	in
O	picturesque
O	attire
O	,
O	darting
O	with
O	electric
O	swiftness
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	among
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	or
O	sailing
O	in
O	pairs
O	and
O	triplets
O	,
O	beckoning
O	,
O	chatting
O	,
O	whispering
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	fulness
O	of
O	youthful
O	glee
O	.
O	A
O	few
O	careful
O	ones
O	are
O	soberly
O	tightening
O	their
O	straps
O	:
O	others
O	,
O	halting
O	on
O	one
O	leg
O	,
O	with
O	flushed
O	,
O	eager
O	faces
O	,
O	suddenly
O	cross
O	the
O	suspected
O	skate
O	over
O	their
O	knee
O	,
O	give
O	it
O	an
O	examining
O	shake
O	,
O	and
O	dart
O	off
O	again
O	.
O	One
O	and
O	all
O	are
O	possessed
O	with
O	the
O	spirit
O	of
O	motion
O	.
O	They
O	can
O	not
O	stand
O	still
O	.
O	Their
O	skates
O	are
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	them
O	;
O	and
O	every
O	runner
O	seems
O	bewitched
O	.
O	Holland
O	is
O	the
O	place
O	for
O	skaters
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	.
O	Where
O	else
O	can
O	nearly
O	every
O	boy
O	and
O	girl
O	perform
O	feats
O	on
O	the
O	ice
O	that
O	would
O	attract
O	a
O	crowd
O	if
O	seen
O	on
O	Central
O	Park
O	?
O	Look
O	at
O	Ben
O	!
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	see
O	him
O	before
O	.
O	He
O	is
O	really
O	astonishing
O	the
O	natives
O	;
O	no
O	easy
O	thing
O	to
O	do
O	in
O	the
O	Netherlands
O	.
O	Save
O	your
O	strength
O	,
O	Ben
O	,
O	you
O	will
O	need
O	it
O	soon
O	.
O	Now
O	other
O	boys
O	are
O	trying
O	!
O	Ben
O	is
O	surpassed
O	already
O	.
O	Such
O	jumping
O	,
O	such
O	poising
O	,
O	such
O	spinning
O	,
O	such
O	india-rubber
O	exploits
O	generally
O	!
O	That
O	boy
O	with
O	a
O	red
O	cap
O	is
O	the
O	lion
O	now
O	:
O	his
O	back
O	is
O	a
O	watch-spring
O	,
O	his
O	body
O	is
O	cork
O	--
O	no
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	iron
O	,
O	or
O	it
O	would
O	snap
O	at
O	that
O	.
O	He
O	is
O	a
O	bird
O	,
O	a
O	top
O	,
O	a
O	rabbit
O	,
O	a
O	corkscrew
O	,
O	a
O	sprite
O	,
O	a
O	flesh-ball
O	,
O	all
O	in
O	an
O	instant
O	.
O	When
O	you
O	think
O	he
O	'
O	s
O	erect
O	,
O	he
O	is
O	down
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	when
O	you
O	think
O	he
O	is
O	down
O	,
O	he
O	is
O	up

O	He
O	drops
O	his
O	glove
O	on
O	the
O	ice
O	,
O	and
O	turns
O	a
O	somerset
O	as
O	he
O	picks
O	it
O	up
O	.
O	Without
O	stopping
O	,
O	he
O	snatches
O	the
O	cap
O	from
O	Jacob
O	Poot
O	'
O	s
O	astonished
O	head
O	,
O	and

O	Lookers-on

O	Foolish
O	boy
O	!
O	It
O	is
O	arctic
O	weather
O	under
O	your
O	feet
O	,
O	but
O	more
O	than

O	overhead
O	.
O	Big
O	drops
O	already

O	Superb
O	skater

O	A
O	French
O	traveller
O	,
O	standing
O	with
O	a
O	note-book
O	in

O	sees
O	our
O	English
O	friend
O	,

O	buy
O	a
O	doughnut
O	of
O	the
O	dwarf
O	'
O	s
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	eat
O	it
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	he
O	writes
O	in
O	his
O	note-book
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	Dutch
O	take
O	enormous
O	mouthfuls
O	,
O	and
O	universally
O	are
O	fond
O	of
O	potatoes
O	boiled
O	in
O	molasses
O	.
O	There
O	are
O	some
O	familiar
O	faces
O	near
O	the
O	white
O	columns
O	.
O	Lambert
O	,
O	Ludwig
O	,
O	Peter
O	,
O	and
O	Carl
O	are
O	all
O	there
O	,
O	cool
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	good
O	skating-order
O	.
O	Hans
O	is
O	not
O	far
O	off
O	.
O	Evidently
O	he
O	is
O	going
O	to
O	join
O	in
O	the
O	race
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	skates
O	are
O	on
O	,
O	--
O	the
O	very
O	pair
O	that
O	he
O	sold
O	for
O	seven
O	guilders
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	soon
O	suspected
O	that
O	his
O	fairy
O	godmother
O	was
O	the
O	mysterious
O	``
O	friend
O	``
O	who
O	had
O	bought
O	them
O	.
O	This
O	settled
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	boldly
O	charged
O	her
O	with
O	the
O	deed
O	;
O	and
O	she
O	,
O	knowing
O	well
O	that
O	all
O	her
O	little
O	savings
O	had
O	been
O	spent
O	in
O	the
O	purchase
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	had
O	the
O	face
O	to
O	deny
O	it
O	.
O	Through
O	the
O	fairy
O	godmother
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	rendered
O	amply
O	able
O	to
O	buy
O	them
O	back
O	again
O	.
O	Therefore
O	Hans
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	in
O	the
O	race
O	.
O	Carl
O	is
O	more
O	indignant

O	,
O	as
O	three

O	peasant-boys
O	have
O	entered
O	,
O	Hans
O	is

O	march
O	.
O	The
O	spectators
O	,
O	thinking
O	something
O	new
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	happen
O	,
O	deigned
O	to
O	listen
O	and
O	to
O	look
O	.
O	The
O	racers
O	formed
O	in
O	single
O	file
O	.
O	Peter
O	,
O	being
O	tallest
O	,
O	stood
O	first
O	.
O	Gretel
O	,
O	the
O	smallest
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	took
O	her
O	place
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	.
O	Hans
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	borrowed
O	a
O	strap
O	from
O	the
O	cake-boy
O	,
O	was
O	near
O	the
O	head
O	.
O	Three
O	gayly-twined
O	arches
O	were
O	placed
O	at
O	intervals
O	upon
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	facing
O	the
O	Van
O	Gleck
O	pavilion
O	.
O	Skating
O	slowly
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	perfect
O	time
O	to
O	the
O	music
O	,
O	the
O	boys
O	and
O	girls
O	moved
O	forward
O	,
O	led
O	on
O	by
O	Peter
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	beautiful
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	bright
O	procession
O	glide
O	along
O	like
O	a
O	living
O	creature
O	.
O	It
O	curved
O	and
O	doubled
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	its
O	graceful
O	length
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	among
O	the
O	arches
O	:
O	whichever
O	way
O	Peter
O	,
O	the
O	head
O	,
O	went
O	,
O	the
O	body
O	was
O	sure
O	to
O	follow
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	it
O	steered
O	direct
O	for
O	the
O	centre
O	arch
O	;
O	then
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	seized
O	with
O	a
O	new
O	impulse
O	,
O	turned
O	away
O	and
O	curled
O	itself
O	about
O	the
O	first
O	one
O	;
O	then
O	unwound
O	slowly
O	,
O	and
O	bending
O	low
O	,
O	with
O	quick
O	,
O	snake-like
O	curvings
O	,
O	crossed
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	passing
O	at
O	length
O	through
O	the
O	farthest
O	arch
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	music
O	was
O	slow
O	,
O	the
O	procession
O	seemed
O	to
O	crawl
O	like
O	a
O	thing
O	afraid
O	:
O	it
O	grew
O	livelier
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	creature
O	darted
O	forward
O	with
O	a
O	spring
O	,
O	gliding
O	rapidly
O	among
O	the
O	arches
O	,
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	,
O	curling
O	,
O	twisting
O	,
O	turning
O	,
O	never
O	losing
O	form
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	the
O	shrill
O	call
O	of
O	the
O	bugle
O	rising
O	above
O	the
O	music
O	,
O	it
O	suddenly
O	resolved
O	itself
O	into
O	boys
O	and
O	girls
O	standing
O	in
O	double
O	semicircle
O	before
O	Madame
O	van
O	Gleck
O	'
O	s
O	pavilion
O	.
O	Peter
O	and
O	Gretel
O	stand
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	,
O	in
O	advance
O	of
O	the
O	others
O	.
O	Madame
O	van
O	Gleck
O	rises
O	majestically
O	.
O	Gretel
O	trembles
O	,
O	but
O	feels
O	that
O	she
O	must
O	look
O	at
O	the
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	.
O	She
O	can
O	not
O	hear
O	what
O	is
O	said
O	,
O	there
O	is
O	such
O	a
O	buzzing
O	all
O	around
O	her
O	.
O	She
O	is
O	thinking
O	that
O	she
O	ought
O	to
O	try
O	and
O	make
O	a
O	courtesy
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	her
O	mother
O	makes
O	to
O	the
O	_meester_
O	,
O	when
O	suddenly
O	something
O	so
O	dazzling
O	is
O	placed
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	that
O	she
O	gives
O	a
O	cry
O	of
O	joy
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	ventures
O	to
O	look
O	about
O	her
O	.
O	Peter
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	has
O	something
O	in
O	his
O	hands
O	.
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	Oh
O	!
O	how
O	splendid
O	!
O	``
O	she
O	cries
O	;
O	and
O	``
O	Oh
O	!
O	how
O	splendid
O	!
O	``
O	is
O	echoed
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	people
O	can
O	see
O	.
O	Meantime
O	the
O	silver
O	skates
O	flash
O	in
O	the
O	sunshine
O	,
O	throwing
O	dashes
O	of
O	light
O	upon
O	those
O	two
O	happy
O	faces
O	.
O	Mevrouw
O	van
O	Gend
O	sends
O	a
O	little
O	messenger
O	with
O	her
O	bouquets
O	,
O	--
O	one
O	for
O	Hilda
O	,
O	one
O	for
O	Carl
O	,
O	and
O	others
O	for
O	Peter
O	and
O	Gretel
O	.
O	At
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	flowers
O	,
O	the
O	Queen
O	of
O	the
O	Skaters
O	becomes
O	uncontrollable
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	bright
O	stare
O	of
O	gratitude
O	,
O	she
O	gathers
O	skates
O	and
O	bouquet
O	in
O	her
O	apron
O	,
O	hugs
O	them
O	to
O	her
O	bosom
O	,
O	and
O	darts
O	off
O	to
O	search
O	for
O	her
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	in
O	the
O	scattering
O	crowd
O	.
