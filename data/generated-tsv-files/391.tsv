O	It
O	was
O	in
O	1779
O	,
O	when
O	America
O	was
O	struggling
O	with
O	England
O	for
O	her
O	independence
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	division
O	of
O	the
O	English
O	redcoats
O	were
O	encamped
O	on
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	Potomac
O	.
O	So
O	admirably
O	fortified
O	was
O	their
O	position
O	by
O	river
O	and
O	steep
O	woods
O	,
O	that
O	no
O	ordinary
O	text-book
O	of
O	warfare
O	would
O	admit
O	the
O	possibility
O	of
O	surprising
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	Washington
O	and
O	his
O	men
O	did
O	not
O	conduct
O	their
O	campaigns
O	by
O	the
O	book
O	.
O	``
O	If
O	you
O	fight
O	with
O	art
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	that
O	general
O	once
O	to
O	his
O	soldiery
O	,
O	``
O	you
O	are
O	sure
O	to
O	be
O	defeated
O	.
O	Acquire
O	discipline
O	enough
O	for
O	retreat
O	and
O	the
O	uniformity
O	of
O	combined
O	attack
O	,
O	and
O	your
O	country
O	will
O	prove
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	engineers
O	.
O	``
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	with
O	a
O	guerilla
O	warfare
O	,
O	and
O	little
O	else
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	British
O	had
O	to
O	contend
O	.
O	The
O	Americans
O	had
O	enrolled
O	whole
O	tribes
O	of
O	Indians
O	in
O	their
O	ranks
O	and
O	made
O	full
O	use
O	of
O	the
O	Indian
O	habits
O	of
O	warfare
O	.
O	The
O	braves
O	would
O	steal
O	like
O	snakes
O	about
O	the
O	pathless
O	forests
O	,
O	and
O	dashing
O	unexpectedly
O	on
O	the
O	outposted
O	redcoats
O	,
O	kill
O	a
O	handful
O	in
O	one
O	fierce
O	charge
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	retreat
O	pell-mell
O	back
O	into
O	their
O	shelter
O	,
O	whither
O	to
O	follow
O	them
O	was
O	to
O	court
O	certain
O	death
O	.
O	The
O	injuries
O	thus
O	inflicted
O	were
O	not
O	overwhelming
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	teasing
O	for
O	all
O	that
O	.
O	Day
O	by
O	day
O	the
O	waste
O	went
O	on
O	--
O	loss
O	of
O	sentinels
O	,
O	of
O	stragglers
O	,
O	sometimes
O	of
O	whole
O	detachments
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	this
O	was
O	more
O	galling
O	from
O	the
O	impossibility
O	of
O	revenge
O	.
O	In
O	order
O	to
O	limit
O	the
O	depredations
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	custom
O	of
O	the
O	British
O	commanders
O	to
O	throw
O	forward
O	their
O	outposts
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	distance
O	from
O	the
O	main
O	body
O	,
O	to
O	station
O	sentinels
O	far
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	and
O	cover
O	the
O	main
O	body
O	with
O	a
O	constant
O	guard
O	.
O	One
O	regiment
O	was
O	suffering
O	from
O	little
O	less
O	than
O	a
O	panic
O	.
O	Perpetually
O	and
O	day
O	after
O	day
O	sentinels
O	had
O	been
O	missing
O	.
O	Worse
O	than
O	this
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	surprised
O	,
O	apparently
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	off
O	without
O	giving
O	any
O	alarm
O	or
O	having
O	time
O	to
O	utter
O	a
O	sound
O	.
O	It
O	would
O	happen
O	that
O	a
O	sentinel
O	went
O	forward
O	to
O	his
O	post
O	with
O	finger
O	upon
O	his
O	trigger
O	,
O	while
O	his
O	comrades
O	searched
O	the
O	woods
O	around
O	and
O	found
O	them
O	empty
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	relief
O	came
O	,
O	the
O	man
O	would
O	just
O	be
O	missing
O	.
O	That
O	was
O	all
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	never
O	a
O	trace
O	left
O	to
O	show
O	the
O	manner
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	conveyed
O	away
O	:
O	only
O	,
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	a
O	few
O	drops
O	of
O	blood
O	splashed
O	on
O	the
O	leaves
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	standing
O	.
O	The
O	men
O	grew
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	uneasy
O	.
O	Most
O	suspected
O	treachery
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	unreasonable
O	,
O	they
O	argued
O	,
O	to
O	believe
O	that
O	man
O	after
O	man
O	could
O	be
O	surprised
O	without
O	having
O	time
O	even
O	to
O	fire
O	his
O	musket
O	.
O	Others
O	talked
O	of
O	magic
O	,
O	and
O	grew
O	gloomy
O	with
O	strange
O	suspicions
O	of
O	the
O	Indian
O	medicinemen
O	.
O	At
O	any
O	rate
O	,
O	here
O	was
O	a
O	mystery
O	.
O	Time
O	would
O	clear
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	no
O	doubt
O	;
O	but
O	meanwhile
O	the
O	sentry
O	despatched
O	to
O	his
O	post
O	felt
O	like
O	a
O	man
O	marked
O	out
O	for
O	death
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	worse
O	.
O	Many
O	men
O	who
O	would
O	have
O	marched
O	with
O	firm
O	step
O	to
O	death
O	in
O	any
O	familiar
O	shape
O	,
O	would
O	go
O	with
O	pale
O	cheeks
O	and
O	bowed
O	knees
O	to
O	this
O	fate
O	of
O	which
O	nothing
O	was
O	known
O	except
O	that
O	nothing
O	was
O	left
O	of
O	the
O	victim
O	.
O	Matters
O	at
O	length
O	grew
O	intolerable
O	.
O	One
O	morning
O	,
O	the
O	sentinels
O	having
O	been
O	set
O	as
O	usual
O	overnight
O	,
O	the
O	guard
O	went
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	dawn
O	began
O	to
O	break
O	to
O	relieve
O	a
O	post
O	that
O	extended
O	far
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	.
O	The
O	sentinel
O	was
O	gone
O	!
O	They
O	searched
O	about
O	,
O	found
O	his
O	footprints
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	on
O	the
O	trodden
O	leaves
O	,
O	but
O	no
O	blood
O	--
O	no
O	trace
O	of
O	struggle
O	,
O	no
O	marks
O	of
O	surrounding
O	enemies
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	old
O	story
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	almost
O	given
O	up
O	the
O	problem
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	.
O	They
O	left
O	another
O	man
O	at
O	the
O	post
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	their
O	way
O	back
O	,
O	wishing
O	him
O	better
O	luck
O	.
O	``
O	No
O	need
O	to
O	be
O	afraid
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	called
O	after
O	them
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	desert
O	.
O	``
O	They
O	looked
O	back
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	standing
O	with
O	his
O	musket
O	ready
O	to
O	fly
O	up
O	to
O	his
O	shoulder
O	at
O	the
O	slightest
O	sound
O	,
O	his
O	eyes
O	searching
O	the
O	glades
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	nothing
O	faint
O	about
O	Tom
O	,
O	they
O	determined
O	,
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	guard-house
O	.
O	The
O	sentinels
O	were
O	replaced
O	every
O	four
O	hours
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	regular
O	time
O	the
O	guard
O	again
O	marched
O	to
O	relieve
O	the
O	post
O	.
O	The
O	man
O	was
O	gone
O	!
O	They
O	rubbed
O	their
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	searched
O	again
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	one
O	had
O	disappeared
O	as
O	mysteriously
O	as
O	his
O	fellows
O	.
O	Again
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	single
O	trace
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	the
O	more
O	necessary
O	that
O	the
O	post
O	should
O	not
O	remain
O	unguarded
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	forced
O	to
O	leave
O	a
O	third
O	man
O	and
O	return
O	,
O	promising
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	colonel
O	should
O	be
O	told
O	of
O	his
O	danger
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	got
O	back
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	panic
O	indeed
O	that
O	filled
O	the
O	regiment
O	when
O	they
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	guard-house
O	and
O	told
O	the
O	news
O	.
O	The
O	colonel
O	was
O	informed
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	He
O	promised
O	to
O	go
O	in
O	person
O	to
O	the
O	spot
O	when
O	the
O	man
O	was
O	relieved
O	,
O	and
O	search
O	the
O	woods
O	round
O	about
O	.
O	This
O	gave
O	them
O	some
O	confidence
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	went
O	nevertheless
O	with
O	the
O	gloomiest
O	forebodings
O	as
O	to
O	their
O	comrade
O	'
O	s
O	fate
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	drew
O	near
O	the
O	spot
O	they
O	advanced
O	at
O	a
O	run
O	.
O	Their
O	fears
O	were
O	justified
O	.
O	The
O	post
O	was
O	vacant
O	--
O	the
O	man
O	gone
O	without
O	a
O	sound
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	blank
O	astonishment
O	that
O	followed
O	,
O	the
O	colonel
O	hesitated
O	.
O	Should
O	he
O	station
O	a
O	whole
O	company
O	at
O	the
O	post
O	?
O	This
O	would
O	doubtless
O	prevent
O	further
O	loss
O	;
O	but
O	then
O	it
O	was
O	little
O	likely
O	to
O	explain
O	the
O	mystery
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	hands
O	that
O	had
O	carried
O	off
O	three
O	sentinels
O	,
O	would
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	reasonable
O	to
O	believe
O	,
O	make
O	no
O	attempt
O	to
O	spirit
O	away
O	a
O	whole
O	company
O	of
O	men
O	.
O	And
O	for
O	future
O	action
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	to
O	put
O	an
O	end
O	to
O	the
O	superstitious
O	terror
O	of
O	the
O	soldiery
O	,
O	the
O	vital
O	necessity
O	was
O	to
O	clear
O	up
O	the
O	mystery
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	no
O	belief
O	in
O	the
O	theory
O	that
O	these
O	men
O	deserted
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	them
O	too
O	well
O	.
O	He
O	prided
O	himself
O	mat
O	he
O	was
O	thoroughly
O	acquainted
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	regiment
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	well-grounded
O	reasons
O	for
O	pride
O	in
O	his
O	men
O	.
O	For
O	this
O	reason
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	more
O	chary
O	of
O	exposing
O	a
O	fourth
O	brave
O	man
O	where
O	three
O	had
O	already
O	been
O	lost
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	it
O	had
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	fellow
O	whose
O	turn
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	post
O	,
O	though
O	a
O	soldier
O	of
O	proved
O	courage
O	and
O	even
O	recklessness
O	in
O	action
O	,
O	positively
O	shook
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	must
O	do
O	my
O	duty
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	colonel
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	know
O	that
O	well
O	enough
O	;
O	but
O	for
O	all
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	like
O	to
O	lose
O	my
O	life
O	with
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	credit
O	.
O	``
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	higher
O	bravery
O	than
O	facing
O	an
O	indefinite
O	terror
O	such
O	as
O	this
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	colonel
O	was
O	at
O	pains
O	to
O	point
O	out
O	,

O	he
O	added
O	--

O	Immediately
O	a
O	soldier
O	stepped
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	ranks
O	.
O	``
O	Give
O	me
O	the
O	post
O	,

O	he
O	said
O	quietly
O	.
O	The
O	colonel
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	volunteer
O	admiringly
O	,
O	and
O	spoke
O	some
O	words
O	in
O	praise
O	of
O	his
O	courage
O	.
O	``
O	No
O	,

O	said
O	the

O	;
O	``

O	on

O	Hardly

O	paced
O	up

O	guard-room
O	,
O	as
O	anxious
O	as
O	any
O	of
O	the

O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	at

O	,
O	the
O	report
O	of

O	out
O	.
O	Colonel
O	,

O	,

O	poured
O	out
O	of

O	at
