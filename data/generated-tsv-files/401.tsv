O	When
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	heard
O	what
O	the
O	Cid
O	said
O	,
O	his
O	anger
O	kindled
O	against
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	You
O	have
O	given
O	this
O	counsel
O	to
O	my
O	sister
O	because
O	you
O	were
O	bred
O	with
O	her
O	.
O	And
O	my
O	Cid
O	answered
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Faithfully
O	have
O	I
O	discharged
O	your
O	bidding
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	a
O	true
O	vassal
O	.
O	Howbeit
O	,
O	O
O	king
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	bear
O	arms
O	against
O	the
O	Infanta
O	your
O	sister
O	,
O	nor
O	against
O	Zamora
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	days
O	which
O	are
O	passed;--and
O	I
O	beseech
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	persist
O	in
O	doing
O	this
O	wrong
O	.
O	But
O	then
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	was
O	more
O	greatly
O	incensed
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	If
O	it
O	were
O	not
O	that
O	my
O	father
O	left
O	you
O	commended
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	would
O	order
O	you
O	this
O	instant
O	to
O	be
O	hanged
O	.
O	But
O	for
O	this
O	which
O	you
O	have
O	said
O	I
O	command
O	you
O	to
O	quit
O	my
O	kingdom
O	within
O	nine
O	days
O	.
O	The
O	Cid
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	tent
O	in
O	anger
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	for
O	his
O	kinsmen
O	and
O	his
O	friends
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	them
O	make
O	ready
O	on
O	the
O	instant
O	to
O	depart
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	set
O	forth
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	and
O	esquires
O	of
O	his
O	table
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	all
O	their
O	retainers
O	horse
O	and
O	foot
O	,
O	twelve
O	hundred
O	persons
O	,
O	all
O	men
O	of
O	approved
O	worth
O	,
O	a
O	goodly
O	company;--and
O	they
O	took
O	the
O	road
O	to
O	Toledo
O	,
O	meaning
O	to
O	join
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	among
O	the
O	Moors
O	.
O	That
O	night
O	they
O	slept
O	at
O	Castro
O	Nuno
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	counts
O	and
O	Ricos-omes
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	good
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	host
O	saw
O	this
O	,
O	they
O	understood
O	the
O	great
O	evil
O	,
O	which
O	might
O	arise
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	from
O	the
O	departure
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	.
O	They
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	said
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	Sir
O	,
O	wherefore
O	would
O	you
O	lose
O	so
O	good
O	a
O	vassal
O	,
O	who
O	has
O	done
O	you
O	such
O	great
O	service
O	?
O	If
O	he
O	should
O	go
O	unto
O	your
O	brother
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	among
O	the
O	Moors
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	let
O	you
O	besiege
O	this
O	city
O	thus
O	in
O	peace
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	perceived
O	that
O	they
O	spake
O	rightly
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	called
O	for
O	Don
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	follow
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	and
O	beseech
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	name
O	to
O	return;
O	and
O	whatever
O	covenant
O	he
O	should
O	make
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	confirmed
O	unto
O	him;
O	and
O	of
O	this
O	he
O	ordered
O	his
O	letters
O	of
O	credence
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	out
O	.
O	And
O	Don
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	rode
O	after
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	and
O	delivered
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	bidding
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	besought
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	bear
O	in
O	mind
O	the
O	words
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	spoken
O	unto
O	him
O	in
O	anger
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Cid
O	called
O	together
O	his
O	kinsmen
O	and
O	friends
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	counselled
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	better
O	to
O	remain
O	in
O	his
O	land
O	and
O	serve
O	God
O	,
O	than
O	to
O	go
O	among
O	the
O	Moors
O	.
O	He
O	held
O	their
O	counsel
O	good
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	for
O	Don
O	Diego
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	do
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	Cid
O	drew
O	nigh
O	unto
O	the
O	host
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	went
O	out
O	with
O	five
O	hundred
O	knights
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	received
O	him
O	gladly
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	him
O	great
O	honour
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Cid
O	kissed
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	confirmed
O	what
O	Don
O	Diego
O	had
O	said;
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	confirmed
O	it
O	before
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	who
O	were
O	there
O	present
O	,
O	promising
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	great
O	possessions
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	army
O	great
O	was
O	the
O	joy
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	'
O	s
O	return
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	were
O	the
O	rejoicings
O	which
O	were
O	made
O	:
O	but
O	as
O	great
O	was
O	the
O	sorrow
O	in
O	Zamora
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	who
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	town
O	held
O	that
O	the
O	siege
O	was
O	broken
O	up
O	by
O	his
O	departure
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	my
O	Cid
O	would
O	not
O	bear
O	arms
O	against
O	the
O	Infanta
O	,
O	nor
O	against
O	the
O	town
O	of
O	Zamora
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	days
O	which
O	were
O	past
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	ordered
O	proclamation
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	throughout
O	the
O	host
O	that
O	the
O	people
O	should
O	make
O	ready
O	to
O	attack
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	They
O	fought
O	against
O	it
O	three
O	days
O	and
O	three
O	nights
O	so
O	bravely
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	ditches
O	were
O	filled
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	barbicans
O	thrown
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	who
O	were
O	within
O	fought
O	sword
O	in
O	hand
O	with
O	those
O	without
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	waters
O	of
O	the
O	Douro
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	past
O	below
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	were
O	all
O	discoloured
O	with
O	blood
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Count
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	de
O	Cabra
O	saw
O	the
O	great
O	loss
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	suffering
O	,
O	it
O	grieved
O	him;
O	and
O	he
O	went
O	unto
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	many
O	men
O	were
O	slain
O	,
O	and
O	advised
O	him
O	to
O	call
O	off
O	the
O	host
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	no
O	longer
O	fight
O	against
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	but
O	hold
O	it
O	besieged
O	,
O	for
O	by
O	famine
O	it
O	might
O	soon
O	be
O	taken
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	king
O	ordered
O	them
O	to
O	draw
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	sent
O	to
O	each
O	camp
O	to
O	know
O	how
O	many
O	men
O	had
O	died
O	in
O	the
O	attack
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	number
O	was
O	found
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	thousand
O	and
O	thirty
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	king
O	knew
O	this
O	he
O	was
O	greatly
O	troubled
O	for
O	the
O	great
O	loss
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	received
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	ordered
O	the
O	town
O	to
O	be
O	beleaguered
O	round
O	about
O	,
O	that
O	none
O	could
O	enter
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	neither
O	go
O	out
O	therefrom;
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	famine
O	within
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	saw
O	the
O	misery
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hunger
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	mortality
O	which
O	were
O	there
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	Infanta
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	,
O	You
O	see
O	,
O	lady
O	,
O	the
O	great
O	wretchedness
O	which
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	Zamora
O	have
O	suffered
O	,
O	and
O	do
O	every
O	day
O	suffer
O	to
O	maintain
O	their
O	loyalty;
O	now
O	then
O	call
O	together
O	the
O	Council
O	,
O	and
O	thank
O	them
O	truly
O	for
O	what
O	they
O	have
O	done
O	for
O	you
O	,
O	and
O	bid
O	them
O	give
O	up
O	the
O	town
O	within
O	nine
O	days
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	your
O	brother
O	.
O	And
O	we
O	,
O	lady
O	,
O	will
O	go
O	to
O	Toledo
O	to
O	your
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	,
O	for
O	we
O	cannot
O	defend
O	Zamora;
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	is
O	of
O	so
O	great
O	heart
O	and
O	so
O	resolute
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	will
O	never
O	break
O	up
O	the
O	siege
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	hold
O	it
O	good
O	that
O	you
O	should
O	abide
O	here
O	longer
O	.
O	And
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	gave
O	orders
O	that
O	the
O	good
O	men
O	of
O	Zamora
O	should
O	meet
O	together
O	in
O	council;
O	and
O	she
O	said
O	unto
O	them
O	,
O	Friends
O	,
O	ye
O	well
O	see
O	the
O	resoluteness
O	of
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	my
O	brother
O	.
O	Ye
O	have
O	done
O	enough
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	hold
O	it
O	good
O	that
O	ye
O	should
O	perish
O	,
O	I
O	command
O	ye
O	therefore
O	give
O	up
O	the
O	town
O	to
O	him
O	within
O	nine
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	to
O	Toledo
O	to
O	my
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	.
O	The
O	men
O	of
O	Zamora
O	when
O	they
O	heard
O	this
O	had
O	great
O	sorrow
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	had
O	endured
O	the
O	siege
O	so
O	long
O	,
O	and
O	must
O	now
O	give
O	up
O	the
O	town
O	at
O	last;
O	and
O	they
O	determined
O	all
O	to
O	go
O	with
O	the
O	Infanta
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	remain
O	in
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	When
O	Vellido
O	Dolfos
O	heard
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Lady
O	,
O	I
O	came
O	here
O	to
O	Zamora
O	to
O	do
O	you
O	service
O	with
O	thirty
O	knights
O	,
O	all
O	well
O	accoutred
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	know;
O	and
O	I
O	have
O	served
O	you
O	long
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	have
O	I
O	had
O	from
O	you
O	guerdon
O	for
O	my
O	service
O	,
O	though
O	I
O	have
O	demanded
O	it
O	:
O	but
O	now
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	grant
O	my
O	demand
O	I
O	will
O	relieve
O	Zamora
O	,
O	and
O	make
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	break
O	up
O	the
O	siege
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	,
O	Vellido
O	,
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	bid
O	thee
O	commit
O	any
O	evil
O	thing
O	,
O	if
O	such
O	thou
O	hast
O	in
O	thy
O	thought;
O	but
O	I
O	say
O	unto
O	you
O	,
O	that
O	there
O	is
O	not
O	a
O	man
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	to
O	whom
O	if
O	he
O	should
O	relieve
O	Zamora
O	,
O	and
O	make
O	the
O	king
O	my
O	brother
O	raise
O	the
O	siege
O	,
O	I
O	would
O	not
O	grant
O	whatsoever
O	he
O	might
O	require
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Vellido
O	heard
O	this
O	he
O	kissed
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	a
O	porter
O	who
O	kept
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	open
O	the
O	gate
O	unto
O	him
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	him
O	flying
O	toward
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	gave
O	him
O	his
O	cloak
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	armed
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	to
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	with
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	,
O	We
O	all
O	know
O	the
O	reason
O	,
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	,
O	why
O	you
O	will
O	not
O	let
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	exchange
O	Zamora
O	with
O	her
O	brother;
O	it
O	is
O	because
O	you
O	deal
O	with
O	her
O	like
O	an
O	old
O	traitor
O	.
O	When
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	heard
O	this
O	,
O	it
O	grieved
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	heart
O	.
O	Then
O	his
O	sons
O	arose
O	and
O	armed
O	themselves
O	hastily
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	after
O	Vellido
O	,
O	who
O	fled
O	before
O	them
O	toward
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	The
O	porter
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	him
O	coming
O	opened
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	rode
O	out
O	and
O	galloped
O	into
O	the
O	camp
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	others
O	followed
O	him
O	till
O	they
O	were
O	nigh
O	the
O	camp
O	,
O	but
O	farther
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	venture
O	.
O	And
O	Vellido
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	kissed
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	unto
O	him
O	these
O	false
O	words
O	with
O	a
O	lying
O	tongue
O	:
O	Sir
O	,
O	because
O	I
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	Council
O	of
O	Zamora
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	yield
O	the
O	town
O	unto
O	you
O	,
O	the
O	sons
O	of
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	would
O	have
O	slain
O	me
O	,
O	even
O	as
O	you
O	have
O	seen
O	.
O	And
O	therefore
O	come
O	I
O	to
O	you
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	and
O	will
O	be
O	your
O	vassal
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	may
O	find
O	favour
O	at
O	your
O	hands
O	.
O	And
O	I
O	will
O	show
O	you
O	how
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	you
O	may
O	have
O	Zamora
O	,
O	if
O	God
O	pleases;
O	and
O	if
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	said
O	,
O	then
O	let
O	me
O	be
O	slain
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	believed
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	received
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	vassal
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	him
O	great
O	honour
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	that
O	night
O	they
O	talked
O	together
O	of
O	his
O	secrets
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	made
O	the
O	king
O	believe
O	that
O	he
O	knew
O	a
O	postern
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	would
O	put
O	Zamora
O	into
O	his
O	hands
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morrow
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	who
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	town
O	went
O	upon
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	out
O	with
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	,
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	,
O	give
O	ear
O	to
O	what
O	I
O	say;
O	I
O	am
O	a
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	from
O	whom
O	I
O	spring
O	were
O	true
O	men
O	and
O	delighted
O	in
O	their
O	loyalty
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	also
O	will
O	live
O	and
O	die
O	in
O	my
O	truth
O	.
O	I
O	say
O	unto
O	you
O	,
O	that
O	from
O	this
O	town
O	of
O	Zamora
O	there
O	is
O	gone
O	forth
O	a
O	traitor
O	to
O	kill
O	you;
O	his
O	name
O	is
O	Vellido
O	Dolfos
O	.
O	Look
O	to
O	yourself
O	therefore
O	and
O	take
O	heed
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	I
O	say
O	this
O	to
O	you
O	,
O	that
O	if
O	evil
O	should
O	befall
O	you
O	by
O	this
O	traitor
O	,
O	it
O	may
O	not
O	be
O	said
O	in
O	Spain
O	that
O	you
O	were
O	not
O	warned
O	against
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Zamora
O	sent
O	also
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	to
O	bid
O	him
O	beware
O	of
O	Vellido;
O	nevertheless
O	he
O	gave
O	no
O	heed
O	to
O	the
O	warning
O	.
O	And
O	Vellido
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	this
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Sir
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	is
O	full
O	crafty
O	,
O	and
O	hath
O	sent
O	to
O	say
O	this
O	unto
O	you
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	knows
O	that
O	by
O	my
O	means
O	you
O	would
O	have
O	won
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	called
O	for
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	feigning
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	depart
O	because
O	of
O	what
O	had
O	been
O	said
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	king
O	took
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Friend
O	and
O	vassal
O	,
O	take
O	no
O	thought
O	for
O	this;
O	I
O	say
O	unto
O	you
O	,
O	that
O	if
O	I
O	may
O	have
O	Zamora
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	make
O	you
O	chief
O	therein
O	,
O	even
O	as
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	is
O	now
O	.
O	Then
O	Vellido
O	kissed
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	God
O	grant
O	you
O	life
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	for
O	many
O	and
O	happy
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	you
O	fulfil
O	what
O	you
O	desire
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	traitor
O	had
O	other
O	thoughts
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	Vellido
O	took
O	the
O	king
O	apart
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	If
O	it
O	please
O	you
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	let
O	us
O	ride
O	out
O	together
O	alone;
O	we
O	will
O	go
O	round
O	Zamora
O	,
O	and
O	see
O	the
O	trenches
O	which
O	you
O	have
O	ordered
O	to
O	be
O	made;
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	show
O	unto
O	you
O	the
O	postern
O	which
O	is
O	called
O	the
O	queen
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	we
O	may
O	enter
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	is
O	never
O	closed
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	is
O	night
O	you
O	shall
O	give
O	me
O	a
O	hundred
O	knights
O	who
O	are
O	hidalgos
O	,
O	well
O	armed
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	will
O	go
O	on
O	foot
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Zamorans
O	because
O	they
O	are
O	weak
O	with
O	famine
O	and
O	misery
O	,
O	will
O	let
O	us
O	conquer
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	will
O	enter
O	and
O	open
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	keep
O	it
O	open
O	till
O	all
O	your
O	host
O	shall
O	have
O	entered
O	in
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	believed
O	what
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	took
O	horse
O	and
O	went
O	riding
O	round
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	trenches
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	traitor
O	showed
O	him
O	the
O	postern
O	.
O	And
O	after
O	they
O	had
O	ridden
O	round
O	the
O	town
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	need
O	to
O	alight;
O	now
O	he
O	carried
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	a
O	light
O	hunting
O	spear
O	which
O	was
O	gilded
O	over
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	the
O	kings
O	from
O	whom
O	he
O	was
O	descended
O	were
O	wont
O	to
O	bear;
O	and
O	he
O	gave
O	this
O	to
O	Vellido
O	to
O	hold
O	it
O	while
O	he
O	went
O	aside
O	,
O	to
O	cover
O	his
O	feet
O	.
O	And
O	Vellido
O	Dolfos
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	him
O	in
O	that
O	guise
O	,
O	took
O	the
O	hunting
O	spear
O	and
O	thrust
O	it
O	between
O	his
O	shoulders
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	went
O	through
O	him
O	and
O	came
O	out
O	at
O	his
O	breast
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	stricken
O	him
O	he
O	turned
O	the
O	reins
O	and
O	rode
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	toward
O	the
O	postern
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
O	the
O	Cid
O	saw
O	him
O	riding
O	thus
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	wherefore
O	he
O	fled
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	answer;
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	Cid
O	understood
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	some
O	treason
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	heart
O	misgave
O	him
O	and
O	he
O	called
O	in
O	haste
O	for
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	but
O	while
O	they
O	were
O	bringing
O	it
O	,
O	Vellido
O	had
O	ridden
O	far
O	away;
O	and
O	the
O	Cid
O	being
O	eager
O	to
O	follow
O	him
O	,
O	took
O	only
O	his
O	lance
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	wait
O	to
O	have
O	his
O	spurs
O	buckled
O	on
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	followed
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	postern
O	and
O	had
O	well
O	nigh
O	overtaken
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	Vellido
O	got
O	in;
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	Cid
O	said
O	in
O	his
O	anger
O	,
O	Cursed
O	be
O	the
O	knight
O	who
O	ever
O	gets
O	on
O	horseback
O	without
O	his
O	spurs
O	.
O	Now
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	feats
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	never
O	was
O	fault
O	found
O	in
O	him
O	save
O	only
O	in
O	this
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	enter
O	after
O	Vellido
O	into
O	the
O	town;
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	fail
O	to
O	do
O	this
O	for
O	cowardice
O	,
O	neither
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	death
O	,
O	or
O	of
O	imprisonment;
O	but
O	because
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	a
O	device
O	between
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	fled
O	by
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	command;
O	for
O	certes
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	known
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	slain
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	which
O	would
O	have
O	prevented
O	him
O	from
O	entering
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	and
O	slaying
O	the
O	traitor
O	in
O	the
O	streets
O	,
O	thereright
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	history
O	saith
O	,
O	that
O	when
O	Vellido
O	Dolfos
O	had
O	got
O	within
O	the
O	postern
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	such
O	fear
O	both
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	town
O	and
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	without
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	placed
O	himself
O	under
O	the
O	mantle
O	of
O	the
O	Infanta
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	knew
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	unto
O	the
O	Infanta
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Lady
O	,
O	I
O	beseech
O	you
O	that
O	you
O	give
O	up
O	this
O	traitor
O	to
O	the
O	Castillians
O	,
O	otherwise
O	the
O	Castillians
O	will
O	impeach
O	all
O	who
O	are
O	in
O	Zamora
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	will
O	be
O	greater
O	dishonour
O	for
O	you
O	and
O	for
O	us
O	.
O	And
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	made
O	answer
O	,
O	Counsel
O	me
O	then
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	may
O	not
O	die
O	for
O	this
O	which
O	he
O	hath
O	done
O	.
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	then
O	answered
O	,
O	Give
O	him
O	unto
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	keep
O	him
O	in
O	custody
O	for
O	three
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	the
O	Castillians
O	impeach
O	us
O	we
O	will
O	deliver
O	him
O	into
O	their
O	hands;
O	and
O	if
O	they
O	do
O	not
O	impeach
O	us
O	within
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	we
O	will
O	thrust
O	him
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	shall
O	not
O	be
O	seen
O	among
O	us
O	.
O	And
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	took
O	him
O	from
O	thence
O	,
O	and
O	secured
O	him
O	with
O	double
O	fetters
O	,
O	and
O	guarded
O	him
O	well
O	.
O	Meantime
O	the
O	Castillians
O	went
O	to
O	seek
O	their
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	found
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	Douro
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	sorely
O	wounded
O	,
O	even
O	unto
O	death;
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	yet
O	lost
O	his
O	speech
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hunting
O	spear
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	body
O	,
O	through
O	and
O	through
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	dare
O	to
O	take
O	it
O	out
O	lest
O	he
O	should
O	die
O	immediately
O	.
O	And
O	a
O	master
O	of
O	Burgos
O	came
O	up
O	who
O	was
O	well
O	skilled
O	in
O	these
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	sawed
O	off
O	the
O	ends
O	of
O	the
O	spear
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	not
O	lose
O	his
O	speech
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	confessed
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	death
O	within
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	Count
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	de
O	Cabra
O	said
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	Sir
O	,
O	think
O	of
O	your
O	soul
O	,
O	for
O	you
O	have
O	a
O	desperate
O	wound
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	made
O	answer
O	,
O	The
O	traitor
O	Vellido
O	has
O	killed
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	well
O	know
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	for
O	my
O	sins
O	,
O	because
O	I
O	broke
O	the
O	oath
O	which
O	I
O	made
O	unto
O	the
O	king
O	my
O	father
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	saying
O	this
O	the
O	Cid
O	came
O	up
O	and
O	knelt
O	before
O	him
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	I
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	remain
O	more
O	desolate
O	than
O	any
O	other
O	of
O	your
O	vassals
O	,
O	for
O	for
O	your
O	sake
O	have
O	I
O	made
O	your
O	brethren
O	mine
O	enemies
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	who
O	were
O	against
O	you
O	,
O	and
O	against
O	whom
O	it
O	pleased
O	you
O	to
O	go
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	your
O	father
O	commended
O	me
O	to
O	them
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	to
O	you
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	divided
O	his
O	kingdoms
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	have
O	lost
O	their
O	love
O	for
O	your
O	sake
O	,
O	having
O	done
O	them
O	great
O	evil
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	neither
O	can
O	I
O	go
O	before
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	,
O	your
O	brother
O	,
O	nor
O	remain
O	among
O	the
O	Christians
O	before
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	your
O	sister
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	hold
O	that
O	whatsoever
O	you
O	have
O	done
O	against
O	them
O	was
O	by
O	my
O	counsel
O	.
O	Now
O	then
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	remember
O	me
O	before
O	you
O	depart
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	said
O	,
O	I
O	beseech
O	all
O	ye
O	who
O	are
O	here
O	present
O	,
O	that
O	if
O	my
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	should
O	come
O	from
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	Moors
O	,
O	ye
O	beseech
O	him
O	to
O	show
O	favour
O	unto
O	you
O	,
O	my
O	Cid
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	always
O	be
O	bountiful
O	unto
O	you
O	,
O	and
O	receive
O	you
O	to
O	be
O	his
O	vassal
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Cid
O	arose
O	and
O	kissed
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	chief
O	persons
O	who
O	were
O	there
O	present
O	did
O	the
O	like
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	said
O	unto
O	them
O	,
O	I
O	beseech
O	ye
O	intreat
O	my
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	to
O	forgive
O	me
O	whatever
O	wrong
O	I
O	have
O	done
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	pray
O	to
O	God
O	to
O	have
O	mercy
O	upon
O	my
O	soul
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	said
O	this
O	he
O	asked
O	for
O	the
O	candle
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	his
O	soul
O	departed
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	who
O	were
O	there
O	present
O	made
O	great
O	lamentation
O	for
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	dead
O	,
O	the
O	townsmen
O	who
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	camp
O	forsook
O	their
O	tents
O	and
O	fled
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	noble
O	Castillians
O	would
O	not
O	depart
O	from
O	Zamora
O	,
O	nor
O	break
O	up
O	the
O	siege
O	thereof
O	,
O	but
O	remained
O	bravely
O	before
O	it
O	,
O	though
O	they
O	had
O	lost
O	their
O	lord
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	took
O	counsel
O	together
O	how
O	they
O	should
O	proceed
O	against
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Zamora
O	for
O	this
O	great
O	treason
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	committed
O	.
O	Then
O	Count
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	de
O	Cabra
O	arose
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Friends
O	,
O	if
O	there
O	be
O	one
O	here
O	who
O	will
O	impeach
O	them
O	for
O	this
O	thing
O	,
O	we
O	will
O	do
O	whatever
O	may
O	be
O	needful
O	that
O	he
O	may
O	come
O	off
O	with
O	honour
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	impeachment
O	be
O	carried
O	through
O	.
O	Then
O	Don
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	arose
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	unto
O	them
O	,
O	If
O	ye
O	will
O	all
O	assent
O	to
O	this
O	which
O	ye
O	have
O	heard
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	impeach
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Zamora
O	for
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	our
O	lord
O	:
O	and
O	they
O	all
O	assented
O	.
O	Now
O	my
O	Cid
O	did
O	not
O	make
O	this
O	impeachment
O	against
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	Zamora
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	oath
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	sworn
O	.
O	Then
O	Don
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	lodging
O	and
O	armed
O	himself
O	well
O	and
O	rode
O	toward
O	Zamora
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	drew
O	nigh
O	unto
O	the
O	town
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	cry
O	aloud
O	,
O	asking
O	if
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	were
O	there
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	would
O	speak
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	went
O	with
O	his
O	sons
O	upon
O	the
O	wall
O	to
O	see
O	who
O	called
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	spake
O	to
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	Friend
O	,
O	what
O	wouldest
O	thou
O	?
O	And
O	Don
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	answered
O	,
O	The
O	Castillians
O	have
O	lost
O	their
O	lord;
O	the
O	traitor
O	Vellido
O	slew
O	him
O	,
O	being
O	his
O	vassal
O	,
O	and
O	ye
O	of
O	Zamora
O	have
O	received
O	Vellido
O	and
O	harboured
O	him
O	within
O	your
O	walls
O	.
O	Now
O	therefore
O	I
O	say
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	a
O	traitor
O	who
O	hath
O	a
O	traitor
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	knoweth
O	and
O	consenteth
O	unto
O	the
O	treason
O	.
O	And
O	for
O	this
O	I
O	impeach
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	Zamora
O	,
O	the
O	great
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	little
O	,
O	the
O	living
O	and
O	the
O	dead
O	.
O	If
O	there
O	be
O	any
O	one
O	in
O	Zamora
O	to
O	gainsay
O	what
O	I
O	have
O	said
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	do
O	battle
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	God
O	'
O	s
O	pleasure
O	conquer
O	him
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	infamy
O	shall
O	remain
O	upon
O	you
O	.
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	replied
O	,
O	If
O	I
O	were
O	what
O	thou
O	sayest
O	I
O	am
O	,
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	better
O	for
O	me
O	never
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	born;
O	but
O	in
O	what
O	thou
O	sayest
O	thou
O	liest
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	do
O	battle
O	with
O	thee
O	upon
O	this
O	quarrel
O	,
O	or
O	give
O	thee
O	one
O	in
O	my
O	stead
O	.
O	But
O	know
O	that
O	you
O	have
O	been
O	ill
O	advised
O	in
O	making
O	this
O	impeachment
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	manner
O	is
O	,
O	that
O	whosoever
O	impeacheth
O	a
O	council
O	must
O	do
O	battle
O	with
O	five
O	,
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	he
O	conquer
O	the
O	five
O	he
O	shall
O	be
O	held
O	a
O	true
O	man
O	,
O	but
O	if
O	either
O	of
O	the
O	five
O	conquer
O	him
O	,
O	the
O	council
O	is
O	held
O	acquitted
O	and
O	he
O	a
O	liar
O	.
O	When
O	Don
O	Diego
O	heard
O	this
O	it
O	troubled
O	him;
O	howbeit
O	he
O	dissembled
O	this
O	right
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	unto
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	bring
O	twelve
O	Castillians
O	,
O	and
O	do
O	you
O	bring
O	twelve
O	men
O	of
O	Zamora
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	shall
O	swear
O	upon
O	the
O	Holy
O	Gospel
O	to
O	judge
O	justly
O	between
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	they
O	find
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	bound
O	to
O	do
O	battle
O	with
O	five
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	perform
O	it
O	.
O	And
O	Don
O	Arias
O	made
O	answer
O	that
O	he
O	said
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	so
O	.
O	And
O	truce
O	was
O	made
O	for
O	three
O	times
O	nine
O	days
O	,
O	till
O	this
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	determined
O	and
O	the
O	combat
O	fought
O	.
O	Then
O	when
O	the
O	truce
O	was
O	made
O	they
O	chose
O	out
O	twelve
O	alcades
O	on
O	the
O	one
O	part
O	,
O	and
O	twelve
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	who
O	should
O	decide
O	in
O	what
O	manner
O	he
O	was
O	bound
O	to
O	perform
O	combat
O	who
O	impeached
O	a
O	council
O	.
O	Two
O	of
O	them
O	who
O	were
O	held
O	the
O	most
O	learned
O	in
O	these
O	things
O	arose
O	,
O	the
O	one
O	being
O	a
O	Castillian
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	of
O	Zamora
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	found
O	the
O	law
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	written
O	to
O	be
O	this
O	:
O	That
O	whosoever
O	impeacheth
O	the
O	council
O	of
O	a
O	town
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	bishop
O	'
O	s
O	seat
O	,
O	must
O	do
O	battle
O	with
O	five
O	in
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	one
O	after
O	another;
O	and
O	that
O	after
O	every
O	combat
O	there
O	should
O	be
O	given
O	unto
O	him
O	fresh
O	arms
O	and
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	three
O	sops
O	of
O	bread
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	draught
O	either
O	of
O	wine
O	or
O	of
O	water
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	chose
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	this
O	sentence
O	which
O	the
O	twain
O	pronounced
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	twenty
O	and
O	two
O	accorded
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morrow
O	the
O	four
O	and
O	twenty
O	alcades
O	marked
O	out
O	the
O	lists
O	upon
O	the
O	sand
O	beside
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	lists
O	they
O	placed
O	a
O	bar
O	,
O	and
O	ordained
O	that
O	he
O	who
O	won
O	the
O	battle
O	should
O	lay
O	hand
O	on
O	the
O	bar
O	,
O	and
O	say
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	conquered
O	:
O	and
O	then
O	they
O	appointed
O	a
O	term
O	of
O	nine
O	days
O	for
O	the
O	combatants
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	those
O	lists
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	assigned
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	all
O	was
O	appointed
O	the
O	Infanta
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	ordered
O	a
O	meeting
O	to
O	be
O	called
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	all
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	assembled
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	gathered
O	together
O	,
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
