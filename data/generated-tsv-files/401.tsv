O	This

O	An
O	instant

O	the
O	missionary
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	was
O	swept
O	forward
O	in
O	a
O	rush

O	carried
O	both
O	parties
O	,
O	intermingled
O	,
O	deep
O	into
O	the
O	center
O	of
O	the
O	tented
O	village
O	.
O	Well
O	toward
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	encampment
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	large
O	and
O	irregular
O	space
O	left
O	unoccupied
O	,
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	plaza
O	,
O	devoted
O	to
O	common
O	use
O	,
O	and
O	employed
O	as
O	meeting-ground
O	in
O	the
O	trading
O	operations
O	of
O	the
O	market
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	jollifications
O	,
O	which
O	occupied
O	far
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	time
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	riders
O	came
O	into
O	this
O	open
O	space
O	Shunan
O	and
O	his
O	party
O	drew
O	off
O	to
O	the
O	right
O	.
O	His
O	antagonist
O	sought
O	out
O	his
O	lodge
O	upon
O	the
O	opposite
O	side
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	followed
O	here

O	``
O	Gervais
O	sprang
O	upon

O	off
O	,
O	calling
O	out
O	to
O	others
O	,
O	who
O	drew
O	near
O	,
O	the
O	instructions

O	He
O	approached
O	Shunan

O	now
O	urging
O	his
O	horse
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	the
O	open
O	space
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	shouting
O	defiance

O	uttering
O	foul
O	reproaches
O	for
O	his
O	antagonist
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	announced
O	himself
O	eager
O	to
O	meet
O	.
O	Gervais
O	delivered
O	his
O	message
O	.
O	The
O	bully
O	continued
O	to
O	crowd
O	his
O	horse
O	back
O	and
O	forth
O	,
O	pulling
O	it
O	up
O	so
O	sharply
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	thrown
O	upon
O	its
O	haunches
O	now
O	and
O	again
O	in
O	mid-career
O	.
O	He
O	waved
O	his
O	long
O	rifle
O	over
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	issued
O	a
O	general
O	challenge
O	to
O	all
O	within
O	reach
O	of
O	his
O	voice
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	moment
O	there
O	rode
O	out
O	from
O	the
O	farther
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	circle
O	the
O	champion
O	of
O	law
O	and
O	order
O	.
O	The
O	horse
O	which
O	he
O	bestrode
O	came
O	on
O	strongly
O	and
O	lightly
O	,
O	its
O	head
O	up
O	.
O	The
O	rider
O	had
O	stripped
O	off
O	all
O	his
O	accouterments
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	a
O	buckskin
O	pad-saddle
O	,
O	Indian
O	fashion
O	.
O	About
O	his
O	waist
O	was
O	a
O	belt
O	,
O	which
O	bore
O	no
O	weapons
O	.
O	His
O	long
O	rifle
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	weapon
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	master
O	,
O	did
O	not
O	rest
O	upon
O	the
O	saddle
O	front
O	.
O	His
O	hat
O	was
O	gone
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	handkerchief
O	bound
O	back
O	his
O	long
O	light
O	hair
O	.
O	He
O	rode
O	forward
O	lightly
O	,
O	easily
O	,
O	in
O	confidence
O	.
O	Shunan
O	,
O	yelling
O	,
O	wildly
O	,
O	charged
O	at
O	once
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	man
O	sat
O	erect
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	Shunan
O	was
O	still
O	a
O	score
O	of
O	yards
O	away
O	,
O	the
O	brown
O	horse
O	leaped
O	aside
O	,
O	its
O	rider
O	lying
O	along
O	its
O	neck
O	as
O	an
O	Indian
O	might
O	have
O	done
O	,
O	and
O	swept
O	round
O	and
O	to
O	the
O	rear
O	of
O	Shunan
O	.
O	The
O	bully
O	,
O	fumbling
O	with
O	his
O	piece
O	,
O	endeavored
O	to
O	follow
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	pistol
O	barrel
O	pointing
O	under
O	the
O	neck
O	of
O	the
O	brown
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	cold
O	terror
O	smote
O	his
O	soul
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	swept
O	past
O	again
O	at
O	full
O	gallop
O	,
O	Shunan
O	still
O	not
O	quite
O	master
O	of
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	weapon
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	long-barreled
O	,
O	muzzle-loading
O	rifle
O	was
O	difficult
O	to
O	manage
O	from
O	the
O	back
O	of
O	a
O	plunging
O	horse
O	.
O	They
O	wheeled
O	and
O	passed
O	yet
O	again
O	;
O	but
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	turned
O	,
O	they
O	headed
O	directly
O	toward
O	each
O	other
O	at
O	a
O	steady
O	pace
O	.
O	The
O	spectators
O	knew
O	that
O	in
O	an
O	instant
O	the
O	issue
O	would
O	be
O	decided
O	.
O	Shunan
O	jerked
O	up
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	threw
O	his
O	rifle
O	sharply
O	to
O	his
O	face
O	.
O	His
O	antagonist
O	made
O	no
O	attempt
O	to
O	swerve
O	,
O	but
O	instead
O	spurred
O	forward
O	sharply
O	.
O	The
O	brown
O	horse
O	sprang
O	breast
O	to
O	breast
O	with
O	the
O	cream-colored
O	mustang
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	men
O	were
O	within
O	arm
O	'
O	s
O	length
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	minute
O	there
O	rang
O	out
O	two
O	reports
O	,
O	almost
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	instant
O	.
O	The
O	horses
O	sprang
O	apart
O	.
O	The
O	slighter
O	man
O	was
O	still
O	sitting
O	erect
O	.
O	He
O	swept
O	his
O	hand
O	hastily
O	across
O	his
O	temple
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	felt
O	a
O	stinging
O	burn
O	.
O	Shunan
O	,
O	dazed
O	,
O	sat
O	his
O	horse
O	for
O	an
O	instant
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	rifle
O	dropped
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	his
O	horse
O	sprang
O	forward
O	,
O	he
O	himself
O	fell
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	lay
O	,
O	one
O	arm
O	hanging
O	limp
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	raised
O	in
O	the
O	sign
O	of
O	surrender
O	.
O	The
O	duel
O	was
O	over
O	.
O	The
O	late
O	friends
O	of
O	Shunan
O	joined
O	the
O	riders
O	who
O	now
O	crowded
O	into
O	the
O	open
O	space
O	from
O	the
O	opposite
O	sides
