O	the

O	,
O	cried
O	out
O	:

O	Cardenio
O	.
O	``
O	Four

O	a

O	a

O	``
O	The

O	her
O	head
O	at
O	these
O	cries

O	move
O	a

O	.
O	This
O	sudden
O	movement
O	loosened
O	the

O	,
O	which
O	fell
O	from

O	face
O	,
O	discovering
O	her
O	marvellous
O	beauty
O	.
O	But
O	her
O	countenance
O	was
O	wan
O	and
O	pale
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	turned
O	her
O	eyes
O	from
O	place
O	to
O	place
O	as
O	one
O	distracted
O	,
O	which
O	caused
O	Dorothea
O	and
O	the
O	rest
O	to
O	behold
O	her
O	with
O	a
O	vast
O	pity

O	The
O	gentleman
O	held
O	her
O	fast
O	by
O	the
O	shoulders
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	so
O	busied
O	that

O	Scarce

O	from
O	the

O	fell
O	backward
O	in
O	a
O	swoon

O	The

O	removed
O	the

O	from
O	giving
O	her
O	their
O	sympathy
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	Don
O	Fernando
O	,
O	he
O	stood
O	gazing
O	fixedly
O	at
O	Dorothea
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	overwhelmed
O	with
O	remorse
O	and
O	admiration
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	her
O	to
O	his
O	arms
O	,
O	saying
O	:
O	``
O	Thou
O	hast
O	vanquished
O	,
O	O
O	beautiful
O	Dorothea
O	.
O	Thou
O	hast
O	vanquished
O	!
O	``
O	At
O	the
O	same
O	moment
O	,
O	Cardenio
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	stood
O	close
O	to
O	Don
O	Fernando
O	,
O	started
O	forward
O	to
O	catch
O	the
O	fainting
O	Lucinda
O	,
O	who
O	threw
O	both
O	her
O	arms
O	around
O	his
O	neck
O	,
O	crying
O	:
O	``
O	Thou
O	,
O	and
O	thou
O	only
O	,
O	art
O	my
O	lord
O	and
O	master
O	.
O	``
O	Thus
O	were
O	the
O	true
O	lovers
O	all
O	united
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	good
O	curate
O	,
O	the
O	barber
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	Sancho
O	Panza
O	joined
O	in
O	their
O	tears
O	,
O	delighted
O	that
O	so
O	much
O	joy
O	had
O	taken
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	so
O	much
O	misery
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	Sancho
O	,
O	he
O	excused
O	himself
O	afterwards
O	for
O	his
O	tears
O	,
O	saying
O	he
O	wept
O	only
O	because
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	Dorothea
O	was
O	not
O	the
O	Queen
O	of
O	Micomicona
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	imagined
O	,
O	from
O	whom
O	he
O	hoped
O	to
O	have
O	received
O	such
O	mighty
O	gifts
O	and
O	favours
O	.
O	Each
O	in
O	turn
O	told
O	his
O	or
O	her
O	story
O	,
O	and
O	Don
O	Fernando
O	gave
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	befallen
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	found
O	the
O	scroll
O	that
O	Lucinda
O	had
O	written
O	in
O	which
O	she
O	declared
O	her
O	love
O	for
O	Cardenio
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	appeared
O	that
O	,
O	the
O	day
O	after
O	the
O	interruption
O	of
O	the
O	wedding
O	,
O	Lucinda
O	had
O	secretly
O	departed
O	from
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	fled
O	no
O	one
O	knew
O	whither
O	;
O	but
O	within
O	a
O	few
O	months
O	Don
O	Fernando
O	had
O	learned
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	certain
O	convent
O	,
O	intending
O	to
O	remain
O	there
O	all
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	her
O	life
O	,
O	if
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	pass
O	them
O	with
O	Cardenio
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	learned
O	that
O	,
O	choosing
O	three
O	gentlemen
O	to
O	aid
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	she
O	was
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	he
O	surprised
O	her
O	walking
O	with
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	nuns
O	in
O	the
O	cloisters
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	her
O	off
O	without
O	giving
O	her
O	a
O	chance
O	to
O	resist
O	.
O	From
O	there
O	they
O	brought
O	her
O	to
O	a
O	certain
O	village
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	disguised
O	themselves
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	rode
O	on
O	until
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	inn
O	.
O	But
O	Lucinda
O	,
O	after
O	she
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	power
O	,
O	did
O	nothing
O	but
O	weep
O	and
O	sigh
O	without
O	speaking
O	a
O	word
O	.
O	Thus
O	in
O	silence
O	and
O	tears
O	had
O	they
O	reached
O	this
O	inn
O	,
O	which
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	all
O	of
O	them
O	would
O	always
O	remain
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	since
O	it
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	so
O	many
O	troubles
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	him
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	true
O	love
O	.
