O	As
O	a
O	gift
O	from
O	the
O	gods
O	she
O	was
O	presented
O	to
O	Prometheus
O	.
O	But
O	Prometheus
O	,
O	gazing
O	in
O	wonder
O	at
O	the
O	violet
O	blue
O	eyes
O	bestowed
O	by
O	Aphrodite

O	two

O	that

O	the

O	Not

O	(

O	.
O	For
O	Epimethus
O	it
O	was
O	enough
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	this
O	peerless

O	,
O	sent

O	the

O	Perfect

O	the
O	happiness
O	that

O	with

O	Before

O	,
O	as
O	he
O	well
O	knew
O	now
O	,
O	the
O	fair

O	had
O	been
O	incomplete
O	.
O	Since

O	the
O	fragrant
O	flowers

O	grown
O	more
O	sweet
O	for

O	,
O	the
O	song

O	.
O	He
O	found

O	and
O	marvelled

O	that

O	aught
O	but
O	peace
O	and

O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	the
O	gods
O	had
O	entrusted
O	to
O	the
O	Titan
O	brothers
O	the
O	endowment
O	of
O	all
O	living
O	things
O	upon
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	careful
O	to

O	pain
O	,

O	,
O	or
O	soul-crushing
O	sorrow
O	.
O	All
O	these
O	hurtful
O	things
O	were
O	imprisoned
O	in
O	a
O	coffer
O	which
O	was
O	given
O	into

O	care
O	of

O	Epimethus
O	.
O	To
O	Pandora
O	the
O	world
O	into
O	which
O	she
O	came
O	was
O	all
O	fresh
O	,
O	all
O	new
O	,
O	quite
O	full
O	of
O	unexpected
O	joys
O	and
O	delightful
O	surprises
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	world
O	of
O	mystery
O	,
O	but
O	mystery
O	of
O	which
O	her
O	great
O	,
O	adoring
O	,
O	simple
O	Titan
O	held
O	the
O	golden
O	key
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	coffer
O	which
O	never

O	,
O	what
O	then
O	more
O	natural
O	than
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	ask
O	Epimethus
O	what
O	it
O	contained
O	?
O	But
O	the
O	contents
O	were
O	known
O	only
O	to
O	the
O	gods
O	.
O	Epimethus
O	was
O	unable
O	to
O	answer
O	.
O	Day
O	by
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	curiosity
O	of
O	Pandora
O	increased
O	.
O	To
O	her
O	the
O	gods
O	had
O	never
O	given
O	anything
O	but
O	good
O	.
O	Surely
O	there
O	must
O	be
O	here
O	gifts
O	more
O	precious
O	still
O	.
O	What
O	if
O	the
O	Olympians
O	had
O	destined
O	her
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	one
O	to
O	open
O	the
O	casket
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	sent
O	her
O	to
O	earth
O	in
O	order
O	that

O	might
O	bestow

O	,
O	on
O	the

O	wolf-pack
O	indeed
O	was
O	that
O	one
O	let
O	loose
O	by
O	Pandora
O	.
O	Terror
O	,
O	doubt
O	,
O	misery
O	,
O	had
O	all
O	rushed
O	straightway
O	to
O	attack
O	her
O	heart
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	evils
O	of
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	never
O	dreamed
O	stung
O	mind
O	and
O	soul
O	into
O	dismay
O	and
O	horror
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	by
O	hastily
O	shutting
O	the
O	lid
O	of
O	the
O	coffer
O	,
O	she
O	tried
O	to
O	undo
O	the
O	evil
O	she
O	had
O	done
O	.
O	And
O	lo
O	,
O	she
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	gods
O	had
O	imprisoned
O	one
O	good
O	gift
O	only
O	in
O	this
O	Inferno
O	of
O	horrors
O	and
O	of
O	ugliness
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	world
O	there
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	any
O	need
O	of
O	Hope
O	.
O	What
O	work
O	was
O	there
O	for
O	Hope
O	to
O	do
O	where
O	all
O	was
O	perfect
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	each
O	creature
O	possessed
O	the
O	desire
O	of
O	body
O	and
O	of
O	heart
O	?
O	Therefore
O	Hope
O	was
O	thrust
O	into
O	the
O	chest
O	that
O	held
O	the
O	evils
O	,
O	a
O	star
O	in
O	a
O	black
O	night
O	,
O	a
O	lily
O	growing
O	on
O	a
O	dung-heap
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	Pandora
O	,
O	white-lipped
O	and
O	trembling
O	,
O	looked
O	into
O	the
O	otherwise
O	empty
O	box
O	,
O	courage
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	her
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	Epimethus
O	let
O	fall
O	to
O	his
O	side
O	the
O	arm
O	that
O	would
O	have
O	slain
O	the
O	woman
O	of
O	his
O	love
O	because
O	there
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	draught
O	of
O	wine
O	to
O	a
O	warrior
O	spent
O	in
O	battle
O	,
O	an
O	imperial
O	vision
O	of
O	the
O	sons
O	of
O	men
O	through
O	all
O	the
O	aeons
O	to
O	come
O	,
O	combatting
O	all
O	evils
O	of
O	body
O	and
O	of
O	soul
O	,
O	going
O	on
O	conquering
O	and
O	to
O	conquer
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	saved
O	by
O	Hope
O	,
O	the
O	Titan
O	and
O	the
O	woman
O	faced
O	the
O	future
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	them
O	the
O	vengeance
O	of
O	the

O	.

O	Thirty

O	was
O	the
