O	In
O	the
O	year
O	280
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	town
O	in
O	Cappadocia
O	,
O	was
O	born
O	that
O	great
O	soldier
O	and
O	champion
O	of
O	the
O	oppressed
O	whom
O	we
O	call
O	St
O	.
O	George
O	.
O	His
O	parents
O	were
O	Christians
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	especially
O	by
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	most
O	carefully
O	instructed
O	and
O	trained
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	youth
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	age
O	of
O	seventeen
O	years
O	he
O	took
O	up
O	the
O	profession
O	of
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	since
O	he
O	was
O	gifted
O	with
O	beauty
O	of
O	person
O	,
O	intelligence
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	exquisite
O	courtesy
O	,
O	he
O	rose
O	rapidly
O	to
O	a
O	considerable
O	military
O	rank
O	.
O	Especially
O	he
O	pleased
O	his
O	imperial
O	master
O	,
O	Diocletian
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	while
O	the
O	Emperor
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	devoted
O	to
O	the
O	worship
O	of
O	Apollo
O	,
O	was
O	consulting
O	at
O	a
O	shrine
O	of
O	that
O	god
O	upon
O	an
O	affair
O	of
O	much
O	importance
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	dark
O	depths
O	of
O	the
O	cavern
O	came
O	forth
O	a
O	voice
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	The
O	just
O	who
O	are
O	on
O	the
O	earth
O	keep
O	me
O	from
O	telling
O	the
O	truth
O	.
O	By
O	them
O	the
O	inspiration
O	of
O	the
O	Sacred
O	Tripod
O	is
O	made
O	a
O	lie
O	.
O	``
O	At
O	once
O	the
O	Emperor
O	was
O	stricken
O	with
O	consternation
O	and
O	asked
O	who
O	these
O	just
O	people
O	were
O	.
O	``
O	Master
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	priests
O	of
O	Apollo
O	,
O	``
O	they
O	are
O	the
O	Christians
O	.
O	``
O	This
O	answer
O	so
O	enraged
O	Diocletian
O	that
O	he
O	rekindled
O	his
O	persecutions
O	.
O	Now
O	from
O	the
O	first
O	the
O	young
O	soldier
O	George
O	had
O	burned
O	with
O	indignation
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	unspeakable
O	cruelties
O	put
O	upon
O	Christians
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	spoken
O	out
O	boldly
O	in
O	defence
O	of
O	his
O	brethren
O	.
O	His
O	friends
O	had
O	counselled
O	silence
O	and
O	prudence
O	.
O	But
O	George
O	would
O	have
O	none
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	called
O	upon
O	to
O	suffer
O	at
O	any
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	hoped
O	to
O	do
O	better
O	work
O	for
O	the
O	world
O	and
O	to
O	die
O	after
O	braver
O	effort
O	.
O	He
O	therefore
O	distributed
O	his
O	money
O	and
O	his
O	fine
O	apparel
O	among
O	the
O	poor
O	and
O	needy
O	,
O	set
O	free
O	all
O	the
O	slaves
O	he
O	possessed
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	forth
O	upon
O	knightly
O	travel
O	.
O	While
O	pricking
O	one
O	day
O	through
O	the
O	plains
O	of
O	Libya
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	certain
O	city
O	called
O	Silene
O	,
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	which
O	were
O	bewailing
O	a
O	dire
O	misfortune
O	that
O	had
O	come
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	An
O	enormous
O	dragon
O	had
O	issued
O	from
O	a
O	marsh
O	neighbouring
O	the
O	town
O	and
O	had
O	devoured
O	all
O	their
O	flocks
O	and
O	herds
O	.
O	Already
O	the
O	monster
O	had
O	taken
O	dwelling
O	near
O	the
O	city
O	walls
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	such
O	distance
O	the
O	people
O	had
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	only
O	by
O	granting
O	him
O	two
O	sheep
O	every
O	day
O	for
O	his
O	food
O	and
O	drink
O	.
O	If
O	they
O	had
O	failed
O	in
O	this
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	come
O	within
O	their
O	walls
O	and
O	poisoned
O	every
O	man
O	,
O	woman
O	,
O	and
O	child
O	with
O	his
O	plague-like
O	breath
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	already
O	all
O	the
O	flocks
O	and
O	herds
O	had
O	been
O	eaten
O	.
O	Nothing
O	remained
O	to
O	fill
O	the
O	insatiable
O	maw
O	of
O	the
O	dragon
O	but
O	the
O	little
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	homes
O	and
O	hearths
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	Every
O	day
O	two
O	children
O	were
O	now
O	given
O	him
O	.
O	Each
O	child
O	taken
O	was
O	under
O	the
O	age
O	of
O	fifteen
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	chosen
O	by
O	lot
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	every
O	house
O	and
O	every
O	street
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	public
O	squares
O	echoed
O	with
O	the
O	wailing
O	of
O	unhappy
O	parents
O	and
O	the
O	cries
O	of
O	the
O	innocents
O	who
O	were
O	soon
O	to
O	be
O	offered
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	had
O	one
O	daughter
O	,
O	an
O	exceeding
O	fair
O	girl
O	both
O	in
O	mind
O	and
O	body
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	many
O	days
O	of
O	the
O	choosing
O	of
O	lots
O	for
O	the
O	sacrifice
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	many
O	a
O	blooming
O	girl
O	and
O	boy
O	had
O	met
O	an
O	unhappy
O	death
O	,
O	the
O	lot
O	fell
O	to
O	this
O	maiden
O	,
O	Cleodolinda
O	.
O	When
O	her
O	father
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	heard
O	his
O	misfortune
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	despair
O	he
O	offered
O	all
O	the
O	gold
O	in
O	the
O	state
O	treasury
O	and
O	even
O	half
O	his
O	kingdom
O	,
O	to
O	redeem
O	the
O	maiden
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	this
O	many
O	fathers
O	and
O	mothers
O	who
O	had
O	lost
O	their
O	children
O	murmured
O	greatly
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	O
O	King
O	,
O	art
O	thou
O	just
O	?
O	By
O	thy
O	edict
O	thou
O	hast
O	made
O	us
O	desolate
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	behold
O	thou
O	wouldst
O	withhold
O	thine
O	own
O	child
O	!
O	``
O	Thus
O	the
O	people
O	spake
O	,
O	and
O	speaking
O	they
O	waxed
O	wroth
O	greatly
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	joining
O	together
O	they
O	marched
O	threatening
O	to
O	burn
O	the
O	King
O	in
O	his
O	palace
O	unless
O	he
O	delivered
O	the
O	maiden
O	to
O	fulfil
O	her
O	lot
O	.
O	To
O	such
O	demands
O	the
O	King
O	perforce
O	submitted
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	asked
O	only
O	a
O	delay
O	of
O	eight
O	days
O	which
O	he
O	might
O	spend
O	with
O	the
O	lovely
O	girl
O	and
O	bewail
O	her
O	fate
O	.
O	This
O	the
O	people
O	granted
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	time
O	agreed
O	to
O	the
O	fair
O	victim
O	was
O	led
O	forth
O	.
O	She
O	fell
O	at
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	feet
O	asking
O	his
O	blessing
O	and
O	protesting
O	she
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	die
O	for
O	her
O	people
O	.
O	Then
O	amid
O	tears
O	and
O	lamentations
O	she
O	was
O	led
O	to
O	the
O	walls
O	and
O	put
O	without
O	.
O	The
O	gates
O	were
O	shut
O	and
O	barred
O	against
O	her
O	.
O	She
O	walked
O	towards
O	the
O	dwelling
O	of
O	the
O	dragon
O	,
O	slowly
O	and
O	painfully
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	road
O	was
O	strewn
O	with
O	the
O	bones
O	of
O	her
O	playmates
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	wept
O	as
O	she
O	went
O	on
O	her
O	way
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	this
O	very
O	morning
O	that
O	George
O	,
O	courageously
O	seeking
O	to
O	help
O	the
O	weak
O	,
O	and
O	strong
O	to
O	serve
O	the
O	truth
O	,
O	was
O	passing
O	by
O	in
O	his
O	knightly
O	journeying
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	stretched
O	before
O	him
O	the
O	noisome
O	path
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	moved
O	to
O	see
O	so
O	beautiful
O	a
O	maiden
O	in
O	tears
O	,
O	he
O	checked
O	his
O	charger
O	and
O	asked
O	her
O	why
O	she
O	wept
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	pitiful
O	story
O	she
O	recounted
O	,
O	to
O	which
O	the
O	valiant
O	one
O	answered
O	,
O	``
O	Fear
O	not
O	;
O	I
O	will
O	deliver
O	you
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Oh
O	noble
O	youth
O	,
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	fair
O	victim
O	,
O	``
O	tarry
O	not
O	here
O	lest
O	you
O	perish
O	with
O	me
O	.
O	Fly
O	,
O	I
O	beseech
O	you
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	God
O	forbid
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	fly
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	George
O	in
O	answer
O	;
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	lift
O	my
O	hand
O	against

O	followers
O	of
O	Christ
O	.
O	``
O	At
O	that
O	moment
O	the
O	dragon
O	was
O	seen
O	coming
O	forth
O	from
O	his
O	lair
O	half
O	flying
O	and
O	half
O	crawling
O	towards
O	them
O	.
O	``
O	Fly
O	,
O	I
O	beseech
O	you
O	,
O	brave
O	knight
O	,
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	fair
O	girl
O	trembling
O	,
O	``
O	Leave
O	me
O	here
O	to
O	die
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	George
O	answered
O	not
O	.
O	Rather
O	he
O	put
O	spurs
O	to
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	,
O	calling
O	upon
O	his
O	Lord
O	,
O	rushed
O	towards
O	the
O	monster
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	terrible
O	and
O	prolonged
O	combat
O	,
O	pinned
O	the
O	mighty
O	hulk
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	with
O	his
O	lance
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	called
O	to
O	the
O	maiden
O	to
O	bring
O	him
O	her
O	girdle
O	.
O	With
O	this
O	he
O	bound
O	the
O	dragon
O	fast
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	girdle
O	into
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	subdued
O	monster
O	crawled
O	after
O	them
O	like
O	a
O	dog
O	.
O	Walking
O	in
O	this
O	way
O	they
O	approached
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	onlooking
O	people
O	were
O	stricken
O	with
O	terror
O	,
O	but
O	George
O	called
O	out
O	to
O	them
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	Fear
O	nothing

O	with
O	His
O	teachings
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	destroy
O	him
O	before
O	your
O	eyes

O	``
O	So
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	believed
O	and
O	such
O	a
O	life
O	they
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	live
O	.
O	Then
O	St
O	.
O	George
O	slew
O	the
O	dragon
O	and
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	gave
O	great
O	treasure
O	to
O	the
O	knight
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	the
O	rewards
O	George
O	distributed
O	among
O	the
O	sick
O	and
O	necessitous
O	and
O	kept
O	nothing
O	for
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	went
O	further
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	of
O	helpfulness
O	.
O	About
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	Emperor
O	Diocletian
O	issued
O	an
O	edict
O	which
O	was
O	published
O	the
O	length
O	and
O	breadth
O	of
O	his
O	empire
O	.
O	This
O	edict
O	was
O	nailed
O	to
O	the
O	doors
O	of
O	temples
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	walls
O	of
O	public
O	markets
O	,
O	in
O	all
O	places
O	people
O	frequented
O	,
O	and
O	those
O	who
O	read
O	it
O	read
O	it
O	with
O	terror
O	and
O	hid
O	their
O	faces
O	in
O	despair
O	.
O	For
O	it
O	condemned
O	all
O	Christians
O	.
O	But
O	St
O	.
O	George
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	writing
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	indignation
O	.
O	That
O	spirit
O	and
O	courage
O	which
O	comes
O	to
O	all
O	of
O	us
O	from
O	communion
O	with
O	the
O	eternal
O	powers
O	heartened
O	and
O	strengthened
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	tore
O	down
O	the
O	unhappy
O	utterance
O	and
O	trampled
O	it
O	under
O	foot
O	.
O	Thus
O	prepared
O	for
O	death
O	George
O	approached
O	the
O	Emperor
O	.
O	``
O	What

O	that
O	this

O	man
O	deserved
O	torture
O	.
O	``

O	``
O	``
O	Young
O	man
O	,
O	``
O	returned
O	Diocletian
O	with
O	threatening
O	looks
O	,
O	``
O	think
O	of

O	and
O	thy

O	``
O	Before
O	George
O	could
O	make
O	answer
O	the
O	ill-will
O	of
O	the
O	tyrant
O	waxed
O	to
O	ardent
O	hatred
O	and
O	he
O	summoned
O	guards
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	martyr
O	to
O	prison
O	.
O	Once
O	within
O	the
O	dungeon
O	the
O	keepers
O	threw
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	put
O	his
O	feet
O	in
O	stocks
O	and
O	placed
O	a
O	stone
O	of
O	great
O	weight
O	upon
O	his
O	chest
O	.
O	But
O	even
O	so
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	torture
O	,
O	the
O	blessed
O	one
O	ceased
O	not
O	to
O	give
O	thanks
O	to
O	God
O	for
O	this
O	opportunity
O	to
O	bear
O	witness
O	to
O	Christ
O	'
O	s
O	teachings
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	they
O	stretched
O	the
O	martyr
O	on
O	a
O	wheel
O	full
O	of
O	sharp
O	spokes
O	.
O	But
O	a
O	voice
O	from
O	heaven
O	came
O	to
O	comfort
O	him
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	George
O	,
O	fear
O	not
O	;
O	so
O	it
O	is
O	with
O	those

O	witness
O	to
O	the
O	truth
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	there
O	appeared
O	to
O	him
O	an
O	angel
O	brighter
O	than
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	clothed
O	in
O	a
O	white
O	robe
O	,
O	who
O	stretched
O	out
O	a
O	hand
O	to
O	embrace
O	and
O	encourage
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	pain
O	.
O	Two
O	of
O	the
O	officers
O	of
O	the
O	prison
O	who
O	saw
O	this
O	beautiful
O	vision
O	became
O	Christians
O	and
O	from
O	that
O	day
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	live
O	after
O	the
O	teachings
O	of
O	Christ
O	.
O	There
O	is
O	still
O	another
O	tale
O	that
O	after
O	George
O	had
O	been
O	comforted
O	by
O	the
O	angel
O	who
O	descended
O	from
O	heaven
O	,
O	his
O	tormentors
O	flung
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	cauldron
O	of
O	boiling
O	lead
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	believed
O	they
O	had
O	subdued
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	force
O	of
O	his
O	agonies
O	,
O	they
O	brought
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	temple
O	to
O	assist
O	in
O	their
O	worship
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	ran
O	in
O	crowds
O	to
O	behold
O	his
O	humiliation
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	priests
O	mocked
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	Emperor
O	,
O	seeing
O	the
O	constancy
O	of
O	George
O	,
O	once
O	more
O	sought
O	to
O	move
O	him
O	by
O	entreaties
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	great
O	soldier
O	refused
O	to
O	be
O	judged
O	by
O	words
O	,
O	only
O	by
O	deeds
O	.
O	He
O	even
O	demanded
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	gods
O	Diocletian
O	himself
O	worshipped
O	.
O	The
O	Emperor
O	,
O	believing
O	that
O	at
O	length
O	George
O	was
O	coming
O	to
O	his
O	right
O	mind
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	yield
O	,
O	ordered
O	the
O	Roman
O	Senate
O	and
O	people
O	to
O	assemble
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	all
O	might
O	be
O	witnesses
O	of
O	George
O	'
O	s
O	acknowledgement
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	Diocletian
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	gods
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	were
O	thus
O	gathered
O	together
O	in
O	the
O	Emperor
O	'
O	s
O	temple
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	were
O	fixed
O	upon
O	the
O	weak
O	and
O	tortured
O	saint
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	he
O	would
O	do
O	,
O	he
O	drew
O	near
O	a
O	statue
O	of
O	the
O	sun-god
O	Apollo
O	,
O	and
O	stretching
O	out
O	his
O	hand
O	toward
O	the
O	image
O	he
O	said
O	slowly
O	,
O	``
O	Wouldst
O	thou
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	offer
O	thee
O	sacrifices
O	as
O	to
O	a
O	god
O	?
O	``
O	The
O	demon
O	who
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	statue
O	made
O	answer
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	God
O	.
O	There
O	is
O	but
O	one
O	God
O	and
O	Christ
O	is
O	his
O	greatest
O	prophet
O	.
O	``
O	At
O	that
O	very
O	hour
O	were
O	heard
O	horrible
O	wailing
O	sounds
O	coming
O	from
O	the
O	mouths
O	of
O	idols
O	the
O	world
O	over
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	statues
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	gods
O	either
O	all
O	fell
O	over
O	or
O	crumbled
O	to
O	dust
O	.
O	One
O	account
O	says
O	that
O	St
O	.
O	George
O	knelt
O	down
O	and
O	prayed
O	,
O	and
O	thunder
O	and
O	lightning
O	from
O	heaven
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	idols
O	and
O	destroyed
O	them
O	.
O	Angry
O	at
O	the
O	breaking
O	of
O	their
O	power
O	,
O	the
O	priests
O	of
O	the
O	gods
O	cried
O	to
O	the
O	Emperor
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	rid
O	himself
O	of
O	so
O	potent
O	a
O	magician
O	and
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	The
O	priests
O	also
O	incited
O	the
O	people
O	to
O	lay
O	hands
O	on
O	the
O	martyr
O	.
O	So
O	it
O	was
O	commanded
O	that
O	George
O	,
O	the
O	Christian
O	knight
O	,
O	should
O	be
O	beheaded
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	dragged
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	execution
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	bending
O	his
O	neck
O	to
O	the
O	sword
O	of
O	the
O	executioner
O	and
O	absorbed
O	in
O	prayer
O	,
O	he
O	received
O	bravely
O	and
O	thankfully
O	the
O	stroke
O	of
O	death
O	in
O	April
O	,
O	303
O	.
O	So
O	stands
O	St
O	.
O	George
O	ever
O	before
O	the
O	youth
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	champions
O	of
O	Christendom
O	,
O	a
O	model
O	of
O	courage
O	,
O	a
O	brave
O	interceder
O	for
O	the
O	oppressed
O	,
O	an
O	example
O	of
O	pure
O	,
O	firm
O	and
O	enduring
O	doing
O	for
O	others
O	,
O	a
O	true
O	soldier
O	of
O	Christ
O	.
