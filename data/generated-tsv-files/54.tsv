O	Three
O	days
O	after
O	my
O	arrival
O	,
O	walking
O	out
O	of
O	curiosity
O	to
O	the
O	northeast
O	coast
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	I
O	observed
O	,
O	about
O	half
O	a
O	league
O	off
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	somewhat
O	that
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	boat
O	overturned
O	.
O	I
O	pulled
O	off
O	my
O	shoes
O	and
O	stockings
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	wading
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	hundred
O	yards
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	the
O	object
O	to
O	approach
O	nearer
O	by
O	force
O	of
O	the
O	tide;
O	and
O	then
O	plainly
O	saw
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	real
O	boat
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	supposed
O	might
O	,
O	by
O	some
O	tempest
O	,
O	have
O	been
O	driven
O	from
O	a
O	ship
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	I
O	returned
O	immediately
O	towards
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	and
O	desired
O	his
O	Imperial
O	Majesty
O	to
O	lend
O	me
O	twenty
O	of
O	the
O	tallest
O	vessels
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	after
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	fleet
O	,
O	and
O	three
O	thousand
O	seamen
O	,
O	under
O	the
O	command
O	of
O	the
O	vice-admiral
O	.
O	This
O	fleet
O	sailed
O	round
O	,
O	while
O	I
O	went
O	back
O	the
O	shortest
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	coast
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	first
O	discovered
O	the
O	boat;
O	I
O	found
O	the
O	tide
O	had
O	driven
O	it
O	still
O	nearer
O	.
O	The
O	seamen
O	were
O	all
O	provided
O	with
O	cordage
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	beforehand
O	twisted
O	to
O	a
O	sufficient
O	strength
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	ships
O	came
O	up
O	,
O	I
O	stripped
O	myself
O	,
O	and
O	waded
O	till
O	I
O	came
O	within
O	an
O	hundred
O	yards
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	after
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	swim
O	till
O	I
O	got
O	up
O	to
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	seamen
O	threw
O	me
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	cord
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	fastened
O	to
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	fore-
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	end
O	to
O	a
O	man-of-war
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	found
O	all
O	my
O	labor
O	to
O	little
O	purpose;
O	for
O	,
O	being
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	depth
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	work
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	necessity
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	swim
O	behind
O	,
O	and
O	push
O	the
O	boat
O	forwards
O	as
O	often
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	with
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	hands;
O	and
O	,
O	the
O	tide
O	favoring
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	advanced
O	so
O	far
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	just
O	hold
O	up
O	my
O	chin
O	and
O	feel
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	I
O	rested
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	minutes
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	gave
O	the
O	boat
O	another
O	shove
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	on
O	,
O	till
O	the
O	sea
O	was
O	no
O	higher
O	than
O	my
O	arm-pits;
O	and
O	now
O	,
O	the
O	most
O	laborious
O	part
O	being
O	over
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	out
O	my
O	other
O	cables
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	stowed
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	ships
O	,
O	and
O	fastened
O	them
O	first
O	to
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	nine
O	of
O	the
O	vessels
O	which
O	attended
O	me;
O	the
O	wind
O	being
O	favorable
O	,
O	the
O	seamen
O	towed
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	shoved
O	till
O	we
O	arrived
O	within
O	forty
O	yards
O	of
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	waiting
O	till
O	the
O	tide
O	was
O	out
O	,
O	I
O	got
O	dry
O	to
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	assistance
O	of
O	two
O	thousand
O	men
O	,
O	with
O	ropes
O	,
O	and
O	engines
O	,
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	shift
O	to
O	turn
O	it
O	on
O	its
O	bottom
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	was
O	but
O	little
O	damaged
O	.
O	I
O	shall
O	not
O	trouble
O	the
O	reader
O	with
O	the
O	difficulties
O	I
O	was
O	under
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	certain
O	paddles
O	,
O	which
O	cost
O	me
O	ten
O	days
O	making
O	,
O	to
O	get
O	my
O	boat
O	to
O	the
O	royal
O	port
O	of
O	Blefuscu
O	,
O	where
O	a
O	mighty
O	concourse
O	of
O	people
O	appeared
O	upon
O	my
O	arrival
O	,
O	full
O	of
O	wonder
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	so
O	prodigious
O	a
O	vessel
O	.
O	I
O	told
O	the
O	emperor
O	that
O	my
O	good
O	fortune
O	had
O	thrown
O	this
O	boat
O	in
O	my
O	way
O	,
O	to
O	carry
O	me
O	to
O	some
O	place
O	from
O	whence
O	I
O	might
O	return
O	into
O	my
O	native
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	begged
O	his
O	Majesty
O	'
O	s
O	orders
O	for
O	getting
O	materials
O	to
O	fit
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	his
O	licence
O	to
O	depart
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	after
O	some
O	kind
O	expostulations
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	pleased
O	to
O	grant
O	.
O	I
O	did
O	very
O	much
O	wonder
O	,
O	in
O	all
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	not
O	to
O	have
O	heard
O	of
O	any
O	express
O	relating
O	to
O	me
O	from
O	our
O	emperor
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	Blefuscu
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	was
O	afterwards
O	given
O	privately
O	to
O	understand
O	that
O	his
O	Imperial
O	Majesty
O	,
O	never
O	imagining
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	least
O	notice
O	of
O	his
O	designs
O	,
O	believed
O	I
O	was
O	only
O	gone
O	to
O	Blefuscu
O	,
O	in
O	performance
O	of
O	my
O	promise
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	licence
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	me
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	well
O	known
O	at
O	our
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	return
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	ceremony
O	was
O	ended
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	was
O	at
O	last
O	in
O	pain
O	at
O	my
O	long
O	absence;
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	consulting
O	with
O	the
O	treasurer
O	and
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	cabal
O	,
O	a
O	person
O	of
O	quality
O	was
O	dispatched
O	with
O	the
O	copy
O	of
O	the
O	articles
O	against
O	me
O	.
O	This
O	envoy
O	had
O	instructions
O	to
O	represent
O	to
O	the
O	monarch
O	of
O	Blefuscu
O	the
O	great
O	lenity
O	of
O	his
O	master
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	content
O	to
O	punish
O	me
O	no
O	further
O	than
O	with
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	my
O	eyes;
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	fled
O	from
O	justice
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	return
O	in
O	two
O	hours
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	deprived
O	of
O	my
O	title
O	of
O	_nardac_
O	,
O	and
O	declared
O	a
O	traitor
O	.
O	The
O	envoy
O	further
O	added
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	maintain
O	the
O	peace
O	and
O	amity
O	between
O	both
O	empires
O	,
O	his
O	master
O	expected
O	that
O	his
O	brother
O	of
O	Blefuscu
O	would
O	give
O	orders
O	to
O	have
O	me
O	sent
O	back
O	to
O	Lilliput
O	,
O	bound
O	hand
O	and
O	foot
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	punished
O	as
O	a
O	traitor
O	.
O	The
O	Emperor
O	of
O	Blefuscu
O	,
O	having
O	taken
O	three
O	days
O	to
O	consult
O	,
O	returned
O	an
O	answer
O	,
O	consisting
O	of
O	many
O	civilities
O	and
O	excuses
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	that
O	as
O	for
O	sending
O	me
O	bound
O	,
O	his
O	brother
O	knew
O	it
O	was
O	impossible;
O	that
O	although
O	I
O	had
O	deprived
O	him
O	of
O	his
O	fleet
O	,
O	yet
O	he
O	owed
O	great
O	obligations
O	to
O	me
O	for
O	many
O	good
O	offices
O	I
O	had
O	done
O	him
O	in
O	making
O	the
O	peace;
O	that
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	both
O	their
O	Majesties
O	would
O	soon
O	be
O	made
O	easy;
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	found
O	a
O	prodigious
O	vessel
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	able
O	to
O	carry
O	me
O	on
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	orders
O	to
O	fit
O	up
O	with
O	my
O	own
O	assistance
O	and
O	direction;
O	and
O	he
O	hoped
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	weeks
O	,
O	both
O	empires
O	would
O	be
O	freed
O	from
O	so
O	insupportable
O	an
O	encumbrance
O	.
O	With
O	this
O	answer
O	the
O	envoy
O	returned
O	to
O	Lilliput
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	monarch
O	of
O	Blefuscu
O	related
O	to
O	me
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	passed;
O	offering
O	me
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	(
O	but
O	under
O	the
O	strictest
O	confidence
O	)
O	his
O	gracious
O	protection
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	would
O	continue
O	in
O	his
O	service;
O	wherein
O	,
O	although
O	I
O	believed
O	him
O	sincere
O	,
O	yet
O	I
O	resolved
O	never
O	more
O	to
O	put
O	any
O	confidence
O	in
O	princes
O	or
O	ministers
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	could
O	possibly
O	avoid
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	due
O	acknowledgments
O	for
O	his
O	favorable
O	intentions
O	,
O	I
O	humbly
O	begged
O	to
O	be
O	excused
O	.
O	I
O	told
O	him
O	,
O	that
O	since
O	fortune
O	,
O	whether
O	good
O	or
O	evil
O	,
O	had
O	thrown
O	a
O	vessel
O	in
O	my
O	way
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	resolved
O	to
O	venture
O	myself
O	on
O	the
O	ocean
O	rather
O	than
O	be
O	an
O	occasion
O	of
O	difference
O	between
O	two
O	such
O	mighty
O	monarchs
O	.
O	Neither
O	did
O	I
O	find
O	the
O	emperor
O	at
O	all
O	displeased
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	discovered
O	,
O	by
O	a
O	certain
O	accident
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	glad
O	of
O	my
O	resolution
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	were
O	most
O	of
O	his
O	ministers
O	.
O	These
O	considerations
O	moved
O	me
O	to
O	hasten
O	my
O	departure
O	somewhat
O	sooner
O	than
O	I
O	intended;
O	to
O	which
O	the
O	court
O	,
O	impatient
O	to
O	have
O	me
O	gone
O	,
O	very
O	readily
O	contributed
O	.
O	Five
O	hundred
O	workmen
O	were
O	employed
O	to
O	make
O	two
O	sails
O	to
O	my
O	boat
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	my
O	directions
O	,
O	by
O	quilting
O	thirteen
O	folds
O	of
O	their
O	strongest
O	linen
O	together
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	pains
O	of
O	making
O	ropes
O	and
O	cables
O	by
O	twisting
O	ten
O	,
O	twenty
O	,
O	or
O	thirty
O	of
O	the
O	thickest
O	and
O	strongest
O	of
O	theirs
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	stone
O	that
O	I
O	happened
O	to
O	find
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	long
O	search
O	by
O	the
O	sea-shore
O	,
O	served
O	me
O	for
O	an
O	anchor
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	tallow
O	of
O	three
O	hundred
O	cows
O	for
O	greasing
O	my
O	boat
O	and
O	other
O	uses
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	at
O	incredible
O	pains
O	in
O	cutting
O	down
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	largest
O	timber-trees
O	for
O	oars
O	and
O	masts
O	,
O	wherein
O	I
O	was
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	much
O	assisted
O	by
O	his
O	Majesty
O	'
O	s
O	ship-carpenters
O	,
O	who
O	helped
O	me
O	in
O	smoothing
O	them
O	after
O	I
O	had
O	done
O	the
O	rough
O	work
O	.
O	In
O	about
O	a
O	month
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	was
O	prepared
O	,
O	I
O	sent
O	to
O	receive
O	his
O	Majesty
O	'
O	s
O	commands
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	take
O	my
O	leave
O	.
O	The
O	emperor
O	and
O	royal
O	family
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	palace;
O	I
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	my
O	face
O	to
O	kiss
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	very
O	graciously
O	gave
O	me;
O	so
O	did
O	the
O	empress
O	,
O	and
O	young
O	princes
O	of
O	the
O	blood
O	.
O	His
O	Majesty
O	presented
O	me
O	with
O	fifty
O	purses
O	of
O	two
O	hundred
O	_sprugs_
O	apiece
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	his
O	picture
O	at
O	full
O	length
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	put
O	immediately
O	into
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	gloves
O	,
O	to
O	keep
O	it
O	from
O	being
O	hurt
O	.
O	The
O	ceremonies
O	at
O	my
O	departure
O	were
O	too
O	many
O	to
O	trouble
O	the
O	reader
O	with
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	.
O	I
O	stored
O	the
O	boat
O	with
O	the
O	carcases
O	of
O	an
O	hundred
O	oxen
O	,
O	and
O	three
O	hundred
O	sheep
O	,
O	with
O	bread
O	and
O	drink
O	proportionable
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	much
O	meat
O	ready
O	dressed
O	as
O	four
O	hundred
O	cooks
O	could
O	provide
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	with
O	me
O	six
O	cows
O	and
O	two
O	bulls
O	alive
O	,
O	with
O	as
O	many
O	ewes
O	and
O	rams
O	,
O	intending
O	to
O	carry
O	them
O	into
O	my
O	own
O	country
O	and
O	propagate
O	the
O	breed
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	to
O	feed
O	them
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	good
O	bundle
O	of
O	hay
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	bag
O	of
O	corn
O	.
O	I
O	would
O	gladly
O	have
O	taken
O	a
O	dozen
O	of
O	the
O	natives
O	,
O	but
O	this
O	was
O	a
O	thing
O	the
O	emperor
O	would
O	by
O	no
O	means
O	permit;
O	and
O	,
O	besides
O	a
O	diligent
O	search
O	into
O	my
O	pockets
O	,
O	his
O	Majesty
O	engaged
O	my
O	honor
O	not
O	to
O	carry
O	away
O	any
O	of
O	his
O	subjects
O	,
O	although
O	with
O	their
O	own
O	consent
O	and
O	desire
O	.
O	Having
O	thus
O	prepared
O	all
O	things
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	able
O	,
O	I
O	set
O	sail
O	on
O	the
O	twenty-fourth
O	day
O	of
O	September
O	,
O	1701
O	,
O	at
O	six
O	in
O	the
O	morning;
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	had
O	gone
O	about
O	four
O	leagues
O	to
O	the
O	northward
O	,
O	the
O	wind
O	being
O	at
O	southeast
O	,
O	at
O	six
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	I
O	descried
O	a
O	small
O	island
O	about
O	half
O	a
O	league
O	to
O	the
O	northwest
O	.
O	I
O	advanced
O	forward
O	,
O	and
O	cast
O	anchor
O	on
O	the
O	lee-side
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	which
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	uninhabited
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	took
O	some
O	refreshment
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	my
O	rest
O	.
O	I
O	slept
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	conjecture
O	at
O	least
O	six
O	hours
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	found
O	the
O	day
O	broke
O	in
O	two
O	hours
O	after
O	I
O	awaked
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	clear
O	night
O	.
O	I
O	ate
O	my
O	breakfast
O	before
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	up;
O	and
O	heaving
O	anchor
O	,
O	the
O	wind
O	being
O	favorable
O	,
O	I
O	steered
O	the
O	same
O	course
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	done
O	the
O	day
O	before
O	,
O	wherein
O	I
O	was
O	directed
O	by
O	my
O	pocket-
O	compass
O	.
O	My
O	intention
O	was
O	to
O	reach
O	,
O	if
O	possible
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	those
O	islands
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	reason
O	to
O	believe
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	northeast
O	of
O	Van
O	Diemen
O	'
O	s
O	Land
O	.
O	I
O	discovered
O	nothing
O	all
O	that
O	day;
O	but
O	upon
O	the
O	next
O	,
O	about
O	three
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	had
O	by
O	my
O	computation
O	made
O	twenty-four
O	leagues
O	from
O	Blefuscu
O	,
O	I
O	descried
O	a
O	sail
O	steering
O	to
O	the
O	southeast;
O	my
O	course
O	was
O	due
O	east
O	.
O	I
O	hailed
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	get
O	no
O	answer;
O	yet
O	I
O	found
O	I
O	gained
O	upon
O	her
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	wind
O	slackened
O	.
O	I
O	made
O	all
O	the
O	sail
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	she
O	spied
O	me
O	,
O	then
O	hung
O	out
O	her
O	ancient
O	,
O	and
O	discharged
O	a
O	gun
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	not
O	easy
O	to
O	express
O	the
O	joy
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	upon
O	the
O	unexpected
O	hope
O	of
O	once
O	more
O	seeing
O	my
O	beloved
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dear
O	pledges
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	in
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	ship
O	slackened
O	her
O	sails
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	came
O	up
O	with
O	her
O	between
O	five
O	and
O	six
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	,
O	September
O	26th;
O	but
O	my
O	heart
O	leaped
O	within
O	me
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	English
O	colors
O	.
O	I
O	put
O	my
O	cows
O	and
O	sheep
O	into
O	my
O	coat-pockets
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	on
O	board
O	with
O	all
O	my
O	little
O	cargo
O	of
O	provisions
O	.
O	The
O	vessel
O	was
O	an
O	English
O	merchantman
O	,
O	returning
O	from
O	Japan
O	by
O	the
O	north
O	and
O	south
O	seas;
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	John
O	Biddel
O	of
O	Deptford
O	,
O	a
O	very
O	civil
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	excellent
O	sailor
O	.
O	We
O	were
O	now
O	in
O	the
O	latitude
O	of
O	30
O	degrees
O	south;
O	there
O	were
O	about
O	fifty
O	men
O	in
O	the
O	ship;
O	and
O	here
O	I
O	met
O	an
O	old
O	comrade
O	of
O	mine
O	,
O	one
O	Peter
O	Williams
O	,
O	who
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	good
O	character
O	to
O	the
O	captain
O	.
O	This
O	gentleman
O	treated
O	me
O	with
O	kindness
O	,
O	and
O	desired
O	I
O	would
O	let
O	him
O	know
O	what
O	place
O	I
O	came
O	from
O	last
O	and
O	whither
O	I
O	was
O	bound;
O	which
O	I
O	did
O	in
O	few
O	words
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	thought
O	I
O	was
O	raving
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	dangers
O	I
O	underwent
O	had
O	disturbed
O	my
O	head;
O	whereupon
O	I
O	took
O	my
O	black
O	cattle
O	and
O	sheep
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	pocket
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	after
O	great
O	astonishment
O	,
O	clearly
O	convinced
O	him
O	of
O	my
O	veracity
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	showed
O	him
O	the
O	gold
O	given
O	me
O	by
O	the
O	Emperor
O	of
O	Blefuscu
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	his
O	Majesty
O	'
O	s
O	picture
O	at
O	full
O	length
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	other
O	rarities
O	of
O	that
O	country
O	.
O	I
O	gave
O	him
O	two
O	purses
O	of
O	two
O	hundred
O	_sprugs_
O	each
O	,
O	and
O	promised
O	,
O	when
O	we
O	arrived
O	in
O	England
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	a
O	present
O	of
O	a
O	cow
O	and
O	a
O	sheep
O	.
O	I
O	shall
O	not
O	trouble
O	the
O	reader
O	with
O	a
O	particular
O	account
O	of
O	this
O	voyage
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	very
O	prosperous
O	for
O	the
O	most
O	part
O	.
O	We
O	arrived
O	in
O	the
O	Downs
O	on
O	the
O	13th
O	of
O	April
O	,
O	1702
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	only
O	one
O	misfortune
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	rats
O	on
O	board
O	carried
O	away
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	sheep;
O	I
O	found
O	her
O	bones
O	in
O	a
O	hole
O	,
O	picked
O	clean
O	from
O	the
O	flesh
O	.
O	The
O	rest
O	of
O	my
O	cattle
O	I
O	got
O	safe
O	ashore
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	them
O	a-grazing
O	in
O	a
O	bowling-
O	green
O	at
O	Greenwich
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	fineness
O	of
O	the
O	grass
O	made
O	them
O	feed
O	very
O	heartily
O	,
O	though
O	I
O	had
O	always
O	feared
O	the
O	contrary
O	:
O	neither
O	could
O	I
O	possibly
O	have
O	preserved
O	them
O	in
O	so
O	long
O	a
O	voyage
O	if
O	the
O	captain
O	had
O	not
O	allowed
O	me
O	some
O	of
O	his
O	best
O	biscuit
O	,
O	which
O	rubbed
O	to
O	powder
O	,
O	and
O	mingled
O	with
O	water
O	,
O	was
O	their
O	constant
O	food
O	.
O	The
O	short
O	time
O	I
O	continued
O	in
O	England
O	,
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	considerable
O	profit
O	by
O	showing
O	my
O	cattle
O	to
O	many
O	persons
O	of
O	quality
O	and
O	others
O	:
O	and
O	,
O	before
O	I
O	began
O	my
O	second
O	voyage
O	,
O	I
O	sold
O	them
O	for
O	six
O	hundred
O	pounds
O	.
O	Since
O	my
O	last
O	return
O	,
O	I
O	find
O	the
O	breed
O	is
O	considerably
O	increased
O	,
O	especially
O	the
O	sheep
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	hope
O	will
O	prove
O	much
O	to
O	the
O	advantage
O	of
O	the
O	woollen
O	manufacture
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	fineness
O	of
O	the
O	fleeces
O	.
O	I
O	stayed
O	but
O	two
O	months
O	with
O	my
O	wife
O	and
O	family;
O	for
O	my
O	insatiable
O	desire
O	of
O	seeing
O	foreign
O	countries
O	would
O	suffer
O	me
O	to
O	continue
O	no
O	longer
O	.
O	I
O	left
O	fifteen
O	hundred
O	pounds
O	with
O	my
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	fixed
O	her
O	in
O	a
O	good
O	house
O	at
O	Redriff
O	.
O	My
O	remaining
O	stock
O	I
O	carried
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	part
O	in
O	money
O	and
O	part
O	in
O	goods
O	,
O	in
O	hopes
O	to
O	improve
O	my
O	fortunes
O	.
O	My
O	eldest
O	uncle
O	John
O	had
O	left
O	me
O	an
O	estate
O	in
O	land
O	,
O	near
O	Epping
O	,
O	of
O	about
O	thirty
O	pounds
O	a
O	year;
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	long
O	lease
O	of
O	the
O	Black
O	Bull
O	in
O	Fetter
O	Lane
O	,
O	which
O	yielded
O	me
O	as
O	much
O	more
O	:
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	in
O	any
O	danger
O	of
O	leaving
O	my
O	family
O	upon
O	the
O	parish
O	.
O	My
O	son
O	Johnny
O	,
O	named
O	so
O	after
O	his
O	uncle
O	,
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	grammar
O	school
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	cowardly
O	child
O	.
O	My
O	daughter
O	Betty
O	(
O	who
O	is
O	now
O	well
O	married
O	,
O	and
O	has
O	children
O	)
O	was
O	then
O	at
O	her
O	needlework
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	leave
O	of
O	my
O	wife
O	and
O	boy
O	and
O	girl
O	,
O	with
O	tears
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	Adventure
O	,
O	a
O	merchant
O	ship
O	,
O	of
O	three
O	hundred
O	tons
O	,
O	bound
O	for
O	Surat
O	,
O	Captain
O	John
O	Nicholas
O	of
O	Liverpool
O	,
O	commander
O	.
