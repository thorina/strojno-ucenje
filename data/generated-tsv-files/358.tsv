O	he
O	has
O	to
O	lose
O	his
O	head
O	!
O	Make
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	me
O	take
O	your

O	``
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	Luck
O	entered
O	Vanek
O	,
O	the
O	executioners
O	sword
O	broke
O	against
O	the
O	scaffold
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	if
O	some
O	one
O	had
O	snapped
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	before
O	they
O	brought
O	him
O	another
O	,
O	up
O	rode
O	a
O	trumpeter
O	on
O	horseback
O	from
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	galloping
O	as
O	swift
O	as
O	a
O	bird
O	,
O	trumpeted
O	merrily
O	,
O	and
O	waved
O	a
O	white
O	flag
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	him
O	came
O	the
O	royal
O	carriage
O	for
O	Vanek
O	.
O	This
O	is
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	:
O	The
O	princess
O	had
O	told
O	her
O	father
O	at
O	home
O	that
O	Vanek
O	had
O	but
O	spoken
O	the
O	truth
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	word
O	ought
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	broken
O	.
O	If
O	Vanek
O	were
O	of
O	mean
O	lineage
O	the
O	king
O	could
O	easily
O	make
O	him
O	a
O	prince
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	You
O	'
O	re
O	right
O	;
O	let
O	him
O	be
O	a
O	prince
O	!
O	``
O	The
O	royal
O	carriage
O	was
O	immediately
O	sent
O	for
O	Vanek
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	councillor
O	who
O	had
O	irritated
O	the
O	king
O	against
O	him
O	was
O	executed
O	in
O	his
O	stead
O	.
O	Afterward
O	,
O	when
O	Vanek
O	and
O	the
O	princess
O	were
O	going
O	together
O	in
O	a
O	carriage
O	from
O	the
O	wedding
O	,
O	Intelligence
O	happened
O	to
O	be
O	somewhere
O	on
O	the
O	road
O	,
O	and
O	seeing
O	that
O	he
O	couldn
O	'
O	t
O	help
O	meeting
O	Luck
O	,
O	bent
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	slipped
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	if
O	cold
O	water
O	had
O	been
O	thrown
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	from
O	that
O	time
O	forth
O	it
O	is
O	said
O	that
O	Intelligence
O	has
O	always
O	given
O	a
O	wide
O	berth
O	to
O	Luck
O	whenever
O	he
O	has
O	had
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	.
