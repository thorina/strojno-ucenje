O	He

O	.
O	He
O	played
O	a

O	,
O	and
O	the

O	sprang
O	up
O	in
O	full

O	of
O	the
O	lilt
O	he
O	played
O	.
O	He
O	played
O	a
O	war-march
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	afar
O	off
O	,
O	the
O	sleeping
O	tyrants
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	sprang
O	up
O	,
O	wide
O	awake
O	,
O	and
O	bared
O	their
O	angry
O	teeth
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	untried
O	youths
O	of
O	Thrace
O	ran
O	to
O	beg
O	their
O	fathers
O	to
O	let
O	them
O	taste
O	battle
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	scarred

O	felt
O	on
O	their
O	thumbs
O	the
O	sharpness
O	of
O	their
O	sword
O	blades
O	,
O	and
O	smiled
O	,
O	well
O	content
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	played
O	it
O	would
O	seem
O	as
O	though
O	the
O	very
O	stones
O	and
O	rocks
O	gained
O	hearts
O	.
O	Nay
O	,
O	the
O	whole
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	universe
O	became
O	one
O	great
O	,
O	palpitating
O	,
O	beautiful
O	thing
O	,
O	an
O	instrument
O	from
O	whose
O	trembling
O	strings
O	was
O	drawn
O	out
O	the
O	music
O	of
O	Orpheus
O	.
O	He
O	rose
O	to
O	great
O	power
O	,
O	and
O	became
O	a
O	mighty
O	prince
O	of
O	Thrace
O	.
O	Not
O	his
O	lute
O	alone
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	himself
O	played
O	on
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	fair
O	Eurydice
O	and
O	held
O	it
O	captive
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	as
O	though
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	became
O	man
O	and
O	wife
O	,
O	all
O	happiness
O	must
O	be
O	theirs
O	.
O	But
O	although
O	Hymen
O	,
O	the
O	god
O	of
O	marriage
O	,
O	himself
O	came
O	to
O	bless
O	them
O	on
O	the
O	day
O	they
O	wed
O	,
O	the
O	omens
O	on
O	that
O	day
O	were
O	against
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	torch
O	that
O	Hymen
O	carried
O	had
O	no
O	golden
O	flame
O	,
O	but
O	sent
O	out
O	pungent
O	black
O	smoke
O	that
O	made
O	their
O	eyes
O	water
O	.
O	They
O	feared
O	they
O	knew
O	not
O	what;
O	but
O	when
O	,
O	soon
O	afterwards
O	,
O	as
O	Eurydice
O	wandered
O	with
O	the
O	nymphs
O	,
O	her
O	companions
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	blue-shadowed
O	woods
O	of
O	Thrace
O	,
O	the
O	reason
O	was
O	discovered
O	.
O	A
O	bold
O	shepherd
O	,
O	who
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	her
O	for
O	a
O	princess
O	,
O	saw
O	Eurydice
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	sooner
O	saw
O	her
O	than
O	he
O	loved
O	her
O	.
O	He
O	ran
O	after
O	her
O	to
O	proclaim
O	to
O	her
O	his
O	love
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	,
O	afraid
O	of
O	his
O	wild
O	uncouthness
O	,
O	fled
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	She
O	ran
O	,
O	in
O	her
O	terror
O	,
O	too
O	swiftly
O	to
O	watch
O	whither
O	she
O	went
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	poisonous
O	snake
O	that
O	lurked
O	amongst
O	the
O	fern
O	bit
O	the
O	fair
O	white
O	foot
O	that
O	flitted
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	butterfly
O	,
O	across
O	it
O	.
O	In
O	agonised
O	suffering
O	Eurydice
O	died
O	.
O	Her
O	spirit
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	Shades
O	,
O	and
O	Orpheus
O	was
O	left
O	broken-hearted
O	.
O	The
O	sad
O	winds
O	that
O	blow
O	at
O	night
O	across
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	the
O	sobbing
O	gales
O	that
O	tell
O	of
O	wreck
O	and
O	death
O	,
O	the
O	birds
O	that
O	wail
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
O	for
O	their
O	mates
O	,
O	the
O	sad
O	,
O	soft
O	whisper
O	of
O	the
O	aspen
O	leaves
O	and
O	the
O	leaves
O	of
O	the
O	heavy
O	clad
O	blue-black
O	cypresses
O	,
O	all
O	now
O	were
O	hushed
O	,
O	for
O	greater
O	than
O	all
O	,
O	more
O	full
O	of
O	bitter
O	sorrow
O	than
O	any
O	,
O	arose
O	the
O	music
O	of
O	Orpheus
O	,
O	a
O	long-drawn
O	sob
O	from
O	a
O	broken
O	heart
O	in
O	the
O	Valley
O	of
O	the
O	Shadow
O	of
O	Death
O	.
O	Grief
O	came
O	alike
O	to
O	gods
O	and
O	to
O	men
O	as
O	they
O	listened
O	,
O	but
O	no
O	comfort
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	expression
O	of
O	his
O	sorrow
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	when
O	to
O	bear
O	his
O	grief
O	longer
O	was
O	impossible
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	Orpheus
O	wandered
O	to
O	Olympus
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	besought
O	Zeus
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	permission
O	to
O	seek
O	his
O	wife
O	in
O	the
O	gloomy
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	Shades
O	.
O	Zeus
O	,
O	moved
O	by
O	his
O	anguish
O	,
O	granted
O	the
O	permission
O	he
O	sought
O	,
O	but
O	solemnly
O	warned
O	him
O	of
O	the
O	terrible
O	perils
O	of
O	his
O	undertaking
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	love
O	of
O	Orpheus
O	was
O	too
O	perfect
O	to
O	know
O	any
O	fear;
O	thankfully
O	he
O	hastened
O	to
O	the
O	dark
O	cave
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	promontory
O	of
O	Taenarus
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	entrance
O	of
O	Hades
O	.
O	Stark
O	and
O	grim
O	was
O	the
O	three-headed
O	watchdog
O	,
O	Cerberus
O	,
O	which
O	guarded
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	growls
O	and
O	the
O	furious
O	roaring
O	of
O	a
O	wild
O	beast
O	athirst
O	for
O	its
O	prey
O	it
O	greeted
O	Orpheus
O	.
O	But
O	Orpheus
O	touched
O	his
O	lute
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	brute
O	,
O	amazed
O	,
O	sank
O	into
O	silence
O	.
O	And
O	still
O	he
O	played
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dog
O	would
O	gently
O	have
O	licked
O	the
O	player
O	'
O	s
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	up
O	in
O	his
O	face
O	with
O	its
O	savage
O	eyes
O	full
O	of
O	the
O	light
O	that
O	we
O	see
O	in
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	the
O	dogs
O	of
O	this
O	earth
O	as
O	they
O	gaze
O	with
O	love
O	at
O	their
O	masters
O	.
O	On
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	strode
O	Orpheus
O	,
O	playing
O	still
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	melody
O	he
O	drew
O	from
O	his
O	lute
O	passed
O	before
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	realms
O	of
O	Pluto
O	.
O	Surely
O	never
O	were
O	heard
O	such
O	strains
O	.
O	They
O	told
O	of
O	perfect
O	,
O	tender
O	love
O	,
O	of
O	unending
O	longing
O	,
O	of
O	pain
O	too
O	great
O	to
O	end
O	with
O	death
O	.
O	Of
O	all
O	the
O	beauties
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	they
O	sang--of
O	the
O	sorrow
O	of
O	the
O	world--of
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	'
O	s
O	desire--of
O	things
O	past--of
O	things
O	to
O	come
O	.
O	And
O	ever
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	song
O	that
O	the
O	lute
O	sang
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	thread
O	of
O	silver
O	that
O	is
O	woven
O	in
O	a
O	black
O	velvet
O	pall
O	,
O	a
O	limpid
O	melody
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	as
O	though
O	a
O	bird
O	sang
O	in
O	the
O	mirk
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	spoke
O	of
O	peace
O	and
O	of
O	hope
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	joy
O	that
O	knows
O	no
O	ending
O	.
O	Into
O	the
O	blackest
O	depths
O	of
O	Hades
O	the
O	sounds
O	sped
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	Time
O	stood
O	still
O	.
O	From
O	his
O	bitter
O	task
O	of
O	trying
O	to
O	quaff
O	the
O	stream
O	that
O	ever
O	receded
O	from
O	the
O	parched
O	and
O	burning
