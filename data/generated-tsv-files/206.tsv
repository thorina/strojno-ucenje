O	a

O	of
O	great
O	sense
O	,
O	he
O	spared
O	no
O	expense
O	for
O	their
O	education
O	,
O	but
O	provided
O	them
O	with
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	masters
O	for
O	their
O	improvement
O	.
O	The
O	three
O	daughters
O	were
O	all
O	handsome
O	,
O	but
O	particularly
O	the
O	youngest
O	:
O	indeed
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	very
O	beautiful
O	that
O	in
O	her
O	childhood
O	every
O	one
O	called
O	her
O	the
O	Little
O	Beauty
O	,
O	and
O	being
O	still
O	the
O	same
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	grown
O	up
O	,
O	nobody
O	called
O	her
O	by
O	any
O	other
O	name
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	her
O	sisters
O	very

O	This

O	more

O	than
O	her

O	The

O	thought
O	below

O	gave

O	went
O	every

O	to
O	balls

O	plays
O	,

O	public
