O	WHERE
O	WE
O	TOLD
O	THE
O	SECOND
O	TALE
O	SUMMER
O	there
O	had
O	been
O	none
O	.
O	Autumn
O	was
O	a
O	mockery
O	.
O	The
O	golden
O	harvest
O	fields
O	lay
O	prostrate
O	under
O	drenching
O	floods
O	of
O	rain
O	.
O	Every
O	burn
O	foamed
O	creamy
O	white
O	in
O	the
O	linns
O	and
O	sulked
O	peaty
O	brown
O	in
O	the
O	pools
O	.
O	The
O	heather
O	,
O	rich
O	in
O	this
O	our
O	Galloway
O	as
O	an
O	emperor
O	'
O	s
O	robe
O	,
O	had
O	scarce
O	bloomed
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	The
O	very
O	bees
O	went
O	hungry
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	lashing
O	rain
O	had
O	washed
O	all
O	the
O	honey
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	purple
O	bells
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	we
O	were
O	again
O	in
O	Galloway
O	--
O	that
O	is
O	,
O	the
O	teller
O	of
O	tales
O	and
O	his
O	little
O	congregation
O	of
O	four
O	.
O	The
O	country
O	of
O	_Guy
O	Mannering_
O	spread
O	about
O	us
O	,
O	even
O	though
O	we
O	could
O	scarce
O	see
O	a
O	hundred
O	yards
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	children
O	flattened
O	their
O	noses
O	against
O	the
O	blurred
O	window-panes
O	to
O	look
O	.
O	Their
O	eyes
O	watered
O	with
O	the
O	keen
O	tang
O	of
O	the
O	peat
O	reek
O	,
O	till
O	,
O	tired
O	with
O	watching
O	the
O	squattering
O	of
O	ducks
O	in
O	farm
O	puddles
O	,
O	they
O	turned
O	as
O	usual
O	upon
O	the
O	family
O	sagaman
O	,
O	and
O	demanded
O	,
O	with
O	that
O	militant
O	assurance
O	of
O	youth
O	which
O	succeeds
O	so
O	often
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	forthwith
O	and
O	immediately
O	``
O	tell
O	them
O	something
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	tales
O	from
O	_Waverley_
O	had
O	proved
O	so
O	enthralling
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	general
O	demand
O	for
O	``
O	another
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	Sir
O	Toady
O	Lion
O	,
O	being
O	of
O	an
O	arithmetical
O	turn
O	of
O	mind
O	,
O	proclaimed
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	plenty
O	of
O	material
O	,
O	in
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	counted
O	no
O	fewer
O	than
O	twenty-four
O	``
O	all
O	the
O	same
O	``
O	upon
O	the
O	shelf
O	before
O	he
O	left
O	home
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	encouraged
O	by
O	the
O	dashing
O	rain
O	on
O	the
O	windows
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	low
O	continual
O	growl
O	of
O	Solway
O	surf
O	in
O	our
O	ears
O	,
O	we
O	bent
O	ourselves
O	to
O	fill
O	a
O	gap
O	in
O	a
O	hopeless
O	day
O	by
O	the
O	retelling
O	of
