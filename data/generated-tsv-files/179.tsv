O	,

O	for
O	the

O	Horn

O	gone
O	into

O	--
O	could

O	sent
O	Horn
O	away
O	in
O	anger
O	seven
O	years
O	ago
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	begged
O	Horn
O	to
O	stay
O	at
O	his
O	court
O	and
O	wed
O	Rimenhild

O	Aylmer
O	could

O	gainsay
O	Horn
O	in

O	purpose
O	,
O	and
O	once
O	more
O	Horn
O	set
O	out
O	on
O	his
O	wanderings
O	.
O	With
O	him
O	went
O	Sir
O	Athulf
O	and
O	a
O	band
O	of
O	brave
O	knights
O	.
O	They
O	took
O	ship
O	and
O	for
O	five
O	days
O	sailed
O	the
O	sea
O	with
O	a
O	favouring
O	wind

O	at
O	last
O	,
O	late
O	at

O	on
O	the
O	fifth
O	day
O	,

O	to
O	the
O	shores

O	Suddenne
O	.
O	Horn
O	and
O	Athulf
O	landed
O	,
O	to
O	spy
O	out
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	A
O	little
O	way
O	inland
O	they
O	came
O	upon
O	an
O	old
O	knight
O	sleeping
O	by
O	the
O	wayside
O	;
O	on
O	his
O	shield
O	was
O	the
O	device
O	of
O	a

O	woke

O	gently
O	.

O	me
O	,
O	sir
O	knight

O	``
O	he
O	asked
O	.
O	``
O	Your
O	shield
O	shows
O	that

O	a
O	Christian
O	;

O	``
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	a
O	Christian
O	,
O	truly
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the

O	knight
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	I
O	serve
O	the

O	hold
O	the

O	I
O	must

O	for

O	against

O	This

O	If
O	King
O	Murry
O	'

O	,
O	Horn
O	,
O	were
O	here
O	,

O	is
O	;
O	for
O	Athulf
O	,
O	my
O	son
O	,
O	was
O	Horn
O	'
O	s
O	dearest
O	companion
O	.
O	``
O	Such
O	changes
O	had
O	the
O	long
O	absence
O	wrought
O	in
O	Horn
O	and
O	Athulf
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	knight
O	that
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	recognise
O	one
O	another
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	these
O	words
O	Horn
O	and
O	Athulf
O	knew
O	for
O	certain
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	indeed
O	in
O	Suddenne
O	.
O	They
O	told
O	the
O	old
O	knight
O	who
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	and
O	learnt
O	that
O	Horn
O	'
O	s
O	mother
O	,
O	the
O	Queen
O	Godhild
O	,
O	was
O	still
O	alive
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	knights
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	besides
O	,
O	desirous
O	of
O	driving
O	the
O	Saracens
O	out
O	,
O	but
O	unable
O	to
O	fulfil
O	their
O	desire
O	through
O	lack
O	of
O	a
O	leader
O	and
O	of
O	men
O	.
O	Horn
O	forthwith
O	summoned
O	his
O	men
O	from
O	the
O	ships
O	,
O	and
O	blew
O	his
O	trumpet
O	for
O	battle
O	,
O	and
O	attacked
O	the
O	Saracens
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	fight
O	,
O	but
O	before
O	long
O	the
O	heathen
O	were
O	defeated
O	,
O	and
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	not
O	slain
O	were
O	driven
O	altogether
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	Thus
O	Horn
O	came
O	into
O	his
O	kingdom
O	again
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	yet
O	to
O	punish
O	Fikenhild
O	the
O	traitor
O	,
O	who
O	first
O	separated
O	him
O	from
O	Rimenhild
O	(
O	for
O	this
O	Aylmer
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	)
O	,
O	and
O	King
O	Modi
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	sought
O	to
O	wed
O	her
O	against
O	her
O	will
O	.
O	Fikenhild
O	,
O	when
O	Horn
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	Westerness
O	in
O	time
O	to
O	save
O	Rimenhild
O	from
O	Modi
O	,
O	had
O	fled
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	still
O	plotted
O	deep
O	treachery
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	By
O	bribes
O	and
O	favours
O	he
O	won
O	many
O	knights
O	to
O	follow
O	him
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	built
O	himself
O	a
O	great
O	castle
O	of
O	stone
O	,
O	set
O	on
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	surrounded
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	with
O	water
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	none
O	could
O	come
O	at
O	it
O	easily
O	.
O	Then
O	by
O	stealth
O	one
O	night
O	he
O	carried
O	off
O	Rimenhild
O	,
O	and
O	married
O	her
O	in
O	this
O	castle
O	,
O	holding
O	a
O	great
O	feast
O	at
O	sunrise
O	to
O	celebrate
O	the
O	marriage
O	.
O	Horn
O	knew
O	nought
O	of
O	this
O	by
O	word
O	of
O	mouth
O	or
O	letter
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	a
O	dream
O	he
O	beheld
O	Rimenhild
O	:
O	she
O	seemed
O	to
O	him
O	as
O	though
O	shipwrecked
O	,
O	calling
O	upon
O	his
O	name
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	she
O	tried
O	to
O	swim
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	Fikenhild
O	appeared
O	and
O	prevented
O	her
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	awoke
O	,
O	Horn
O	told
O	Athulf
O	this
O	vision
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	thought
O	upon
O	the
O	lore
O	of
O	dreams
O	,
O	they
O	agreed
O	that
O	it
O	meant
O	that
O	Rimenhild
O	was
O	in
O	Fikenhild
O	'
O	s
O	sea-girt
O	castle
O	,
O	the
O	fame
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	known
O	to
O	all
O	men
O	.
O	Straightway
O	they
O	took
O	a
O	ship
O	and
O	sailed
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	hard
O	by
O	where
O	the
O	castle
O	lay
O	.
O	There
O	a
O	certain
O	knight
O	named
O	Arnoldin
O	,
O	cousin
O	of
O	Athulf
O	,
O	met
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	that
O	Fikenhild
O	had
O	just
O	wedded
O	Rimenhild
O	,
O	arid
O	the
O	wedding-feast
O	was
O	now
O	beginning
O	.
O	They
O	could
O	not
O	come
O	nigh
O	the
O	castle
O	openly
O	as
O	enemies
O	,
O	for
O	none
O	could
O	approach
O	it
O	across
O	the
O	water
O	unless
O	those
O	within
O	were
O	willing
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	enter
O	.
O	But
O	Horn
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	his
O	knights
O	disguised
O	themselves
O	as
O	harpers
O	,
O	hiding
O	their
O	swords
O	under
O	long
O	cloaks
O	.
O	They
O	took
O	a
O	boat
O	and
O	rowed
O	under
O	the
O	walls
O	of
O	the
O	banqueting-hall
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	they
O	played
O	and
O	sang
O	merrily
O	,
O	till
O	Fikenhild
O	heard
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	them
O	in
O	to
O	the
O	feast
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	into
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	again
O	,
O	at
O	Fikenhild
O	'
O	s
O	bidding
O	.
O	But
O	soon
O	Horn
O	looked
O	once
O	more
O	upon
O	his
O	ring
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	shout
O	,
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	companions
O	fell
O	upon
O	Fikenhild
O	and
O	his
O	men
O	and
O	slew
O	every
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	tale
O	is
O	soon
O	told
O	.
O	Horn
O	made
O	Arnoldin
O	king
O	in
O	Fikenhild
O	'
O	s
O	castle
O	.
O	Athulf
O	he
O	sent
O	to
O	Thurston
O	'
O	s
O	court
O	,
O	where
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	he
O	married
O	the
O	princess
O	Reynild
O	;
O	and
O	Horn
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Suddenne
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	made
O	Rimenhild
O	his
O	queen
O	.
O	Long
O	and
O	happily
O	they
O	reigned
O	in
O	true
O	love
O	and
O	in
O	fear
O	of
O	God
O	.
