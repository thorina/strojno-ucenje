O	I
O	had
O	married
O	a
O	lady
O	of
O	great
O	beauty
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	having
O	heard
O	of
O	my
O	sporting
O	exploits
O	,
O	desired
O	,
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	after
O	our
O	marriage
O	,
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	with
O	me
O	on
O	a
O	shooting
O	expedition
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	in
O	front
O	to
O	start
O	something
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	soon
O	saw
O	my
O	dog
O	stop
O	before
O	several
O	hundred
O	coveys
O	of
O	partridges
O	.
O	I
O	waited
O	for
O	my
O	wife
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	following
O	me
O	with
O	my
O	lieutenant
O	and
O	a
O	servant
O	.
O	I
O	waited
O	a
O	long
O	time;
O	nobody
O	came
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	very
O	uneasy
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	half-way
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	my
O	wife
O	,
O	I
O	heard
O	lamentable
O	groans
O	.
O	They
O	seemed
O	quite
O	near
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	I
O	could
O	see
O	no
O	trace
O	of
O	a
O	human
O	being
O	.
O	I
O	jumped
O	off
O	my
O	horse;
O	I
O	put
O	my
O	ear
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	only
O	heard
O	the
O	groans
O	distinctly
O	rising
O	from
O	beneath
O	,
O	but
O	my
O	wife
O	'
O	s
O	voice
O	and
O	those
O	of
O	my
O	lieutenant
O	and
O	servant
O	.
O	I
O	remarked
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	,
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	spot
O	,
O	the
O	shaft
O	of
O	a
O	coal-pit
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	doubt
O	that
O	my
O	wife
O	and
O	her
O	unfortunate
O	companions
O	had
O	been
O	swallowed
O	up
O	in
O	it
O	.
O	I
O	rode
O	full
O	speed
O	to
O	the
O	nearest
O	village
O	to
O	fetch
O	the
O	miners
O	,
O	who
O	after
O	great
O	efforts
O	succeeded
O	in
O	drawing
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	individuals
O	buried
O	in
O	the
O	pit--which
O	measured
O	ninety
O	feet--to
O	the
O	surface
O	.
O	They
O	first
O	drew
O	up
O	the
O	man-servant;
O	then
O	his
O	horse;
O	next
O	the
O	lieutenant;
O	next
O	his
O	horse;
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	my
O	wife
O	on
O	her
O	little
O	palfrey
O	.
O	The
O	most
O	curious
O	part
O	of
O	this
O	affair
O	was
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	awful
O	depth
O	to
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	fallen
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	was
O	hurt
O	,
O	not
O	even
O	the
O	horses
O	,
O	if
O	we
O	except
O	a
O	few
O	slight
O	contusions
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	had
O	had
O	a
O	terrible
O	fright
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	quite
O	unable
O	to
O	pursue
O	our
O	intended
O	sport
O	.
O	In
O	all
O	this
O	confusion
O	I
O	quite
O	forgot
O	my
O	setter
O	,
O	as
O	no
O	doubt
O	you
O	also
O	have
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	I
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	go
O	away
O	on
O	duty
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	return
O	home
O	for
O	a
O	fortnight
O	.
O	On
O	my
O	return
O	I
O	asked
O	for
O	Diana
O	,
O	my
O	setter
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	knew
O	anything
O	about
O	her
O	.
O	My
O	servants
O	thought
O	she
O	had
O	followed
O	me
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	certainly
O	lost
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	never
O	hoped
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	again
O	!
O	At
O	length
O	a
O	bright
O	idea
O	occurred
O	to
O	me
O	:
O	""""
O	She
O	is
O	perhaps
O	still
O	watching
O	the
O	partridges
O	.
O	""""
O	I
O	hastened
O	,
O	full
O	of
O	hope
O	and
O	joy
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	spot
O	,
O	and
O	actually
O	there
O	she
O	was
O	!
O	--my
O	noble
O	Diana--on
O	the
O	very
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	her
O	a
O	fortnight
O	before
O	.
O	""""
O	Hi
O	,
O	Diana
O	!
O	""""
O	I
O	cried
O	.
O	""""
O	Seize
O	them
O	!
O	""""
O	She
O	instantly
O	sprang
O	the
O	partridges;
O	they
O	rose
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	killed
O	twenty-five
O	at
O	one
O	shot
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	poor
O	beast
O	had
O	scarcely
O	strength
O	enough
O	to
O	follow
O	me
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	thin
O	and
O	famished
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	carry
O	her
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	house
O	on
O	my
O	horse
O	,
O	where
O	rest
O	,
O	feeding
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	care
O	soon
O	restored
O	her
O	to
O	health
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	thoroughly
O	glad
O	to
O	get
O	her
O	back
O	again
O	.
