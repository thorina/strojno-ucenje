O	Ere
O	Horn
O	had
O	sailed
O	long
O	,
O	the
O	wind
O	rose
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	ship
O	drove
O	blindly
O	before
O	it
O	for
O	many
O	leagues
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	length
O	it
O	was
O	cast
O	up
O	on
O	land
O	.
O	Horn
O	stepped
O	out
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	before
O	him
O	saw
O	two
O	princes
O	,
O	whose
O	names
O	(
O	for
O	they
O	greeted
O	him
O	kindly
O	)
O	were
O	Harild
O	and
O	Berild
O	.
O	``
O	Whence
O	are
O	you
O	?
O	``
O	they
O	asked
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	who
O	they
O	were
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	are
O	you
O	called
O	?
O	``
O	Horn
O	thought
O	it
O	wise
O	to
O	hide
O	his
O	real
O	name
O	from
O	them
O	,
O	lest
O	it
O	should
O	come
O	to
O	Aylmer
O	'
O	s
O	ears
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	anger
O	reach
O	Horn
O	even
O	in
O	this
O	distant
O	land
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	called
O	Cuthbert
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	answered
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	I

O	come
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	west
O	in
O	this
O	little
O	ship
O	,
O	seeking
O	adventure
O	and
O	honour
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Well
O	met
O	,
O	sir
O	knight
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Harild
O	.
O	``
O	Come
O	now
O	to
O	our
O	father

O	knightly
O	deeds
O	in
O	his

O	.
O	``
O	They
O	led
O	him
O	to
O	King
O	Thurston
O	their
O	father
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	Thurston
O	saw
O	that
O	Horn
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	might
O	,
O	skilled
O	in
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	true
O	knight
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	his
O	service
O	readily
O	.
O	So
O	Horn
O	--
O	or
O	Cuthbert
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	knew
O	him
O	--
O	abode
O	at
O	Thurston
O	'
O	s
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	served
O	the
O	king
O	in
O	battle
O	.
O	But
O	no
O	great
O	and
O	notable
O	thing
O	befell
O	him
O	until
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	Christmas
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	King
O	Thurston
O	'
O	s
O	custom
O	to
O	make
O	each
O	Christmas
O	a
O	great
O	feast
O	,
O	lasting
O	many
O	days
O	.
O	To
O	this
O	feast
O	Horn
O	was
O	bidden
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	other
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	.
O	Great
O	mirth
O	and
O	joy
O	was
O	there
O	that
O	Yule-tide
O	;
O	all
O	men
O	feasted
O	with
O	light
O	hearts
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	about
O	noon-day
O	,
O	the
O	great
O	doors
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	hall
O	were
O	flung
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	monstrous
O	giant
O	strode
O	in
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	fully
O	armed
O	,
O	in
O	pagan
O	raiment
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	mien
O	was
O	proud
O	and
O	terrible
O	.
O	``
O	Sit
O	still
O	,
O	sir
O	king
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	roared
O	,

O	To-morrow
O	at

O	ready
O	for

O	Thereupon
O	he
O	turned
O	,

O	stalked
O	out

O	saying
O	never

O	word
O	.
O	``
O	This
O	is
O	a
O	sorry

O	said
O	King
O	Thurston
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	Saracen

O	``

O	turning
O	to
O	Horn
O	,
O	``

O	started
O	up
O	from

O	unaided
O	.
O	``
O	Thurston
O	hoped
O	little
O	of
O	this
O	plan
O	,
O	but
O	none
O	the
O	less
O	he
O	agreed
O	to
O	it
O	;

O	when
O	the
O	next

O	came
O	,
O	he
O	arose
O	betimes
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	hands
O	helped
O	to
O	arm
O	Horn
O	;
O	and
O	having
O	made
O	ready
O	,

O	rode
O	down

O	.
O	There
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	open
O	space

O	the
O	Saracen

O	by

O	the

O	.
O	They
O	made
O	little

O	fell
O	to
O	right
O	soon
O	.
O	Horn
O	dealt
O	mightily
O	with
O	the
O	giant
O	;
O	he
O	attacked
O	him
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	showered
O	blows
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	pagan
O	was
O	hard
O	pressed
O	,

O	for
O	a
O	breathing

O	.
O	``

O	ran
O	hot
O	within
O	him
O	:
O	before
O	him
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	man
O	who
O	had
O	slain
O	his
O	father
O	and
O	had
O	driven
O	himself
O	from

O	kingdom

O	He
O	fell
O	to
O	more
O	furiously
O	than
O	ever
O	,
O	and
O	drove
O	hard
O	at

O	Rimenhild
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	.
O	Therewith
O	his
O	strength
O	was
O	redoubled
O	;
O	so
O	straight
O	and
O	strong
O	was
O	the
O	blow
O	,
O	so
O	true
O	his
O	arm
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	pierced
O	the
O	giant
O	to
O	the
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	fell
O	dead
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	saw
O	their
O	champion
O	slain
O	,
O	the
O	Saracens
O	were
O	stricken
O	with
O	panic
O	.
O	They
O	turned

O	headlong
O	to
O	their
O	ships
O	,
O	Thurston

O	his
O	knights
O	pursuing
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	battle
O	was
O	fought
O	by
O	the
O	ships
O	:
O	Harild
O	and
O	Berild
O	were
O	slain
O	,
O	but
O	Horn
O	did
O	such
O	deeds
O	of
O	prowess
O	that
O	every

O	killed
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	great
O	lamentation
O	over

O	.
O	Their

O	brought
O	to
