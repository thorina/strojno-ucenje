O	It
O	was
O	the
O	feast
O	of
O	Pentecost
O	,
O	and
O	King
O	Arthur
O	was
O	holding
O	his
O	court
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	at
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Kin-Kenadon
O	,
O	hard
O	by
O	the
O	sea
O	in
O	Wales
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	high
O	hall
O	the
O	tables
O	were
O	set
O	for
O	dinner
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	floor
O	was
O	freshly
O	strewn
O	with
O	rushes
O	,
O	flowers
O	and
O	fennel
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	place
O	smelled
O	as
O	sweet
O	as
O	a
O	field
O	.
O	The
O	cook
O	and
O	his
O	scullions
O	came
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	through
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	kitchen
O	with
O	anxious
O	faces
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	feared
O	lest
O	the
O	meats
O	should
O	be
O	overdone
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	yet
O	King
O	Arthur
O	would
O	not
O	sit
O	to
O	dinner
O	.
O	For
O	it
O	was
O	his
O	custom
O	never
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	meat
O	on
O	that
O	day
O	until
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	or
O	seen
O	some
O	great
O	marvel
O	or
O	adventure
O	.
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	stood
O	looking
O	from
O	a
O	window
O	in
O	the
O	bower
O	where
O	the
O	king
O	sat
O	with
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	and
O	suddenly
O	he
O	turned
O	with
O	a
O	laugh
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	'
O	Sir
O	,
O	go
O	to
O	your
O	meat
O	,
O	for
O	here
O	,
O	I
O	think
O	,
O	cometh
O	a
O	strange
O	adventure
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	even
O	as
O	the
O	king
O	took
O	his
O	seat
O	on
O	the
O	high
O	dais
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	knights
O	sat
O	at
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	great
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	hall
O	came
O	two
O	men
O	,
O	well
O	beseen
O	and
O	richly
O	dressed
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	leaning
O	on
O	their
O	shoulders
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	tall
O	,
O	fair
O	,
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	as
O	goodly
O	to
O	strength
O	and
O	breadth
O	as
O	ever
O	was
O	seen
O	,
O	with
O	hands
O	large
O	and
O	fair
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	was
O	either
O	lazy
O	or
O	ill-conditioned
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	leaned
O	upon
O	his
O	fellows
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	unable
O	to
O	stand
O	upright
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	three
O	of
O	them
O	marched
O	through
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	speaking
O	no
O	word
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	dais
O	,
O	while
O	men
O	sat
O	silent
O	and
O	marvelling
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	raised
O	himself
O	upright
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	seen
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	foot
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	taller
O	than
O	those
O	beside
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	God
O	bless
O	you
O	,
O	O
O	king
O	!
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	'
O	and
O	all
O	your
O	fair
O	fellowship
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	especial
O	the
O	fellowship
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	.
O	I
O	come
O	to
O	crave
O	of
O	your
O	kindness
O	three
O	gifts
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	are
O	such
O	as

O	worshipfully
O	and
O	honourably
O	grant
O	unto
O	me
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	first
O	I
O	will
O	ask
O	now
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	others
O	will
O	I
O	ask
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	day
O	twelvemonths
O	,
O	wheresoever

O	your
O	feast
O	of
O	Pentecost
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Ask
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	and
O	ye
O	shall
O	be
O	granted
O	your
O	petition
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	The
O	first
O	is
O	this
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	ye
O	give
O	me
O	meat
O	and

O	and
O	lodging
O	here
O	for
O	a
O	year
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Willingly
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	but
O	what
O	is
O	your
O	name
O	and
O	whence
O	come
O	you
O	?
O	Ye
O	have
O	the
O	bearing
O	of
O	good
O	lineage
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	That
O	is
O	as
O	may
O	be
O	,
O	'
O	was
O	the
O	reply
O	,
O	'
O	but
O	I
O	may
O	tell
O	you
O	naught
O	,
O	if
O	it
O	please
O	you
O	,
O	lord
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	King
O	Arthur
O	called
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	,
O	his
O	steward
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	tend
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	for
O	a
O	year
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	a
O	lord
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	.
O	'
O	There
O	is
O	no
O	need
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	have
O	such
O	care
O	,
O	'
O	sneered
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	a
O	sour
O	mind
O	.
O	'
O	I
O	dare
O	swear
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	but
O	a
O	villein
O	born
O	.
O	If
O	he
O	were
O	of
O	good
O	blood
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	craved
O	a
O	horse
O	and
O	harness
O	.
O	And
O	since
O	he
O	hath
O	no
O	name
O	I
O	will
O	dub
O	him
O	Beaumains
O	,
O	or
O	Fair
O	Hands
O	,
O	for
O	see
O	how
O	soft
O	are
O	his
O	hands
O	!
O	And
O	he
O	shall
O	live
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen
O	,
O	and
O	become
O	as
O	fat
O	as
O	any
O	pig
O	!
O	'
O	But
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	reproached
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	for
O	his
O	mocking
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	'
O	for
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	'
O	I
O	dare
O	lay
O	my
O	head
O	he
O	hath
O	the
O	making
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	great
O	worship
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	That
O	can
O	not
O	be
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	;
O	'
O	he
O	has
O	asked
O	as
O	his
O	nature
O	prompted
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	will
O	make
O	naught
O	but
O	fat
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	desires
O	only
O	meat
O	and
O	drink
O	.
O	On
O	my
O	life
O	I
O	would
O	swear
O	he
O	is
O	only
O	some
O	lazy
O	fellow
O	from
O	an
O	abbey
O	,
O	where
O	food
O	hath
O	failed
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	he
O	has
O	come
O	hither
O	for
O	sustenance
O	.
O	'
O	So
O	Kay
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	his
O	meat
O	laughing
O	,
O	and
O	Beaumains
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	varlets
O	and
O	boys
O	ate
O	the
O	leavings
O	from
O	the
O	table
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	fared
O	badly
O	there
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	jeered
O	at
O	him
O	as
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	had
O	done
O	.
O	Afterwards
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	of
O	his
O	great
O	gentleness
O	and
O	courtesy
O	,
O	bade
O	him
O	come
O	to
O	his
O	chamber
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	better
O	fed
O	and
O	clothed
O	;
O	and
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	a
O	liking
O	he
O	felt
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	for
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	proffered
O	him
O	good
O	meat
O	and
O	drink
O	and
O	a
O	soft
O	bed
O	.
O	But
O	then
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	all
O	other
O	times
O	,
O	Beaumains
O	refused
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	do
O	nothing
O	but
O	what
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	commanded
O	.
O	Thus
O	he
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen
O	,
O	eating
O	broken
O	scraps
O	,
O	and
O	lying
O	at
O	night
O	where
O	the
O	scullions
O	lay
O	,
O	except
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	given
O	the
O	chilliest
O	spot
O	furthest
O	from
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	did
O	what
O	he
O	was
O	bidden
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	a
O	cheerful
O	air
O	and
O	was
O	ever
O	willing
O	to
O	work
O	.
O	And
O	if
O	there
O	was
O	any
O	jousting
O	of
O	knights
O	or
O	any
O	other
O	sights
O	of
O	prowess
O	,
O	these
O	would
O	he
O	see
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	delight
O	.
O	In
O	any
O	sports
O	or
O	trials
O	of
O	strength
O	or
O	skill
O	among
O	the
O	serving-men
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	ever
O	foremost
O	,
O	and
O	none
O	could
O	overcome
O	him
O	in
O	wrestling
O	or
O	at
O	quarterstaff
O	,
O	nor
O	could
O	any
O	throw
O	the
O	bar
O	or
O	cast
O	the
O	stone
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	,
O	no
O	,
O	not
O	by
O	two
O	yards
O	.
O	Whenever
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	met
O	him
O	about
O	the
O	hall
O	or
O	the
O	kitchen
O	he
O	would
O	laugh
O	mockingly
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	those
O	about
O	him
O	he
O	would
O	say
O	,
O	'
O	Well
O	,
O	how
O	like
O	you
O	my
O	huge
O	boy
O	of
O	the
O	kitchen
O	?
O	'
O	But
O	to
O	such
O	sneers
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	all
O	the
O	scorns
O	and
O	insults
O	of
O	the
O	varlets
O	of
O	the
O	kitchen
O	,
O	Beaumains
O	would
O	answer
O	naught
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	ever
O	quiet
O	and
O	mild
O	whatever
O	he
O	endured
O	.
O	And
O	to
O	all
O	was
O	he
O	ever
O	gentle
O	,
O	both
O	man
O	and
O	child
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	never
O	put
O	forth
O	his
O	great
O	strength
O	in
O	anger
O	.
O	Thus
O	a
O	year
O	passed
O	,
O	until
O	again
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	feast
O	of
O	Pentecost
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	the
O	king
O	held
O	it
O	at
O	his
O	chief
O	city
O	in
O	Wales
O	,
O	Caerleon-upon-Usk
O	.
O	And
O	again
O	the
O	feast
O	was
O	royally
O	prepared
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	hall
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	king
O	would
O	not
O	give
O	the
O	signal
O	to
O	sit
O	to
O	meat
O	until
O	he
O	should
O	have
O	heard
O	or
O	seen
O	some
O	strange
O	adventure
O	.
O	But
O	about
O	noon
O	a
O	squire
O	came
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	king
O	waited
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	Lord
O	,
O	I

O	your

O	,
O	for
O	there
O	cometh
O	a
O	damsel
O	with
O	some
O	strange
O	adventure
O	.
O	'
O	Quickly
O	the
O	king
O	sat
O	on
O	the
O	high
O	seat
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	cooks
O	brought
O	in
O	the
O	smoking
O	collops
O	of
O	meat
O	and
O	the
O	dishes
O	of
O	savoury
O	stews
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	maiden
O	of
O	a
O	plain
O	sharp
O	visage
O	,
O	who
O	made
O	her
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	step
O	of
O	the
O	dais
O	,

O	there
O	kneeling

O	roughly

O	into

O	,

O	,
O	looking
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	bank
O	,
O	Beaumains
O	was
O	aware
O	of

O	knights
O	on

O	,
O	stationed
O	as

O	.
O	'
O	Now
O	,
O	sir
O	kitchen
O	knight
O	,
O	'
O	laughed
O	the
O	lady
O	mockingly
O	,
O	'
O	what
O	sayest
O	thou
O	?
O	Art
O	thou
O	a
O	match
O	for
O	these

O	knights
O	,
O	or
O	wilt
O	thou
O	not
O	turn
O	back
O	?
O	'
O	'
O	I
O	would
O	not
O	turn
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	six
O	,
O	'
O	replied
O	Beaumains
O	quietly
O	.
O	With
O	that
O	he
O	rushed
O	,
O	with
O	spear
O	at
O	rest
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	ford
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	waiting
O	knights
O	came
O	swiftly
O	against
O	him
O	.
O	They
O	met
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	with
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	shock
O	that
O	their
O	spears
O	were
O	splintered
O	.
O	They
O	then
O	closed
O	fiercely
O	with
O	their
O	swords
O	,
O	and
O	hurtled
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	foaming
O	,
O	dashing
O	water
O	,
O	beating
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	Beaumains
O	struck
O	the
O	other
O	so
O	hard
O	a
O	stroke
O	on
O	his
O	helm
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	stunned
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	into
O	the
O	stream
O	,
O	which
O	whirled
O	him
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	deeps
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	drowned
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	Beaumains
O	rode
O	swiftly
O	towards
O	the
O	other
O	knight
O	,
O	who
O	with
O	his
O	lance
O	dashed
O	against
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	Beaumains
O	parried
O	the
O	spear
O	stroke
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	one
O	great
O	heave
O	of
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	clove
O	the
O	other
O	'
O	s
O	helm
O	in
O	twain
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	knight
O	fell
O	like
O	a
O	stone
O	.
O	'
O	Alas

O	At
O	that
O	they
O	saw
O	Sir
O	Persaunt
O	array
O	himself
O	in
O	his
O	armour
O	and
O	mount
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	he
O	came
O	rushing
O	across
O	the
O	field
O	at
O	utmost
O	speed
O	,
O	his
O	lance
O	in
O	rest
O	.
O	Beaumains
O	also
O	made
O	his
O	horse
O	leap
O	forward
O	swiftly
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	met
O	with
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	force
O	that
O	both
O	their
O	lances
O	splintered
O	in
O	many
O	pieces
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	horses
O	fell
O	dead
O	upon
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	instantly
O	disentangled
O	themselves
O	,
O	and
O	fought
O	on
O	foot
O	with
O	shield
O	and
O	sword
O	.
O	So
O	furiously
O	did
O	they
O	hurl
O	themselves
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	that
O	often
O	they
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	For
O	two
O	hours
O	the
O	duel
O	raged
O	,
O	till
O	their
O	hauberks
O	were
O	tattered
O	and
O	their
O	shields
O	were
O	hacked
O	,
O	while
O	both
O	were
O	sorely
O	bruised
O	and
O	wounded
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	Beaumains
O	thrust
O	Sir
O	Persaunt
O	in
O	the
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	latter
O	'
O	s
O	attack
O	became
O	less
O	eager
O	.
O	Finally
O	Beaumains
O	hit
O	the
O	other
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	stroke
O	that
O	he
O	fell
O	headlong
O	,
O	and
O	instantly
O	Beaumains
O	leaped
O	astride
O	of
O	him
O	and
O	unlashed
O	his
O	helm
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	about
O	to
O	slay
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Persaunt
O	yielded
O	him
O	and
O	pleaded
O	for
O	his
O	life
O	,

O	the
O	lady
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	stood
O	watching

O	helping
O	the
O	knight
O	to
O	rise
O	,
O	'
O	for
O	he
O	hath
O	nobly

O	people
O	looked
O	out
O	from
O	the
O	walls
O	and
O	windows
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	Then
O	Beaumains
O	saw
O	a
O	tall
O	man
O	come
O	running
O	from
O	a
O	tent
O	,
O	arming
O	himself
O	as
O	he
O	came
O	.
O	Two
O	barons
O	set
O	his
O	spurs
O	upon
O	his
O	heels
O	and
O	an
O	earl
O	buckled
O	his
O	helm
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	all
O	in
O	red
O	armour
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	plume
O	which
O	waved
O	upon
O	his
O	crest
O	to
O	the
O	cloth
O	which
O	was
O	upon
O	his
O	horse
O	.
O	And
O	his
O	shield
O	was
O	all
O	of
O	red
O	,
O	with
O	but
O	a
O	black
O	heart
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	thereof
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	waited
O	for
O	Beaumains
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	hollow
O	before
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	all
O	that
O	were
O	therein
O	might
O	see
O	the
O	combat
O	.
O	'

O	With
O	that
O	they
O	withdrew
O	a
O	little
O	from
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	spurring
O	their
O	horses
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	lances
O	in
O	rest
O	,
O	they
O	hurled
O	themselves
O	towards
O	each
O	other
O	.
O	With
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	crash
O	did
O	they
O	come
O	together
O	that
O	both
O	their
O	spears
O	were
O	broken
O	into
O	a
O	hundred
O	pieces
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	breastplates
O	,
O	girths
O	and
O	cruppers
O	burst
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	half
O	stunned
O	with
O	the
O	shock
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	they
O	avoided
O	their
O	struggling
O	horses
O	,
O	and
O	leaping
O	towards
O	each
O	other
O	with
O	their
O	swords
O	,
O	they
O	cut
O	and
O	hacked
O	each
O	the

O	so
O	fiercely
O	that
O	great
O	pieces
O	of
O	their
O	shields
O	and
O	armour
O	flew
O	off
O	.
O	Thus
O	they
O	fought
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	past
O	noon
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	stop
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	both
O	lacked
O	wind
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	they
O	stood
O	swaying
O	,
O	staggering
O	,
O	panting
O	,
O	yet
O	feinting
O	and
O	striking
O	with
O	what
O	strength
O	they
O	had
O	.
O	The
O	Red
O	Knight
O	was
O	a
O	cunning
O	fighter
O	,
O	and
O	Beaumains
O	learned
O	much
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	cost
O	of
O	many
O	a
O	gaping
O	wound
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	evensong
O	they
O	rested
O	by
O	mutual
O	accord
O	,
O	and
O	seated
O	on
O	two
O	molehills
O	near
O	the
O	fighting
O	place
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	their
O	helms
O	taken
O	off
O	by
O	their
O	pages
O	and
O	their
O	worse
O	wounds
O	bound
O	up
O	.
O	Then
O	Beaumains
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	eyes
O	to
O	the
O	lady
O	at
O	the
O	window
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	how
O	her
O	looks
O	were
O	tender
O	with
O	pity
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	heartened
O	was
O	he
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	that
O	he
O	started
O	up
O	swiftly
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	make
O	him
O	ready
O	to
O	do
O	battle
O	once
O	more
O	to
O	the
O	uttermost
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	rushed
O	fiercely
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fight
O	raged
O	more
O	hotly
O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	by
O	cunning
O	,
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	suddenly
O	struck
O	Beaumains
O	'
O	sword
O	from
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	he
O	could
O	recover
O	it
O	,
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	had
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	buffet
O	thrown
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	fallen
O	upon
O	him
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	down
O	.
O	Then
O	cried
O	the
O	Lady
O	Linet
O	piteously
O	:
O	'

O	almost
O	in

O	power
O	!
O	'
O	At
O	that
O	,
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	rage
O	possessed
O	Beaumains
O	,
O	that
O	with
O	one
O	great
O	effort
O	he
O	thrust
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	leaping
O	up
O	,
O	he
O	seized
O	his
O	sword
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	fiercely
O	did
O	he
O	beat
O	upon
O	his
O	enemy
O	that
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	sank
O	to
O	his
O	knees
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	was
O	thrust
O	grovelling
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Beaumains
O	leaped
O	astride
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	the
O	fastenings
O	of
O	his
O	helm
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	shrieked
O	for
O	mercy
O	.
O	'
O	Thou
O	recreant
O	and
O	coward

O	said
O	Beaumains
O	.

O	slew

O	at
O	a
O	stroke
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	cried
O	out
O	with
O	joy
O	.

O	leader

O	dead
O	,
O	his
O	following
O	of
O	earls
O	,
O	barons

O	knights
O	came

O	did
O	homage
O	to

O	,
O	and
O	he
O	commanded
O	that

O	court
O	of

O	yield

O	for
O	ten
O	days
O	the
O	Lady
O	Linet

O	as
O	he
O	came
O	thither
