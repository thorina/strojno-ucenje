O	and
O	a

O	.
O	The

O	woman
O	was
O	withered
O	,
O	sour-tempered
O	,
O	and
O	dumb
O	.
O	The

O	as

O	and
O	as
O	fresh
O	as
O	an
O	opening
O	rosebud
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	voice
O	was
O	as

O	as

O	in

O	.
O	In
O	the

O	In

O	it

O	and
O	their

O	towards
O	the

O	were
O	two

O	of
O	plain
O	woodwork
O	,
O	in

O	slept
O	the
O	old
O	woman;
O	the
O	other
O	was
O	Finola
O	'
O	s
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	of
O	bog-oak
O	,
O	polished
O	as
O	a
O	looking-glass
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	it
O	were
O	carved
O	flowers

O	shone
O	in

O	This

O	towards
O	the

O	by
O	a

O	mountains
O	that
O	looked

O	blue
O	in

O	put
O	on
O	a
O	hundred
O	changing
O	colors
O	as
O	the

O	but
O	when

O	across
O	the

O	it
O	lost
O	its

O	by
O	talking
O	to

O	a
