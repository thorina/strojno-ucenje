O	THE
O	RETURN
O	OF
O	DIRK
O	HATTERAICK
O	ONE
O	event
O	deeply
O	stirred
O	all
O	Solway-side
O	in
O	the
O	year
O	of
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	'
O	s
O	arrival
O	at
O	Woodbourne
O	--
O	the
O	smugglers
O	had
O	returned
O	in
O	force
O	,
O	and
O	proved
O	themselves
O	ripe
O	for
O	any
O	desperate
O	act
O	.
O	Their
O	stronghold
O	was
O	as
O	of
O	old
O	,
O	the
O	Isle
O	of
O	Man
O	,
O	from
O	which
O	they
O	could
O	descend
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	hours
O	upon
O	the
O	Solway
O	coasts
O	.
O	Stricter
O	laws
O	and
O	more
O	severe
O	penalties
O	had
O	only
O	rendered
O	them
O	fiercer
O	than
O	of
O	old
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	case
O	of
O	need
O	,
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	hesitate
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	to
O	shed
O	blood
O	.
O	As
O	of
O	yore
O	also
O	,
O	their
O	leader
O	was
O	the
O	savage
O	Dirk
O	Hatteraick
O	,
O	under
O	whom
O	served
O	a
O	Lieutenant
O	named
O	Brown
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	their
O	first
O	exploits
O	was
O	a
O	daring
O	attack
O	upon
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	Woodbourne
O	,
O	where
O	dwelt
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	with
O	his
O	daughter
O	and
O	Lucy
O	Bertram
O	.
O	It
O	happened
O	thus
O	.
O	Mannering
O	,
O	in
O	company
O	with
O	young
O	Charles
O	Hazlewood
O	,
O	was
O	setting
O	out
O	for
O	a
O	loch
O	some
O	miles
O	away
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	the
O	skaters
O	.
O	Hazlewood
O	had
O	quite
O	often
O	come
O	to
O	visit
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	Woodbourne
O	since
O	Lucy
O	Bertram
O	went
O	to
O	live
O	there
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	a
O	few
O	men
O	,
O	each
O	leading
O	a
O	laden
O	horse
O	,
O	burst
O	through
O	the
O	bushes
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	pressing
O	straight
O	across
O	the
O	lawn
O	,
O	made
O	for
O	the
O	front
O	door
O	.
O	Mannering
O	hastened
O	to
O	demand
O	what
O	they
O	wanted
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	revenue
O	officers
O	,
O	they
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	they
O	knew
O	that
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	had
O	served
O	in
O	the
O	East
O	,
O	they
O	called
O	upon
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	name
O	to
O	protect
O	them
O	and
O	their
O	captures
O	.
O	To
O	this
O	Mannering
O	instantly
O	agreed
O	.
O	No
O	time
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	lost
O	.
O	The
O	smugglers
O	were
O	hot
O	in
O	pursuit
O	,
O	strongly
O	reinforced
O	.
O	Immediately
O	the
O	goods
O	were
O	piled
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	.
O	The
O	windows
O	were
O	blocked
O	up
O	with
O	cushions
O	,
O	pillows
O	,
O	and
O	(
O	what
O	caused
O	the
O	Dominie
O	many
O	a
O	groan
O	)
O	great
O	folios
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	library
O	,
O	bound
O	in
O	wood
O	,
O	covered
O	with
O	leather
O	,
O	and
O	studded
O	with
O	brazen
O	bosses
O	like
O	a
O	Highland
O	targe
O	.
O	While
O	these
O	preparations
O	were
O	being
O	made
O	within
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	Woodbourne
O	the
O	steady
O	earth-shaking
O	beat
O	of
O	a
O	body
O	of
O	horsemen
O	was
O	heard
O	approaching
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	a
O	body
O	of
O	thirty
O	mounted
O	men
O	rushed
O	out
O	upon
O	the
O	lawn
O	,
O	brandishing
O	weapons
O	and
O	uttering
O	savage
O	yells
O	.
O	Most
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	their
O	heads
O	tied
O	up
O	in
O	coloured
O	handkerchiefs
O	,
O	while
O	many
O	wore
O	masks
O	by
O	way
O	of
O	disguising
O	themselves
O	.
O	Finding
O	the
O	mansion
O	in
O	an
O	unexpected
O	state
O	of
O	defence
O	,
O	they
O	halted
O	a
O	moment
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	to
O	take
O	counsel
O	together
O	.
O	But
O	finally
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	his
O	face
O	all
O	blackened
O	with
O	soot
O	,
O	dismounted
O	and
O	came
O	forward
O	,
O	waving
O	a
O	white
O	cloth
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	immediately
O	threw
O	up
O	a
O	window
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	the
O	smuggler
O	what
O	he
O	wanted
O	.
O	``
O	We
O	want
O	our
O	goods
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	we
O	have
O	been
O	robbed
O	by
O	these
O	sharks
O	,
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	man
O	with
O	the
O	blackened
O	face
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	we
O	mean
O	to
O	have
O	them
O	.
O	If
O	you
O	give
O	them
O	up
O	,
O	we
O	will
O	go
O	away
O	quietly
O	without
O	harming
O	any
O	one
O	,
O	but
O	if
O	you
O	refuse
O	,
O	then
O	we
O	will
O	burn
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	have
O	the
O	life-blood
O	of
O	every
O	soul
O	under
O	your
O	roof
O	.
O	``
O	This
O	he
O	swore
O	with
O	many
O	horrible
O	and
O	cruel
O	oaths
O	.
O	``
O	If
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	instantly
O	ride
O	off
O	my
O	lawn
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	fire
O	upon
O	you
O	without
O	any
O	further
O	warning
O	!
O	``
O	The
O	Ambassador
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	troop
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	sooner
O	had
O	he
O	told
O	them
O	the
O	Colonel
O	'
O	s
O	answer
O	than
O	they
O	rushed
O	forward
O	to
O	the
O	attack
O	with
O	horrid
O	yells
O	.
O	Three
O	volleys
O	were
O	fired
O	,
O	shattering
O	the
O	window-glass
O	in
O	all
O	directions
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	thanks
O	to
O	the
O	Colonel
O	'
O	s
O	preparations
O	,
O	the
O	slugs
O	and
O	bullets
O	rattled
O	harmlessly
O	against
O	his
O	defences
O	.
O	Many
O	of
O	the
O	smugglers
O	now
O	dismounted
O	and
O	advanced
O	with
O	axe
O	and
O	crow-bar
O	to
O	force
O	the
O	front
O	door
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	time
O	for
O	those
O	within
O	to
O	take
O	action
O	.
O	``
O	Let
O	only
O	Charles
O	Hazlewood
O	and
O	myself
O	shoot
O	!
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	Colonel
O	,
O	``
O	Hazlewood
O	,
O	do
O	you
O	mark

O	of
O	the
O	rascals
O	--
O	the
O	man
O	on
O	the
O	grey
O	horse
O	,
O	whom
O	they
O	call
O	their
O	Lieutenant
O	!
O	``
O	Both
O	men
O	fell
O	as
O	the
O	shots
O	rang
O	out
O	.
O	Astonished
O	by
O	this
O	reception
O	,
O	the
O	smugglers
O	retreated
O	,
O	carrying
O	with
O	them
O	their
O	wounded
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	whom
O	Captain
O	Brown
O	saw
O	die
O	in
O	the
O	little
O	ruined
O	keep
O	at
O	Derncleugh
O	the
O	night
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	overtaken
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
O	--
O	indeed
O	,
O	that
O	very
O	namesake
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	Brown
O	,
O	the
O	mate
O	of
O	Hatteraick
O	'
O	s
O	vessel
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	many
O	who
O	thought
O	that
O	after
O	this
O	Captain
O	Mannering
O	ought
O	to
O	remove
O	his
O	family
O	out
O	of
O	danger
O	.
O	But
O	that
O	gentleman
O	confined
O	himself
O	to
O	taking
O	greater
O	precautions
O	at
O	locking-up
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	insisting
O	that
O	when
O	the
O	ladies
O	went
O	out
O	walking
O	,
O	a
O	gun
O	should
O	be
O	carried
O	by
O	an
O	attendant
O	for
O	their
O	protection
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	Julia
O	Mannering
O	and
O	Lucy
O	Bertram
O	had
O	gone
O	out
O	with
O	young
O	Charles
O	Hazlewood
O	to
O	visit
O	a
O	small
O	lake
O	much
O	frequented
O	by
O	skaters
O	and
O	curlers
O	,
O	while
O	a
O	servant
O	followed
O	behind
O	with
O	a
O	gun
O	.
O	It
O	chanced
O	that
O	Lucy
O	,
O	who
O	never
O	kept
O	Hazlewood
O	'
O	s
O	arm
O	when
O	she
O	could
O	avoid
O	it
O	,
O	had
O	dropped
O	behind
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	passing
O	along
O	a
O	narrow
O	path
O	through
O	a
O	pine
O	plantation
O	.
O	Julia
O	Mannering
O	was
O	therefore
O	alone
O	at
O	Charles
O	Hazlewood
O	'
O	s
O	side
O	when
O	Brown
O	suddenly
O	appeared
O	from
O	among
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	right
O	in
O	their
O	path
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	roughly
O	dressed
O	,
O	and
O	young
O	Hazlewood
O	,
O	taking
O	him
O	for
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	smugglers
O	,
O	and
O	mistaking
O	the
O	meaning
O	of
O	Julia
O	'
O	s
O	cry
O	of
O	surprise
O	at
O	seeing
O	her
O	lover
O	,
O	snatched
O	the
O	gun
O	from
O	the
O	servant
O	,
O	and
O	haughtily
O	ordered
O	Brown
O	to
O	stand
O	back
O	so
O	as
O	not
O	to
O	alarm
O	the
O	lady
O	.
O	Brown
O	,
O	piqued
O	at
O	finding
O	Julia
O	on
O	the
O	arm
O	of
O	a
O	stranger
O	,
O	replied
O	as
O	haughtily
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	require
O	to
O	take
O	lessons
O	from
O	Hazlewood
O	how
O	to
O	behave
O	to
O	any
O	lady
O	.
O	Instantly
O	Charles
O	Hazlewood
O	pointed
O	the
O	gun
O	at
O	his
O	breast
O	.
O	Upon
O	which
O	Brown
O	sprang
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	struggle
O	the
O	gun
O	went
O	off
O	by
O	accident
O	,
O	and
O	Hazlewood
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	wounded
O	.
O	Brown
O	,
O	anxious
O	not
O	to
O	bring
O	Julia
O	Mannering
O	into
O	the
O	affair
O	,
O	at
O	once
O	sprang
O	over
O	the
O	hedge
O	and
O	disappeared
O	.
O	Hazlewood
O	'
O	s
O	wound
O	was
O	,
O	happily
O	,
O	not
O	serious
O	,
O	and
O	being
O	an
O	honest
O	open
O	young
O	fellow
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	to
O	own
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	wrong
O	.
O	Nothing
O	of
O	importance
O	would
O	have
O	come
O	of
O	the
O	affair
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	the
O	officiousness
O	of
O	Glossin
O	,
O	the
O	new
O	Laird
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	,
O	who
O	saw
O	in
O	it
O	a
O	way
O	of
O	ingratiating
O	himself
O	with
O	the
O	two
O	powerful
O	families
O	of
O	Mannering
O	and
O	Hazlewood
O	.
O	Glossin
O	began
O	by
O	questioning
O	the
O	landlady
O	of
O	the
O	hotel
O	where
O	Brown
O	had
O	been
O	staying
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	tried
O	to
O	draw
O	out
O	the
O	postboy
O	.
O	From
O	them
O	he
O	gathered
O	little
O	,
O	save
O	the
O	fact
O	that
O	a
O	young
O	man
O	named
O	Brown
O	had
O	been
O	staying
O	at
O	the
O	Gordon
O	Arms
O	at
O	Kippletringan
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	day
O	of
O	the
O	accident
O	to
O	Charles
O	Hazlewood
O	,
O	Brown
O	had
O	taken
O	the
O	postboy
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	show
O	him
O	the
O	skating
O	and
O	curling
O	on
O	the
O	pond
O	in
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	supposed
O	attack
O	had
O	taken
O	place
O	.
O	Jock
O	Jabos
O	,
O	the
O	postboy
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	denied
O	that
O	``
O	the
O	stoutest
O	man
O	in
O	Scotland

O	take
O	a

O	,
O	in
O	order
O	the
O	better
O	to
O	carry
O	out
O	his
O	plans
O	,
O	pretended
O	to

O	the

O	the

O	was
O	the
O	information
O	which
O	was
O	waiting
O	for
O	Glossin
O	on
O	his
O	return
O	to
O	his
O	house
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	.
O	Mac-Guffog
O	,
O	the
O	county
O	thief-taker
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	of
O	his
O	people
O	were
O	there
O	.
O	With
O	them
O	they
O	had
O	brought
O	a
O	prisoner
O	,
O	whom
O	they
O	had
O	first
O	beguiled
O	into
O	drink
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	easily
O	handcuffed
O	while
O	asleep
O	.
O	Glossin
O	was
O	delighted
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	under
O	a
O	great
O	hope
O	that
O	this
O	might
O	prove
O	to
O	be
O	Brown
O	himself
O	.
O	Instead
O	,
O	he
O	recognised
O	an
O	old
O	acquaintance
O	--
O	no
O	other
O	than
O	Dirk
O	Hatteraick
O	,
O	the
O	smuggler
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	interview
O	which
O	followed
O	,
O	Dirk
O	told
O	Glossin
O	some
O	facts
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	tremble
O	.
O	His
O	possession
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	was
O	threatened
O	.
O	The
O	true
O	heir
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	lad
O	Harry
O	Bertram
O	,
O	lost
O	on
O	the
O	night
O	of
O	the
O	murder
O	of
O	Frank
O	Kennedy
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	perished
O	as
O	had
O	been
O	supposed
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	brought
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	principal
O	partner
O	of
O	the
O	Dutch
O	firm
O	to
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	bound
O	apprentice
O	,
O	sent
O	to
O	the
O	East
O	Indies
O	under
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Vanbeest
O	Brown
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	at
O	that
O	very
O	moment
O	upon
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	Solway
O	--
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	very
O	near
O	to
O	Ellangowan
O	itself
O	.
O	Glossin
O	saw
O	his
O	hopes
O	wither
O	before
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	If
O	the
O	heir
O	should
O	find
O	out
O	his
O	rights
O	,
O	then
O	the
O	fruits
O	of
O	his
O	villany
O	,
O	the
O	estate
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	itself
O	,
O	must
O	return
O	to
O	its
O	true
O	owner
O	.
O	The
O	lawyer
O	secretly
O	gave
O	Dirk
O	Hatteraick
O	a
O	small
O	file
O	with
O	which
O	to
O	rid
O	himself
O	of
O	his
O	irons
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	bade
O	his
O	captors
O	confine
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	strong-room
O	of
O	the
O	ancient
O	castle
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	stanchions
O	are
O	falling
O	to
O	pieces
O	with
O	rust
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	whispered
O	to
O	Dirk
O	,
O	``
O	the
O	distance
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	is
O	not
O	twelve
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	snow
O	lies
O	thick
O	.
O	After
O	that
O	,
O	you
O	must
O	steal
O	my
O	boat
O	which
O	lies
O	below
O	in
O	the
O	cove
O	,
O	and
O	wait
O	till
O	I
O	come
O	to
O	you
O	in
O	the
O	cave
O	of
O	the
O	Wood
O	of
O	Warroch
O	!
O	``
O	So
O	saying
O	,
O	he
O	called
O	the
O	thief-takers
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	his
O	arrangements
O	.
O	Glossin
O	could
O	not
O	sleep
O	that
O	night
O	.
O	Eagerly
O	he
O	watched
O	the
O	window
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	castle
O	.
O	He
O	heard
O	the
O	iron
O	bars
O	fall
O	outward
O	upon
O	the
O	rocks
O	with
O	a
O	clinking
O	sound
O	,
O	and
O	feared
O	that
O	all
O	was
O	lost
O	.
O	The
O	light
O	in
O	the
O	window
O	was
O	obscured
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	black
O	object
O	drop
O	upon
O	the
O	snow
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	little
O	boat
O	put
O	out
O	from
O	the
O	harbour
O	,
O	the
O	wind
O	caught
O	the
O	sail
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	bore
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	of
O	Warroch
O	Point
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morrow
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	overwhelmed
O	Mac-Guffog
O	with
O	the
O	full
O	force
O	of
O	his
O	anger
O	for
O	his
O	carelessness
O	in
O	allowing
O	his
O	prisoner
O	to
O	escape
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	sent
O	his
O	men
O	off
O	in
O	different
O	directions
O	,
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	,
O	to
O	retake
O	Hatteraick
O	--
O	in
O	all
O	directions
O	,
O	that
O	is
O	,
O	except
O	the
O	true
O	one
O	.
O	Having
O	thus
O	disposed
O	of
O	the
O	thief-takers
O	,
O	he
O	set
O	out
O	for
O	Warroch
O	Head
O	alone
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	marks
O	of
O	his
O	feet
O	in
O	the
O	snow
O	startled
O	him
O	.
O	Any
O	officer
O	,
O	coming
O	upon
O	that
O	trail
O	,
O	would
O	run
O	it
O	up
O	like
O	a
O	bloodhound
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	changed
O	his
O	path
O	,
O	descending
O	the
O	cliff
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	his
O	way
O	cautiously
O	along
O	the
O	sea-beach
O	where
O	the
O	snow
O	did
O	not
O	lie
O	.
O	He
O	passed
O	the
O	great
O	boulder
O	which
O	had
O	fallen
O	with
O	Frank
O	Kennedy
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	now
O	all
O	overgrown
O	with
O	mussels
O	and
O	seaweed
O	.
O	The
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	cave
O	opened
O	black
O	and
O	dismal
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	Glossin
O	drew
O	breath
O	before
O	entering
O	such
O	a
O	haunt
O	of
O	iniquity
O	,
O	and
O	recharged
O	his
O	pistols
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	somewhat
O	heartened
O	by
O	the
O	thought
O	that
O	Dirk
O	Hatteraick
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	gain
O	by
O	his
O	death
O	.
O	Finally
O	he
O	took
O	courage
O	to
O	push
O	forward
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	Hatteraick
O	came
O	hoarse
O	from
O	the
O	back
O	of
O	the
O	cave
O	.

O	growled
O	.
O	``

O	said
O	Glossin

O	set
O	down
O	the
O	little
O	lantern
O	which
O	he
O	carried
O	,
O	he
O	gathered
O	together
O	some
O	barrel-staves

O	driftwood
O	.
O	The
O	flame
O	showed
O	Hatteraick
O	'
O	s
O	fierce
O	and
O	bronzed
O	visage
O	as
O	he
O	warmed
O	his
O	sinewy
O	hands
O	at
O	the
O	blaze
O	.
O	He
O	sat
O	with
O	his
O	face
O	thrust
O	forward
O	and
O	actually
O	in
O	the
O	smoke
O	itself
O	,
O	so
O	great
O	had
O	been
O	his
O	agony
O	of
O	cold
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	warmed
O	up
O	,
O	Glossin
O	gave
O	him
O	some
O	cold
O	meat
O	and
O	a
O	flask
O	of
O	strong
O	spirits
O	.
O	Hatteraick
O	eagerly
O	seized
O	upon
O	these
O	,
O	exclaiming
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	long
O	draught
O	,
O	``

O	After

O	had
O	put
O	the
O	smuggler
O	into
O	a
O	somewhat
O	better
O	temper
O	,
O	the
O	two
O	associates
O	settled
O	themselves

O	brought
O	Glossin
O	to
O	the
O	Cave

O	Warroch
O	Point
O	.
O	Up
O	to
O	the
O	present

O	Vanbeest

O	behalf
O	of
O	the
O	lost
O	heir
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	,
O	young
O	Harry
O	Bertram
O	,
O	whom
O	(
O	said
O	the
O	will
O	)
O	she
O	had
O	good
O	reason
O	for
O	believing
O	to
O	be
O	still
O	alive
O	.
O	The
O	object
O	of
O	all
O	these
O	plots
O	and
O	plans
O	,
O	good
O	and
O	evil
O	intentions
O	,
O	was
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	safe
O	in
O	Cumberland
O	.
O	And
O	had
O	he
O	been
O	content
O	to
O	stay
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	safe
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	remained
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	young
O	Bertram
O	arrived
O	upon
O	the
O	English
O	coast
O	he
O	had
O	written
O	to
O	Julia
O	Mannering
O	to
O	explain
O	his
O	conduct
O	in
O	the
O	affair
O	with
O	Hazlewood
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	Colonel
O	of
O	his
O	regiment
O	to
O	ask
O	him
O	for
O	the
O	means
O	of
O	establishing
O	his
O	identity
O	as
O	a
O	Captain
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	Majesty
O	'
O	s
O	dragoon
O	regiments
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	agent
O	to
O	send
O	him
O	a
O	sum
O	of
O	money
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	meantime
O	to
O	Dandie
O	Dinmont
O	for
O	a
O	small
O	temporary
O	loan
O	till
O	he
O	could
O	hear
O	from
O	his
O	man-of-affairs
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	wait
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	a
O	sharp
O	reply
O	from
O	Julia
O	Mannering
O	stung
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	quick
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	she
O	first
O	of
O	all
O	informed
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	Colonel
O	would
O	be
O	from
O	home
O	for
O	some
O	days
O	,
O	then
O	reproached
O	him
O	for
O	the
O	hastiness
O	of
O	his
O	conduct
O	,
O	and
O	concluded
O	by
O	saying
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	returning
O	to
O	Scotland
O	.
O	This
O	last
O	was
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	what
O	Bertram
O	at
O	once
O	proceeded
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	as
O	perhaps
O	the
O	young
O	lady
O	both
O	hoped
O	and
O	anticipated
O	.
O	So
O	once
O	more
O	the
O	heir
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	was
O	set
O	ashore
O	beneath
O	the
O	old
O	castle
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	built
O	by
O	his
O	forefathers
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	worked
O	his
O	passage
O	manfully
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	with
O	regret
O	that
O	the
O	sailors
O	put
O	him
O	ashore
O	in
O	the
O	bay
O	directly
O	beneath
O	the
O	Auld
O	Place
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	.
O	Some
O	remembrance
O	came
O	across
O	him
O	,
O	drifting
O	fitfully
O	over
O	his
O	mind
O	,
O	that
O	somehow
O	he
O	was
O	familiar
O	with
O	these
O	ruins
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	entered
O	and
O	looked
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	this
O	became
O	almost
O	a
O	certainty
O	.
O	It
O	chanced
O	that
O	lawyer
O	Glossin
O	had
O	entered
O	the
O	castle
O	at
O	about
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	,
O	coming
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	said
O	aloud
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	``
O	what
O	could
O	be
O	made
O	of
O	it
O	as
O	a
O	quarry
O	of
O	good
O	hewn
O	stone
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	adding
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	better
O	to
O	pull
O	it
O	down
O	at
O	any
O	rate
O	,
O	than
O	to
O	preserve
O	it
O	as
O	a
O	mere
O	haunt
O	of
O	smugglers
O	and
O	evil-doers
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	would
O	you
O	destroy
O	this
O	fine
O	old
O	ruin
O	?
O	``
O	said
O	Bertram
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	overheard
O	the
O	last
O	part
O	of
O	Glossin
O	'
O	s
O	remarks
O	.
O	The
O	lawyer
O	was
O	struck
O	dumb
O	,
O	so
O	exactly
O	were
O	the
O	tone
O	and
O	attitude
O	those
O	of
O	Harry
O	Bertram
O	'
O	s
O	father
O	in
O	his
O	best
O	days
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	coming
O	suddenly
O	face
O	to
O	face
O	with
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	there
O	within
O	the
O	ancient
O	castle
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	,
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	Glossin
O	as
O	if
O	Godfrey
O	Bertram
O	had
O	indeed
O	risen
O	from
O	the
O	dead
O	to
O	denounce
O	and
O	punish
O	his
O	treachery
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	lawyer
O	soon
O	recovered
O	himself
O	.
O	The
O	scheme
O	he
O	had
O	worked
O	out
O	together
O	with
O	Dirk
O	Hatteraick
O	matured
O	in
O	his
O	mind
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	seemed
O	as
O	good
O	a
O	time
O	as
O	any
O	for
O	carrying
O	it
O	out
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	waited
O	only
O	for
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	two
O	of
O	his
O	thief-takers
O	to
O	lay
O	hands
O	on
O	Bertram
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	send
O	word
O	to
O	the
O	father
O	of
O	Charles
O	Hazlewood
O	that
O	he
O	held
O	the
O	would-be
O	murderer
O	of
O	his
O	son
O	at
O	his
O	disposition
O	.
O	Now
O	Sir
O	Robert
O	Hazlewood
O	was
O	a
O	formal
O	old
O	dunderhead
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	of
O	opinion
O	that
O	his
O	family
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	connected
O	with
O	it
O	,
O	were
O	the
O	only
O	really
O	important
O	things
O	in
O	the
O	universe
O	.
O	Still
O	when
O	the
O	prisoner
O	was
O	brought
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	startled
O	by
O	Bertram
O	'
O	s
O	quiet
O	assurance
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	Glossin
O	'
O	s
O	sneers
O	,
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	being
O	influenced
O	by
O	the
O	information
O	that
O	Colonel
O	Guy
O	Mannering
O	could
O	speak
O	to
O	the
O	fact
O	of
O	his
O	being
O	both
O	an
O	officer
O	and
O	a
O	gentleman
O	.
O	But
O	Glossin
O	pointed
O	out
O	that
O	Mannering
O	was
O	in
O	Edinburgh
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	let
O	a
O	possible
O	malefactor
O	go
O	merely
O	because
O	he
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	known
O	to
O	an
O	absent
O	man
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	arranged
O	that
O	,
O	pending
O	the
O	arrival
O	of
O	the
O	Colonel
O	,
O	Harry
O	Bertram
O	(
O	or
O	Captain
O	Vanbeest
O	Brown
O	)
O	should
O	be
O	confined
O	in
O	the
O	custom-house
O	at
O	Portanferry
O	,
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	guard
O	of
O	soldiers
O	for
O	the
O	purpose
O	of
O	guarding
O	the
O	goods
O	taken
O	from
O	the
O	smugglers
O	.
O	Happy
O	that
O	his
O	schemes
O	were
O	prospering
O	so
O	well
O	,
O	Glossin
O	went
O	off
O	to
O	arrange
O	with
O	Dirk
O	Hatteraick
O	for
O	the
O	attack
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	removal
O	of
O	the
O	soldiers
O	,
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	way
O	that
O	no
O	suspicion
O	might
O	fall
O	upon
O	that
O	honourable
O	gentleman
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	Gilbert
O	Glossin
O	,
O	Justice
O	of
O	the
O	Peace
O	and
O	present
O	owner
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	.

O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	emissaries
O	of
O	Meg
O	Merrilies
O	were
O	not
O	idle
O	.
O	They
O	brought
O	her
O	the
O	earliest
O	information
O	that
O	the
O	heir
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	custom-house
O	at
O	Portanferry
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	imminent
O	danger
O	of
O	his
O	life
O	.
O	Far
O	on
O	the
O	hills
O	of
O	Liddesdale
O	one
O	Gibbs
O	Faa
O	,
O	a
O	gipsy
O	huntsman
O	,
O	warned
O	Dandie
O	Dinmont
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	wished
O	his
O	friend
O	well
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	better
O	take
O	horse
O	and
O	ride
O	straight
O	for
O	Portanferry
O	--
O	where
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	found
O	Brown
O	in
O	confinement
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	stay
O	by
O	him
O	night
O	and
O	day
O	.
O	For
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	only
O	regret
O	it
O	once
O	--
O	and
O	that
O	would
O	be
O	for
O	his
O	whole
O	life
O	.
O	Glossin
O	'
O	s
O	plan
O	was
O	to
O	work
O	on
O	the
O	fears
O	of
O	the
O	stupid
O	pompous
O	Sir
O	Robert
O	Hazlewood
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	summon
O	all
O	the
O	soldiers
O	for
O	the
O	defence
O	of
O	Hazlewood
O	House
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	belief
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	assaulted
O	by
O	the
O	gipsies
O	and
O	smugglers
O	.
O	But
O	Meg
O	Merrilies
O	herself
O	sent
O	young
O	Charles
O	Hazlewood
O	to
O	order
O	the
O	soldiers
O	back
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	mission
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	succeeded
O	but
O	for
O	the
O	dull
O	persistence
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	Mac-Morlan
O	,
O	as
O	Sheriff-Substitute
O	of
O	the
O	county
O	,
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	do
O	that
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	Sir
O	Robert
O	'
O	s
O	protest
O	which
O	the
O	good
O	sense
O	of
O	his
O	son
O	had
O	been
O	powerless
O	to
O	effect
O	.
O	The
O	soldiers
O	left
O	Hazlewood
O	House
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	direct
O	road
O	back
O	to
O	Portanferry
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	Sir
O	Robert
O	'
O	s
O	threats
O	and
O	remonstrances
O	.
O	Lastly
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	,
O	but
O	recently
O	returned
O	from
O	Edinburgh
O	,
O	was
O	warned
O	by
O	a
O	missive
O	which
O	Dominie
O	Sampson
O	had
O	brought
O	from
O	Meg
O	herself
O	.
O	So
O	that
O	on
O	one
O	particular
O	night
O	all
O	the
O	forces
O	of
O	order
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	those
O	of
O	disorder
O	,
O	were
O	directing
O	themselves
O	toward
O	the
O	custom-house
O	of
O	Portanferry
O	,
O	where
O	in
O	a
O	close
O	and
O	ignoble
O	apartment
O	Harry
O	Bertram
O	and
O	his
O	worthy
O	friend
O	,
O	Dandie
O	Dinmont
O	,
O	were
O	sleeping
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	Bertram
O	who
O	wakened
O	first
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	strong
O	smell
O	of
O	burning
O	in
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	From
O	the
O	window
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	a
O	crowded
O	boat-load
O	of
O	men
O	landing
O	at
O	the
O	little
O	harbour
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	yard
O	below
O	a
O	huge
O	mastiff
O	was
O	raging
O	on
O	his
O	chain
O	.
O	``
O	Go
O	down
O	and
O	let
O	loose
O	the
O	dog
O	!
O	``
O	the
O	wife
O	of
O	Mac-Guffog
O	called
O	to
O	her
O	husband
O	;
O	``
O	I
O	tell
O	you
O	they
O	are
O	breaking
O	in
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	liquor
O	store
O	!
O	``
O	But
O	the
O	good
O	man
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	more
O	anxious
O	about
O	his
O	prisoners
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	from
O	cell
O	to
O	cell
O	,
O	making
O	sure
O	that
O	all
O	was
O	safe
O	,
O	while
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	affirming
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	a
O	chicken
O	,
O	descended
O	herself
O	into
O	the
O	courtyard
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	,
O	Bertram
O	and
O	Dandie
O	watched
O	from
O	their
O	barred
O	window
O	the
O	savage
O	figures
O	of
O	the
O	smugglers
O	triumphantly
O	loading
O	their
O	boats
O	with
O	their
O	recovered
O	goods
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	whole
O	custom-house
O	flamed
O	to
O	the
O	heavens
O	,
O	sending
O	sparks
O	and
O	blazing
O	fragments
O	upon
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	the
O	adjoining
O	prison
O	.
O	Soon
O	at
O	the
O	outer
O	gate
O	was
O	heard
O	the
O	thunder
O	of
O	sledge-hammers
O	and
O	crows
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	being
O	forced
O	by
O	the
O	smugglers
O	.
O	Mac-Guffog

O	of

O	of

O	One
O	of

O	,

O	to

O	,
O	the
O	smugglers
O	became
O	somewhat
O	separated
O	from

O	.
O	The

O	of
O	cavalry
O	approaching
