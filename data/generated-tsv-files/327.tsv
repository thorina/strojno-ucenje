O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	gathering
O	darkness
O	,
O	once
O	more
O	to
O	climb
O	the
O	cliff
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	seek
O	further
O	assistance
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	old
O	Blue-Gown
O	withheld
O	him
O	.
O	No
O	cragsman
O	in
O	broadest
O	daylight
O	could
O	do
O	such
O	a
O	thing
O	,
O	he
O	asserted
O	.
O	Even
O	he
O	himself
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	fullest
O	of
O	his
O	strength
O	,
O	would
O	never
O	have
O	attempted
O	the
O	feat
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	death
O	to
O	ascend
O	ten
O	yards
O	.
O	Miss
O	Wardour
O	begged
O	that
O	neither
O	of
O	them
O	should
O	try
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	already
O	much
O	better
O	,
O	she
O	said
O	.
O	Besides
O	,
O	their
O	presence
O	was
O	needed
O	to
O	control
O	her
O	father
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	clearly
O	not
O	responsible
O	for
O	his
O	actions
O	.
O	Just
O	then
O	a
O	faint
O	halloo
O	came
O	from
O	high
O	above
O	.
O	Edie
O	answered
O	it
O	with
O	a
O	shout
O	,
O	waving
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	Miss
O	Wardour
O	'
O	s
O	handkerchief
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	his
O	long
O	beggar
O	'
O	s
O	staff
O	,
O	as
O	far
O	out
O	from
O	the
O	cliff
O	as
O	possible
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	the
O	signals
O	were
O	so
O	regularly
O	replied
O	to
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	forlorn
O	party
O	on
O	Bessie
O	'
O	s
O	Apron
O	knew
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	again
O	within
O	hearing
O	,
O	if
O	not
O	within
O	reach
O	,
O	of
O	friendly
O	assistance
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	cliffs
O	Monkbarns
O	was
O	heading
O	the
O	party
O	of
O	searchers
O	.
O	Saunders
O	Mucklebackit
O	,
O	an
O	old
O	fisherman
O	and
O	smuggler
O	,
O	had
O	charge
O	of
O	the
O	rescue
O	apparatus
O	.
O	This
O	consisted
O	of
O	the
O	mast
O	of
O	a
O	boat
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	yard
O	firmly
O	fixed
O	across
O	it
O	.
O	Through
O	the
O	ends
O	of
O	the
O	yard
O	a
O	rope
O	ran
O	in
O	two
O	blocks
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	this
O	Saunders
O	hoped
O	to
O	lower
O	a
O	chair
O	down
O	the
O	cliffs
O	,
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	which
O	(
O	said
O	the
O	old
O	smuggler
O	)
O	the
O	whole
O	party
O	would
O	presently
O	be
O	``
O	boused
O	up
O	and
O	landed
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	as
O	safe
O	as
O	so
O	many
O	kegs
O	of
O	brandy
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	chair
O	was
O	accordingly
O	let
O	down
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	a
O	second
O	rope
O	--
O	which
O	,
O	being
O	held
O	by
O	some
O	one
O	below
O	,
O	would
O	keep
O	the
O	chair
O	from
O	dashing
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	wind
O	against
O	the
O	rock
O	.
O	This
O	Saunders
O	called
O	the
O	``
O	guy
O	``
O	or
O	guide

O	.
O	Miss
O	Wardour
O	,
O	after
O	some
O	persuasion
O	,
O	mounted
O	first
O	,
O	being
O	carefully
O	bound
O	in
O	the
O	rude
O	seat
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	Lovel
O	'
O	s
O	handkerchief

O	in
O	addition
O	to
O	the
O	mendicant
O	'
O	s
O	broad
O	leathern
O	belt
O	passed
O	about
O	her
O	waist
O	.
O	Sir
O	Arthur
O	,
O	whose
O	brain
O	appeared
O	quite
O	dazed
O	,
O	continued
O	loudly
O	to
O	protest
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	are
O	you
O	doing
O	with
O	my
O	bairn

O	the

O	away
O	,
O	the

O	mounted
O	,
O	intently
O	watched

O	,
O	who
O	stood
O	holding
O	the
O	guide
O	rope
O	,
O	to
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	lady
O	'
O	s
O	white
O	dress
O	.
O	Miss
O	Wardour
O	was
O	duly
O	and
O	safely
O	landed
O	.
O	Sir
O	Arthur
O	and
O	Edie
O	followed
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	remained
O	for
O	Lovel
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	more
O	hazardous
O	final
O	ascent
O	.
O	For
O	now
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	one
O	left
O	below
O	to
O	help
O	him
O	by
O	holding
O	the
O	``
O	guy

O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	being
O	young
O	and
O	accustomed
O	to
O	danger
O	,
O	he
O	managed
O	,
O	though
O	much
O	banged
O	and
O	buffeted
O	about
O	by
O	the
O	wind
O	,
O	to
O	fend
O	himself
O	off
O	the
O	rocks
O	with
O	the
O	long
O	pike-staff
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
O	beggar
O	,
O	which
O	Edie
O	had
O	left
O	him
O	for
O	that
O	purpose
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	only
O	when
O	Lovel
O	reached
O	the
O	safety
O	of
O	the
O	cliff
O	that
O	he
O	felt
O	himself
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	a
O	little
O	faint
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	himself
O	Sir
O	Arthur
O	had
O	already

O	to

O	saw
O	of
O	the
O	girl

O	vanishing
O	through
O	the
O	storm
O	.
O	``
O	She
O	did
O	not
O	even
O	think
O	it
O	worth
O	while
O	waiting
O	to
O	see
O	whether
O	I
O	was
O	dead
O	or
O	alive
O	--

O	``
O	And
O	he

O	Fairport
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	,
O	without
O	visiting
O	Knockwinnock
O	,
O	or
O	again
O	seeing
O	Miss

O	.
O	But
O	what
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	was
O	that
O	Miss
O	Wardour
O	had
O	waited
O	till
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	assured
O	that
O	Lovel
O	was
O	safe
O	and
O	sound
O	,
O	having
O	sent
O	Sir
O	Arthur
O	on
O	before
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	carriage
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	was
O	not
O	aware
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	shown
O	him
O	even
O	this
O	limited
O	sympathy
O	,
O	his
O	heart
O	continued
O	to
O	be
O	bitter
O	within
O	him
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	arranged
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	sleep
O	that
O	night
O	at
O	Monkbarns
O	.
O	Indeed
O	Mr
O	.
O	Oldbuck
O	would
O	hear
O	of
O	no
O	other
O	way
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	Antiquary
O	had
O	looked
O	forward
O	to
O	the
O	chicken
O	pie
O	and
O	the
O	bottle
O	of
O	port
O	which
O	Sir
O	Arthur
O	had
O	left
O	untasted
O	when
O	he
O	bounced
O	off
O	in
O	a
O	fume
O	.
O	What
O	then
O	was
O	his
O	wrath
O	when
O	his
O	sister
O	,
O	Miss
O	Grizel
O	,
O	told
O	him
O	how
O	that
O	the
O	minister
O	of
O	Trotcosey
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	Blattergowl
O	,
O	having
O	come
O	down
O	to
O	Monkbarns
O	to
O	sympathise
O	with
O	the
O	peril
O	of
O	all
O	concerned
O	,
O	had
O	so
O	much
O	affected
O	Miss
O	Oldbuck
O	by
O	his
O	show
O	of
O	anxiety
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	set
O	the
O	pie
O	and
O	the
O	wine
O	before
O	him
O	--
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	accordingly
O	consumed
O	to
O	show
O	his
O	good-will
O	.
O	But
O	after
O	some
O	very
O	characteristic
O	grumbling
O	,
O	cold
O	beef
O	and
O	hard-boiled
O	eggs
O	did
O	just
O	as
O	well
O	for
O	the
O	two
O	friends
O	,
O	and
O	while
O	Lovel
O	partook
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	Miss
O	Grizel
O	entertained
O	him
O	with
O	tales
O	of
O	the
O	Green
O	Room
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	This
O	apartment
O	was
O	haunted
O	,
O	it
O	seemed
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	spirit
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	Oldenbuck
O	,
O	the
O	celebrated
O	printer
O	of
O	the
O	Augsburg
O	Confession
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	even
O	appeared
O	in
O	person
O	to
O	a
O	certain
O	town-clerk
O	of
O	Fairport
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	him
O	(
O	at
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	his
O	toe
O	)
O	upstairs
O	to
O	an
O	old
O	cabinet
O	in
O	which
O	was
O	stored
O	away
O	the
O	very
O	document
O	for
O	the
O	want
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	lairds
O	of
O	Monkbarns
O	were
O	likely
O	to
O	be
O	worsted
O	in
O	a
O	famous
O	lawsuit
O	before
O	the
O	Court
O	of
O	Session
O	in
O	Edinburgh
O	.
O	Furthermore
O	,
O	a
O	famous
O	German
O	professor
O	,
O	a
O	very
O	learned
O	man
O	,
O	Dr
O	.
O	Heavysterne
O	by
O	name
O	,
O	had
O	found
O	his
O	rest
O	so
O	much
O	disturbed
O	in
O	that
O	very
O	room
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	never
O	again
O	be
O	persuaded
O	to
O	sleep
O	there
O	.
O	Lovel
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	laughed
O	at
O	such
O	fears
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	accordingly
O	shown
O	by
O	the
O	Antiquary
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	famous
O	Green
O	Room
O	,
O	a
O	large
O	chamber
O	with
O	walls
O	covered
O	by
O	a
O	tapestry
O	of
O	hunting
O	scenes
O	,
O	--
O	stags
O	,
O	boars
O	,
O	hounds
O	,
O	and
O	huntsmen
O	,
O	all
O	mixed
O	together
O	under
O	the
O	greenwood
O	tree
O	,
O	the
O	boughs
O	of
O	which
O	,
O	interlacing
O	above
O	,
O	gave
O	its
O	name
O	to
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	Lovel
O	fell
O	asleep
O	after
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	still
O	bitterly
O	meditating
O	on
O	how
O	unkindly
O	Miss
O	Wardour
O	had
O	used
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	thoughts
O	,
O	mixed
O	with
O	the
O	perilous
O	adventures
O	of
O	the
O	evening
O	,
O	made
O	him
O	not
O	a
O	little
O	feverish
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	his
O	dreams
O	were
O	wild
O	,
O	confused
O	,
O	and
O	impossible
O	.
O	He
O	flew
O	like
O	a
O	bird
O	.
O	He
O	swam
O	like
O	a
O	fish
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	upborne
O	on
O	clouds
O	,
O	and
O	dashed
O	on
O	rocks
O	which
O	yet
O	received
O	him
O	soft
O	as
O	pillows
O	of
O	down
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	gloom
O	a
O	figure
O	approached
O	his
O	bedside
O	,
O	separating
O	himself
O	from
O	the
O	wild
O	race
O	of
O	the
O	huntsmen
O	upon
O	the
O	green
O	tapestry
O	,
O	--
O	a
O	figure
O	like
O	that
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	described
O	to
O	him
O	as
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
O	first
O	laird
O	of
O	Monkbarns
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	dressed
O	in
O	antique
O	Flemish
O	garb
O	,
O	a
O	furred
O	Burgomaster
O	cap
O	was
O	on
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	held
O	in
O	his
O	hands
O	a
O	black
O	volume
O	with
O	clasps
O	of
O	brass
O	.
O	Lovel
O	strove
O	to
O	speak
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	as
O	usual
O	in
O	such
O	cases
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	utter
O	a
O	word
O	.
O	His
O	tongue
O	refused
O	its
O	office
O	.
O	The
O	awful
O	figure
O	held
O	up
O	a
O	warning
O	finger
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	began
O	deliberately
O	to
O	unclasp
O	the
O	volume
O	he
O	held
O	in
O	his
O	hands
O	.
O	He
O	turned
O	the
O	leaves
O	hastily
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	;
O	then
O	,
O	holding
O	the
O	book
O	aloft
O	in
O	his
O	left
O	hand
O	,
O	he
O	pointed
O	with
O	his
O	right
O	to
O	a
O	line
O	which
O	seemed

O	the

O	A
