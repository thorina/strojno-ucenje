O	FRANK
O	THE

O	FRANK
O	OSBALDISTONE
O	had
O	come
O	back
O	from
O	France
O	to
O	quarrel
O	with
O	his
O	father
O	.
O	A
O	merchant
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	.
O	He
O	hated
O	the
O	three-legged
O	stool
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	used
O	the
O	counting-house
O	quills
O	to
O	write
O	verses
O	with
O	.
O	His
O	four
O	years
O	in
O	Bordeaux
O	had
O	spoiled
O	him
O	for
O	strict
O	business
O	,
O	without
O	teaching
O	him
O	anything
O	else
O	practical
O	enough
O	to
O	please
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	his
O	son
O	persisted
O	in
O	declining
O	the
O	stool
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	counting-room
O	in
O	Crane
O	Alley
O	,
O	packed
O	him
O	off
O	to
O	the

O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	Sir
O	Hildebrand
O	Osbaldistone
O	of
O	Osbaldistone
O	Hall
O	in
O	Northumberland

O	to

O	of
O	his
O	disobedience
O	.
O	``
O	I

O	to
O	the

O	Road
O	accordingly
O	,
O	an
O	exile
O	from
O	his
O	home
O	and
O	disinherited
O	of
O	his
O	patrimony
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	he
O	was
O	gloomy
O	enough
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	leaving
O	behind
O	him
O	wealth
O	,
O	ease
O	,
O	society
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	looked
O	back
O	from
O	the
O	heights
O	of
O	Highgate
O	,
O	the
O	bells
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	steeples
O	rang
O	out
O	their
O	``
O	Turn

O	``
O	And
O	to
O	tell
O	the
O	truth
O	,
O	Frank
O	Osbaldistone
O	felt
O	half
O	inclined
O	to
O	obey
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	grave
O	scorn
O	held
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	purpose
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	the
O	delights
O	of
O	travel
O	and
O	the
O	quickly
O	changing
O	scene
O	chased
O	the
O	sadness
O	from
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	as
O	was
O	natural
O	to
O	a
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	a
O	good
O	horse
O	under
O	his
O	thigh
O	and
O	fifty
O	guineas
O	in
O	his
O	pocket
O	helped
O	amazingly
O	to
O	put
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	best
O	humour
O	with
O	himself
O	.
O	The
O	company
O	Frank
O	met
O	with
O	on
O	the
O	North
O	Road
O	was
O	commonplace
O	and
O	dull
O	.
O	But
O	one
O	poor
O	man
O	,
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	army
O	officer
O	in
O	a
O	gold-laced
O	hat
O	,
O	whose
O	martial
O	courage
O	was
O	more
O	than
O	doubtful
O	,
O	amused
O	Frank
O	Osbaldistone
O	by
O	clinging
O	desperately
O	to
O	a
O	small
O	but
O	apparently
O	very
O	heavy
O	portmanteau
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	carried
O	on
O	the
O	pillion
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	never
O	parting
O	from
O	it
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	.
O	This
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	talk
O	was
O	all
O	of
O	well-dressed
O	highwaymen
O	,
O	whose
O	conversation
O	and
O	manners
O	induced
O	the
O	unwary
O	to
O	join
O	company
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	Then
O	in
O	some
O	shady
O	dell
O	whistling
O	up
O	their
O	men
O	,
O	the
O	unlucky
O	traveller
O	found
O	himself
O	despoiled
O	--
O	of
O	his
O	goods
O	certainly
O	,
O	perhaps
O	also
O	of
O	his
O	life
O	.
O	It
O	delighted
O	Frank
O	'
O	s
O	boyish
O	humour
O	beyond
O	measure
O	to
O	play
O	upon
O	the
O	fears
O	of
O	this
O	gallant
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	officer
O	--
O	which
O	he
O	proceeded
O	to
O	do
O	by
O	asking
O	him
O	first
O	whether
O	his
O	bag
O	were
O	heavy
O	or
O	not
O	,
O	then
O	by
O	hinting
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	like
O	to
O	be
O	informed
O	as
O	to
O	his
O	route
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	by
O	offering
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	bag
O	on
O	his
O	own
O	pillion
O	and
O	race
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	added
O	weight
O	to
O	the
O	nearest
O	village
O	.
O	This
O	last
O	audacious
O	proposal
O	almost
O	took
O	the
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	breath
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	that
O	moment
O	he
O	was
O	convinced
O	that
O	Frank
O	was
O	none
O	other
O	than
O	the
O	``
O	Golden
O	Farmer
O	``
O	himself
O	in
O	disguise
O	.
O	At
O	Darlington
O	,
O	the
O	landlord
O	of
O	their
O	inn
O	introduced
O	a
O	Scotch

O	,
O	a
O	certain
O	Mr
O	.
O	Campbell
O	,
O	to
O	share
O	their
O	meal
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	stern-faced
O	,
O	dark-complexioned
O	man
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	martial
O	countenance
O	and
O	an
O	air
O	of
O	instinctive
O	command
O	which
O	took
O	possession
O	of
O	the
O	company
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	The
O	lawyer
O	,
O	the
O	doctor
O	,
O	the
O	clergyman
O	,
O	even
O	Frank
O	himself
O	,
O	found
O	themselves
O	listening
O	with
O	deference
O	to
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	this
O	plainly
O	dressed
O	,
O	unobtrusive
O	,
O	Scottish
O	drover
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	man
O	with
O	the
O	weighty
O	bag
O	,
O	he
O	fairly
O	hung
O	upon
O	his
O	words
O	.
O	And
O	especially
O	so
O	when
O	the
O	landlord
O	informed
O	the
O	company
O	that
O	Mr
O	.
O	Campbell
O	had
O	with

O	.
O	``
O	Thou

O	And
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	short
O	answers
O	,
O	he
O	continued
O	to
O	press
O	his
O	proposal
O	upon
O	the
O	unwilling
O	Scot
O	,
O	till
O	Campbell
O	had
O	very
O	unceremoniously
O	to
O	extricate
O	himself
O	from

O	grip
O	,
O	telling
O	him

O	travelling
O	upon

O	The
O	next

O	Frank
O	approached
O	Osbaldistone
O	Hall
O	,
O	which
O	stood
O	under
O	the
O	great
O	rounded
O	range

O	standing
O	,
O	stark
O	and
O	grey
O	,
O	among
O	its
O	ancestral
O	oaks
O	,
O	when
O	down
O	the
O	ravine
O	streamed
O	a
O	band
O	of

O	full

O	The
