O	Sir
O	--
O	Agreeably
O	to
O	my
O	promise
O	,
O	I
O	now
O	relate
O	to
O	you
O	all
O	the
O	particulars
O	of
O	the
O	lost
O	man
O	and
O	child
O	which
O	I
O	have
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	collect
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	entirely
O	owing
O	to
O	the
O	humane
O	interest
O	you
O	seemed
O	to
O	take
O	in
O	the
O	report
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	have
O	pursued
O	the
O	inquiry
O	to
O	the
O	following
O	result
O	.
O	You
O	may
O	remember
O	that
O	business
O	called
O	me
O	to
O	Boston
O	in
O	the
O	summer
O	of
O	1820
O	.
O	I
O	sailed
O	in
O	the
O	packet
O	to
O	Providence
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	arrived
O	there
O	I
O	learned
O	that
O	every
O	seat
O	in
O	the
O	stage
O	was
O	engaged
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	thus
O	obliged
O	either
O	to
O	wait
O	a
O	few
O	hours
O	or
O	accept
O	a
O	seat
O	with
O	the
O	driver
O	,
O	who
O	civilly
O	offered
O	me
O	that
O	accommodation
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	I
O	took
O	my
O	seat
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	found
O	him
O	intelligent
O	and
O	communicative
O	.
O	When
O	we
O	had
O	travelled
O	about
O	ten
O	miles
O	,
O	the
O	horses
O	suddenly
O	threw
O	their
O	ears
O	on
O	their
O	necks
O	,
O	as
O	flat
O	as
O	a
O	hare
O	'
O	s
O	.
O	Said
O	the
O	driver
O	,
O	``
O	Have
O	you
O	a
O	surtout
O	with
O	you
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	No
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	I
O	;
O	``
O	why
O	do
O	you
O	ask
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	You
O	will
O	want
O	one
O	soon
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	;
O	``
O	do
O	you
O	observe
O	the
O	ears
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	horses
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	Yes
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	just
O	about
O	to
O	ask
O	the
O	reason
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	They
O	see
O	the
O	storm-breeder
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	shall
O	see
O	him
O	soon
O	.
O	``
O	At
O	this
O	moment
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	cloud
O	visible
O	in
O	the
O	firmament
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	a
O	small
O	speck
O	appeared
O	in
O	the
O	road
O	.
O	``
O	There
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	my
O	companion
O	,
O	``
O	comes
O	the
O	storm-breeder
O	;
O	he
O	always
O	leaves
O	a
O	Scotch

O	behind
O	him
O	.
O	By
O	many
O	a
O	wet
O	jacket
O	do
O	I
O	remember
O	him
O	.
O	I
O	suppose
O	the
O	poor
O	fellow
O	suffers
O	much
O	himself
O	,
O	much
O	more
O	than
O	is
O	known
O	to
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	``
O	Presently
O	a
O	man
O	with
O	a
O	child
O	beside
O	him
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	large
O	black
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	weather-beaten
O	chair
O	,
O	once
O	built
O	for
O	a
O	chaise
O	body
O	,
O	passed
O	in
O	great
O	haste
O	,
O	apparently
O	at
O	the
O	rate
O	of
O	twelve
O	miles
O	an
O	hour
O	.
O	He
O	seemed
O	to
O	grasp
O	the
O	reins
O	of
O	his
O	horse
O	with
O	firmness
O	,
O	and
O	appeared
O	to
O	anticipate
O	his
O	speed
O	.
O	He
O	seemed
O	dejected
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	anxiously
O	at
O	the
O	passengers
O	,
O	particularly
O	at
O	the
O	stage-driver
O	and
O	myself
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	moment
O	after
O	he
O	passed
O	us
O	,
O	the
O	horses
O	'
O	ears
O	were
O	up
O	and
O	bent
O	themselves
O	forward
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	nearly
O	met
O	.
O	``
O	Who

O	have
O	been
O	so
O	often
O	asked
O	the

O	by
O	that

O	even

O	of
O	late
O	I
O	have
O	refused
O	any

O	with

O	,
O	and

O	such

O	``
O	We
O	were
O	now
O	ascending
O	a
O	high
O	hill
O	in
O	Walpole
O	,

O	as
O	we
O	had
O	a
O	fair
O	view
O	of
O	the
O	heavens
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	rather
O	disposed
O	to
O	jeer
O	the
O	driver
O	for
O	thinking
O	of
O	his
O	surtout
O	,

O	could
O	be
O	discerned
O	.
O	``

O	said
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	in
O	the

O	the

O	``
O	We
O	presently
O	approached
O	another
O	hill
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	at
O	the
O	height
O	,
O	the
O	driver
O	pointed
O	out
O	in
O	an
O	eastern
O	direction
O	a
O	little
O	black
O	speck
O	as
O	big

O	``
O	There
O	,

O	said
O	he

O	``
O	And
O	now
O	the
O	horses
O	,
O	as
O	though
O	taught
O	by
O	instinct
O	,
O	hastened
O	with
O	increased
O	speed
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	black
O	cloud
O	came
O	on
O	rolling
O	over
O	the
O	turnpike
O	,
O	and
O	doubled
O	and
O	trebled
O	itself
O	in
O	all
O	directions
O	.
O	The
O	appearance
O	of
O	this
O	cloud
O	attracted
O	the
O	notice
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	passengers
O	;
O	for
O	after
O	it
O	had
O	spread
O	itself
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	bulk
O	,
O	it
O	suddenly
O	became
O	more
O	limited
O	in
O	circumference
O	,
O	grew
O	more
O	compact
O	,
O	dark
O	,
O	and
O	consolidated
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	the
O	successive
O	flashes
O	of
O	chain
O	lightning
O	caused
O	the
O	whole
O	cloud
O	to
O	appear
O	like
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	irregular
O	network
O	,
O	and
O	displayed
O	a
O	thousand
O	fantastic
O	images
O	.
O	The
O	driver
O	bespoke
O	my
O	attention
O	to
O	a
O	remarkable
O	configuration
O	in
O	the
O	cloud
O	;
O	he
O	said
O	every
O	flash
O	of
O	lightning
O	near
O	its
O	centre
O	discovered
O	to
O	him
O	distinctly
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	sitting
O	in
O	an
O	open
O	carriage
O	drawn
O	by
O	a
O	black
O	horse
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	truth
O	I
O	saw
O	no
O	such
O	thing
O	.
O	The
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	fancy
O	was
O	doubtless
O	at
O	fault
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	a
O	very
O	common
O	thing
O	for
O	the
O	imagination
O	to
O	paint
O	for
O	the
O	senses
O	,
O	both
O	in
O	the
O	visible
O	and
O	invisible
O	world
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	the
O	distant
O	thunder
O	gave
O	notice
O	of
O	a
O	shower
O	at
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	just
O	as
O	we
O	reached
O	Polley
O	'

O	the

O	a
O	respectable-looking
O	man
O	in
O	a

O	excited
O	some
O	little
O	sympathy
O	among

O	Ah
O	,
O	I
O	perceive

O	shows
O	by
O	his
O	impatience
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	in
O	a
O	strange

O	.
O	Absurd
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	mistaken
O	this

O	for
O	the

O	at
O	a

O	youth
O	;
O	that
O	his

O	caused
O	some

O	own
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Peter
O	Rugg
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	if
O	my
O	grandfather
O	was
O	worthy
O	of
O	credit
O	,
O	once
O	lived
O	in
O	Middle
O	Street
O	,
O	in
O	this
O	city
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	in
O	comfortable
O	circumstances
O	,
O	had
O	a
O	wife
O	and
O	one
O	daughter
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	generally
O	esteemed
O	for
O	his
O	sober
O	life
O	and
O	manners
O	.
O	But
O	unhappily
O	his
O	temper
O	at
O	times
O	was
O	altogether
O	ungovernable
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	his
O	language
O	was
O	terrible
O	.
O	In
O	these
O	fits
O	of
O	passion
O	,
O	if
O	a
O	door
O	stood
O	in
O	his
O	way
O	he
O	would
O	never
O	do
O	less
O	than
O	kick
O	a
O	panel
O	through
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	sometimes
O	throw
O	his
O	heels
O	over
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	come
O	down
O	on
O	his
O	feet
O	,
O	uttering
O	oaths
O	in
O	a
O	circle
O	.
O	And
O	thus
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	rage
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	who
O	performed
O	a
O	somerset
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	what
O	others
O	have
O	since
O	learned
O	to
O	do
O	for
O	merriment
O	and
O	money
O	.
O	Once
O	Rugg
O	was
O	seen
O	to
O	bite
O	a
O	tenpenny
O	nail
O	in
O	halves
O	.
O	In
O	those
O	days
O	everybody
O	,
O	both
O	men
O	and
O	boys
O	,
O	wore
O	wigs
O	;
O	and
O	Peter
O	,
O	at
O	these
O	moments
O	of
O	violent
O	passion
O	,
O	would
O	become
O	so
O	profane
O	that
O	his
O	wig
O	would
O	rise
O	up
O	from
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	Some
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	terrible
O	language
O	;
O	others
O	accounted
O	for
O	it
O	in
O	a
O	more
O	philosophical
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	caused
O	by
O	the
O	expansion
O	of
O	his
O	scalp
O	,
O	as
O	violent
O	passion
O	,
O	we
O	know
O	,
O	will
O	swell
O	the
O	veins
O	and
O	expand
O	the
O	head
O	.
O	While
O	these
O	fits
O	were
O	on
O	him
O	,
O	Rugg
O	had
O	no
O	respect
O	for
O	heaven
O	or
O	earth
O	.
O	Except
O	this
O	infirmity
O	,
O	all
O	agreed
O	that
O	Rugg
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	soft
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	;
O	for
O	when
O	his
O	fits
O	were
O	over
O	,
O	nobody
O	was
O	so
O	ready
O	to
O	commend
O	a
O	placid
O	temper
O	as
O	Peter
O	.
O	``
O	It
O	was
O	late
O	in
O	autumn
O	,
O	one
O	morning
O	,
O	that
O	Rugg
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	chair
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	fine
O	large
O	bay
O	horse
O	,
O	took
O	his
O	daughter
O	and
O	proceeded
O	to
O	Concord
O	.
O	On
O	his
O	return
O	a
O	violent
O	storm
O	overtook
O	him
O	.
O	At
O	dark
O	he
O	stopped
O	in
O	Menotomy
O	(
O	now
O	West
O	Cambridge
O	)
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	a
O	Mr
O	.
O	Cutter
O	,
O	a
O	friend
O	of
O	his
O	,
O	who
O	urged
O	him
O	to
O	tarry
O	overnight
O	.
O	On
O	Rugg
O	'
O	s
O	declining
O	to
O	stop
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	Cutter
O	urged
O	him
O	vehemently
O	.
O	'
O	Why
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	Rugg
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Cutter
O	,
O	'
O	the
O	storm
O	is
O	overwhelming
O	you
O	;
O	the
O	night
O	is
O	exceeding
O	dark
O	;
O	your
O	little
O	daughter
O	will
O	perish
O	;
O	you
O	are
O	in
O	an
O	open
O	chair
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	tempest
O	is
O	increasing
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	_Let
O	the
O	storm
O	increase_
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Rugg
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	fearful
O	oath
O	,
O	'
O	_I
O	will
O	see
O	home
O	to-night
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	last
O	tempest
O	!
O	or
O	may
O	I
O	never
O	see
O	home_
O	.
O	'
O	At
O	these
O	words
O	he
O	gave
O	his
O	whip
O	to
O	his
O	high-spirited
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	disappeared
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	.
O	But
O	Peter
O	Rugg
O	did
O	not
O	reach
O	home
O	that
O	night
O	,
O	nor
O	the
O	next
O	;
O	nor
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	became
O	a
O	missing
O	man
O	,
O	could
O	he
O	ever
O	be
O	traced
O	beyond
O	Mr
O	.
O	Cutter
O	'
O	s
O	in
O	Menotomy
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	after
O	,
O	on
O	every
O	dark
O	and
O	stormy
O	night
O	,
O	the
O	wife
O	of
O	Peter
O	Rugg
O	would
O	fancy
O	she
O	heard
O	the
O	crack
O	of
O	a
O	whip
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fleet
O	tread
O	of
O	a
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rattling
O	of
O	a
O	carriage
O	,
O	passing
O	her
O	door
O	.
O	The
O	neighbours
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	heard
O	the
O	same
O	noises
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	said
O	they
O	knew
O	it
O	was
O	Rugg
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	;
O	the
O	tread
O	on
O	the
O	pavement
O	was
O	perfectly
O	familiar
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	This
O	occurred
O	so
O	repeatedly
O	that
O	at
O	length
O	the
O	neighbours
O	watched
O	with
O	lanterns
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	real
O	Peter
O	Rugg
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	horse
O	and
O	chair
O	,
O	and
O	child
O	sitting
O	beside
O	him
O	,
O	pass
O	directly
O	before
O	his
O	own
O	door
O	,
O	his
O	head
O	turning
O	toward
O	his
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	himself
O	making
O	every
O	effort
O	to
O	stop
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	the
O	friends
O	of
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Rugg
O	exerted
O	themselves
O	to
O	find
O	her
O	husband
O	and
O	child
O	.
O	They
O	inquired
O	at
O	every
O	public
O	house
O	and
O	stable
O	in
O	town
O	;
O	but
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	that
O	Rugg
O	made
O	any
O	stay
O	in
O	Boston
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	,
O	after
O	Rugg
O	had
O	passed
O	his
O	own
O	door
O	,
O	could
O	give
O	any
O	account
O	of
O	him
O	;
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	asserted
O	by
O	some
O	that
O	the
O	clatter
O	of
O	Rugg
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	and
O	carriage
O	over
O	the
O	pavements
O	shook
O	the
O	houses
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	street
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	is
O	credible
O	,
O	if
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	Rugg
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	and
O	carriage
O	did
O	pass
O	on
O	that
O	night
O	.
O	For
O	at
O	this
O	day
O	,
O	in
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	streets
O	,
O	a
O	loaded
O	truck
O	or
O	team
O	in
O	passing
O	will
O	shake
O	the
O	houses
O	like
O	an
O	earthquake
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	Rugg
O	'
O	s
O	neighbours
O	never
O	afterward
O	watched
O	again
O	;
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	treated
O	it
O	all
O	as
O	a
O	delusion
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	no
O	more
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	Others
O	,
O	of
O	a
O	different
O	opinion
O	,
O	shook
O	their
O	heads
O	and
O	said
O	nothing
O	.
O	Thus
O	Rugg
O	and
O	his
O	child
O	,
O	horse
O	and
O	chair
O	,
O	were
O	soon
O	forgotten
O	;
O	and
O	probably
O	many
O	in
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	never
O	heard
O	a
O	word
O	on
O	the
O	subject
O	.
O	``
O	There
O	was
O	indeed
O	a
O	rumour
O	that
O	Rugg
O	afterward
O	was
O	seen
O	in
O	Connecticut
O	,
O	between
O	Suffield
O	and
O	Hartford
O	,
O	passing
O	through
O	the
O	country
O	like
O	a
O	streak
O	of
O	chalk
O	.
O	This
O	gave
O	occasion
O	to
O	Rugg
O	'
O	s
O	friends
O	to
O	make
O	further
O	inquiry
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	more
O	they
O	inquired
O	,
O	the
O	more
O	they
O	were
O	baffled
O	.
O	If
O	they
O	heard
O	of
O	Rugg
O	one
O	day
O	in
O	Connecticut
O	,
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	they
O	heard
O	of
O	him
O	winding
O	around
O	the
O	hills
O	in
O	New
O	Hampshire
O	;
O	and
O	soon
O	after
O	,
O	a
O	man
O	in
O	a
O	chair
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	small
O	child
O	,
O	exactly
O	answering
O	the
O	description
O	of
O	Peter
O	Rugg
O	,
O	would
O	be
O	seen
O	in
O	Rhode
O	Island
O	,
O	inquiring
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	Boston
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	that
O	which
O	chiefly
O	gave
O	a
O	colour
O	of
O	mystery
O	to
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	Peter
O	Rugg
O	was
O	the
O	affair
O	at
O	Charlestown
O	bridge
O	.
O	The
O	toll-gatherer
O	asserted
O	that
O	sometimes
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	darkest
O	and
O	most
O	stormy
O	nights
O	,
O	when
O	no
O	object
O	could
O	be
O	discerned
O	about
O	the
O	time
O	Rugg
O	was
O	missing
O	,
O	a
O	horse
O	and
O	wheelcarriage
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	noise
O	equal
O	to
O	a
O	troop
O	,
O	would
O	at
O	midnight
O	,
O	in
O	utter
O	contempt
O	of
O	the
O	rates
O	of
O	toll
O	,
O	pass
O	over
O	the
O	bridge
O	.
O	This
O	occurred
O	so
O	frequently
O	that
O	the
O	toll-gatherer
O	resolved
O	to
O	attempt
O	a
O	discovery
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	usual
O	time
O	,
O	apparently
O	the
O	same
O	horse
O	and
O	carriage
O	approached
O	the
O	bridge
O	from
O	Charlestown
O	square
O	.
O	The
O	toll-gatherer
O	,
O	prepared
O	,
O	took
O	his
O	stand
O	as
O	near
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	bridge
O	as
O	he
O	dared
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	large
O	three-legged
O	stool
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	appearance
O	passed
O	,
O	he
O	threw
O	the
O	stool
O	at
O	the
O	horse
O	,
O	but
O	heard
O	nothing
O	except
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	the
O	stool
O	skipping
O	across
O	the
O	bridge
O	.
O	The
O	toll-gatherer
O	on
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	asserted
O	that
O	the
O	stool
O	went
O	directly
O	through
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	persisted
O	in
O	that
O	belief
O	ever
O	after
O	.
O	Whether
O	Rugg
O	,
O	or
O	whoever
O	the
O	person
O	was
O	,
O	ever
O	passed
O	the
O	bridge
O	again
O	,
O	the
O	toll-gatherer
O	would
O	never
O	tell
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	questioned
O	,
O	seemed
O	anxious
O	to
