O	A
O	long
O	,
O	long
O	time
O	ago
O	there
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	hut
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	inland
O	lakes
O	of
O	Erin
O	,
O	an
O	old
O	fisherman
O	and
O	his
O	son
O	.
O	The
O	hut
O	was
O	built
O	on
O	stakes
O	driven
O	into
O	the
O	bed
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	so
O	high
O	above
O	the
O	waters
O	that
O	even
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	stirred
O	into
O	waves
O	by
O	the
O	wind
O	coming
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	mountains
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	reach
O	the

O	.
O	Around
O	,
O	outside
O	the
O	hut
O	,
O	on
O	a
O	level
O	with
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	little

O	s
O	curragh
O	,
O	made
O	of
O	willows
O	,
O	covered
O	with
O	skins
O	,
O	was
O	moored
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	the
O	curragh
O	that
O	he
O	and

O	,
O	Enda
O	,
O	could
O	leave
O	their
O	lake
O	dwelling
O	.
O	On
O	many
O	a
O	summer
O	evening
O	Enda
O	lay
O	stretched
O	on
O	the
O	platform
O	,
O	watching
O	the
O	sunset
O	fading
O	from
O	the
O	mountain-tops
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	twilight
O	creeping
O	over
O	the
O	waters
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
O	once
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	engaged
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	rustle
O	in
O	a
O	clump
O	of
O	sedge
O	that
O	grew
O	close
O	to
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	hut
O	.
O	He
O	turned
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	sound
O	came
O	from
O	,
O	and
O	what
O	should
O	he
O	see
O	but
O	an
O	otter
O	swimming
O	towards
O	him
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	little
O	trout
O	in
O	his
O	mouth
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	otter
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	where
O	Enda
O	was
O	lying
O	,
O	he
O	lifted
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	half
O	his
O	body
O	from
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	flung
O	the
O	trout
O	on
O	the
O	platform
O	,
O	almost
O	at
O	Enda
O	'
O	s
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	disappeared
O	.
O	Enda
O	took
O	the
O	little
O	panting
O	trout
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	;
O	but
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	so
O	he
O	heard
O	,
O	quite
O	close
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	a
O	sound
O	like
O	that
O	of
O	water
O	plashing
O	upon
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	widening
O	circles
O	caused
O	by
O	a
O	trout
O	which
O	had
O	just
O	risen
O	to
O	a
O	fly
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	trout
O	he
O	held
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	:
O	``
O	I

O	send
O	you
O	back
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	saying
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	dropped
O	the
O	little
O	trout
O	into
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	next
O	evening
O	came
O	,
O	again
O	Enda
O	was
O	lying
O	stretched
O	outside
O	the

O	once

O	the
O	otter
O	came

O	flung
O	the
O	little

O	almost
O	into

O	hands
O	.
O	Enda
O	,
O	more
O	surprised
O	than
O	ever
O	,
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	same
O	little
O	trout
O	the
O	otter
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	the
O	night
O	before

O	``
O	And
O	he
O	dropped
O	the
O	trout
O	into
O	the

O	;
O	but
O	no
O	sooner
O	had
O	it
O	touched
O	the

O	than
O	it

O	changed
O	into
O	a

O	,
O	milk-white
O	swan
O	.
O	And
O	Enda
O	could
O	hardly
O	believe
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	it
O	sailing
O	across
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	until
O	it
O	was
O	lost
O	in
O	the
O	sedges
O	growing
O	by
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	All
O	that
O	night
O	he
O	lay
O	awake
O	,
O	thinking
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	morning
O	stood
O	on
O	the
O	hill-tops
O	,
O	and
O	cast
O	its
O	shafts
O	of
O	golden
O	light
O	across
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	Enda
O	rose
O	and
O	got
O	into
O	his
O	curragh
O	.
O	He
O	rowed
O	all
O	round
O	the

O	,
O	beating
O	the
O	sedges
O	with
O	his

O	all
O	in
O	vain
O	;
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	catch
O	a
O	glimpse
O	of
O	her
O	white
O	plumage
O	anywhere
O	.
O	Day
O	after
O	day
O	he
O	rowed
O	about
O	the
O	lake
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	evening
O	he
O	lay
O	outside
O	the
O	hut
O	watching
O	the
O	waters
O	.
O	At
O	long
O	last
O	,
O	one
O	night
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	full
O	moon
O	,
O	rising
O	above
O	the
O	mountains
O	,
O	flooded
O	the
O	whole
O	lake
O	with
O	light
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	swan
O	coming
O	swiftly
O	towards
O	him
O	,
O	shining
O	brighter
O	than
O	the
O	moonbeams
O	.
O	The
O	swan
O	came
O	on
O	until
O	it

O	to

O	,
O	saying
O	this
O	,
O	she
O	turned
O	round
O	and
O	sailed
O	away
O	.
O	Enda
O	jumped
O	into
O	the
O	curragh
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	dripping
O	from
O	his
O	oar
O	,
O	was
O	flashing
O	like
O	diamonds
O	in
O	the
O	moonlight
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	rowed
O	after
O	the
O	swan
O	,
O	who
O	glided
O	on
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	until
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	shadows

O	mountains
O	lay
O	deepest
O	on
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	swan
O	rested
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	Enda
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	:

O	crystal

O	again
O	,
O	he
O	drove
O	his
O	spear
O	through
O	one
O	of
O	its
O	fiery
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	writhing
O	with
O	pain
O	,
O	the
O	hissing
O	dragon
O	darted
O	through

O	cave
O	behind
O	him
O	.
O	Enda
O	,
O	gaining
O	courage
O	from
O	the
O	dragon
O	'
O	s
O	flight
O	,
O	marched
O	on
O	until
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	door
O	of
O	dull
O	brass
O	set
O	in
O	the
O	rocks
O	.
O	He
O	tried

O	in
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	but

O	push
O	away
O	the
O	rocks
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	was
O	wondering
O	what
O	he
O	should
O	do
O	,
O	he
O	heard
O	again
O	the
O	fierce
O	hissing
O	of
O	the
O	dragon
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	red
O	glare
O	of
O	his
O	fiery
O	eye
O	dimly
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	Lifting
O	his
O	spear
O	and
O	hastily
O	turning
O	round
O	to
O	meet
O	the
O	furious
O	monster
O	,
O	Enda
O	accidentally
O	touched
O	the
O	door
O	with
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	the
O	spear
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	door
O	flew
O	open
O	.
O	Enda
O	passed
O	through
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	door
O	closed
O	behind
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	grating
O	sound
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	marched
O	along
O	through
O	a
O	rocky
O	pass
O	which
O	led
O	to
O	a
O	sandy
O	plain
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	stepped
O	from
O	the
O	pass
O	into
O	the
O	plain
O	the
O	sands
O	began
O	to
O	move
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	alive
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	second
O	a
O	thousand
O	hideous
O	serpents
O	,
O	almost
O	the
O	color
O	of
O	the
O	sand
O	,
O	rose
O	hissing
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	their
O	forked
O	tongues
O	made
O	a
O	horrible
O	,
O	poisonous
O	hedge
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	second
O	he
O	stood
O	dismayed
O	,
O	but
O	then
O	,
O	leveling
O	his
O	spear
O	,
O	he
O	rushed
O	against
O	the
O	hedge
O	of
O	serpents
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	,
O	shooting
O	poison
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	sank
O	beneath
O	the
O	sand
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	poison
O	did
O	not
O	harm
O	him
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	his
O	water-dress
O	and
O	crystal
O	helmet
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	passed
O	over
O	the
O	sandy
O	plain
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	climb
O	a
O	great
O	steep
O	,
O	jagged
O	rock
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	got
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	rock
O	he
O	saw
O	spread
O	out
O	before
O	him
O	a
O	stony
O	waste
O	without
O	a
O	tuft
O	or
O	blade
O	of
O	grass
O	.
O	At
O	some
O	distance
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	him
O	he
O	noticed
O	a
O	large
O	dark
O	object
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	took
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	but
O	on
O	looking
O	at
O	it
O	more
O	closely
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	huge
O	,
O	misshapen
O	,
O	swollen
O	mass
O	,
O	apparently
O	alive
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	was
O	growing
O	bigger
O	and
O	bigger
O	every
O	moment
O	.
O	Enda
O	stood
O	amazed
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	he
O	knew
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	loathsome
O	creature
O	rose
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	sprang
O	upon
O	him
O	before
O	he
O	could
O	use
O	his
O	spear
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	catching
O	him
O	in
O	its
O	horrid
O	grasp
O	,
O	flung
O	him
O	back
O	over
O	the
O	rocks
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	sandy
O	plain
O	.
O	Enda
O	was
O	almost
O	stunned
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	hissing
O	of
O	the
O	serpents
O	rising
O	from
O	the
O	sand
O	around
O	him
O	brought
O	him
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	jumping
O	to
O	his
O	feet
O	,
O	once
O	more
O	he
O	drove
O	them
O	down
O	beneath
O	the
O	surface
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	approached
O	the
O	jagged
O	rock
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	filthy
O	monster
O	glaring
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	bloodshot
O	eyes
O	.
O	Enda
O	poised
O	his
O	spear
O	and
O	hurled
O	it
O	against
O	his
O	enemy
O	.
O	It
O	entered
O	between
O	the
O	monster
O	'
O	s
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	wound
O	the
O	blood
O	flowed
O	down
O	like
O	a
O	black
O	torrent
O	and
O	dyed
O	the
O	plain
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	shrunken
O	carcass
O	slipped
O	down
O	the
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	rocks
O	and
O	disappeared
O	beneath
O	the
O	sand
O	.
O	Enda
O	once
O	more
O	ascended
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	without
O	meeting
O	or
O	seeing
O	anything
O	he
O	passed
O	over
O	the
O	stony
O	waste
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	leafy
O	wood
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	not
O	gone
O	far
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	until
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	fairy
O	music
O	,
O	and
O	walking
O	on
O	he
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	mossy
O	glade
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	fairies
O	dancing
O	around
O	their
O	queen
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	so
O	small
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	all
O	so
O	brightly
O	dressed
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	mass
O	of
O	waving
O	flowers
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	seen
O	by
O	them
O	they
O	vanished
O	like
O	a
O	glorious
O	dream
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	one
O	remained
O	before
O	him
O	but
O	the
O	fairy
O	queen
O	.
O	The
O	queen
O	blushed
O	at
O	finding
O	herself
O	alone
O	,
O	but
O	on
O	stamping
O	her
O	little
O	foot
O	three
O	times
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	the
O	frightened
O	fairies
O	all

O	And
O	the

O	At

O	into
O	his
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	placed
O	beside
O	his
O	couch
O	a
O	silver
O	helmet
O	and
O	a
O	silver
O	shield
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	rubbed
O	the
O	helmet
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	shield
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	blue
O	blade
O	and
O	haft
O	of
O	his
O	spear
O	with
O	the
O	juice
O	of
O	the
O	red
O	rowan
O	berries
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	let
O	a
O	drop
O	fall
O	upon
O	his
O	face
O	and
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	she
O	slid
O	out
O	as
O	silently
O	as
O	she
O	came
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	morning
O	broke
O	,
O	Enda
O	sprang
O	from
O	his
O	couch
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	hardly
O	believe
O	his
O	eyes
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	silver
O	shield
O	and
O	helmet
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	them
O	he
O	longed
O	for
O	the
O	hour
O	of
O	battle
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	watched
O	with
O	eager
O	gaze
O	the
O	sun
O	climbing
O	the
O	sky
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	hours
O	of
O	suspense
O	,
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	trumpet
O	'
O	s
O	sound
O	and
O	the
O	clangor
O	of
O	the
O	hollow
O	shields
O	,
O	struck
O	by
O	the
O	hard-pointed
O	spears
O	.
O	Putting
O	on
O	the
O	helmet
O	,
O	and
O	fastening
O	the
O	shield
O	upon
O	his
O	left
O	arm
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	the
O	spear
O	in
O	his
O	right
O	hand
O	,
O	he
O	stepped
O	out
O	bravely
O	to
O	the
O	fight
O	.
O	The
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	lawn
O	before
O	the
O	palace
O	gates
O	was
O	ringed
O	by
O	the
O	princes
O	,
O	nobles
O	,
O	and
O	chiefs
O	of
O	Erin
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	palace
O	walls
O	were
O	thronged
O	by
O	all
O	the
O	beauties
O	of
O	the
O	Court
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	noble
O	ladies
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	And
O	on
O	his
O	throne
O	,
O	surrounded
O	by
O	his
O	Druids
O	,
O	his
O	brehons
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	bards
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	king
O	of
O	Erin
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	sat
O	the
O	lovely
O	Lady
O	Mave
O	.
O	As
O	Enda
O	stepped
O	out
O	upon
O	the
O	lawn
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	Congal
O	advancing
O	from
O	the
O	ranks
O	of
O	the
O	nobles
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	champions
O	approached
O	each
O	other
O	until
O	they
O	met
O	right
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	throne
O	.
O	Then
O	both
O	turned
O	towards
O	the
O	throne
O	,
O	and
O	bowed
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	the
O	Princess
O	Mave
O	;
O	and
O	then
O	facing
O	each
O	other
O	again
O	,
O	they
O	retired
O	a
O	space
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	their
O	spears
O	were
O	poised
O	,
O	ready
O	for
O	battle
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	gave
O	the
O	signal
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	answered
O	by
O	the
O	clang
O	of
O	stricken
O	shields
O	,
O	and
O	Congal
O	and
O	Enda
O	launched
O	their
O	gleaming
O	spears
O	.
O	They
O	flashed
O	like
O	lightning
O	in
O	the
O	sunlit
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	second
O	Congal
O	'
O	s
O	had
O	broken
O	against
O	Enda
O	'
O	s
O	shield
O	;
O	but
O	Enda
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	piercing
O	Congal
O	'
O	s
O	helmet
O	,
O	hurled
O	him
O	senseless
O	on
O	the
O	plain
O	.
O	The
O	nobles
O	and
O	chiefs
O	could
O	hardly
O	realize
O	that
O	in
O	that
O	single
O	second
O	their
O	boldest
O	champion
O	was
O	overthrown
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	him
O	stretched
O	motionless
O	on
O	the
O	grassy
O	sward
O	,
O	from
O	out
O	their
O	ranks
O	six
O	warriors
O	advanced
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	chieftain
O	lay
O	,
O	and
O	sadly
O	they
O	bore
O	him
O	away
O	upon
O	their
O	battle-shields
O	,
O	and
O	Enda
O	remained
O	victor
O	upon
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	voice
O	rang
O	out
O	clear
O	as
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	a
O	trumpet
O	in
O	the
O	still
O	morning
O	:
O	``
O	Bards
O	and
O	brehons
O	,
O	princes
O	and
O	nobles
O	,
O	and
O	chiefs
O	of
O	Erin
O	,
O	Enda
O	has
O	proved
O	himself
O	a
O	battle
O	champion
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	amongst
O	you
O	now
O	will
O	dare
O	gainsay
O	his
O	right
O	to
O	claim
O	my
O	daughter
O	for
O	his
O	bride
O	?
O	``
O	And
O	no
O	answer
O	came
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	he
O	summoned
O	Enda
O	to
O	his
O	throne
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	the
O	lady
O	'
O	s
O	hand
O	in
O	his
O	,
O	a
O	cheer
O	arose
O	from
O	the
O	great
O	assembly
O	,
O	that
O	proved
O	that
O	jealousy
O	was
O	extinguished
O	in
O	all
O	hearts
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	all
O	believed
O	that
O	Enda
O	was
O	worthy
O	of
O	the
O	winsome
O	bride
O	;
O	and
O	never
O	since
O	that
O	day
O	,
O	although
O	a
O	thousand
O	years
O	have
O	passed
O	,
O	was
O	there
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	a
O	brighter
O	and
O	gayer
O	wedding
O	than
O	the
O	wedding

O	Princess
O	Mave
O	.
