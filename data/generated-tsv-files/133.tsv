O	Lady
O	Harriet
O	Graham
O	was
O	an
O	extremely
O	thin
O	,
O	delicate
O	,
O	old
O	lady
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	very
O	pale
O	face
O	and
O	a
O	sweet
O	,
O	gentle
O	voice
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	children
O	delighted
O	to
O	hear
O	;
O	for
O	it
O	always
O	spoke
O	kindly
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	sounded
O	like
O	music
O	,
O	after
O	the
O	loud
O	,
O	rough
O	tones
O	of
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Crabtree
O	.
O	She
O	wore
O	her
O	own
O	gray
O	hair
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	become
O	almost
O	as
O	white
O	as
O	the
O	widow
O	'
O	s
O	cap
O	which
O	covered
O	her
O	head
O	.
O	The
O	rest
O	of
O	her
O	dress
O	was
O	generally
O	black
O	velvet
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	usually
O	sat
O	in
O	a
O	comfortable
O	arm-chair
O	by
O	the
O	fireside
O	,
O	watching
O	her
O	grandchildren
O	at
O	play
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	large
O	work-bag
O	by
O	her
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	prodigious
O	Bible
O	open
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	before
O	her
O	.
O	Lady
O	Harriet
O	often
O	said
O	that
O	it
O	made
O	her
O	young
O	again
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	joyous
O	gambols
O	of
O	Harry
O	and
O	Laura
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	unable
O	any
O	longer
O	to
O	bear
O	their
O	noise
O	,
O	she
O	sometimes
O	kept
O	them
O	quiet
O	by
O	telling
O	them
O	the
O	most
O	delightful
O	stories
O	about
O	what
O	happened
O	to
O	herself
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	young
O	.
O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	Lady
O	Harriet
O	suddenly
O	became
O	so
O	very
O	ill
O	,
O	that
O	Dr
O	.
O	Bell
O	said
O	she
O	must
O	spend
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	for
O	change
O	of
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	accordingly
O	she
O	determined
O	on
O	passing
O	a
O	quiet
O	week
O	at
O	Holiday
O	House
O	with
O	her
O	relations
O	,
O	Lord
O	and
O	Lady
O	Rockville
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	Harry
O	and
O	Laura
O	were
O	to
O	be
O	left
O	under
O	the
O	sole
O	care
O	of
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Crabtree
O	,
O	so
O	it
O	might
O	have
O	been
O	expected
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	both
O	feel
O	more
O	frightened
O	of
O	her
O	,
O	now
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	reigning
O	monarch
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	Harry
O	would
O	obey
O	those
O	he
O	loved
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	only
O	held
O	up
O	a
O	little
O	finger
O	;
O	but
O	all
O	the
O	terrors
O	of
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Crabtree
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	cat-o
O	'
O	-nine-tails
O	,
O	were
O	generally
O	forgotten
O	soon
O	after
O	she
O	left
O	the
O	room
O	;
O	therefore
O	he
O	thought
O	little
O	at
O	first
O	about
O	the
O	many
O	threats
O	she
O	held
O	out
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	behaved
O	ill
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	listened
O	most
O	seriously
O	when
O	his
O	dear
O	,
O	sick
O	grandmamma
O	told
O	him
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	faint
O	,
O	weak
O	voice
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	day
O	of
O	her
O	departure
O	from
O	home
O	,
O	how
O	very
O	well
O	he
O	ought
O	to
O	behave
O	in
O	her
O	absence
O	,
O	as
O	no
O	one
O	remained
O	but
O	the
O	maids
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	in
O	order
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	she
O	hoped
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Crabtree
O	would
O	write
O	her
O	a
O	letter
O	full
O	of
O	good
O	news
O	about
O	his
O	excellent
O	conduct
O	.
O	Harry
O	felt
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	gladly
O	sit
O	still
O	without
O	stirring
O	till
O	his
O	grandmamma
O	came
O	back
O	,
O	if
O	that
O	could
O	only
O	please
O	her
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	never
O	was
O	any
O	one
O	more
O	determined
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	good
O	boy
O	than
O	he
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	moment
O	when
O	Lady
O	Harriet
O	'
O	s
O	carriage
O	came
O	round
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	Laura
O	,
O	Frank
O	,
O	and
O	Harry
O	helped
O	to
O	carry
O	all
O	the
O	pillows
O	,
O	boxes
O	,
O	books
O	,
O	and
O	baskets
O	which
O	were
O	necessary
O	for
O	the
O	journey
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	there
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	about
O	fifty
O	;
O	then
O	they
O	arranged
O	the
O	cushions
O	as
O	comfortably
O	as
O	possible
O	,
O	and
O	watched
O	very
O	sorrowfully
O	when
O	their
O	grandmamma
O	,
O	after
O	kindly
O	embracing
O	them
O	both
O	,
O	was
O	carefully
O	supported
O	by
O	Major
O	Graham
O	and
O	her
O	own
O	maid
O	Harrison
O	into
O	the
O	chariot
O	.
O	Uncle
O	David
O	gave
O	each
O	of
O	the
O	children
O	a
O	pretty
O	picture-book
O	before
O	taking
O	leave
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	stepping
O	into
O	the
O	carriage
O	,
O	``
O	Now
O	,
O	children
O	,
O	I
O	have
O	only
O	one
O	piece
O	of
O	serious
O	,
O	important
O	advice
O	to
O	give
O	you
O	all
O	,
O	so
O	attend
O	to
O	me
O	!
O	Never
O	crack
O	nuts
O	with
O	your
O	teeth
O	.
O	``
O	When
O	the
O	carriage
O	had
O	driven
O	off
O	,
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Crabtree
O	became
O	so
O	busy
O	scolding
O	Betty
O	,
O	and
O	storming
O	at
O	Jack
O	the
O	footboy
O	,
O	for
O	not
O	cleaning
O	her
O	shoes
O	well
O	enough
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	left
O	Harry
O	and
O	Laura
O	standing
O	in
O	the
O	passage
O	,
O	not
O	knowing
O	exactly
O	what
O	they
O	ought
O	to
O	do
O	first
O	,
O	and
O	Frank
O	,
O	seeing
O	them
O	looking
O	rather
O	melancholy
O	and
O	bewildered
O	at
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	their
O	grandmamma
O	,
O	stopped
O	a
O	moment
O	as
O	he
O	passed
O	on
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	school
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	kind
O	,
O	affectionate
O	voice
O	:
O	``
O	Now
O	,
O	Harry
O	and
O	Laura
O	,
O	listen
O	both
O	of
O	you
O	--
O	here
O	is
O	a
O	grand
O	opportunity
O	to
O	show
O	everybody
O	that
O	we
O	can
O	be
O	trusted
O	to
O	ourselves
O	,
O	without
O	getting
O	into
O	any
O	scrapes
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	if
O	grandmamma
O	is
O	ever
O	ill
O	again
O	and
O	obliged
O	to
O	go
O	away
O	,
O	she
O	need
O	not
O	feel
O	so
O	sad
O	and
O	anxious
O	as
O	she
O	did
O	to-day
O	.
O	I
O	mean
O	to
O	become
O	nine
O	times
O	more
O	attentive
O	to
O	my
O	lessons
O	than
O	usual
O	this
O	morning

O	to
O	show
O	how

O	are
O	wise
O	,
O	pray
O	march
O	straight
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	nursery
O	yourselves
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	arranged
O	a
O	gown

O	s
O	on
O	the
O	large
O	arm-chair
O	,
O	to
O	look
O	as
O	like
O	herself
O	as
O	possible
O	,
O	that
O	you
O	may
O	be
O	reminded
O	how
O	soon
O	she
O	will
O	come
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	you
O	must
O	not

O	like
O	the
O	mice
O	when
O	the
O	cat
O	is
O	out
O	.
O	Good-bye
O	!
O	Say
O	the
O	alphabet
O	backwards
O	,
O	and
O	count
O	your
O	fingers
O	for
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	Mrs

O	Crabtree
O	appears
O	again
O	,
O	pray
O	do
O	not
O	jump
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	for
O	joy
O	.
O	``
O	Harry
O	and
O	Laura
O	were
O	proceeding
O	directly
O	towards
O	the
O	nursery
O	,
O	as
O	Frank
O	had
O	recommended
O	,
O	when
O	unluckily
O	they
O	observed
O	,
O	in
O	passing
O	the
O	drawing-room
O	door
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	wide
O	open
O	;
O	so
O	Harry
O	peeped
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	began
O	idly
O	wandering
O	round
O	the
O	tables
O	and
O	cabinets
O	.
O	Not
O	ten
O	minutes
O	elapsed
O	before
O	they
O	both
O	commenced
O	racing
O	about
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	mad
O	,
O	perfectly
O	screaming
O	with
O	joy
O	,
O	and
O	laughing
O	so
O	loudly
O	at
O	their
O	own
O	funny
O	tricks
O	that
O	an
O	old
O	gentleman
O	who
O	lived
O	next
O	door
O	very
O	nearly
O	sent
O	in
O	a
O	message
O	to
O	ask
O	what
O	the
O	joke
O	was
O	.
O	Presently
O	Harry

O	Laura
O	ran
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	stairs
O	till
O	the
O	housemaid
O	was
O	quite
O	fatigued
O	with
O	running
O	after
O	them
O	.
O	They
O	jumped
O	upon
O	the
O	fine
O	damask
O	sofas
O	in
O	the
O	drawing-room
O	,
O	stirred
O	the
O	fire
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	blaze
O	,
O	and
O	rushed
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	balcony
O	upsetting
O	one
O	or
O	two
O	geraniums
O	and
O	a
O	myrtle
O	.
O	They
O	spilt
O	Lady
O	Harriet
O	'
O	s
O	perfumes
O	over
O	their
O	handkerchiefs
O	,
O	--

O	looked
O	into
O	all
O	the
O	beautiful
O	books
O	of
O	pictures
O	,
O	--
O	they
O	tumbled
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	pretty
O	Dresden
O	china
O	figures
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	--
O	they
O	wound
O	up
O	the
O	little
O	French
O	clock
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	broken
O	,
O	--
O	they
O	made
O	the
O	musical
O	work-box
O	play
O	its
O	tunes
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	the
O	Chinese
O	mandarins
O	a-nodding
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	very
O	nearly
O	nodded
O	their
O	heads
O	off
O	.
O	In
O	short
O	,
O	so
O	much
O	mischief
O	has
O	seldom
O	been
O	done
O	in
O	so
O	short
O	a
O	time
O	,

O	Harry
O	,
O	perfectly
O	worn
O	out
O	with
O	laughing
O	and
O	running
O	,
O	threw
O	himself
O	into
O	a
O	large
O	arm-chair
O	,
O	and
O	Laura
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	ringlets
O	tumbling
O	in
O	frightful
O	confusion
O	over

O	many
O	consultations
O	,
O	she
O	and
O	Harry
O	thought
O	at
O	last
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	nicely
O	expressed
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	wrote
O	these
O	words
O	upon
O	a
O	large
O	sheet
O	of
O	paper
O	to
O	each
O	of
O	their
O	friends
O	:
O	``

O	HARRY
O	and

O	``
O	Laura
O	afterwards
O	singed
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	her
O	muslin
O	frock
O	while
O	lighting
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	vesta
O	matches
O	to
O	seal
O	these
O	numerous
O	notes
O	,
O	and
O	Harry
O	dropped
O	some
O	burning
O	sealing-wax
O	on
O	his
O	hand
O	in
O	the
O	hurry
O	of
O	assisting
O	her
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	little
O	accident
O	no
O	matter
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	away
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	the
O	cards
O	could
O	be
O	sent
O	off
O	immediately
O	.
O	Now
O	there
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	a
O	very
O	old
O	footman
O	,
O	called
O	Andrew
O	,
O	who
O	remembered
O	Harry
O	and
O	Laura
O	since
O	they
O	were
O	quite
O	little
O	babies
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	often
O	looked
O	exceedingly
O	sad
O	and
O	sorry
O	when
O	they
O	suffered
O	punishment
O	from
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Crabtree
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	do
O	anything
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	when
O	it
O	pleased
O	the
O	children
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	carried
O	a
O	message
O	to
O	the
O	moon
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	only
O	shown
O	him
O	the
O	way
O	.
O	Many
O	odd
O	jobs
O	and
O	private
O	messages
O	he
O	had
O	already
O	been
O	employed
O	in
O	by
O	Harry
O	,
O	who
O	now
O	called
O	Andrew
O	upstairs
O	,
O	entreating
O	him
O	to
O	carry
O	out
O	all
O	those
O	absurd
O	notes
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	possible
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	deliver
O	them
O	immediately
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	of
O	the
O	greatest
O	consequence
O	.
O	Upon
O	hearing
O	this
O	,
O	old
O	Andrew
O	lost
O	not
O	a
O	moment
O	,
O	but
O	threw
O	on
O	his
O	hat
O	,
O	and
O	instantly
O	started
O	off
O	,
O	looking
O	like
O	the
O	twopenny
O	postman
O	,
O	he
O	carried
O	such
O	a
O	prodigious
O	parcel
O	of
O	invitations
O	;
O	while
O	Harry
O	and
O	Laura
O	stood
O	at
O	the
O	drawing-room
O	window
O	,
O	almost
O	screaming
O	with
O	joy
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	him
O	set
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	observed
O	that
O	,
O	to
O	oblige
O	them
O	,
O	he
O	actually
O	ran
O	along
O	the
O	street
O	at
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	trot
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	possibly
O	go
O	.
O	Presently
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	certainly
O	did
O	stop
O	for
O	a
O	single
O	minute
O	,
O	and
O	Laura
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	peep
O	into
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	notes
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	ascertain
O	what
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	about
O	;
O	but
O	as
O	he
O	never
O	carried
O	any
O	letters
O	without
O	doing
O	so
O	,
O	she
O	thought
O	that
O	quite
O	natural
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	only
O	very
O	glad
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	finished
O	,
O	and
O	rapidly
O	pursued
O	his
O	way
O	again
O	.
O	Next
O	morning
O	,
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Crabtree
O	and
O	Betty
O	became
O	very
O	much
O	surprised
O	to
O	observe
O	what
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	smart
O	livery-servants
O	knocked
O	at
O	the
O	street
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	in
O	cards
O	;
O	but
O	their
O	astonishment
O	became
O	still
O	greater
O	when
O	old
O	Andrew
O	brought
O	up
O	a
O	whole
O	parcel
O	of
O	them
O	to
O	Harry
O	and
O	Laura
O	,
O	who
O	immediately
O	broke
O	the
O	seals
O	,
O	and
O	read
O	the
O	contents
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	together
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	are

O	and
O	their
O	faces
O	washed
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	party
O	had
O	dined
O	at
O	two
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	,
O	so
O	they
O	were
O	as
O	hungry
O	as
O	hawks
O	,
O	looking
O	eagerly
O	round
O	,
O	whenever
O	they
O	entered
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	tea-table
O	,
O	and
O	evidently
O	surprised
O	that
O	nothing
O	had
O	yet
O	been
O	put
O	down
O	.
O	Laura
O	and
O	Harry
O	soon
O	afterwards
O	heard
O	their
O	visitors
O	whispering
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	about
O	Norwich
O	buns
O	,
O	rice-cakes
O	,
O	sponge-biscuits
O	,
O	and
O	macaroons
O	;
O	while
O	Peter
O	Grey
O	was
O	loud
O	in
O	praise
O	of
O	a
O	party
O	at
O	George
O	Lorraine
O	'
O	s
O	the
O	night
O	before
O	,
O	where
O	an
O	immense
O	plum-cake
O	had
O	been
O	sugared
O	over
O	like
O	a
O	snowstorm
O	,
O	and
O	covered
O	with
O	crowds
O	of
O	beautiful
O	amusing
O	mottoes
O	;
O	not
O	to
O	mention
O	a
O	quantity
O	of
O	noisy
O	crackers
O	that
O	exploded
O	like
O	pistols
O	;
O	besides
O	which
O	,
O	a
O	glass
O	of
O	hot
O	jelly
O	had
O	been
O	handed
O	to
O	each
O	little
O	guest
O	before
O	he
O	was
O	sent
O	home
O	.
O	Every
O	time
O	the
O	door
O	opened
O	,
O	all
O	eyes
O	were
O	anxiously
O	turned
O	round
O	,
O	expecting
O	a
O	grand
O	feast
O	to
O	be
O	brought
O	in
O	;
O	but
O	quite
O	the
O	contrary
O	--
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	Andrew
O	showing
O	up
O	more
O	hungry
O	visitors
O	;
O	while
O	Harry
O	felt
O	so
O	unspeakably
O	wretched
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	some
O	kind
O	fairy
O	could
O	only
O	have
O	turned
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	Norwich
O	bun
O	at
O	the
O	moment
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	gladly
O	have
O	consented
O	to
O	be
O	cut
O	in
O	pieces
O	,
O	that
O	his
O	ravenous
O	guests
O	might
O	be
O	satisfied
O	.
O	Charles
O	Forrester
O	was
O	a
O	particularly
O	good-natured
O	boy
O	,
O	so
O	Harry
O	at
O	last
O	took
O	courage
O	and
O	beckoned
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	remote
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	confessed
O	,
O	in
O	whispers
O	,
O	the
O	real
O	state
O	of
O	affairs
O	about
O	tea
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	sadly
O	distressed
O	he
O	and
O	Laura
O	felt
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	had
O	nothing
O	whatever
O	to
O	give
O	among
O	so
O	many
O	visitors
O	,
O	seeing
O	that
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Crabtree
O	kept
O	her
O	determination
O	of
O	affording
O	them
O	no
O	provisions
O	.
O	``
O	What

O	be
O	done

O	said
O	Charles
O	,
O	very
O	anxiously
O	,

O	,
O	he
O	could
O	hardly

O	Lady

O	became
O	very
O	angry
O	at

O	she
O	seemed
O	quite

O	recover
O	the
O	loaf

O	hurried
O	forward
O	to
O	overtake

O	the

O	so

O	breathless
O	,
O	while
O	the

O	was
O	so
O	lame

O	that
O	it
O	seemed
O	an
O	even

O	.
O	Harry
O	stood
O	at
O	his
O	own
O	door
O	,
O	impatiently
O	hoping
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	prize
O	,
O	and
O	eagerly
O	stretched
O	out
O	his
O	arms
O	to
O	encourage

O	while
O	it

O	impossible
O	to

O	the
O	runners
O	might
O	arrive
O	first
O	.
O	Harry
O	had
O	sometimes
O	heard
O	of
O	a
O	race
O	between
O	two
O	old
O	women
O	tied
O	up
O	in
O	sacks
O	,

O	he
O	thought
O	they
O	could
O	scarcely
O	move
O	with
O	more
O	difficulty
O	;
O	but
O	at
O	the
O	very
O	moment
O	when
O	Charles
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	he
O	stumbled
O	over
O	a

O	fell
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Mrs

O	Comfit
O	then
O	instantly
O	rushed
O	up
O	,

O	,
O	seizing
O	the
O	loaf
O	,

O	it
O	off

O	ready
O	to
O	cry
O	with
O	vexation
O	,
O	and
O	quite
O	at
O	a
O	loss
O	what
O	plan
O	to
O	attempt
O	next
O	.
O	Meantime
O	a
O	sad
O	riot
O	had
O	arisen
O	in
O	the
O	dining-room
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	boys
O	called
O	loudly
O	for
O	their
O	tea
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	young
O	ladies
O	drew
O	their
O	chairs
O	all
O	round
O	the
O	table
O	,
O	to
O	wait
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	ready
O	.
O	Still
O	nothing
O	appeared
O	;
O	so
O	everybody
O	wondered
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	how
O	long
O	they
O	were
O	to
O	wait
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	nice
O	cakes
O	and
O	sweetmeats
O	which
O	must
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	be
O	coming
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	longer
O	they
O	were
O	delayed
O	,

O	more
O	was
O	expected
O	.
O	The
O	last
O	at
O	a
O	feast
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	first
O	at
O	a
O	fray
O	,

O	generally
O	Peter
O	Grey
O	,
O	who
O	now
O	lost
O	patience
O	,
O	and
O	seized
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	biscuits
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	the

O	of
O	greedily
O	devouring
O	,
O	when
O	Laura
O	returned
O	with
O	Harry
O	to
O	the
O	dining-room

O	he
O	had
O	done
O	.
O	``
O	Peter
O	Grey

O	said
O	she
O	,
O	holding
O	up
O	her

O	look
O	very
O	dignified
O	,
O	``

O	an
O	aspect
O	of
O	rage
O	enough
O	to
O	petrify
O	a
O	milestone
O	.
O	Now
O	old
O	Andrew
O	had
O	long
O	been
O	trying
O	all
O	in
O	his
O	power
O	to
O	render
O	the
O	boys
O	quiet
O	and
O	contented
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	made
O	them
O	a
O	speech
O	,
O	--
O	he
O	had
O	chased
O	the
O	ringleaders
O	all
O	round
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	--
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	thrown
O	his
O	stick
O	at
O	Peter
O	,
O	who
O	seemed
O	the
O	most
O	riotous
O	,
O	--
O	but
O	all
O	in
O	vain
O	;
O	they
O	became
O	worse
O	and
O	worse
O	,
O	laughing
O	into
O	fits
O	,
O	and
O	calling
O	Andrew
O	``
O	the
O	police
O	officer
O	and
O	the
O	bailiff
O	.
O	``
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	different
O	story
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	when
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Crabtree
O	appeared
O	,
O	so
O	flaming
O	with
O	fury
O	she
O	might
O	have
O	blown
O	up
O	a
O	powder-mill
O	.
O	Nobody
O	could
O	help
O	being
O	afraid
O	of
O	her
O	.
O	Even
O	Peter
O	himself
O	stood
O	stock
O	still
O	,
O	and
O	seemed
O	withering
O	away
O	to
O	nothing
O	when
O	she
O	looked
O	at
O	him
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	scold
O	in
O	her
O	most
O	furious
O	manner
O	,
O	not
O	a
O	boy
O	ventured
O	to
O	look
O	off
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	A
O	large
O	pair
O	of
O	tawse
O	then
O	became
O	visible
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	so
O	every
O	heart
O	sunk
O	with
O	fright
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	riotous
O	visitors
O	began
O	to
O	get
O	behind
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	huddle
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	possible
O	,
O	whispering
O	,
O	and
O	pushing
O	,
O	and
O	fighting
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	desperate
O	scuffle
O	to
O	escape
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	is
O	all
O	this
O	?
O	``
O	cried
O	she
O	at
O	the
O	full
O	pitch
O	of
O	her
O	voice
O	;
O	``
O	has
O	bedlam
O	broke
O	loose
O	?
O	Who
O	smashed
O	these
O	cups
O	!
O	I
O	'
O	ll
O	break
O	his
O	head
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	let
O	me
O	tell
O	you
O	that
O	!
O	Master
O	Peter
O	,
O	you
O	should
O	be
O	hissed
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	for
O	your
O	misconduct
O	;
O	but
O	I
O	shall
O	certainly
O	whip
O	you
O	round
O	the
O	room
O	like
O	a
O	whipping-top
O	.
O	``
O	At
O	this
O	moment
O	Peter
O	observed
O	that
O	the
O	dining-room
O	window
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	only
O	about
O	six
O	feet
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	had
O	been
O	left
O	wide
O	open
O	;
O	so
O	instantly
O	seizing
O	the
O	opportunity
O	,
O	he
O	threw
O	himself
O	out
O	with
O	a
O	single
O	bound
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	laughing
O	away
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	other
O	boys
O	immediately
O	followed
O	his
O	example
O	,
O	and
O	disappeared
O	by
O	the
O	same
O	road
O	;
O	after
O	which
O	,
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Crabtree
O	leaned
O	far
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	scolded
O	loudly
O	,
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	they
O	remained
O	in
O	sight
O	,
O	till
O	her
O	face
O	became
O	red
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	voice
O	perfectly
O	hoarse
O	.
O	Meantime
O	the
O	little
O	misses
O	sat
O	soberly
O	down
O	before
O	the
O	empty
O	table
O	,
O	and
O	talked
O	in
O	whispers
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	waiting
O	,
O	till
O	their
O	maids
O	came
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	home
O	,
O	after
O	which
O	they
O	all
O	hurried
O	away
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	possible
O	,
O	hardly
O	waiting
O	to
O	say
O	``
O	Good-bye
O	!
O	``
O	and
O	intending
O	to
O	ask
O	for
O	some
O	supper
O	at
O	home
O	.
O	During
O	that
O	night
O	,
O	long
O	after
O	Harry
O	and
O	Laura
O	had
O	been
O	scolded
O	,
O	whipped
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	to
O	bed
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	each
O	heard
O	in
O	different
O	rooms
O	sobbing
O	and
O	crying
O	as
O	if
O	their
O	very
O	hearts
O	would
O	break
O	,
O	while
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Crabtree
O	grumbled
O	and
O	scolded
O	to
O	herself
O	,
O	saying
O	she
O	must
O	do
O	her
O	duty
O	,
O	and
O	make
O	them
O	good
O	children
O	,
O	though
O	she
O	were
O	to
O	flay
O	them
O	alive
O	first
O	.
O	When
O	Lady
O	Harriet
O	returned
O	home
O	some
O	days
O	afterwards
O	,
O	she
O	heard
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	Harry
O	and
O	Laura
O	'
O	s
O	misconduct
O	from
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Crabtree
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	whole
O	story
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	terrible
O	case
O	against
O	them
O	,
O	that
O	their
O	poor
O	grandmamma
O	became
O	perfectly
O	astonished
O	and
O	shocked
O	,
O	while
O	even
O	Uncle
O	David
O	was
O	preparing
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	angry
O	;
O	but
O	before
O	the
O	culprits
O	appeared
O	,
O	Frank
O	most
O	kindly
O	stepped
O	forward
O	,
O	and
O	begged
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	be
O	pardoned
O	for
O	this
O	once
O	,
O	adding
O	all
O	in
O	his
O	power
O	to
O	excuse
O	Harry
O	and
O	Laura
O	,
O	by
O	describing
O	how
O	very
O	penitent
O	they
O	had
O	become
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	very
O	severely
O	they
O	had
O	already
O	been
O	punished
O	.
O	Frank
O	then
O	mentioned
O	all
O	that
O	Harry
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	about
O	the
O	starving
O	party
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	related
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	humor
O	and
O	drollery
O	that
O	Lady
O	Harriet
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	laughing
O	;
O	so
O	then
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	a
O	victory
O	had
O	been
O	gained
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	to
O	the
O	nursery
O	for
O	the
O	two
O	little
O	prisoners
O	.
O	Uncle
O	David
O	shook
O	his
O	walking-stick
O	at
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	terrible
O	face
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	entered
O	;
O	but
O	Harry
O	jumped
O	upon
O	his
O	knee
O	with
O	joy
O	at
O	seeing
O	him
O	again
O	while
O	Laura
O	forgot
O	all
O	her
O	distress
O	,
O	and
O	rushed
O	up
O	to
O	Lady
O	Harriet
O	,
O	who
O	folded
O	her
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	and
O	kissed
O	her
O	most
O	affectionately
O	.
O	Not
O	a
O	word
O	was
O	said
O	that
O	day
O	about
O	the
O	tea-party
O	,
O	but
O	next
O	morning
O	Major
O	Graham
O	asked
O	Harry
O	very
O	gravely
O	,
O	``
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	read
O	in
O	the
O	newspaper
O	the
O	melancholy
O	accounts
O	about
O	several
O	of
O	his
O	little
O	companions
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	ill
O	and
O	confined
O	to
O	bed
O	from
O	having
O	eaten
O	too
O	much
O	at
O	a
O	certain
O	tea-party
O	on
O	Saturday
O	last
O	.
O	Poor
O	Peter
O	Grey
O	has
O	been
O	given
O	over
O	;
O	and
O	Charles
O	Forrester
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	feared
O	,
O	may
O	be
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	eat
O	another
O	loaf
O	of
O	bread
O	for
O	a
O	fortnight
O	!
O	``
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	Uncle
O	David
O	,
O	it
O	makes
O	me
O	ill
O	whenever
O	I
O	think
O	of
O	that
O	party
O	!
O	``
O	said
O	Harry
O	,
O	coloring
O	perfectly
O	scarlet
O	;
O	``
O	that
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	miserable
O	evening

O	``
O	I
O	must
O	say
O	it

O	quite
O	fair
O	in

O	Crabtree
O	to
O	starve
O	all
O	the
O	strange
O	little
O	boys
O	and

O	came
O	as
O	visitors
O	to
O	my
O	house
O	,

O	turned
O	out

O	the
O	very
O	next

O	,

O	Graham
O	showered

O	the
