O	At
O	one
O	time
O	,
O	the
O	animals
O	had
O	tribes
O	and
O	chiefs
O	,
O	like
O	men
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	when
O	the
O	porcupine
O	was
O	chief
O	,
O	that
O	a
O	council
O	was
O	called
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	fire
O	was
O	lighted
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	night
O	.
O	When
O	all
O	the
O	animals
O	were
O	seated
O	around
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	the
O	porcupine
O	spoke
O	.
O	``
O	Friends
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	we
O	have
O	met
O	here
O	to
O	settle
O	a
O	great
O	question
O	:
O	'
O	Shall
O	we
O	have
O	night
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	,
O	or
O	day
O	?
O	'
O	``
O	At
O	this
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	animals
O	began
O	to
O	talk
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	great
O	confusion
O	.
O	The
O	night
O	animals
O	kept
O	shouting
O	,
O	``
O	Night
O	,
O	night
O	!
O	Always
O	night
O	!
O	``
O	Others
O	of
O	the
O	animals
O	cried
O	,
O	``
O	Day
O	,
O	day
O	!
O	Always
O	day
O	!
O	``
O	Still
O	others
O	called
O	for
O	``
O	Day
O	and
O	night
O	!
O	``
O	There
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	noise
O	that
O	it
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	decided
O	what
O	was
O	best
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	animals
O	grew
O	tired
O	of
O	calling
O	.
O	One
O	by
O	one
O	the
O	voices
O	grew
O	fainter
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	shouting
O	ceased
O	.
O	Of
O	the
O	night
O	animals
O	,
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	the
O	bear
O	alone
O	was
O	heard
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	a
O	big
O	voice
O	and
O	still
O	kept
O	calling
O	,
O	``
O	Night
O	,
O	night
O	!
O	Always
O	night
O	!
O	``
O	The
O	animals
O	who
O	wanted
O	day
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	those
O	who
O	wanted
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	,
O	also
O	became
O	quiet
O	,
O	--
O	all
O	except
O	the
O	chipmunk
O	.
O	He
O	chattered
O	on
O	,
O	``
O	We
O	will
O	have
O	light
O	--
O	and
O	then
O	night
O	.
O	We
O	will
O	have
O	light
O	--
O	and
O	then
O	night
O	.
O	Chee
O	,
O	chee
O	,
O	chee
O	!
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	bear
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	became
O	tired
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	fat
O	and
O	lazy
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	sleepy
O	!
O	He
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	take
O	a
O	short
O	nap
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	night
O	long
O	the
O	wide-awake
O	little
O	chipmunk
O	kept
O	up
O	his
O	song
O	.
O	Not
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	did
O	he
O	stop
O	to
O	rest
O	.
O	Out
O	of
O	the
O	dark
O	came
O	his
O	voice
O	,
O	sure
O	and
O	cheery
O	,
O	``
O	We
O	will
O	have
O	light
O	--
O	and
O	then
O	night
O	.
O	We
O	will
O	have
O	light
O	--
O	and
O	then
O	night
O	!
O	Chee
O	,
O	chee
O	,
O	chee
O	!
O	``
O	And
O	before
O	the
O	animals
O	knew
O	it
O	,
O	the
O	sun
O	began
O	to
O	rise
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	first
O	rays
O	of
O	light
O	,
O	the
O	bear
O	sat
O	up
O	,
O	blinked
O	,
O	and
O	rubbed
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	that
O	while
O	he
O	had
O	slept
O	,
O	light
O	had
O	indeed
O	come
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	and
O	the
O	night
O	animals
O	had
O	been
O	beaten
O	in
O	the
O	council
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	chipmunk
O	and
O	the
O	animals
O	who
O	wanted
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	had
O	won
O	.
O	The
O	bear
O	was
O	very
O	angry
O	.
O	He
O	struck
O	at
O	the
O	chipmunk
O	with
O	his
O	paw
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	was
O	clumsy
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	chipmunk
O	was
O	spry
O	!
O	The
O	chipmunk
O	laughed
O	and
O	sprang
O	into
O	a
O	hole
O	of
O	a
O	hollow
O	tree
O	near
O	by
O	.
O	But
O	those
O	black
O	stripes
O	on
O	the
O	chipmunk
O	'
O	s
O	back
O	show
O	where
O	the
O	paw
O	of
O	the
O	black
O	bear
O	touched
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	slipped
O	into
O	the
O	tree
O	.
O	Ever
O	since
O	this
O	council
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	chipmunk
O	called
O	so
O	long
O	and
O	loud
O	for
O	``
O	light
O	and
O	night
O	,
O	``
