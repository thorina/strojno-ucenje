O	It
O	was
O	when
O	James
O	the
O	Sixth
O	was
O	king
O	in
O	Scotland
O	that
O	the
O	young
O	Wemyss
O	of
O	Logie
O	got
O	into
O	sore
O	trouble
O	.
O	Wemyss
O	of
O	Logie
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	courtiers
O	;
O	a
O	tall
O	,
O	handsome
O	lad
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	favourite
O	with
O	both
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	.
O	Now
O	King
O	James
O	had
O	brought
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	Queen
O	Anne
O	,
O	across
O	the
O	sea
O	to
O	Scotland
O	.
O	Her
O	home
O	was
O	in
O	Denmark
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	,
O	a
O	royal
O	bride
O	,
O	to
O	Scotland
O	,
O	she
O	brought
O	with
O	her
O	a
O	few
O	fair
O	Danish
O	maids
O	.
O	She
O	thought
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	dull
O	in
O	her
O	new
O	home
O	unless
O	she
O	had
O	some
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	country-folk
O	around
O	her
O	.
O	Among
O	these
O	maids
O	was
O	a
O	tall
O	,
O	beautiful
O	girl
O	named
O	Margaret
O	Twynlace
O	.
O	Her
O	the
O	queen
O	loved
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	oft
O	would
O	she
O	speak
O	with
O	Margaret
O	of
O	their
O	old
O	free
O	life
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	over
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	It
O	chanced
O	on
O	a
O	day
O	that
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	was
O	in
O	attendance
O	upon
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Danish
O	maid
O	,
O	Margaret
O	Twynlace
O	,
O	in
O	waiting
O	upon
O	the
O	queen
O	;
O	and
O	that
O	day
O	they
O	two
O	looked
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	another
O	day
O	they
O	two
O	talked
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	indeed
O	many
O	were
O	the
O	times
O	they
O	met
O	.
O	And
O	before
O	long
O	it
O	was
O	well
O	known
O	at
O	court
O	that
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	loved
O	the
O	Danish
O	maid
O	Margaret
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	marry
O	her
O	an
O	he
O	could
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	trouble
O	befell
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	seen
O	talking
O	with
O	the
O	Earl
O	of
O	Bothwell
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	a
O	traitor
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	Nor
O	was
O	it
O	alone
O	that
O	Wemyss
O	of
O	Logie
O	had
O	been
O	seen
O	to
O	speak
O	with
O	Bothwell
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	even
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	letters
O	written
O	by
O	the
O	traitor
O	in
O	his
O	room
O	at
O	Holyrood
O	.
O	No
O	sooner
O	had
O	this
O	rumour
O	reached
O	the
O	king
O	than
O	orders
O	were
O	given
O	to
O	search
O	both
O	young
O	Logie
O	himself
O	and
O	the
O	room
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	used
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	On
O	his
O	person
O	no
O	letters
O	were
O	found
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	his
O	room
O	,
O	flung
O	carelessly
O	into
O	his
O	trunk
O	,
O	lay
O	a
O	packet
O	of
O	letters
O	tied
O	and
O	sealed
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	seal
O	was
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	traitor
O	,
O	the
O	Earl
O	of
O	Bothwell
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	laird
O	was
O	taken
O	at
O	once
O	before
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	He
O	spoke
O	in
O	his
O	usual
O	fearless
O	tones
O	.
O	'
O	It
O	is
O	true
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	I
O	have
O	ofttimes
O	spoken
O	to
O	the
O	Earl
O	of
O	Bothwell
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	true
O	that
O	I
O	received
O	from
O	him
O	the
O	sealed
O	packet
O	which
O	was
O	found
O	in
O	my
O	trunk
O	.
O	But
O	of
O	that
O	which
O	is
O	written
O	in
O	the
O	packet
O	know
O	I
O	nought
O	.
O	The
O	seal
O	is
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	see
O	,
O	unbroken
O	.
O	Nor
O	knew
O	I
O	that
O	the
O	earl
O	was
O	still
O	acting
O	as
O	traitor
O	,
O	'
O	added
O	the
O	lad
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	displeasure
O	written
O	on
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	But
O	despite
O	all
O	he
O	could
O	say
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	was
O	arrested
O	as
O	a
O	traitor
O	and
O	thrown
O	into
O	prison
O	.
O	Margaret
O	Twynlace
O	with
O	her
O	own
O	eyes
O	saw
O	Sir
O	John
O	Carmichael
O	,
O	keeper
O	of
O	the
O	prison
O	,
O	turn
O	the
O	key
O	in
O	the
O	lock
O	.
O	Margaret
O	went
O	quickly
O	to
O	the
O	queen
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	did
O	she
O	neither
O	sew
O	nor
O	sing
O	.
O	She
O	sat
O	twining
O	her
O	fingers
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	,
O	while
O	she
O	cried
O	,
O	'
O	Woe
O	is
O	me
O	that
O	ever
O	I
O	was
O	born
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	ever
O	I
O	left
O	my
O	home
O	in
O	Denmark
O	.
O	I
O	would
O	I
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	then
O	Margaret
O	wept
O	bitterly
O	,
O	for
O	having
O	seen
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	,
O	she
O	loved
O	him
O	well
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	queen
O	came
O	to
O	her
O	bower
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	grieved
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	favourite
O	maid
O	in
O	tears
O	.
O	Yet
O	had
O	she
O	no
O	comfort
O	to
O	offer
O	her
O	,
O	for
O	well
O	she
O	knew
O	that
O	,
O	even
O	should
O	he
O	wish
O	it
O	,
O	little
O	power
O	had
O	the
O	king
O	to
O	save
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	queen
O	spoke
O	kindly
O	to
O	the
O	maid
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	,
O	Margaret
O	,
O	might
O	e
O	'
O	en
O	go
O	herself
O	to
O	King
O	James
O	to
O	beg
O	for
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	.
O	For
O	it
O	was
O	well
O	known
O	that
O	the
O	sentence
O	passed
O	on
O	him
O	would
O	be
O	death
O	.
O	Then
O	Margaret
O	Twynlace
O	wiped
O	from
O	her
O	face
O	all
O	traces
O	of
O	her
O	tears
O	.
O	She
O	put
O	on
O	her
O	soft
O	green
O	silk
O	gown
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	combed
O	out
O	her
O	bonny
O	yellow
O	hair
O	.
O	Thus
O	she
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	fell
O	on
O	her
O	knee
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	Why
O	,
O	May
O	Margaret
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	is
O	it
O	thou
O	?
O	What
O	dost
O	thou
O	at
O	my
O	feet
O	,
O	my
O	bonny
O	maid
O	?
O	'
O	'
O	Ah
O	,
O	sire
O	,
O	'
O	cried
O	she
O	,
O	'
O	I
O	have
O	come
O	to
O	beg
O	of
O	thee
O	a
O	boon
O	.
O	Nor
O	ever
O	since
O	I
O	came
O	over
O	the
O	sea
O	have
O	I
O	begged
O	of
O	thee
O	until
O	now
O	.
O	Give
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	beseech
O	of
O	thee
O	,
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Alas
O	,
O	May
O	Margaret
O	,
O	'
O	cried
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	can
O	not

O	do
O	!
O	An

O	gavest
O	to

O	all
O	the
O	gold
O	that
O	is
O	in
O	Scotland
O	yet
O	could
O	I
O	not
O	save
O	the
O	lad
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	Margaret
O	Twynlace
O	turned
O	away
O	and
O	crept
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	queen
O	'
O	s
O	bower
O	.
O	Yet
O	now
O	no
O	tears
O	fell
O	from
O	her
O	blue
O	eyes
O	,
O	for
O	if
O	neither
O	king
O	nor
O	queen
O	could
O	help
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	,
O	she
O	herself
O	would
O	save
O	him
O	from
O	death
O	.
O	She
O	would
O	wait
O	until
O	night
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	slumbered
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	she
O	would
O	carry
O	out
O	her
O	plan
O	.
O	A
O	brave
O	plan
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	for
O	Margaret
O	Twynlace
O	was
O	no
O	coward
O	maid
O	.
O	Quiet
O	and
O	patient
O	she
O	waited
O	in
O	the
O	little
O	ante-room
O	,
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	queen
O	'
O	s
O	bedchamber
O	,
O	waited
O	until
O	she
O	felt
O	sure
O	the
O	royal
O	pair
O	were
O	fast
O	asleep
O	.
O	Then
O	tripping
O	lightly
O	on
O	tiptoe
O	,
O	she
O	stole
O	into
O	the
O	bedroom
O	,
O	where
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	guessed
O	,
O	both
O	king

O	queen
O	were
O	slumbering
O	sound
O	.
O	She
O	crossed
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	quiet
O	as
O	any
O	mouse
O	,
O	and
O	reached
O	the
O	toilet
O	table
O	.
O	There
O	lay
O	the

O	slept
O	sound
O	as

O	Then
O	downstairs
O	in

O	dark
O	fled
O	Margaret

O	Now
O	,

O	'
O	s
O	will
O	,
O	rubbing
O	his
O	sleepy
O	eyes
O	the

O	He
O	took

O	not

O	THE
O	THREE
O	GOLDEN
O	APPLES
O	Did
O	you
O	ever
O	hear
O	of
O	the
O	golden
O	apples
O	that
O	grew
O	in
O	the
O	garden
O	of
O	the
O	Hesperides
O	?
O	Ah
O	,
O	those
O	were
O	such
O	apples
O	as
O	would
O	bring
O	a
O	great
O	price
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	bushel
O	,
O	if
O	any
O	of
O	them
O	could
O	be
O	found
O	growing
O	in
O	the
O	orchards
O	of
O	nowadays
O	!
O	But
O	there
O	is
O	not
O	,
O	I
O	suppose
O	,
O	a
O	graft
O	of
O	that
O	wonderful
O	fruit
O	on
O	a
O	single
O	tree
O	in
O	the
O	wide
O	world
O	.
O	Not
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	a
O	seed
O	of
O	those
O	apples
O	exists
O	any
O	longer
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	even
O	in
O	the
O	old
O	,
O	old
O	,
O	half-forgotten
O	times
O	,
O	before
O	the
O	garden
O	of
O	the
O	Hesperides
O	was
O	overrun
O	with
O	weeds
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	people
O	doubted
O	whether
O	there
O	could
O	be
O	real
O	trees
O	that
O	bore
O	apples
O	of
O	solid
O	gold
O	upon
O	their
O	branches
O	.
O	All
O	had
O	heard
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	but
O	nobody
O	remembered
O	to
O	have
O	seen
O	any
O	.
O	Children
O	,
O	nevertheless
O	,
O	used
O	to
O	listen
O	,
O	open-mouthed
O	,
O	to
O	stories
O	of
O	the
O	golden
O	apple
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	resolved
O	to
O	discover
O	it
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	should
O	be
O	big
O	enough
O	.
O	Adventurous
O	young
O	men
O	,
O	who
O	desired
O	to
O	do
O	a
O	braver
O	thing
O	than
O	any
O	of
O	their
O	fellows
O	,
O	set
O	out
O	in
O	quest
O	of
O	this
O	fruit
O	.
O	Many
O	of
O	them
O	returned
O	no
O	more
O	;
O	none
O	of
O	them
O	brought
O	back
O	the
O	apples
O	.
O	No
O	wonder
O	that
O	they
O	found
O	it
O	impossible
O	to
O	gather
O	them
O	!
O	It
O	is
O	said
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	dragon
O	beneath
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	hundred
O	terrible
O	heads
O	,
O	fifty
O	of
O	which
O	were
O	always
O	on
O	the
O	watch
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	other
O	fifty
O	slept
O	.
O	In
O	my
O	opinion
O	it
O	was
O	hardly
O	worth
O	running
O	so
O	much
O	risk
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	a
O	solid
O	golden
O	apple
O	.
O	Had
O	the
O	apples
O	been
O	sweet
O	,
O	mellow
O	,
O	and
O	juicy
O	,
O	indeed
O	that
O	would
O	be
O	another
O	matter
O	.
O	There
O	might
O	then
O	have
O	been
O	some
O	sense
O	in
O	trying
O	to
O	get
O	at
O	them
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	hundred-headed
O	dragon
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	already
O	told
O	you
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	a
O	common
O	thing
O	with
O	young
O	persons
O	,
O	when
O	tired
O	of
O	too
O	much
O	peace
O	and
O	rest
O	,
O	to
O	go
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	the
O	garden
O	of
O	the
O	Hesperides
O	.
O	And
O	once
O	the
O	adventure
O	was
O	undertaken
O	by
O	a
O	hero
O	who
O	had
O	enjoyed
O	very
O	little
O	peace
O	or
O	rest
O	since
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	am
O	going
O	to
O	speak
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	wandering
O	through
O	the
O	pleasant
O	land
O	of
O	Italy
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	mighty
O	club
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	bow
O	and
O	quiver
O	slung
O	across
O	his
O	shoulders
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	wrapt
O	in
O	the
O	skin
O	of
O	the
O	biggest
O	and
O	fiercest
O	lion
O	that
O	ever
O	had
O	been
O	seen
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	he
O	himself
O	had
O	killed
O	;
O	and
O	though
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	whole
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	kind
O	,
O	and
O	generous
O	,

O	noble
O	,

O	was
O	a

O	deal
O	of

O	fierceness
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	,

O	continually
O	inquired
O	whether

O	to
O	a
O	beach
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	great
O	surf
O	waves
O	tumbled
O	themselves
O	upon
O	the
O	hard
O	sand
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	long
O	line
O	of
O	snowy
O	foam
O	.
O	At
O	one
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	pleasant
O	spot
O	,
O	where
O	some
O	green
O	shrubbery
O	clambered
O	up
O	a
O	cliff
O	,
O	making
O	its
O	rocky
O	face
O	look
O	soft
O	and
O	beautiful
O	.
O	A
O	carpet
O	of
O	verdant
O	grass
O	,
O	largely
O	intermixed
O	with
O	sweet-smelling
O	clover
O	,
O	covered
O	the
O	narrow
O	space
O	between
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	cliff
O	and
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	And
O	what
O	should
O	Hercules
O	espy
O	there
O	but
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	fast
O	asleep
O	!
O	But
O	was
O	it
O	really
O	and
O	truly
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	?
O	Certainly
O	,
O	at
O	first
O	sight
O	,
O	it
O	looked
O	very
O	like
O	one
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	on
O	closer
O	inspection
O	,
O	it
O	rather
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	some
O	kind
O	of
O	a
O	creature
O	that
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	For
O	on
O	his
O	legs
O	and
O	arms
O	there
O	were
O	scales
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	fishes
O	have
O	;
O	he
O	was
O	web-footed
O	and
O	web-fingered
O	,
O	after
O	the
O	fashion
O	of
O	a
O	duck
O	;
O	and
O	his
O	long
O	beard
O	,
O	being
O	of
O	a
O	greenish
O	tinge
O	,
O	had
O	more
O	the
O	appearance
O	of
O	a
O	tuft
O	of
O	seaweed
O	than
O	of
O	an
O	ordinary
O	beard
O	.
O	Have
O	you
O	never
O	seen
O	a
O	stick
O	of
O	timber
O	,
O	that
O	has
O	been
O	long
O	tossed
O	about
O	by
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	and
O	has
O	got
O	all
O	overgrown
O	with
O	barnacles
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	drifting
O	ashore
O	,
O	seems
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	thrown
O	up
O	from
O	the
O	very
O	deepest
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	would
O	have
O	put
O	you
O	in
O	mind
O	of
O	just
O	such
O	a
O	wave-tossed
O	spar
O	!
O	But
O	Hercules
O	,
O	the
O	instant
O	he
O	set
O	eyes
O	on
O	this
O	strange
O	figure
O	,
O	was
O	convinced
O	that
O	it
O	could
O	be
O	no
O	other
O	than
O	the
O	Old
O	One
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	to
O	direct
O	him
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	.
O	Yes
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	selfsame
O	Old
O	Man
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	whom
O	the
O	hospitable
O	maidens
O	had
O	talked
O	to
O	him
O	about
O	.
O	Thanking
O	his
O	stars
O	for
O	the
O	lucky
O	accident
O	of
O	finding
O	the
O	old
O	fellow
O	asleep
O	,
O	Hercules
O	stole
O	on
O	tiptoe
O	toward
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	caught
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	arm
O	and
O	leg
O	.
O	``
O	Tell
O	me
O	,
O	``
O	cried
O	he
O	,
O	before
O	the
O	Old
O	One
O	was
O	well
O	awake
O	,
O	``
O	which
O	is
O	the
O	way
O	to

O	garden
O	of
O	the
O	Hesperides
O	?
O	``
O	As
O	you
O	may
O	easily
O	imagine
O	,
O	the
O	Old
O	Man
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	awoke
O	in
O	a
O	fright
O	.
O	But
O	his
O	astonishment
O	could
O	hardly
O	have
O	been
O	greater
O	than
O	was
O	that
O	of
O	Hercules
O	,
O	the
O	next
O	moment
O	.
O	For
O	,
O	all
O	of
O	a
O	sudden
O	,
O	the
O	Old
O	One
O	seemed
O	to
O	disappear
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	grasp
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	holding
O	a
O	stag
O	by
O	the
O	fore
O	and
O	hind
O	leg
O	!
O	But
O	still
O	he
O	kept
O	fast
O	hold
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	stag
O	disappeared
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	its
O	stead
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	sea
O	bird
O	,
O	fluttering
O	and
O	screaming
O	,
O	while
O	Hercules
O	clutched
O	it
O	by
O	the
O	wing
O	and
O	claw
O	!
O	But
O	the
O	bird
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	away
O	.
O	Immediately
O	afterward
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	ugly
O	three-headed
O	dog
O	,
O	which
O	growled
O	and
O	barked
O	at
O	Hercules
O	,
O	and
O	snapped
O	fiercely
O	at
O	the
O	hands
O	by
O	which
O	he
O	held
O	him
O	!
O	But
O	Hercules
O	would
O	not
O	let
O	him
O	go
O	.
O	In
O	another
O	minute
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	the
O	three-headed
O	dog
O	,
O	what
O	should
O	appear
O	but
O	Geryon
O	,
O	the
O	six-legged
O	man
O	monster
O	,
O	kicking
O	at
O	Hercules
O	with
O	five
O	of
O	his
O	legs
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	get
O	the
O	remaining
O	one
O	at
O	liberty
O	!
O	But
O	Hercules
O	held
O	on
O	.
O	By
O	and
O	by
O	,
O	no
O	Geryon
O	was
O	there
O	,
O	but
O	a
O	huge
O	snake
O	,
O	like
O	one
O	of
O	those
O	which
O	Hercules
O	had
O	strangled
O	in
O	his
O	babyhood
O	,
O	only
O	a
O	hundred
O	times
O	as
O	big
O	;
O	and
O	it
O	twisted
O	and
O	twined
O	about
O	the
O	hero
O	'
O	s
O	neck
O	and
O	body
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	its
O	tail
O	high
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	opened
O	its
O	deadly
O	jaws
O	as
O	if
O	to
O	devour
O	him
O	outright
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	really
O	a
O	very
O	terrible
O	spectacle
O	!
O	But
O	Hercules
O	was
O	no
O	whit
O	disheartened
O	,
O	and
O	squeezed
O	the
O	great
O	snake
O	so
O	tightly
O	that
O	he
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	hiss
O	with
O	pain
O	.
O	You
O	must
O	understand
O	that
O	the
O	Old
O	Man
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	generally
O	looked
O	so
O	much
O	like
O	the
O	wave-beaten
O	figurehead
O	of
O	a
O	vessel
O	,
O	had
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	assuming
O	any
O	shape
O	he
O	pleased
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	so
O	roughly
O	seized
O	by
O	Hercules
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	in
O	hopes
O	of
O	putting
O	him
O	into
O	such
O	surprise
O	and
O	terror
O	,
O	by
O	these
O	magical
O	transformations
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	hero
O	would
O	be
O	glad
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	go
O	.
O	If
O	Hercules
O	had
O	relaxed
O	his
O	grasp
O	,
O	the
O	Old
O	One
O	would
O	certainly
O	have
O	plunged
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	very
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	whence
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	soon
O	have
O	given
O	himself
O	the
O	trouble
O	of
O	coming
O	up
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	answer
O	any
O	impertinent
O	questions
O	.
O	Ninety-nine
O	people
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	hundred
O	,
O	I
O	suppose
O	,
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	frightened
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	wits
O	by
O	the
O	very
O	first
O	of
O	his
O	ugly
O	shapes
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	taken
O	to
O	their
O	heels
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	For
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	hardest
O	things
O	in
O	this
O	world
O	is
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	difference
O	between
O	real
O	dangers
O	and
O	imaginary
O	ones
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	as
O	Hercules
O	held
O	on
O	so
O	stubbornly
O	,
O	and
O	only
O	squeezed
O	the
O	Old
O	One
O	so
O	much
O	the
O	tighter
O	at
O	every
O	change
O	of
O	shape
O	,
O	and
O	really
O	put
O	him
O	to
O	no
O	small
O	torture
O	,
O	he
O	finally
O	thought
O	it
O	best
O	to
O	reappear
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	figure
O	.
O	So
O	there
O	he
O	was
O	again
O	,
O	a
O	fishy
O	,
O	scaly
O	,
O	web-footed
O	sort
O	of
O	personage
O	,
O	with
O	something
O	like
O	a
O	tuft
O	of
O	seaweed
O	at
O	his
O	chin
O	.

O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	he
O	became
O	ten
O	times
O	as
O	strong
O	as
O	ever
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	before
O	.
O	His
O	name
O	was
O	Antæus
O	.
O	You
O	may
O	see
O	,
O	plainly
O	enough
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	difficult
O	business
O	to
O	fight
O	with
O	such
O	a
O	fellow
O	;
O	for
O	,
O	as
O	often
O	as
O	he
O	got
O	a
O	knock-down
O	blow
O	,
O	up
O	he
O	started
O	again
O	,
O	stronger
O	,
O	fiercer
O	,
O	and
O	abler
O	to
O	use
O	his
O	weapons
O	than
O	if
O	his
O	enemy
O	had
O	let
O	him
O	alone
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	the
O	harder
O	Hercules
O	pounded
O	the
O	giant
O	with
O	his
O	club
O	,
O	the
O	further
O	he
O	seemed
O	from
O	winning
O	the
O	victory
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	sometimes
O	argued
O	with
O	such
O	people
O	,
O	but
O	never
O	fought
O	with
O	one
O	.
O	The
O	only
O	way
O	in
O	which
O	Hercules
O	found
O	it
O	possible
O	to
O	finish
O	the
O	battle
O	was
O	by
O	lifting
O	Antæus
O	off
O	his
O	feet
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	squeezing
O	,
O	and
O	squeezing
O	,
O	and
O	squeezing
O	him
O	until
O	,
O	finally
O	,
O	the
O	strength
O	was
O	quite
O	squeezed
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	enormous
O	body
O	.
O	When
O	this
O	affair
O	was
O	finished
O	,
O	Hercules
O	continued
O	his
O	travels
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	Egypt
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	taken
O	prisoner
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	put
O	to
O	death
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	slain
O	the
O	king
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	and
O	made
O	his
O	escape
O	.
O	Passing
O	through
O	the
O	deserts
O	of
O	Africa
O	,
O	and
O	going
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	,
O	he
O	arrived
O	at
O	last
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	ocean
O	.
O	And
O	here
O	,
O	unless
O	he
O	could
O	walk
O	on
O	the
O	crests
O	of
O	the
O	billows
O	,
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	his
O	journey
O	must
O	needs
O	be
O	at
O	an
O	end
O	.
O	Nothing
O	was
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	save
O	the
O	foaming
O	,
O	dashing
O	,
O	measureless
O	ocean
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	suddenly
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	looked
O	toward
O	the
O	horizon
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	something
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	way
O	off
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	seen
O	the
O	moment
O	before
O	.
O	It
O	gleamed
O	very
O	brightly
O	,
O	almost
O	as
O	you
O	may
O	have
O	beheld
O	the
O	round
O	,
O	golden
O	disc
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	rises
O	or
O	sets
O	over
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	It
O	evidently
O	drew
O	nearer
O	;
O	for
O	,
O	at
O	every
O	instant
O	,
O	this
O	wonderful
O	object
O	became
O	larger
O	and
O	more
O	lustrous
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	it
O	had
O	come
O	so
O	nigh
O	that
O	Hercules
O	discovered
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	an
O	immense
O	cup
O	or
O	bowl
O	,
O	made
O	either
O	of
O	gold
O	or
O	burnished
O	brass
O	.
O	How
O	it
O	had
O	got
O	afloat
O	upon
O	the
O	sea
O	is
O	more
O	than
O	I
O	can
O	tell
O	you
O	.
O	There
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	at
O	all
O	events
O	,
O	rolling
O	on
O	the
O	tumultuous
O	billows
O	,
O	which
O	tossed
O	it
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	heaved
O	their
O	foamy
O	tops
O	against
O	its
O	sides
O	,
O	but
O	without
O	ever
O	throwing
O	their
O	spray
O	over
O	the
O	brim
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	have
O	seen
O	many
O	giants
O	,
O	in
O	my
O	time
O	,
O	``
O	thought
O	Hercules
O	,
O	``
O	but
O	never
O	one
O	that
O	would
O	need
O	to
O	drink
O	his
O	wine
O	out
O	of
O	a

O	like

O	And
O	,
O	true
O	enough
O	,
O	what
O	a
O	cup
O	it
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	!
O	It
O	was
O	as
O	large
O	--
O	as
O	large
O	--
O	but
O	,
O	in
O	short
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	afraid
O	to
O	say
O	how
O	immeasurably
O	large
O	it
O	was
O	.
O	To
O	speak
O	within
O	bounds
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	ten
O	times
O	larger
O	than
O	a
O	great
O	mill
O	wheel
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	all
O	of
O	metal
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	it
O	floated
O	over
O	the
O	heaving
O	surges
O	more
O	lightly
O	than
O	an
O	acorn
O	cup
O	adown
O	the
O	brook
O	.
O	The
O	waves
O	tumbled
O	it
O	onward
O	,
O	until
O	it
O	grazed
O	against
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	within
O	a
O	short
O	distance
O	of
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	Hercules
O	was
O	standing
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	this
O	happened
O	,
O	he
O	knew
O	what
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	;
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	gone
O	through
O	so
O	many
O	remarkable
O	adventures
O	without
O	learning
O	pretty
O	well
O	how
O	to
O	conduct
O	himself
O	,
O	whenever
O	anything
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	a
O	little
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	common
O	rule
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	just
O	as
O	clear
O	as
O	daylight
O	that
O	this
O	marvellous
O	cup
O	had
O	been
O	set
O	adrift
O	by
O	some
O	unseen
O	power
O	,
O	and
O	guided
O	hitherward
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	carry
O	Hercules
O	across
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	garden
O	of
O	the
O	Hesperides
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	without
O	a
O	moment
O	'
O	s
O	delay
O	,
O	he
O	clambered
O	over
O	the
O	brim
O	,
O	and
O	slid
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	inside
O	,
O	where
O	,
O	spreading
O	out
O	his
O	lion
O	'
O	s
O	skin
O	,
O	he
O	proceeded
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	little
O	repose
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	scarcely
O	rested
O	,
O	until
O	now
O	,
O	since
O	he
O	bade
O	farewell
O	to
O	the
O	damsels
O	on
O	the
O	margin
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	.
O	The
O	waves
O	dashed
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	pleasant
O	and
O	ringing
O	sound
O	,
O	against
O	the
O	circumference
O	of
O	the
O	hollow
O	cup
O	;
O	it
O	rocked
O	lightly
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	motion
O	was
O	so
O	soothing
O	that
O	it
O	speedily
O	rocked
O	Hercules
O	into
O	an
O	agreeable
O	slumber
O	.
O	His
O	nap
O	had
O	probably
O	lasted
O	a
O	good
O	while
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	cup
O	chanced
O	to
O	graze
O	against
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	consequence
O	,
O	immediately
O	resounded
O	and
O	reverberated
O	through
O	its
O	golden
O	or
O	brazen
O	substance
O	,
O	a
O	hundred
O	times
O	as
O	loudly
O	as
O	ever
O	you
O	heard
O	a
O	church
O	bell
O	.
O	The
O	noise
O	awoke
O	Hercules
O	,
O	who
O	instantly
O	started
O	up
O	and
O	gazed
O	around
O	him
O	,
O	wondering
O	whereabouts
O	he
O	was
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	in
O	discovering
O	that
O	the
O	cup
O	had
O	floated
O	across
O	a
O	great
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	approaching
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	what
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	an
O	island
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	on
O	that
O	island
O	,
O	what
O	do
O	you
O	think
O	he
O	saw
O	?
O	No
O	;
O	you
O	will
O	never
O	guess
O	it
O	,
O	not
O	if
O	you
O	were
O	to
O	try
O	fifty
O	thousand
O	times
O	!
O	It
O	positively
O	appears
O	to
O	me
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	marvellous
O	spectacle
O	that
O	had
O	ever
O	been
O	seen
O	by
O	Hercules
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	course
O	of
O	his
O	wonderful
O	travels
O	and
O	adventures
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	greater
O	marvel
O	than
O	the
O	hydra
O	with
O	nine
O	heads
O	,
O	which
O	kept
O	growing
O	twice
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	cut
O	off
O	;
O	greater
O	than
O	the
O	six-legged
O	man
O	monster
O	;
O	greater
O	than
O	Antæus
O	;
O	greater
O	than
O	anything
O	that
O	was
O	ever
O	beheld
O	by
O	anybody
O	,
O	before
O	or
O	since
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	Hercules
O	,
O	or
O	than
O	anything
O	that
O	remains
O	to
O	be
O	beheld
O	by
O	travellers
O	in
O	all
O	time
O	to
O	come
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	giant
O	!
O	But
O	such
O	an
O	intolerably
O	big
O	giant
O	!
O	A
O	giant
O	as
O	tall
O	as
O	a
O	mountain
O	;
O	so
O	vast
O	a
O	giant
O	that
O	the
O	clouds
O	rested
O	about
O	his
O	midst
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	girdle
O	,
O	and
O	hung
O	like
O	a
O	hoary
O	beard
O	from
O	his
O	chin
O	,
O	and
O	flitted
O	before
O	his
O	huge
O	eyes
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	neither
O	see
O	Hercules
O	nor
O	the
O	golden
O	cup
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	voyaging
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	most
O	wonderful
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	the
O	giant
O	held
O	up
O	his
O	great
O	hands
O	and
O	appeared
O	to
O	support
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	Hercules
O	could
O	discern
O	through
O	the
O	clouds
O	,
O	was
O	resting
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	!
O	This
O	does
O	really
O	seem
O	almost
O	too
O	much
O	to
O	believe
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	the
O	bright
O	cup
O	continued
O	to
O	float
O	onward
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	touched
O	the
O	strand
O	.
O	Just
O	then
O	a
O	breeze
O	wafted
O	away
O	the
O	clouds
O	from
O	before
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	visage
O	,
O	and
O	Hercules
O	beheld
O	it
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	its
O	enormous
O	features
O	;
O	eyes
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	as
O	big
O	as
O	yonder
O	lake
O	,
O	a
O	nose
O	a
O	mile
O	long
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	width
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	countenance
O	terrible
O	from
O	its
O	enormity
O	of
O	size
O	,
O	but
O	disconsolate
O	and
O	weary
O	,
O	even
O	as
O	you
O	may
O	see
O	the
O	faces
O	of
O	many
O	people
O	,
O	nowadays
O	,
O	who
O	are
O	compelled
O	to
O	sustain
O	burdens
O	above
O	their
O	strength
O	.
O	What
O	the
O	sky
O	was
O	to
O	the
O	giant
O	,
O	such
O	are
O	the
O	cares
O	of
O	earth
O	to
O	those
O	who
O	let
O	themselves
O	be
O	weighed
O	down
O	by
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	whenever
O	men
O	undertake
O	what
O	is
O	beyond
O	the
O	just
O	measure
O	of
O	their
O	abilities
O	,
O	they
O	encounter
O	precisely
O	such
O	a
O	doom
O	as
O	had
O	befallen
O	this
O	poor
O	giant
O	.
O	Poor
O	fellow
O	!
O	He
O	had
O	evidently
O	stood
O	there
O	a
O	long
O	while
O	.
O	An
O	ancient
O	forest
O	had
O	been
O	growing
O	and
O	decaying
O	around
O	his
O	feet
O	;
O	and
O	oak
O	trees
O	,
O	of
O	six
O	or
O	seven
O	centuries
O	old
O	,
O	had
O	sprung
O	from
O	the
O	acorn
O	,
O	and
O	forced
O	themselves
O	between
O	his
O	toes
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	now
O	looked
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	far
O	height
O	of
O	his
O	great
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	perceiving
O	Hercules
O	,
O	roared
O	out
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	voice
O	that
O	resembled
O	thunder
O	,
O	proceeding
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	cloud
O	that
O	had
O	just
O	flitted
O	away
O	from

O	favour
O	by

O	a
O	ramble

O	And
O	,
O	besides
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	still
O	more
O	for

O	own
O	glory
O	if
O	he

O	boast
O	of

O	do
O	so
O	ordinary

O	thing
O	as
O	to
O	conquer
O	a
O	dragon
O	with
O	a
O	hundred
O	heads
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	without
O	more
O	words
O	,
O	the
O	sky
O	was
O	shifted
O	from
O	the
O	shoulders
O	of
O	Atlas
O	and
O	placed
O	upon
O	those
O	of
O	Hercules
O	.
O	When
O	this
O	was
O	safely
O	accomplished
O	,
O	the
O	first
O	thing
O	that
O	the
O	giant
O	did
O	was
O	to
O	stretch
O	himself
O	;
O	and
O	you
O	may
O	imagine
O	what
O	a
O	prodigious
O	spectacle
O	he
O	was
O	then
O	.
O	Next
O	,
O	lie
O	slowly
O	lifted
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	feet
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	that
O	had
O	grown
O	up
O	around
O	it
O	;
O	then
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	caper
O	,
O	and
O	leap
O	,
O	and
O	dance
O	for
O	joy
O	at
O	his
O	freedom
O	;
O	flinging
O	himself
O	nobody
O	knows
O	how
O	high
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	floundering
O	down
O	again
O	with
O	a
O	shock
O	that
O	made
O	the
O	earth
O	tremble
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	laughed
O	--
O	Ho
O	!
O	ho
O	!
O	ho
O	!
O	--
O	with
O	a
O	thunderous
O	roar

O	so
O	many
O	rejoicing
O	brothers

O	When
O	his
O	joy
O	had
O	a
O	little
O	subsided
O	,
O	he
O	stepped
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	;
O	ten
O	miles
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	stride
O	,

O	him
O	midleg
O	deep
O	;
O	and
O	ten
O	miles
O	at
O	the
O	second
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	water
O	came
O	just
O	above
O	his
O	knees
O	;
O	and
O	ten
O	miles
O	more
O	at
O	the
O	third

O	by
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	immersed
O	nearly
O	to

O	waist
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	the
O	greatest
O	depth
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Hercules
O	watched
O	the
O	giant
O	as
O	he
O	still
O	went
O	onward
O	;
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	really
O	a
O	wonderful
O	sight
O	,
O	this
O	immense
O	human
O	form
O	,
O	more
O	than
O	thirty
O	miles
O	off
O	,
O	half
O	hidden
O	in
O	the
O	ocean
O	,
O	but
O	with

O	,
O	and

O	blue
O	as
O	a
O	distant
O	mountain
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	gigantic
O	shape
O	faded
O	entirely
O	out
O	of
O	view
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	Hercules
O	began
O	to

O	by
O	the

O	which
O	guarded
O	the

O	If

O	how

O	And
O	,
O	by

O	all
O	taking

O	wistfully
O	at

O	,
O	and
O	acknowledged

O	and
O	bear

O	For
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	as
O	you

O	on

O	,
O	after
