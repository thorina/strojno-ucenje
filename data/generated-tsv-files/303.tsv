O	King
O	Arthur
O	was
O	spending
O	Whitsuntide
O	at
O	Caerleon-upon-Usk
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	day
O	he
O	hunted
O	the
O	stag
O	in
O	the
O	forests
O	that
O	lay
O	thereby
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	permission
O	for

O	queen
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	see
O	the
O	hunting
O	,

O	set
O	out
O	with
O	one
O	handmaiden
O	,

O	rode
O	in
O	the
O	misty
O	dawning
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	and
O	across
O	the
O	ford
O	.

O	climbed
O	up
O	the

O	,
O	following
O	the
O	track
O	of
O	the
O	men

O	which

O	formed
O	the

O	party
O	,
O	until
O	they
O	stood
O	on
O	the

O	the
O	dark
O	forest
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	young
O	leaves
O	were
O	fresh
O	and
O	sweetly
O	green
O	.
O	The
O	sun
O	burst
O	forth
O	,
O	and
O	sucked
O	up
O	the
O	mists
O	along
O	the
O	meadow

O	beside
O	the

O	sang
O	.

O	,

O	'
O	Suddenly
O	they
O	heard
O	a
O	rushing
O	sound
O	and
O	the
O	thud
O	of
O	hoofs
O	behind
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	turning
O	,
O	they
O	saw
O	a
O	young
O	man
O	upon
O	a
O	hunter
O	foal
O	of
O	mighty
O	size
O	.
O	The

O	A

O	talking

O	heard
O	the
O	clatter
O	of
O	steel
O	armour
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	between
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	they
O	beheld
O	a
O	proud
O	knight
O	upon
O	a

O	went
O	with

O	go
O	towards

O	spurred
O	forward

O	and
O	lashed
O	towards
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	long

O	there
O	,
O	he
O	rode
O	about
O	the
O	little
O	town
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	full
O	of
O	knights
O	and
O	squires
O	,
O	with
O	armourers
O	and
O	others
O	cleaning
O	arms
O	,
O	sharpening
O	swords
O	and
O	repairing

O	.
O	But
O	no
O	one
O	did
O	he
O	know
O	of
O	whom
O	to
O	beg
O	a
O	suit
O	of
O	armour
O	and
O	a
O	lance
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	stream
O	beneath
O	the
O	wall
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	manor-house
O	,
O	old
O	and
O	ruinous
O	,
O	standing
O	amidst
O	tall
O	weeds
O	.
O	And
O	thinking
O	he
O	might
O	get
O	lodging
O	there
O	for
O	that
O	night
O	,
O	he
O	forded
O	the
O	river
O	and
O	went
O	towards
O	the
O	manor
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	hall-door
O	yawned
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	a
O	marble

O	up
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	over
O	a

O	full
O	of
O	stagnant
O	water
O	and
O	thick
O	with
O	green
O	weeds
O	and

O	.
O	On
O	the
O	bridge
O	sat
O	an
O	old
O	and
O	reverend
O	man
O	in

O	been

O	And
O	Geraint
O	thought

O	not
O	possible
O	that
O	so

O	could
O	help

O	at
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	.
O	'
O	Young

O	'
O	He
O	led
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	into
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	bleak
O	and
O	desolate
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hearthstone
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	was
O	thick
O	with
O	last

O	s
O	leaves
O	,
O	as
O	if

O	through
O	the
O	cracks
O	there
O	crept
O	the
O	ivy
O	from
O	the
O	outer
O	wall
O	.
O	The
O	horse
O	was
O	tethered
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	by
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	led
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	to
O	a
O	door
O	upon
O	the
O	dais
O	,
O	and
O	ushered
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	bower
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	saw
O	an
O	old
O	decrepit
O	woman
O	,
O	sweet
O	of
O	look
O	though
O	thin
O	and
O	peaked
O	.
O	She
O	rose
O	from
O	the
O	cushion
O	on
O	which
O	she
O	sat
O	,
O	greeting
O	him
O	kindly
O	,

O	he
O	saw
O	that

O	were
O	also
O	old

O	Yet
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	thought

O	must
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	lovely
O	woman
O	in
O	her
O	happy
O	youth
O	.
O	Beside
O	her
O	was
O	a
O	maiden
O	,
O	upon
O	whom
O	was
O	a
O	vest
O	and

O	poor
O	and
O	thin
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	veil
O	of
O	her
O	headcloth
O	was
O	old
O	though
O	clean
O	.
O	Yet
O	truly
O	,
O	thought
O	Geraint
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	never

O	And
O	the

O	poorly
O	.
O	'

O	drank
O	weak

O	from

O	'
O	The
O	stranger
O	knight
O	looked
O	keenly
O	at
O	Geraint
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	haughty
O	voice
O	cried
O	:

O	to
O	bear
O	arms
O	against
O	me
O	,
O	come
O	forward
O	.
O	'
O	Geraint
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	rode
O	to
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	meadow
O	laughter
O	rippled
O	and
O	rang
O	from
O	the
O	people
O	watching
O	him
O	.
O	For
O	he
O	bore
O	an
O	old
O	and
O	rusty
O	suit
O	of
O	armour
O	that
O	was
O	of
O	an
O	ancient
O	pattern
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	joints
O	of
O	which
O	gaped
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	.
O	And
O	none
O	knew
O	who
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	shield
O	was
O	bare
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	,
O	thundering
O	together
O	,
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	had
O	each
O	broken
O	several
O	lances
O	upon
O	the
O	shield
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	the
O	people
O	eyed
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	with
O	some
O	regard
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	seemed
O	that
O	the
O	proud
O	knight
O	was
O	the
O	better
O	jouster
O	,
O	the
O	earl
O	and
O	his
O	people
O	shouted
O	,
O	and
O	Inewl
O	and
O	Enid
O	had
O	sad
O	looks
O	.
O	'

O	gaping
O	armour
O	.
O	For
O	when
O	they
O	clash
O	together
O	,
O	I
O	feel
O	the
O	cruel
O	point
O	of
O	the
O	proud
O	knight

O	Then
O	the

O	said
O	,

O	you
O	this
O	.
O	It

O	I
O	had
O	on
O	the
O	day
O	when
O	I
O	received
O	knighthood
O	.
O	It
O	was

O	who
O	lives
O	in
O	the
O	Hill
O	of
O	Ithel
O	,

O	'
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	took
O	the
O	lance
O	and
O	thanked
O	the
O	old
O	earl
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	back
O	to
O	where
O	stood
O	Enid
O	.
O	And
O	his
O	heart
O	leaped
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	proud
O	and
O	calm
O	she
O	stood
O	,
O	though
O	her
O	lips
O	trembled
O	as
O	she
O	smiled
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	With
O	that
O	the
O	strength
O	seemed
O	to
O	course
O	like
O	a
O	mountain
O	stream
O	through
O	all
O	his
O	body
O	;
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	uttermost
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	meadow
O	he
O	pricked
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	rushed
O	towards
O	the
O	proud
O	knight
O	.
O	His
O	blow
O	was
O	so
O	mighty
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	good
O	lance
O	so
O	strong
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	shield
O	of
O	the
O	proud
O	knight
O	was
O	cleft
O	in
O	twain
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	thrust
O	far
O	beyond
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	fell
O	crashing
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Then
O	Geraint
O	leaped
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	rising
O	to
O	his
O	feet
O	,

O	dashed
O	together
O	with
O	the
O	fury
O	of

O	bulls
O	;

O	so
O	battled
O	long
O	and
O	sore
O	until
O	the
O	sweat
O	and
O	blood
O	obscured
O	their
O	sight
O	.
O	Once
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	proud
O	knight
O	had
O	struck
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	a
O	mighty
O	blow
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	knight
O	saw
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	fought
O	,
O	how
O	the
O	maid
O	Enid
O	stood
O	with
O	clasped
O	hands
O	and
O	a
O	pale
O	face
O	of
O	terror
O	,
O	as
O	if

O	feared
O	for
O	his

O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	maiden
O	'

O	the
O	proud
O	knight
O	to
O	Queen
O	Gwenevere
O	,
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	waxed
O	both
O	fiercer
O	and
O	stronger
O	;
O	and
O	gathering
O	all
O	his
O	might
O	in
O	one
O	blow
O	,
O	he
O	beat
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	upon
O	the
O	crown
O	of
O	the
O	knight
O	'
O	s
O	helm
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	fierce
O	was
O	it
O	that
O	the
O	headpiece
O	broke
O	and
O	the
O	sword-blade
O	cut
O	to
O	the
O	bone
O	.
O	Straightway
O	the
O	knight
O	fell
O	down
O	upon

O	,
O	for
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	one
O	who
O	would
O	joust
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	began
O	to
O	stay
O	at
O	home
O	and
O	never
O	went
O	beyond
O	his
O	wife
O	'
O	s
O	bower-chamber
O	,
O	but
O	sat
O	and
O	delighted
O	in
O	playing
O	chess
O	,
O	or
O	hearing
O	the
O	bards
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	sing
O	songs
O	of
O	glamour
O	and
O	wizardry
O	,
O	or
O	tell
O	him
O	tales
O	of
O	ancient
O	warriors
O	and
O	lovers
O	,
O	long
O	since
O	dead
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	court
O	marvelled
O	at
O	his
O	slothfulness
O	as
O	time
O	passed
O	and
O	he
O	changed
O	not
O	.
O	He
O	gave
O	up
O	the
O	friendship
O	of
O	his
O	nobles
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	not
O	hunting
O	or
O	hawking
O	;
O	and
O	found
O	no
O	pleasure
O	but
O	in
O	the
O	company
O	of
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	dearly
O	loved
O	.
O	Men
O	began
O	to
O	scoff
O	and
O	jeer
O	at
O	his
O	name
O	over
O	their
O	cups
O	in
O	hall
O	,
O	or
O	as
O	they
O	rode
O	with
O	hawk
O	on
O	fist
O	to
O	the
O	hunting
O	,
O	or
O	as
O	they
O	tilted
O	in
O	the
O	lists
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	lawless
O	lords
O	upon
O	the
O	marches
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	began
O	to
O	stir
O	and
O	to
O	dare
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	none
O	came
O	to
O	punish
O	them
O	,
O	their
O	plunderings
O	and
O	oppressions
O	grew
O	.
O	Soon
O	these
O	things
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	ears
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	King
O	Erbin
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	heaviness
O	was
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	called
O	the
O	Lady
O	Enid
O	to
O	him
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	stern
O	sorrow
O	in
O	his
O	eyes
O	spoke
O	thus
O	:
O	'
O	Fair
O	woman

O	thy
O	love

O	made
O	his
O	name
O	a
O	byword
O	among
O	those
O	who
O	should

O	once
O	was
O	--
O	a
O	man

O	wolfish
O	lords
O	and
O	tyrant
O	barons
O	upon
O	his
O	marchlands
O	begin
O	to

O	out
O	of

O	his
O	people

O	wrest
O	from

O	broad
O	lands

O	fertile
O	fields
O	?
O	'
O	'
O	Nay
O	,
O	lord
O	,
O	nay
O	,

O	said
O	Enid
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	knew
O	from
O	the
O	tears
O	in
O	her
O	brave
O	eyes
O	that
O	she
O	spoke
O	the
O	truth
O	.

O	'
O	And
O	Enid
O	went
O	away
O	weeping
O	sorely
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	Enid
O	awoke
O	from
O	sleep
O	,
O	she
O	sat
O	up
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	Geraint
O	sleeping
O	.
O	The
O	sun

O	shining
O	through
O	the
O	windows
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	upon
O	her
O	husband
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	gazed
O	upon
O	his
O	marvellous
O	beauty
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	great
O	muscles
O	of
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	breast
O	,
O	and
O	tears
O	filled

O	she
O	leaned
O	over
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	Alas
O	,

O	she
O	said
O	half
O	aloud
O	,
O	'

O	'
O	And
O	the
O	words
O	were
O	heard
O	by
O	Geraint
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	felt
O	the
O	scalding
O	tears
O	fall
O	upon
O	his
O	breast
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	lay
O	appearing
O	to
O	be
O	asleep
O	,
O	yet
O	he
O	was
O	awake
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	rage
O	burned
O	in
O	him
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	for
O	some
O	moments
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	or
O	say
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	opened
O	his
O	eyes
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	and
O	felt
O	nothing
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	eyes
O	was
O	a
O	hard
O	gleam
O	.
O	He
O	rose
O	and
O	swiftly
O	dressed
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	his
O	squire
O	.
O	'
O	Go
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	man
O	,
O	'
O	prepare
O	my
O	destrier

O	thereon
O	,

O	rusty
O	.
O	And
O	say
O	naught
O	to
O	none
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	And
O	do
O	thou
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	'
O	rise
O	and
O	apparel
O	thyself
O	,

O	cause
O	thy
O	horse
O	to
O	be
O	prepared
O	,
O	and
O	do
O	thou
O	wear
O	the
O	oldest
O	riding-robe
O	thou
O	hast
O	.
O	And
O	thou
O	wilt
O	come

O	'
O	So
O	Enid
O	arose
O	and
O	clothed
O	herself
O	in
O	her
O	meanest
O	garments
O	.
O	Then
O	Geraint
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	father
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	Sir
O	,

O	keep
O	our
O	kingdom
O	till
O	I

O	'
O	'
O	I
O	will
O	do
O	so
O	,
O	my

O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Erbin
O	,
O	'
O	but
O	thou
O	art
O	not
O	strong
O	enough
O	to
O	go
O	through
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	Logres
O	alone
O	.
O	Wilt
O	thou
O	not
O	have
O	a
O	company
O	with
O	thee
O	?
O	'
O	'
O	But
O	one
O	person
O	shall
O	go
O	with

O	said
O	Geraint
O	,
O	'
O	and
O	that
O	is
O	a
O	woman
O	.
O	Farewell
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	he
O	put
O	on
O	the
O	old
O	and
O	rusty
O	suit
O	of
O	armour
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	shield
O	with
O	no
O	device
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	sword
O	and
O	a
O	lance
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	mounting
O	his
O	horse
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	way
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	And
O	Enid
O	went
O	before
O	him
O	on
O	her
O	palfrey
O	,
O	marvelling
O	what
O	all
O	this
O	might
O	mean
O	.
O	Geraint
O	called
O	unto
O	her
O	and
O	said
O	sternly
O	:
O	'
O	Go
O	thou

O	'
O	All
O	day
O	they
O	rode
O	thus
O	,
O	and
O	deeper
O	and
O	deeper
O	they
O	sank
O	into
O	a
O	desolate
O	land
O	,
O	where
O	huge
O	rocks
O	jutted
O	from
O	the
O	starved
O	soil
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	sound
O	or
O	sight
O	of
O	living
O	thing
O	,
O	except
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	wolf
O	looking
O	from
O	his
O	lair
O	beneath
O	a
O	stone
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	breaking
O	of
O	a
O	branch
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	brown
O	bear
O	on
O	a
O	distant
O	hillslope
O	tore
O	at
O	a
O	tree
O	to
O	get
O	a
O	honeycomb
O	,
O	and
O	blinked
O	down
O	at
O	them
O	,
O	marvelling
O	,
O	maybe
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	knight
O	and
O	a
O	lady
O	in
O	his
O	desolate
O	domain
O	.
O	When
O	,
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	,
O	their
O	long
O	shadows
O	marched
O	before
O	them
O	down
O	a
O	broad
O	green
O	road
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	struck
O	upon
O	,
O	Enid
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	suddenly
O	lifted
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	white
O	walls
O	and
O	roofs
O	of
O	what
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	rich
O	town
O	;
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	was
O	in
O	her
O	lord
O	'
O	s
O	mind
O	,
O	and
O	feared
O	lest
O	his
O	strange
O	anger
O	should
O	push
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	through
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	become
O	a
O	prey
O	to
O	robbers
O	or
O	wild
O	animals
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	marvelled
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	sight
O	or
O	sound
O	of
O	people
O	;
O	no
O	carters
O	or
O	travellers
O	going
O	to
O	or
O	coming
O	from
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	smoke
O	rose
O	above
O	the
O	housetops
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	nearer
O	,
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	wall
O	of
O	the
O	gate
O	was
O	broken
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	along
O	the
O	broad
O	road
O	beyond
O	the
O	wall
O	the
O	grass
O	waved
O	high
O	across
O	the
O	street
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	wooden
O	booths
O	and
O	cabins
O	beside
O	the
O	road
O	were
O	rotting
O	and
O	decayed
O	.
O	Anon
O	they
O	rode
O	into
O	a
O	broad
O	market-place
O	or
O	forum
O	,
O	where
O	white
O	buildings
O	rose
O	above
O	them
O	,
O	the
O	windows
O	gaping
O	,
O	grass
O	growing
O	on
O	the
O	roofs
O	or
O	in
O	the
O	crannies
O	of
O	the
O	walls
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	doorways
O	choked
O	with
O	bushes
O	.
O	And
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	broad
O	hallway
O	of
O	the
O	basilica
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	grey
O	form
O	of
O	a
O	wolf
O	walk
O	and
O	slink
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	shadows
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	sinking
O	heart
O	she
O	knew
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	fair
O	cities
O	which
O	the
O	Romans
O	had
O	built
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	left
O	Britain
O	this
O	town
O	had
O	been
O	deserted
O	and
O	left
O	desolate
O	,
O	to
O	become
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	wolf
O	and
O	the
O	bear
O	made
O	their
O	lairs
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	beaver
O	built
O	his
O	dam
O	in
O	the
O	stream
O	beneath
O	the
O	wall
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	robbers
O	and
O	wild
O	men
O	lay
O	hid
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	small
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	hills
O	came
O	and
O	made
O	their
O	magic
O	and
O	weaved
O	their
O	spells
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	aid
O	of
O	the
O	spirits
O	haunting
O	the
O	desolate
O	hearths
O	of
O	the
O	Romans
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	Enid
O	checked
O	her
O	horse
O	and
O	waited
O	for
O	Geraint
O	to
O	come
O	up
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	ask
O	him
O	whether
O	it
O	was
O	his
O	pleasure
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	night
O	there
O	,
O	she
O	saw
O	,
O	down
O	the
O	wide
O	street
O	before
O	her
O	,
O	the
O	forms
O	of
O	men
O	,
O	creeping
O	and
O	gathering
O	in
O	the
O	gloom
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	fearing
O	lest
O	they
O	should
O	fall
O	upon
O	her
O	husband
O	before
O	he
O	was
O	aware
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	she
O	turned
O	her
O	horse
O	and
O	rode
O	towards
O	him
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	'
O	Lord
O	,
O	dost
O	thou
O	see
O	the
O	wild
O	men
O	which
O	gather
O	in
O	the
O	shadows
O	there
O	in
O	the
O	street
O	before
O	us
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	attack
O	thee
O	?
O	'
O	Geraint
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	angry
O	eyes
O	to
O	hers
O	:
O	'
O	Thou
O	wert
O	bid
O	to
O	keep
O	silent
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	whatsoever
O	thou
O	hast
O	seen
O	or
O	heard
O	.
O	Why
O	dost
O	thou
O	warn
O	one
O	whom
O	thou
O	dost
O	despise
O	?
O	'
O	Even
O	as
O	he
O	spoke
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	broken
O	houses
O	through
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	crept
O	to
O	assail
O	the
O	single
O	knight
O	,
O	dashed
O	ten
O	robbers
O	,
O	naked
O	of
O	feet
O	,
O	evil
O	of
O	look
O	,
O	clothed
O	in
O	skins
O	.
O	One
O	leaped
O	at
O	the
O	knight
O	with
O	a
O	knife
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	cut
O	down
O	,
O	halfway
O	in
O	his
O	spring
O	,
O	by
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	'
O	s
O	fierce
O	sword-stroke
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	while
O	Enid
O	stood
O	apart
O	,
O	terror
O	in
O	her
O	heart
O	,
O	prayer
O	on
O	her
O	lips
O	,
O	she
O	saw
O	him
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	a
O	pack
O	of
O	tearing
O	wolves
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	silent
O	street
O	with
O	its
O	twilight
O	was
O	the
O	sudden
O	clash
O	of
O	steel
O	,
O	the
O	howls
O	and
O	cries
O	of
O	wounded
O	men
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	was
O	aware
O	that
O	six
O	lay
O	quiet
O	on
O	the
O	road
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	remaining
O	four
O	broke
O	suddenly
O	away
O	towards
O	the
O	shelter
O	of
O	the
O	houses
O	.
O	But
O	two
O	of
O	these
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	pursued
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	down
O	before
O	they
O	could
O	reach
O	cover
O	.
O	He
O	rejoined
O	her
O	in
O	silence
O	and
O	sought
O	for
O	a
O	place
O	of
O	lodging
O	;
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	small
O	villa
O	they
O	found
O	a
O	room
O	with
O	but
O	one
O	door
O	.
O	Here
O	they
O	supped
O	from
O	the
O	scrip
O	of
O	food
O	and
O	the
O	bottle
O	of
O	wine
O	which
O	Enid
O	had
O	brought
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	they
O	slept
O	that
O	night
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morrow
O	they
O	pursued
O	their
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	followed
O	the
O	green
O	road
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	ruined
O	city
O	until
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	the
O	heat
O	and
O	brightness
O	of
O	the
O	high
O	noon
O	the
O	green
O	and
O	coolness
O	of
O	the
O	forestways
O	were
O	sweet
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	tiny
O	streams
O	hidden
O	beneath
O	the
O	leaves
O	was
O	refreshing
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	plain
O	where
O	was
O	a
O	village
O	surrounded
O	by
O	a
O	bank
O	of
O	earth
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	palisade
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	wailing
O	and
O	weeping
O	coming
O	from
O	between
O	the
O	little
O	mud-cabins
O	therein
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	they
O	approached
O	they
O	saw
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	green
O	four
O	knights
O	in
O	armour
O	and
O	a
O	crowd
O	of
O	poor
O	frightened
O	folk
O	about
O	them
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	passed
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	a
O	poor
O	man
O	ran
O	from
O	the
O	group
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	himself
O	before
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	.
O	'
O	O
O	sir
O	knight
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	cried
O	full
O	piteously
O	,
O	'
O	if

O	and
O	a
O	brave
O	,

O	thou
O	see
O	justice
O	done
O	here
O	.
O	For
O	these
O	four
O	lords
O	would
O	cut
O	my
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	throat
O	if

O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Are
O	they

O	asked
O	Geraint
O	.
O	'
O	Nay

O	,

O	that

O	sleeps
O	all
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	they
O	will
O	be
O	our

O	they
O	do
O	ever
O	oppress
O	us
O	with
O	fine
O	and
O	tax
O	and
O	torture
O	.
O	'
O	Therewith
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	rode
O	through
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	and
O	approached
O	the
O	group
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	where
O	the
O	four
O	knights
O	stood
O	cruelly
O	torturing
O	a
O	poor
O	old
O	man
O	whom
O	they
O	had
O	tied
O	to
O	a
O	post
O	,

O	the
O	sweat
O	stood
O	upon
O	the
O	peasant
O	'
O	s
O	white
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fear

O	eyes
O	.
O	'
O	Lords

O	'
O	At
O	the
O	cruel
O	torture
O	the

O	shrieked
O	aloud
O	,

O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	the

O	sank
O	and
O	he
O	slid
O	down
O	the
O	post
O	in
O	a
O	swoon
O	.
O	And
O	a
O	young
O	woman
O	rushed
O	forth
O	,
O	threw
O	her
O	arm
O	about
O	the
O	hanging
O	body
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	flashing
O	eyes
O	turned
O	and

O	moment
O	it

O	gone
O	ill
O	with

O	'
O	The
O	knights
O	turned
O	in
O	rage
O	,
O	and
O	laughed
O	and
O	sneered
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	but
O	one
O	solitary
O	knight
O	in
O	old
O	and
O	rusty
O	armour
O	.
O	'
O	Ah

O	down

O	him
O	up
O	with
O	this
O	starveling
O	peasant
O	,
O	'
O	cried
O	another
O	.
O	All
O	now
O	had
O	mounted
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	first
O	prepared
O	to
O	run
O	at
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	,
O	who
O	backed
O	his
O	horse
O	through
O	the
O	gateway
O	into
O	the
O	open
O	plain
O	.
O	Anon
O	the
O	first
O	knight
O	came
O	,
O	hurling
O	himself
O	angrily
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	deftly
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	struck
O	the
O	other
O	'
O	s
O	lance
O	aside
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	rider
O	rushed
O	past
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	rose
O	in
O	his
O	stirrups
O	,
O	his
O	blade
O	flashed
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	sank
O	in
O	the
O	neck
O	of
O	the
O	felon
O	knight
O	,
O	who
O	swayed
O	in
O	his
O	saddle
O	and
O	then
O	crashed
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	second
O	horseman
O	attacked
O	him
O	furiously
O	,
O	being
O	wroth
O	at
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	his
O	companion
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	couched
O	his
O	lance
O	,
O	and
O	caught
O	the
O	other
O	on
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	his
O	shield
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	spear
O	passed
O	through
O	his
O	body
O	.
O	And
O	by
O	good
O	hap
O	also
O	he
O	slew
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	,
O	one
O	with
O	his
O	lance
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	with

O	sword
O	on

O	Enid
O	,
O	full
O	of
O	fear
O	while
O	the
O	fight
O	was
O	raging
O	,
O	felt
O	gladness
O	and
O	sorrow
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	how
O	nobly
O	her
O	husband
O	had
O	smitten
O	these
O	torturers
O	with
O	justice
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	said
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	truth
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	wrong
O	,
O	and
O	that

O	the
O	strong
O	arm

O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	took
O	off
O	the

O	them
O	before

O	.
O	'
O	And
O	do
O	thou
O	go
O	forward

O	'
O	As

O	mounted
O	his

O	,
O	the
O	man
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	tortured
O	came
O	forward
O	with

O	knelt
O	before

O	kissed
O	the
O	mail-clad
O	shoe
O	in
O	his
O	stirrup
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	rude
O	few
O	words
O	they
O	thanked
O	him
O	tearfully
O	,
O	asking
O	for

O	name
O	,
O	so
O	that

O	prayers
O	.
O	'
O	I

O	I
O	deserve

O	But
O	,

O	ye
O	,

O	a
O	little
O	while
O	they
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	highroad
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	lady
O	went
O	on
O	first
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	all
O	his
O	anger
O	,
O	Geraint
O	was
O	sorry
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	much
O	trouble
O	Enid
O	had
O	in
O	driving
O	the
O	four
O	horses
O	before
O	her
O	,
O	yet
O	how
O	patient
O	she
O	was
O	.
O	Soon
O	they
O	beheld
O	a
O	wide
O	valley
O	below
O	them
O	,
O	the
O	fairest
O	and
O	richest
O	in
O	homesteads
O	and
O	farms
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	yet
O	seen
O	.
O	A
O	river
O	ran
O	through
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	road
O	on
O	which
O	they
O	passed
O	ran
O	down
O	to
O	a
O	bridge
O	over
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	beyond
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	castle
O	and
O	a
O	walled
O	town
O	.
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	took
O	the
O	road
O	towards
O	the
O	bridge
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	a
O	knight
O	came
O	cantering
O	towards
O	them
O	.
O	'
O	Fair
O	sir
O	,

O	said
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	,
O	'

O	?
O	'
O	'
O	Of
O	a
O	truth
O	,

O	said
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	'
O	these
O	are
O	the

O	the
O	Little
O	King
O	.
O	He

O	that

O	so
O	famous
O	,

O	'
O	'

O	thank
O	thee
O	for
O	thy
O	words
O	,
O	fair

O	said
O	Geraint
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	pass
O	on
O	.
O	'
O	I
O	would

O	thee
O	not

O	,
O	'

O	the

O	For
O	armed
O	strangers
O	he
O	will
O	not
O	suffer
O	to
O	pass
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	doubt
O	me

O	of
O	much
O	use
O	to

O	.
O	'
O	And
O	the
O	knight
O	smiled
O	at
O	the
O	rusty
O	arms
O	and
O	shield
O	of
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	.
O	'
O	Nevertheless
O	,

O	said
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	,
O	'
O	though
O	my

O	.
O	'
O	'
O	If

O	so
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	'
O	thou
O	wilt
O	meet
O	with
O	shame
O	and
O	defeat
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	little
O	king
O	is
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	giant
O	strength
O	.
O	'
O	But
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	passed
O	down
O	towards
O	the
O	bridge
O	and
O	crossed
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	along
O	the
O	road
O	beyond
O	towards
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	Presently
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	heard
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	hoofs
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	round
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	knight
O	following
O	him
O	upon
O	a
O	great
O	black
O	horse
O	,
O	tall
O	and
O	stately
O	and
O	stepping
O	proudly
O	.
O	The
O	knight
O	was
O	the
O	smallest
O	that
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	had
O	ever
O	seen
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	stranger
O	had
O	come
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	:
O	'
O	Tell
O	me
O	,
O	fair
O	sir
O	,
O	is
O	it
O	by
O	presumption

O	by
O	ignorance
O	that
O	thou
O	comest
O	armed
O	along
O	this
O	road
O	?
O	'
O	'
O	I
O	knew
O	not
O	that
O	in
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	lands
O	of
O	King
O	Erbin
O	,
O	a
O	peaceful
O	man
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	be
O	armed
O	,
O	could
O	not
O	go
O	without
O	hindrance
O	,
O	'
O	replied
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	.
O	'
O	That
O	was
O	so
O	,
O	'
O	replied
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	'
O	when
O	King
O	Erbin
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	prowess
O	,
O	not
O	a
O	soft
O	fool
O	.
O	Then
O	his
O	name
O	alone
O	kept
O	his
O	borders
O	clean
O	of
O	robber
O	lords
O	and
O	bandit
O	knights
O	;
O	but
O	now
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	less
O	than
O	naught
O	,
O	I
O	myself
O	must
O	keep
O	my
O	land
O	clean
O	of
O	thieves
O	in
O	rusty
O	armour
O	that
O	would
O	frighten
O	and
O	oppress
O	poor
O	folk
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	,
O	'
O	I
O	will
O	travel
O	by
O	this
O	road
O	,
O	and
O	ye
O	hinder
O	me
O	at
O	your
O	peril
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Have
O	at
O	thee
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	little
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	together
O	they
O	spurred
O	towards
O	each
O	other
O	.
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	marvelled
O	to
O	feel
O	how
O	powerful
O	were
O	the
O	lance-strokes
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	man
O	,
O	while
O	,
O	as
O	for
O	himself
O	,
O	so
O	high
O	was
O	the
O	little
O	knight
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	and
O	so
O	small
O	was
O	the
O	rider
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	hardly
O	able
O	to
O	get
O	a
O	good
O	blow
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	jousted
O	until
O	at
O	the
O	third
O	bout
O	the
O	little
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	lance
O	broke
O	short
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	they
O	dismounted
O	,
O	and
O	lashed
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	with
O	their
O	swords
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	nigh
O	unseemly
O	that
O	one
O	so
O	strong
O	and
O	tall
O	as
O	himself
O	should
O	have
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	so
O	small
O	a
O	knight
O	;
O	but
O	if
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	advantage
O	in
O	his
O	longer
O	reach
O	and
O	greater
O	strength
O	he
O	quickly
O	saw
O	his
O	error
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	little
O	king
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	marvellous
O	strength
O	and
O	agility
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	all
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	'
O	s
O	knowledge
O	and
O	strength
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	'
O	s
O	strokes
O	were
O	so
O	boldly
O	fierce
O	,
O	so
O	quick
O	and
O	powerful
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	ere
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	found
O	he
O	had
O	need
O	of
O	great
O	wariness
O	.
O	Soon
O	their
O	helmets
O	were
O	cracked
O	and
O	their
O	shields
O	dented
O	and
O	carved
O	and
O	their
O	hauberks
O	in
O	rags
O	,
O	and
O	hardly
O	could
O	they
O	see
O	between
O	the
O	bars
O	of
O	their
O	vizors
O	for
O	the
O	sweat
O	and
O	blood
O	in
O	their
O	eyes
O	.
O	Then
O	at
O	last
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	,
O	enraged
O	that
O	one
O	so
O	small
O	should
O	give
O	him
O	so
O	much
O	trouble
O	to
O	conquer
O	,
O	gathered
O	all
O	his
O	strength
O	in
O	one
O	blow
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	king
O	was
O	beaten
O	to
O	his
O	knees
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sword
O	flew
O	from
O	his
O	hand
O	ten
O	yards
O	away
O	.
O	'
O	I
O	yield
O	me
O	!
O	'
O	cried
O	King
O	Griffith
O	,
O	'
O	and
O	never
O	have
O	I
O	fought
O	with
O	so
O	valiant
O	and
O	strong
O	a
O	knight
O	.
O	Have
O	mercy
O	and
O	spare
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	be
O	thy
O	man
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Be
O	it
O	so
O	!
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	,
O	'
O	but
O	thou
O	hast
O	already
O	sworn
O	to
O	be
O	my
O	man
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	he
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	vizor
O	and
O	showed
O	his
O	face
O	,
O	whereat
O	the
O	little
O	king
O	did
O	off
O	his
O	own
O	helm
O	quickly
O	and
O	came
O	and
O	kneeled
O	humbly
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	forgive
O	me
O	my
O	words
O	concerning
O	thee
O	,
O	but
O	men
O	told
O	me
O	that
O	ye
O	had
O	forgotten
O	that
O	you
O	had
O	once
O	been
O	so
O	glorious
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	softening
O	to
O	a
O	fool
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Nay
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	,
O	'
O	they
O	were
O	the
O	fools
O	that
O	said
O	so
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	I
O	will
O	depart
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	see
O	these
O	marches
O	are
O	in
O	safe
O	keeping
O	in
O	your
O	hands
O	,
O	fair
O	king
O	.
O	'
O	But
O	the
O	little
O	king
O	wished
O	Geraint
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	his
O	castle
O	to
O	be
O	rested
O	and
O	healed
O	of
O	his
O	wounds
O	,
O	and
O	Geraint
O	and
O	Enid
O	went
O	and
O	abode
O	there
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	.
O	But
O	ever
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	was
O	cold
O	and
O	stern
O	to
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	still
O	angry
O	at
O	her
O	disbelief
O	in
O	him
O	.
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	would
O	not
O	stay
O	longer
O	,
O	though
O	his
O	wounds
O	were
O	but
O	half
O	healed
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	he
O	commanded
O	Enid
O	to
O	mount
O	her
O	horse
O	and
O	to
O	go
O	before
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	four
O	other
O	horses
O	.
O	While
O	the
O	sun
O	climbed
O	up
O	the
O	sky
O	they
O	rode
O	through
O	the
O	wilderness
O	,
O	by
O	tangled
O	woods
O	,
O	deep
O	valleys
O	and
O	quaking
O	marshes
O	,
O	until
O	they
O	reached
O	a
O	deep
O	dark
O	forest
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	as
O	they
O	rode
O	they
O	heard
O	a
O	great
O	wailing
O	of
O	distress
O	,
O	and
O	bidding
O	Enid
O	stay
O	,
O	Geraint
O	dashed
O	through
O	the
O	trees
O	towards
O	the
O	crying
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	out
O	upon
O	a
O	great
O	bare
O	upland
O	,
O	and
O	beside
O	the
O	wood
O	were
O	a
O	knight
O	,
O	dead
O	in
O	his
O	armour
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	horses
O	,
O	one
O	with
O	a
O	woman
O	'
O	s
O	saddle
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	And
O	looking
O	further
O	Geraint
O	saw
O	three
O	small
O	dark
O	shaggy
O	trolls
O	making
O	swift
O	way
O	up
O	the
O	hill
O	towards
O	a
O	great
O	green
O	mound
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	arms
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	was
O	a
O	damsel
O	,
O	who
O	shrieked
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	borne
O	away
O	.
O	Fiercely
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	spurred
O	his
O	horse
O	up
O	the
O	slope
O	,
O	bidding
O	the
O	trolls
O	to
O	stop
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	only
O	ran
O	with
O	an
O	exceeding
O	great
O	swiftness
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	pursued
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	within
O	a
O	few
O	steps
O	of
O	a
O	small
O	door
O	in
O	the
O	hillside
O	,
O	the
O	one
O	dropped
O	the
O	maiden
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	three
O	of
O	them
O	turned
O	at
O	bay
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	damsel
O	ran
O	shrieking
O	away
O	down
O	the
O	hill
O	.
O	The
O	trolls
O	had
O	dark
O	thin
O	faces
O	,
O	with
O	curly
O	black
O	hair
O	and
O	fierce
O	black
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	rage
O	was
O	horrible
O	to
O	see
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	lightly
O	clothed
O	in
O	skins
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	their
O	arms
O	they
O	held
O	,
O	one
O	a
O	bar
O	of
O	iron
O	,
O	another
O	a
O	great
O	club
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	third
O	a
O	long
O	sharp
O	stick
O	.
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	commended
O	his
O	soul
O	to
O	Heaven
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	battle
O	with
O	evil
O	dwarfs
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	hollow
O	hills
O	,
O	and
O	whose
O	strength
O	was
O	greater
O	than
O	any
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	and
O	whose
O	powers
O	of
O	wizardry
O	were
O	stronger
O	than
O	Merlin
O	'
O	s
O	.
O	He
O	dashed
O	with
O	his
O	lance
O	at
O	the
O	one
O	with
O	the
O	iron
O	bar
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	hill-troll
O	slipped
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	the
O	great
O	bar
O	with
O	a
O	heavy
O	blow
O	upon
O	his
O	lance
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	snapped
O	in
O	twain
O	.
O	Then
O	one
O	leaped
O	like
O	a
O	wild
O	cat
O	upon
O	the
O	arm
O	that
O	held
O	the
O	rein
O	,
O	but
O	happily
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	had
O	drawn
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	one
O	stroke
O	slew
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	two
O	others
O	leaped
O	towards
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	blows
O	of
O	the
O	bar
O	and
O	club
O	he
O	caught
O	upon
O	his
O	shield
O	and
O	slew
O	the
O	troll
O	with
O	the
O	club
O	.
O	Ere
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	could
O	draw
O	his
O	sword
O	back
O	from
O	this
O	blow
O	,
O	he
O	felt
O	his
O	horse
O	fall
O	under
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	dwarf
O	with
O	the
O	iron
O	bar
O	had
O	with
O	one
O	blow
O	broken
O	the
O	beast
O	'
O	s
O	back
O	.
O	Quickly
O	avoiding
O	the
O	horse
O	,
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	dashed
O	at
O	the
O	dwarf
O	,
O	who
O	ran
O	towards
O	the
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	hill
O	,
O	but
O	ere
O	he
O	could
O	reach
O	it
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	blow
O	on
O	the
O	crown
O	of
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	so
O	fierce
O	and
O	hard
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	skull
O	was
O	split
O	to
O	the
O	shoulders
O	.
O	So
O	then
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	turned
O	and
O	walked
O	slowly
O	down
O	the
O	hill
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	dazed
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	old
O	wounds
O	had
O	broken
O	afresh
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	where
O	Enid
O	stood
O	comforting
O	the
O	damsel
O	mourning
O	over
O	the
O	dead
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	there
O	,
O	straightway
O	he
O	fell
O	down
O	lifeless
O	.
O	Enid
O	shrieked
O	with
O	the
O	anguish
O	of
O	the
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	dead
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	and
O	knelt
O	beside
O	him
O	and
O	undid
O	his
O	helm
O	and
O	kissed
O	him
O	many
O	times
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	her
O	wailing
O	reached
O	an
O	earl
O	named
O	Madoc
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	passing
O	with
O	a
O	company
O	along
O	the
O	road
O	from
O	a
O	plundering
O	expedition
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	came
O	and
O	took
O	up
O	Geraint
O	and
O	the
O	dead
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	laid
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	hollow
O	of
O	their
O	shields
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	damsels
O	took
O	them
O	to
O	his
O	castle
O	a
O	mile
O	along
O	the
O	road
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	earl
O	was
O	a
O	tyrant
O	and
O	a
O	robber
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	done
O	much
O	evil
O	on
O	the
O	borderlands
O	of
O	Geraint
O	,
O	in
O	burning
O	,
O	plundering
O	and
O	slaying
O	,
O	since
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	that
O	Geraint
O	was
O	become
O	soft
O	and
O	foolish
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	had
O	recognised
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	while
O	he
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	swoon
O	,
O	and
O	rejoiced
O	that
O	now
O	he
O	was
O	like
O	to
O	die
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	rode
O	along
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	prevail
O	upon
O	the
O	Lady
O	Enid
O	to
O	wed
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	might
O	get
O	much
O	land
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	widow
O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	,
O	future
O	King
O	of
O	Cornwall
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	determined
O	to
O	make
O	her
O	marry
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	host
O	had
O	reached
O	his
O	castle
O	,
O	he
O	ordered
O	the
O	dead
O	knight
O	to
O	be
O	buried
O	,
O	but
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	he
O	commanded
O	to
O	be
O	laid
O	in
O	his
O	shield
O	on
O	a
O	litter-couch
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	high
O	table
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	.
O	So
O	that
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	should
O	die
O	,
O	he
O	commanded
O	that
O	no
O	leech
O	should
O	be
O	sent
O	for
O	.
O	While
O	his
O	knights
O	and
O	men-at-arms
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	dine
O	,
O	Earl
O	Madoc
O	came
O	to
O	Enid
O	and
O	begged
O	her
O	to
O	make
O	good
O	cheer
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	thinking
O	to
O	gain
O	more
O	from
O	secrecy
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	tell
O	her
O	that
O	he
O	knew
O	who
O	she
O	was
O	,
O	nor
O	did
O	he
O	show

O	knew
O	who
O	was
O	her
O	lord
O	.

O	had
O	mounted
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	up
O	Enid
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	placed
O	her
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	Thus
O	they
O	rode
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	away
O	as
O	rapidly
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	reconciled
O	,
O	much
O	joyful
O	and
O	loving
O	talk
O	was
O	between
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	night
O	was
O	coming
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	Geraint
O	was
O	weak
O	from
O	his
O	wounds
O	and
O	loss
O	of
O	blood
O	,
O	and
O	Enid
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	trouble
O	for
O	the
O	pain
O	her
O	husband
O	suffered
O	.
O	She
O	prayed
O	fervently
O	that
O	soon
O	they
O	might
O	reach
O	a
O	town
O	where
O	she
O	could
O	obtain
O	help
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	she
O	heard
O	far
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	the
O	tramp
O	of
O	horses
O	,
O	and
O	Enid
O	could
O	have
O	wept
O	for
O	sorrow
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	kept
O	her
O	face
O	calm
O	,
O	though
O	her
O	lips
O	trembled
O	,
O	Geraint
O	also
O	heard
O	the
O	beat
O	of
O	the
O	hoofs
O	,
O	and
O	turning
O	in
O	his
O	saddle
O	he
O	looked
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	on
O	the
O	skyline
O	of
O	the
O	narrow
O	road
O	the
O	glint
O	of
O	spears
O	between
O	them
O	and
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	'
O	Dear
O	wife
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	faint
O	brave
O	smile
O	,
O	'
O	I
O	hear
O	some
O	one
O	following
O	us
O	.
O	I
O	will
O	put
O	thee
O	in
O	hiding
O	behind

O	,
O	and
O	should
O	they
O	slay
O	me
O	,
O	do
O	thou
O	make
O	thy
O	way
O	homeward
O	to
O	my
O	father
O	Erbin
O	,
O	and
O	bid
O	him
O	avenge
O	my
O	death
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	O
O	my
O	dear
O	Geraint
O	!
O	'
O	said
O	Enid
O	,
O	sobbing
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	her
O	bravery
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	surely
O	be
O	slain
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	their
O	trouble
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	allowed
O	to
O	enjoy
O	the
O	happiness
O	of
O	their
O	reconciliation
O	.
O	'
O	I
O	would
O	liefer
O	die
O	with
O	thee
O	,
O	my
O	dear
O	,
O	dear
O	lord
O	.
O	Let
O	them
O	kill
O	us
O	both
O	,
O	if
O	it
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Nay
O	,
O	dear
O	wife
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Geraint
O	,
O	'
O	I
O	would
O	not

O	thee
O	slain
O	.
O	Revenge
O	my
O	death
O	if
O	they
O	slay
O	me
O	.
O	'
O	So
O	,
O	with
O	many
O	lingering
O	kisses
O	,
O	he
O	set
O	her
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	road
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	her
O	hide
O	in
O	the
O	thickets
O	.
O	By
O	now
O	the
O	gloom
O	of
O	evening
O	had
O	settled
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	trampling
O	horses
O	had
O	rapidly
O	approached
O	.
O	And
O	painfully
O	,
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	his
O	stiff
O	wounds
O	,
O	Geraint
O	dressed
O	his
O	armour
O	as
O	best
O	he
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	laid
O	spear
O	in
O	rest
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	his
O	shield
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	waited
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	road
O	.
O	He
O	heard
O	a
O	single
O	knight
O	riding
O	before
O	the
O	others
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	saw
O	his
O	figure
O	issue
O	from
O	the
O	gloom
O	with
O	couched
O	lance
O	.
O	And
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	made
O	him
O	ready
O	also
O	,
O	resolved
O	to
O	sell
O	his
O	life
O	dearly
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	spur
O	their
O	horses
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	Enid
O	from
O	the
O	hedgerow
O	beside
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	cried
O	out
O	piteously
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	:
O	'
O	O
O	chieftain
O	,
O	whoever

O	gain
O	by
O	slaying
O	a
O	dead
O	man
O	?
O	'
O	The
O	stranger
O	stopped
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	out
O	:
O	'
O	O

O	'
O	Yes

O	the
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	swiftly
O	towards
O	Sir
O	Geraint
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	leaped
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	stirrup
O	of
O	his
O	chief
O	.
O	'
O	My

O	ran
O	forward

O	joy
O	at
O	hearing

O	welcomed
O	the
O	little

O	day
O	by
O	day

O	was
O	quite
O	well
O	again
O	.

O	fame

O	HOW
O	SIR
O	PERCEVAL
O	WAS
O	TAUGHT
O	CHIVALRY
O	,
O	AND
O	ENDED
O	THE
O	EVIL
O	WROUGHT
O	BY
O	SIR
O	BALIN
O	'
O	S
O	DOLOROUS
O	STROKE
O	It
O	befell
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	when
O	King
O	Arthur
O	was
O	Pendragon
O	,
O	or
O	overlord
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	Britain
O	,
O	that
O	Earl
O	Evroc
O	held
O	an
O	earldom
O	of
O	large
O	dominion
O	in
O	the
O	north
O	under
O	King
O	Uriens
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	earl
O	had
O	seven
O	sons
O	,
O	the
O	last
O	being
O	but
O	a
O	child
O	still
O	at
O	play
O	about
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	chair
O	as
O	she
O	sat
O	with
O	her
O	maidens
O	in
O	the
O	bower
O	.
O	Lord
O	Evroc
O	was
O	a
O	valiant
O	and
O	a
O	mighty
O	warrior
O	,
O	ever
O	battling
O	against
O	the
O	hated
O	pagans
O	,
O	when
O	their
O	bands
O	of
O	blue-eyed
O	fierce
O	fighters
O	landed
O	on
O	his
O	coasts
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	peace
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	about
O	on
O	errantry
O	,
O	jousting
O	in
O	tournaments
O	and
O	fighting
O	champions
O	.
O	His
O	six
O	elder
O	sons
O	did
O	likewise
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	were
O	famed
O	for
O	their
O	knightly
O	prowess
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	mother
O	sat
O	at
O	home
O	,
O	sad
O	of
O	mood
O	.
O	For
O	she
O	hated
O	war
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	rather
O	have
O	had
O	her
O	lord
O	and
O	her
O	six
O	tall
O	sons
O	about
O	her
O	in
O	the
O	home
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	her
O	heart
O	she
O	resolved
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	plead
O	with
O	Evroc
O	to
O	let
O	her
O	have
O	her
O	little
O	son
O	Perceval
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	clerk
O	or
O	a
O	learned
O	bard
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	stay
O	at
O	home
O	with
O	her
O	and
O	run
O	no
O	risk
O	of
O	death
O	.
O	The
O	sorrow
O	she
O	was
O	ever
O	dreading
O	smote
O	her
O	at
O	length
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	messenger
O	came
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	Earl
O	Evroc
O	her
O	lord
O	had
O	been
O	slain
O	at
O	Bamborough
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	mighty
O	melée
O	between
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	best
O	and
O	most
O	valiant
O	knights
O	of
O	Logres
O	and
O	Alban
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	tall
O	sons
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	years
O	passed
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	little
O	son
O	began
O	to
O	run
O	,
O	three
O	black
O	days
O	came
O	within
O	a
O	little
O	of
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	for
O	on
O	these
O	days
O	messengers
O	came
O	with
O	the
O	sad
O	news
O	of
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	her
O	other
O	boys
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	been
O	done
O	to
O	death
O	by
O	an
O	evil
O	troll
O	on
O	the
O	lonely
O	wastes
O	by
O	the
O	Roman
O	wall
O	,
O	two
O	others
O	were
O	slain
O	by
O	the
O	shores
O	of
O	Humber
O	,
O	repelling
O	a
O	horde
O	of
O	fair-haired
O	Saxon
O	raiders
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	was
O	killed
O	at
O	a
O	ford
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	kept
O	at
O	bay
O	six
O	bandit
O	knights
O	that
O	would
O	have
O	pursued
O	and
O	slain
O	his
O	wounded
O	lord
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	in
O	her
O	grief
O	,
O	the
O	widow
O	dame
O	resolved
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	fly
O	with
O	her
O	little
O	son
O	,
O	and
O	make
O	a
O	home
O	for
O	him
O	in
O	some
O	wilderness
O	,
O	where
O	never
O	sounds
O	or
O	sights
O	of
O	war
O	or
O	death
O	would
O	come
O	,
O	where
O	knights
O	would
O	be
O	unknown
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	one
O	would
O	speak
O	to
O	him
O	of
O	arms
O	and
O	battles
O	.
O	And
O	thus
O	did
O	she
O	do
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	left
O	the
O	hall
O	where
O	she
O	had
O	lived
O	,
O	and
O	removed
O	to
O	the
O	deserts
O	and
O	wastes
O	of
O	the
O	wilderness
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	with
O	her
O	only
O	her
O	women
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	few
O	boys
O	and
O	spiritless
O	men
O	,
O	too
O	old
O	or
O	feeble
O	to
O	fight
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	fighting
O	.
O	Thus
O	she
O	reared
O	the
O	only
O	son
O	left
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	teaching
O	him
O	all
O	manner
O	of
O	nobleness
O	in
O	thought
O	and
O	action
O	and
O	in
O	learning
O	,
O	but
O	never
O	suffering
O	him
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	weapon
O	,
O	nor
O	to
O	hear
O	a
O	tale
O	of
O	war
O	or
O	knightly
O	prowess
O	.
O	He
O	grew
O	up
O	loving
O	all
O	noble
O	things
O	,
O	gentle
O	of
O	speech
O	and
O	bearing
O	,
O	but
O	quick
O	to
O	anger
O	at
O	evil
O	or
O	mean
O	actions
O	,
O	merciful
O	of
O	weak
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	full
O	of
O	pity
O	and
O	tenderness
O	.
O	Yet
O	was
O	he
O	also
O	very
O	strong
O	of
O	body
O	,
O	fleet
O	of
O	foot
O	,
O	quick
O	of
O	eye
O	and
O	hand
O	.
O	Daily
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	divert
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	dark
O	forest
O	that
O	climbed
O	the
O	high
O	mountains
O	beside
O	his
O	home
O	,
O	or
O	he
O	roamed
O	the
O	wide
O	rolling
O	moors
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	practised
O	much
O	with
O	the
O	throwing
O	of
O	stones
O	and
O	sticks
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	with
O	a
O	stick
O	he
O	could
O	hit
O	a
O	small
O	mark
O	at
O	a
O	great
O	distance
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	sharp
O	stone
O	he
O	could
O	cut
O	down
O	a
O	sapling
O	at
O	one
O	blow
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	flock
O	of
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	goats
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	and
O	near
O	them
O	stood
O	two
O	hinds
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	wondered
O	greatly
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	two
O	deer
O	which
O	had
O	no
O	horns
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	goats
O	had
O	two
O	each
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	thought
O	they
O	had
O	long
O	run
O	wild
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	lost
O	their
O	horns
O	in
O	that
O	way
O	.
O	He
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	please
O	his
O	mother
O	if
O	he
O	caught
O	them
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	not
O	escape
O	again
O	.
O	And
O	by
O	his
O	great
O	activity
O	and
O	swiftness
O	he
O	ran
O	the
O	two
O	deer
O	down
O	till
O	they
O	were
O	spent
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	took
O	them
O	and
O	shut
O	them
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	goat-house
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	Going
O	home
O	,
O	he
O	told
O	his
O	mother
O	and
O	her
O	servants
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	see
O	,
O	and
O	marvelled
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	catch
O	such
O	fleet
O	creatures
O	as
O	the
O	wild
O	red
O	deer
O	.
O	Once
O	he
O	overheard
O	his
O	mother
O	say
O	that
O	she
O	yearned
O	for
O	fresh
O	venison
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	the
O	hunter
O	who
O	was
O	attached
O	to
O	her
O	house
O	was
O	lying
O	wounded
O	by
O	a
O	wild
O	boar
O	.
O	Always
O	Perceval
O	had
O	wondered
O	what
O	the
O	little
O	dark
O	man
O	did
O	whom
O	they
O	called
O	the
O	hunter
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	always
O	so
O	secret
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	Perceval
O	could
O	never
O	see
O	where
O	he
O	went
O	or
O	when
O	he
O	returned
O	from
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	hut
O	where
O	Tod
O	the
O	hunter
O	lay
O	sick
O	,
O	and
O	charged
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	love
O	and
O	worship
O	he
O	bore
O	to
O	the
O	countess
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	tell
O	him
O	how
O	he
O	could
O	obtain
O	fresh
O	venison
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	dwarf
O	told
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	Perceval
O	took
O	a
O	few
O	sticks
O	of
O	stout
O	wood
O	,
O	with
O	points
O	hardened
O	by
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	as
O	Tod
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	seeing
O	a
O	deer
O	he
O	hurled
O	a
O	stick
O	at
O	it
O	and
O	slew
O	it
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	he
O	brought
O	it
O	home
O	.
O	The
O	countess
O	was
O	greatly
O	wroth
O	that
O	Tod
O	had
O	taught
O	him
O	how
O	to
O	slay
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	said
O	that
O	never
O	more
O	should
O	the
O	dwarf
O	serve
O	her
O	.
O	And
O	Tod
O	wept
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	well
O	again
O	the
O	countess
O	would
O	not
O	suffer
O	him
O	to
O	stay
O	,
O	but
O	said
O	he
O	should
O	leave
O	the
O	hall
O	and
O	never
O	come
O	there
O	again
O	.
O	She
O	commanded
O	Perceval
O	never
O	to
O	slay
O	any
O	more
O	living
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	lad
O	promised
O	.
O	But
O	hard
O	was
O	it
O	to
O	keep
O	his
O	word
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	wild
O	things
O	passing
O	through
O	the
O	brakes
O	.
O	Once
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	strayed
O	deep
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	wide
O	glade
O	or
O	laund
O	,
O	with
O	two
O	green
O	hillocks
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	thereof
O	.
O	And
O	feeding
O	upon
O	the
O	grass
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	buck
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	had
O	a
O	silver
O	ring
O	round
O	its
O	neck
O	.
O	Perceval
O	wondered
O	at
O	this
O	beast
O	being
O	thus
O	adorned
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	it
O	to
O	stroke
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	buck
O	was
O	fierce
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	gored
O	him
O	with
O	its
O	horns
O	,
O	but
O	Perceval
O	seized
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	great
O	struggle
O	he
O	threw
O	the
O	animal
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	it
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	wrath
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	slain
O	it
O	with
O	a
O	sharp
O	stick
O	.
O	With
O	that
O	a
O	swarm
O	of
O	little
O	angry
O	trolls
O	poured
O	from
O	the
O	hollow
O	hillocks
O	with
O	great
O	cries
O	,
O	and
O	seizing
O	Perceval
O	would
O	have
O	hurt
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	suddenly
O	Tod
O	ran
O	among
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	commanded
O	them
O	to
O	release
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	the
O	end
O	Tod
O	,
O	who
O	came
O	himself
O	of
O	the
O	troll
O	folk
O	,
O	made
O	the
O	little
O	people
O	pass
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	peace
O	and
O	friendship
O	with
O	Perceval
O	,
O	and
O	ever
O	after
O	that
O	the
O	boy
O	went
O	with
O	the
O	trolls
O	,
O	and
O	sported
O	with
O	them
O	in
O	wrestling
O	,
O	running
O	and
O	other
O	games
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	learned
O	many
O	things
O	of
O	great
O	wisdom
O	from
O	them
O	concerning
O	the
O	secrets

O	young
O	lord
O	with
O	reverence
O	.

O	But
O	the
O	lad
O	knew
O	not

O	meant

O	was
O	very
O	content
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	trolls
O	for
O	his
O	friends
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	Perceval
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	far
O	up
O	the
O	mountain
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	looked
O	over
O	the
O	blue
O	distance
O	far
O	below
O	across
O	the
O	moor
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	man
O	riding
O	on
O	a
O	wide
O	road
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	noticed
O	before
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	man
O	rode
O	very
O	fast
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	the
O	sun
O	seemed
O	to
O	flash
O	from
O	him
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	was
O	clothed
O	in
O	glass
O	.
O	Perceval
O	wondered
O	what
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	across
O	the
O	moor
O	to
O	the
O	road
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	road
O	he
O	found
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	broad
O	,
O	and
O	banked
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	straight
O	as
O	the
O	flight
O	of
O	a
O	wild
O	duck
O	right
O	across
O	the
O	moor
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	swerved
O	by
O	the
O	hills
O	or
O	pools
O	,
O	but
O	went
O	over
O	everything
O	in
O	its
O	way
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	he
O	stood
O	marvelling
O	what
O	mighty
O	men
O	had
O	builded
O	it
O	,
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	strange
O	rattling
O	sound
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	turning
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	three
O	men
O	on
O	horseback
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sun
O	shone
O	from

O	Perceval
O	,

O	pulled

O	Many
O	other
O	questions

O	and
O	the
O	accoutrements

O	their
O	uses
O	.
O	And
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	said

O	two
O	hours

O	Perceval

O	swiftly
O	back
O	to

O	'
O	With
O	a
O	great
O	shriek
O	his

O	swooned
O	away
O	,

O	the
O	women
O	turned

O	from
O	the

O	Much
O	grieved
O	was
O	Perceval
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	hurt
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	,
O	taking
O	his
O	store
O	of
O	pointed
O	sticks
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	off
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	and
O	strayed
O	there
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	,
O	torn
O	between
O	his
O	love
O	for
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	strange
O	restlessness
O	which
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	three
O	warriors
O	had
O	caused
O	in
O	him
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	wandered
O	,
O	troubled
O	,
O	his
O	quick
O	ear
O	caught
O	the
O	clang
O	of
O	metal
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	.
O	And
O	swiftly
O	he
O	ran
O	towards
O	the
O	sound
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	a
O	clearing
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	two
O	knights
O	on
O	horseback
O	doing
O	mighty
O	battle
O	.
O	One
O	bore
O	a
O	red
O	shield
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	a
O	green
O	one
O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	eagerly
O	at
O	this
O	strange
O	sight
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	blood
O	sang
O	in
O	his
O	veins
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	green
O	knight
O	was
O	of
O	slighter
O	frame
O	than
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	weakening
O	before
O	the
O	strokes
O	of
O	the
O	red
O	knight
O	.
O	Full
O	of
O	anger
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	,
O	Perceval
O	launched
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	hard-wood
O	javelins
O	at
O	the
O	red
O	knight
O	.
O	With
O	such
O	force
O	did
O	it
O	go
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	true
O	was
O	the
O	aim
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	pierced
O	the
O	coif
O	of
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	entered
O	between
O	the
O	neck
O	and
O	the
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	red
O	knight
O	swayed
O	and
O	then
O	clattered
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	dead
O	.
O	The
O	green
O	knight
O	came
O	and
O	thanked
O	Perceval
O	for
O	thus
O	saving
O	his
O	life
O	.
O	'
O	Are
O	knights
O	then
O	so

O	,
O	and
O	I
O	sorrow

O	,
O	not
O	thinking
O	what
O	I
O	did
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	full
O	evil
O	knight
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	'
O	and
O	deserved
O	death
O	richly
O	for
O	his
O	many
O	villainies
O	and
O	oppressions
O	of
O	weak
O	orphans
O	and
O	friendless
O	widows
O	.
O	'
O	The
O	knight
O	took
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	knight
O	to
O	be
O	buried
O	in
O	a
O	chapel
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	Perceval
O	he
O	could
O	have
O	the
O	horse
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	lad
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	it
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	longed
O	greatly
O	to
O	possess
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	green
O	knight
O	took
O	it
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	Perceval
O	went
O	home
O	,
O	sad
O	,
O	yet
O	wild
O	with
O	wonder
O	at
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	his
O	mother
O	well
O	again
O	,
O	but
O	very
O	sorrowful
O	.
O	And
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	giving
O	her
O	pain
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	tell
O	her
O	of
O	the
O	knight
O	he
O	had
O	slain
O	.
O	She
O	called
O	him

O	told
O	Arthur

O	marvelled
O	who
O	the

O	could
O	be
O	,

O	many
O	sought

O	found
O	.
O	Greater
O	still
O	was
O	their
O	marvelling
O	when
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	weeks
O	passed
O	,
O	knights
O	came
O	and

O	had
O	overcome
O	them
O	in
O	knightly
O	combat
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	given
O	them
O	their

O	they
O	went
O	to
O	King

O	yielded
O	themselves
O	up
O	to

O	The
O	king
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	court
O	reproved
O	Kay
O	for
O	his
O	churlish
O	manner
O	,

O	having
O	driven
O	so
O	splendid
O	a
O	youth
O	from
O	the
O	court
O	.
O	And
O	Perceval
O	rode
O	ever
O	forward
O	.
O	He
O	came
O	one
O	day
O	towards
O	the
O	gloaming
O	to
O	a
O	lonely
O	wood
O	in
O	the
O	fenlands
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	wind
O	shivered
O	like
O	the
O	breath
O	of
O	ghosts
O	among
O	the
O	leaves
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	track
O	or
O	trace
O	of
O	man
O	or
O	beast
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	birds
O	piped
O	.
O	And
O	soon
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	wind
O	shrilled
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rain
O	began
O	to
O	beat
O	down
O	like
O	thin
O	grey
O	spears
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	vast
O	castle
O	rise
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	towards
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	way
O	so
O	overgrown
O	with
O	weeds
O	that
O	hardly
O	could
O	he
O	push
O	his
O	horse
O	between
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	threshold
O	the
O	grass
O	grew
O	thick
O	and
O	high
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	door
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	opened
O	for
O	a
O	hundred
O	winters
O	.
O	He
O	battered
O	on
O	the
O	door
O	with
O	the
O	butt
O	of
O	his
O	lance
O	;
O	and
O	long
O	he
O	waited
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	cold
O	rain
O	drove
O	and
O	the
O	wind
O	snarled
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	a
O	voice
O	came
O	from
O	above
O	the
O	gateway
O	,
O	and
O	glancing
O	up
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	damsel
O	looking
O	through
O	an
O	opening
O	in
O	the
O	battlements
O	.
O	'
O	Choose
O	thou
O	,
O	chieftain
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	she
O	,
O	'
O	whether
O	I
O	shall
O	open
O	unto
O	thee
O	without
O	announcing
O	thee
O	,
O	or
O	whether
O	I
O	shall
O	tell
O	her
O	that
O	rules
O	here
O	that

O	wishest
O	to

O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Say
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	here
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Perceval
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	if
O	she
O	will
O	not
O	house
O	me
O	for
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	then
O	will
O	I
O	go
O	forward
O	.
O	'
O	Soon
O	the
O	maiden
O	came
O	back
O	and
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	horse
O	she
O	led
O	into
O	the
O	stable
O	,
O	where
O	she
O	fed
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	Perceval
O	she
O	brought
O	into
O	the
O	hall
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	light
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	girl
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	another
O	of
O	so
O	fair
O	an
O	aspect
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	an
O	old
O	garment
O	of
O	satin
O	upon
O	her
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	once
O	been
O	rich
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	now
O	frayed
O	and
O	tattered
O	;
O	and
O	fairer
O	was
O	her
O	skin
O	than
O	the
O	bloom
O	of
O	the
O	rose
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	hair
O	and
O	eyebrows
O	were
O	like
O	the
O	sloe
O	for
O	blackness
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	her
O	cheeks
O	was
O	the
O	redness
O	of
O	poppies
O	.
O	Her
O	eyes
O	were
O	like
O	deep
O	pools
O	in
O	a
O	dark
O	wood
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	,
O	though
O	she
O	was
O	very
O	beautiful
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	great
O	arrogance
O	in
O	her
O	look
O	and
O	cruelty
O	in
O	her
O	lips
O	.
O	When
O	Perceval
O	went
O	towards
O	the
O	dais
O	of
O	the
O	hall
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	tall
O	and
O	stately
O	lady
O	in
O	the
O	high
O	seat
O	,
O	old
O	of
O	years
O	and
O	reverend
O	of
O	aspect
O	,
O	though
O	sorrowful
O	.
O	Several
O	handmaids
O	sat
O	beside
O	her
O	,
O	sad
O	of
O	face
O	and
O	tattered
O	of
O	dress
O	.
O	All
O	welcomed
O	him
O	right
O	kindly
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	sat
O	at
O	meat
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	the
O	best
O	cheer
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	.

O	it
O	was
O	time
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	rest
O	,
O	the

O	,
O	he
O	said
O	:
O	'
O	Lady
O	,
O	I
O	think
O	these
O	evil
O	witches
O	will
O	not
O	hurt
O	thee
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	little
O	help
O	that
O	I
O	may
O	give
O	to
O	thee
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	stay
O	this
O	night
O	with
O	thee
O	.
O	'
O	After
O	he
O	had
O	prayed
O	at
O	the
O	altar
O	in
O	the
O	ruined
O	chapel
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	they
O	led
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	bed
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	slept
O	.
O	And
O	just
O	before
O	the
O	break
O	of
O	day
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	dreadful
O	outcry
O	,
O	with
O	groans
O	and
O	shrieks
O	and
O	terrible
O	screams
O	and
O	moanings
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	all
O	the
O	evil
O	that
O	could
O	be
O	done
O	was
O	being
O	done
O	upon
O	poor
O	wretches
O	out
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	.
O	Perceval
O	leapt
O	from
O	his
O	couch
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	naught
O	upon
O	him
O	but
O	his
O	vest
O	and
O	doublet
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	in
O	hand
O	to
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	saw
O	two
O	poor
O	serving-men
O	struggling
O	with
O	a
O	hag
O	dressed
O	all
O	in
O	armour
O	.
O	Behind
O	her
O	came
O	eight
O	others
O	.
O	And
O	their
O	eyes
O	,
O	from
O	between
O	the
O	bars
O	of
O	their
O	helms
O	,
O	shone
O	with
O	a
O	horrible
O	red
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	each
O	point
O	of
O	their
O	armour
O	sparks
O	flashed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	swords
O	in
O	their
O	grisly
O	hands
O	gleamed
O	with
O	a
O	blue
O	flame
O	,
O	so
O	fierce
O	and
O	so
O	terrible
O	that
O	it
O	scorched
O	the
O	eyes
O	to
O	look
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	Perceval
O	dashed
O	upon
O	the
O	foremost
O	witch
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	beat
O	her
O	with
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	stroke
O	that
O	she
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	helm
O	on
O	her
O	head
O	was
O	flattened
O	to
O	the
O	likeness
O	of
O	a
O	dish
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	fell
O	,
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	her
O	eyes
O	and
O	her
O	sword
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	armour
O	all
O	seemed
O	to
O	wither
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	nothing
O	but
O	an
O	old
O	ugly
O	woman
O	in
O	rags
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	cried
O	out
O	:
O	'
O	Thy

O	'
O	How

O	,

O	,

O	'
O	'
O	By

O	the
O	foreknowledge
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	suffer
O	harm
O	from

O	.
O	And
O	I

O	.
O	But
O	it
O	is
O	fated
O	,
O	'
O	she
O	went
O	on
O	,
O	'
O	that

O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	Perceval
O	remembered

O	heard
O	the
O	trolls
O	--
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	Underworld
O	--
O	say
O	,

O	their
O	meaning
O	.
O	'
O	The
O	stainless
O	knight
O	,

O	they
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	shall
O	gain
O	from

O	.
O	'
O	'
O	If
O	it
O	be
O	thus
O	fated
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	with
O	thee
O	.
O	But
O	first
O	thou
O	shalt
O	swear
O	that

O	'
O	It

O	'
O	Then
O	Perceval
O	took
O	leave
O	of
O	the
O	lady
O	of
O	the
O	Castle
O	of
O	Weeds
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	Angharad
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	lady
O	thanked
O	him
O	with
O	tears
O	for
O	saving
O	their
O	lives
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	girl
O	was
O	cold
O	and
O	scornful
O	and
O	said
O	no
O	word
O	of
O	thanks
O	.
O	Then
O	Perceval
O	went
O	with
O	the
O	witches
O	to
O	their
O	Castle
O	of
O	Glaive
O	.
O	He
O	stayed
O	with
O	them
O	for
O	a
O	year
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	,
O	learning
O	such
O	knowledge
O	of
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	gaining
O	such
O	strength
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	marvel
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	feats
O	which
O	he
O	performed
O	.
O	And
O	while
O	he
O	lived
O	with
O	them
O	they
O	strove
O	to
O	bend
O	him
O	to
O	their
O	wills
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	saw
O	how
O	great
O	a
O	knight
O	he
O	would
O	become
O	in
O	prowess
O	and
O	in
O	knightly
O	deeds
O	.
O	They
O	tempted
O	him
O	every
O	hour
O	and
O	every
O	day
O	,
O	telling
O	him
O	what
O	earthly
O	power
O	,
O	what
O	riches
O	and
O	what
O	great
O	dominions
O	would
O	be
O	his
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	but
O	swear
O	fealty
O	to
O	the
O	chief
O	witch
O	,
O	Domna
O	,
O	and
O	fight
O	for
O	her
O	against
O	King
O	Arthur
O	and
O	his
O	proud
O	knights
O	.
O	Perceval
O	prayed
O	daily
O	for
O	strength
O	to
O	withstand
O	the
O	poison
O	of
O	their
O	tongues
O	,
O	and
O	evermore
O	he
O	held
O	himself
O	humble
O	and
O	gentle
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	much
O	of
O	his
O	widowed
O	mother
O	in
O	her
O	lonely
O	home
O	in
O	the
O	northern
O	wastes
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	promise
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	her
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	Angharad
O	,
O	how
O	beautiful
O	she
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	sad
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	so
O	cold
O	a
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	so
O	cruel
O	in
O	her
O	words
O	.
O	Anon
O	the
O	witch
O	Domna
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	now
O	learned
O	all
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	teach
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	must
O	go
O	and
O	prove
O	himself
O	against
O	greater
O	powers
O	than
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	yet
O	known
O	.
O	If
O	he
O	prevailed
O	not
O	in
O	that
O	battle
O	,
O	the
O	ladies
O	of
O	the
O	Castle
O	of
O	Weeds
O	would
O	become
O	the
O	prey
O	of
O	the
O	witches
O	,
O	and
O	greater
O	power
O	of
O	evil
O	would
O	they
O	have
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	than
O	ever
O	before
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	horse
O	and
O	a
O	full
O	suit
O	of
O	black
O	armour
O	.
O	So
O	Perceval
O	took
O	the
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	armed
O	himself
O	and
O	rode
O	forth
O	.
O	And
O	anon
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	hermit
O	'
O	s
O	cell
O	beside
O	a
O	ruined
O	chapel
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	alighted
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	chapel
O	,
O	and
O	stripped
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	laid
O	all
O	his
O	armour
O	,
O	his
O	lance
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	before
O	the
O	high
O	altar
O	.
O	Prayerfully
O	he
O	gave
O	his
O	arms
O	to
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	God
O	,
O	and
O	devoted
O	them
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	to
O	do
O	only
O	knightly
O	and
O	pure
O	deeds
O	,
O	to
O	rescue
O	the
O	oppressed
O	and
O	the
O	weak
O	,
O	to
O	put
O	down
O	the
O	proud
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	cherish
O	the
O	humble
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	he
O	ended
O	praying
O	,
O	the
O	armour
O	stirred
O	of
O	itself
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	black
O	before
O	,
O	now
O	did
O	the
O	darkness
O	fade
O	from
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	all
O	became
O	a
O	pure
O	white
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	marvelled
O	,
O	a
O	faint
O	light
O	glowed
O	over
O	hauberk
O	,
O	helm
O	,
O	shield
O	,
O	sword
O	and
O	lance
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	exceeding
O	sweet
O	savour
O	wafted
O	through
O	the
O	place
O	.
O	And
O	ghostily
O	,
O	as
O	in
O	a
O	silver
O	mist
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	above
O	the
O	altar
O	the
O	likeness
O	of
O	a
O	spear
O	,
O	and
O	beside
O	it
O	a
O	dish
O	or
O	salver
O	.
O	And
O	at
O	the
O	wondrous
O	sight
O	his
O	breath
O	stayed
O	on
O	his
O	lips
O	.
O	Then
O	slowly
O	the
O	vision
O	faded
O	from
O	his
O	sight
O	.
O	He
O	arrayed
O	himself
O	in
O	his
O	armour
O	that
O	was
O	now
O	of
O	a
O	dazzling
O	white
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	rode
O	forth
O	and
O	thought
O	to
O	go
O	towards
O	Camelot
O	,
O	where
O	was
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	felt
O	that
O	some
O	power
O	drew
O	him
O	aside
O	through
O	the
O	desolate
O	ways
O	of
O	a
O	hoar
O	forest
O	,
O	where
O	all
O	the
O	trees
O	were
O	ancient
O	and
O	big
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	bearded
O	with
O	long
O	moss
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	vast
O	castle
O	reared
O	upon
O	a
O	rock
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	He
O	rode
O	up
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	marvelled
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	so
O	quiet
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	beat
O	upon
O	the
O	door
O	with
O	the
O	butt
O	of
O	his
O	lance
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	door
O	opened
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	entered
O	into
O	the
O	wide
O	dark
O	hall
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	pallets
O	under
O	the
O	wall
O	he
O	saw
O	men
O	lying
O	as
O	if
O	dead
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	the
O	high
O	seat
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	hall
O	sat
O	a
O	king
O	,
O	old
O	and
O	white
O	,
O	but
O	richly
O	clothed
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	seemed
O	dead
O	like
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	.
O	All
O	were
O	clad
O	in
O	garments
O	of
O	an
O	ancient
O	kind
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	lived
O	and
O	died
O	a
O	thousand
O	years
O	agone
O	,
O	yet
O	had
O	not
O	rotted
O	into
O	dust
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	about
O	the
O	wide
O	heap
O	of
O	ashes
O	where
O	the
O	fire
O	had
O	burned
O	,
O	the
O	hounds
O	still
O	lay
O	as
O	if
O	asleep
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	posts
O	the
O	hawks
O	sat
O	stiff
O	upon
O	their
O	perches
O	.
O	Much
O	did
O	Perceval
O	marvel
O	at
O	this
O	strange
O	sight
O	,
O	but
O	most
O	of
O	all
O	he
O	marvelled
O	to
O	see
O	where
O	a
O	shaft
O	of
O	light
O	from
O	a
O	narrow
O	window
O	gleamed
O	across
O	the
O	hall
O	full
O	upon
O	a
O	shield
O	hung
O	on
O	the
O	fire-pillar
O	beside
O	the
O	high
O	seat
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	king
O	sat
O	like
O	one
O	dead
O	.
O	Perceval
O	caused
O	his
O	horse
O	to
O	pick
O	its
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	approached
O	the
O	shield
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	of
O	shining
O	white
O	,
O	but
O	whiter
O	than
O	the
O	whiteness
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	thereof
O	was
O	a
O	heart
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	sat
O	looking
O	thereat
O	,
O	he
O	marvelled
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	the
O	heart
O	seemed
O	to
O	stir
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	alive
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	throb
O	and
O	move
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	beat
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	whiteness
O	of
O	the
O	shield
O	began
O	to
O	dazzle
O	like
O	to
O	a
O	light
O	that
O	mortal
O	eyes
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	.
O	He
O	lifted
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	shield
O	by
O	its
O	strap
O	from
O	the
O	peg
O	on
O	which
O	it
O	hung
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	so
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	sigh
O	arose
O	from
O	within
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	at
O	one
O	time
O	many
O	sleepers
O	awoke
O	.
O	And
O	looking
O	round
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	how
O	all
O	the
O	men
O	that
O	had
O	seemed
O	dead
O	were
O	now
O	on
O	their
O	knees
O	,
O	with
O	bent
O	heads
O	and
O	folded
O	hands
O	as
O	if
O	in
O	prayer
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	in
O	the
O	high
O	seat
O	stirred
O	and
O	sat
O	upright
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	at

O	with
O	a
O	most
O	sweet
O	smile
O	.

O	'

O	,

O	said
O	Perceval
O	,
O	'
O	what
O	means
O	this
O	?
O	'
O	'
O	I
O	am
O	Marius
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	and
O	I
O	was
O	that
O	Roman
O	soldier
O	who
O	took
O	pity
O	of
O	the
O	gentle
O	Saviour
O	dying
O	in
O	His
O	agony
O	upon
O	the
O	rood
O	.
O	And
O	I
O	helped
O	to
O	take
O	Him
O	from
O	the
O	cross
O	.
O	For
O	my
O	pity
O	did
O	God
O	,
O	whom
O	till
O	then
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	known
O	,
O	deal
O	with
O	me
O	in
O	marvellous
O	wise
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	shield
O	was
O	mine
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	holy
O	hermit
O	in
O	a
O	desert
O	of
O	Syria
O	did
O	bless
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	prophesy
O	concerning
O	it
O	and
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	this
O	land
O	of
O	Britain
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	evil
O	men
O	,
O	warring
O	fiercely
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	in
O	heathen
O	darkness
O	.
O	I
O	preached
O	the
O	Word
O	of
O	Christ
O	,
O	I
O	and
O	my
O	fellows
O	that
O	came
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	until
O	the
O	heathens
O	rose
O	up
O	and
O	would
O	slay
O	me
O	.
O	And
O	by
O	that
O	time
O	I
O	was
O	wearied
O	and
O	very
O	old
O	,
O	and
O	wished
O	to
O	die
O	.
O	Yet
O	I
O	sorrowed
O	,
O	wondering
O	whether
O	God
O	would
O	do
O	naught
O	to
O	rescue
O	these
O	people
O	from
O	this
O	slavery
O	to
O	the
O	old
O	evil
O	law
O	.
O	Then
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	God
O	came
O	to
O	me
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	marvel
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	caused
O	this
O	castle
O	to
O	be
O	builded
O	in
O	this
O	ancient
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	put
O	my
O	shield
O	upon
O	the
O	post
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	me
O	and
O	my
O	dear
O	friends
O	sleep
O	.
O	'
O	For
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	'
O	thou
O	hast
O	earned
O	thy
O	sleep
O	,
O	and
O	others
O	shall
O	carry

O	to
O	these

O	to
O	God
O	wholly
O	.

O	have
O	the

O	Go
O	then
O	,
O	thou
O	good
O	knight
O	,

O	went
O	on
O	King
O	Marius
O	,

O	against
O	that
O	thing
O	of
O	evil
O	whom

O	spoke

O	my
O	shield
O	encompass
O	thee
O	and
O	ever
O	guard

O	.
O	'
O	Perceval
O	took
O	the
O	shield
O	and
O	left
O	his
O	own
O	.
O	Turning
O	,
O	he
O	rode
O	back
O	between
O	lines
O	of
O	silent
O	forms
O	bent
O	in
O	prayer
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	forth
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	some
O	little
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	from
O	the
O	castle
O	the
O	singing
O	of
O	a
O	joyful
O	hymn
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	looking
O	back
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	castle
O	had
O	vanished
O	.
O	But
O	still
O	above
O	him
O	and
O	about
O	him
O	was
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	singing
O	,
O	of
O	a
O	sweetness
O	indescribable
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	sang
O	who
O	had
O	gained
O	all
O	that
O	they
O	desired
O	.
O	Then
O	Perceval
O	rode
O	forward
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	night
O	;
O	but
O	never
O	could
O	he
O	get
O	sight
O	of
O	castle
O	or
O	knight
O	'
O	s
O	hold
O	or
O	hermit
O	'
O	s
O	cell
O	where
O	he
O	could
O	be
O	houselled
O	for
O	the
O	night
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	abode
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	that
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	prayed
O	he
O	slept
O	beside
O	his
O	good
O	horse
O	until
O	it
O	was
O	day
O	.
O	Just
O	before
O	the
O	dawn
O	he
O	awoke
O	to
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	rushing
O	wind
O	all
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	Yet
O	marvel

O	to
O	see

O	the
O	trees
O	in

O	wood
O	did
O	not
O	wave
O	their
O	branches
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	were
O	still
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	was
O	aware
O	of
O	a
O	sweet
O	savour
O	which
O	surrounded
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	anon
O	a
O	gentle
O	voice
O	spoke
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	darkness
O	.
O	'
O	Fair

O	Knight

O	,
O	'

O	Much
O	moved
O	at
O	these
O	words
O	,
O	Perceval
O	knelt
O	and
O	prayed
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	dawn
O	filtered
O	through
O	the
O	trees
O	,

O	his
O	horse
O	and

O	his
O	long
O	journey
O	to
O	the
O	north
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	seventh
O	day
O	he
O	crossed

O	.
O	And
O	he
O	passed
O	through

O	an
O	evil
O	and
O	a
O	pagan
O	knight
O	,
O	the
O	knight
O	of
O	the
O	Dragon
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	willed
O	that

O	how
O	the
O	boss
O	of
O	the
O	Black
O	Knight
O	'
O	s
O	shield
O	was
O	the
O	head

O	a

O	,

O	its
O	mouth
O	came
O	a
O	blinding
O	flash
O	as
O	of
O	lightning
O	and
O	beat
O	at
O	Perceval
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	held
O	up
O	his
O	shield
O	of
O	the
O	Throbbing
O	Heart
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	angry
O	shrieks
O	the
O	Black
O	Knight
O	perceived
O	that

O	lightning
O	could
O	not
O	touch
O	the
O	shield
O	.
O	Then
O	from
O	his
O	side
O	the
O	evil
O	knight
O	tore
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	flamed
O	red
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	heated
O	in
O	a
O	fierce
O	furnace
O	,
O	and
O	thrusting
O	forward

O	the
O	White
O	Knight
O	warded
O	off
O	the
O	blows
O	with
O	his
O	shield
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	flaming
O	sword
O	had
O	no
O	power
O	to
O	harm
O	.
O	Then
O	did
O	the
O	Black
O	Knight
O	marvel
O	greatly
O	,
O	for
O	never
O	had
O	a
O	knight
O	,
O	however
O	skilled
O	,
O	withstood
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	either
O	the
O	lightning
O	of
O	the
O	dragon

O	had
O	burnt
O	him
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	stroke
O	of
O	his
O	flaming
O	sword
O	had
O	slain
O	him
O	swiftly
O	.
O	And
O	by
O	this
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	this
O	knight

O	,
O	with
O	a
O	scornful
O	laugh
O	.
O	'

O	more
O	than
O	ever

O	taught

O	.
O	Now
O	prepare
O	ye
O	to
O	die
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	Perceval
O	knew
O	that
O	this
O	indeed
O	was
O	the
O	fight
O	which
O	Domna
O	had
O	foretold
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	failed
O	in
O	this
O	,
O	ruin
O	and
O	sorrow
O	would
O	be
O	the
O	lot
O	of
O	many
O	.
O	And
O	Perceval
O	began
O	to
O	thrust
O	and
O	strike
O	full
O	valorously
O	and
O	skilfully
O	,
O	but
O	naught
O	seemed
O	to
O	avail
O	him
O	.
O	Thus
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	they
O	went
O	about
O	,
O	thrusting
O	and
O	striking
O	.
O	Always
O	the
O	strength
O	of
O	the
O	Black
O	Knight
O	seemed
O	as
O	unwearied
O	as
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	demon
O	,
O	while
O	Perceval
O	felt
O	his
O	arm
O	weaken
O	,
O	as
O	much
O	from
O	the
O	great
O	strokes
O	he
O	gave
O	,
O	as
O	from
O	the
O	burning
O	fires
O	that
O	darted
O	at
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	dragon
O	shield
O	.
O	Then
O	Perceval
O	cried
O	in
O	prayer
O	for
O	aid
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	that
O	if
O	Christ
O	would
O	have
O	this
O	land
O	saved
O	for
O	His
O	glory
O	,
O	strength
O	should
O	be
O	given
O	him
O	to
O	slay
O	this
O	fiendish
O	oppressor
O	.
O	Forthwith
O	strength
O	seemed
O	to
O	nerve
O	his
O	arm
O	mightily
O	,
O	and
O	lifting
O	his
O	sword
O	he
O	struck
O	at
O	the
O	shield
O	of
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	vehement
O	was
O	the
O	blow
O	that
O	he
O	cut
O	down
O	the
O	shield
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	dragon
O	.
O	Feeling
O	the
O	wound
O	,
O	the
O	dragon
O	gave
O	forth
O	a
O	great
O	flame
O	,
O	and
O	Perceval
O	wondered
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	now
O	his
O	own
O	sword
O	burned
O	as
O	if
O	on
O	fire
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	Black
O	Knight
O	marvelled
O	at
O	this
O	stroke
O	,
O	Perceval
O	struck
O	at
O	him
O	more
O	fiercely
O	and
O	beat
O	in
O	the
O	other
O	'
O	s
O	helm
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	fiend
O	knight
O	bent
O	and
O	swayed
O	in
O	his
O	saddle
O	.
O	But
O	recovering
O	,
O	he
O	became
O	so
O	wroth
O	that
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	fiery
O	sword
O	,
O	he
O	heaved
O	a
O	mighty
O	blow
O	at
O	Perceval
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	through
O	his
O	hauberk
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	shoulder
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	burned
O	to
O	the
O	bone
O	.
O	Ere
O	the
O	other
O	could
O	withdraw
O	himself
O	,
O	Perceval
O	thrust
O	his
O	sword
O	to
O	the
O	hilt
O	into
O	the
O	loathsome
O	throat
O	of
O	the
O	dragon
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	the
O	dragon
O	gave
O	so
O	terrible
O	a
O	cry
O	that
O	the
O	earth
O	seemed
O	to
O	shake
O	with
O	the
O	horror
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	its
O	wrath
O	and
O	pain
O	the
O	dragon
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	turned
O	upon
O	the
O	Black
O	Knight
O	its
O	master
O	,
O	and
O	vomited
O	forth
O	fire
O	so
O	fiercely
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	scorched
O	and
O	burned
O	him
O	utterly
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	fell
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	dead
O	.
O	Perceval
O	,
O	dizzy
O	and
O	weak
O	from
O	the
O	battle
O	,
O	alighted
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	towards
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	slay
O	the
O	dragon
O	.
O	But
O	suddenly
O	he
O	swooned
O	and
O	fell
O	and
O	his
O	consciousness
O	went
O	from
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	Perceval
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	senses
O	again
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	upon
O	a
O	pallet
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rough
O	walls
O	of
O	a
O	room
O	were
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	while
O	above
O	him
O	was
O	the
O	window
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	seemed
O	,
O	of
O	an
O	abbey
O	or
O	convent
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	weak
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	lift
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	Some
O	one
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	recognised
O	Tod
O	the
O	troll
O	.
O	'
O	Ah
O	,
O	good
O	Tod
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	he
O	faintly
O	.
O	'
O	Where
O	am
O	I
O	?
O	'
O	'
O	Now
O	God

O	said
O	Tod
O	,

O	smiled
O	joyfully
O	.
O	'
O	For

O	the
O	witches
O	,

O	For
O	when

O	that
O	should
