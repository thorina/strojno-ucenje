O	It
O	happened
O	that
O	on
O	a
O	day
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	wandering
O	from
O	his
O	court
O	,
O	had
O	fought
O	and
O	vanquished
O	a
O	valiant
O	knight
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	himself
O	had
O	been
O	sore
O	wounded
O	.
O	Merlin
O	,
O	coming
O	to
O	his
O	aid
O	,
O	had
O	taken
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	hermit
O	'
O	s
O	cave
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	with
O	many
O	marvellous
O	salves
O	had
O	searched
O	his
O	wounds
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	in
O	three
O	days
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	whole
O	again
O	.
O	Riding
O	forth
O	together
O	,
O	Merlin
O	led
O	the
O	king
O	deeper
O	and
O	deeper
O	into
O	a
O	wild
O	and
O	desolate
O	country
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	pathways
O	.
O	Arthur
O	looked
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	over
O	the
O	waste
O	,
O	but
O	saw
O	no
O	sign
O	of
O	man
O	or
O	beast
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	bird
O	flitted
O	or
O	piped
O	.
O	Great
O	gaunt
O	stones
O	stood
O	upright
O	on
O	the
O	hillsides
O	,
O	solitary
O	or
O	in
O	long
O	lines
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	marched
O	,
O	or
O	else
O	they
O	leaned
O	together
O	as
O	if
O	conspiring;
O	while
O	great
O	heaps
O	or
O	cairns
O	of
O	stone
O	rose
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	from
O	the
O	lichen-covered
O	and
O	rocky
O	soil
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	grass
O	grew
O	weakly
O	in
O	small
O	crevices
O	.
O	The
O	mists
O	now
O	rose
O	and
O	drifted
O	before
O	them
O	as
O	they
O	rode
O	,
O	the
O	light
O	was
O	low
O	and
O	sallow
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wind
O	began
O	to
O	whisper
O	shrilly
O	among
O	the
O	great
O	stones
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	crannies
O	of
O	the
O	cairns
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	crossed
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	white
O	,
O	old
O	,
O	and
O	wrinkled
O	face
O	of
O	Merlin;
O	but
O	the
O	wizard
O	seemed
O	sunk
O	in
O	thought
O	.
O	Then
O	Arthur
O	bethought
O	him
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	case
O	some
O	fiend-shape
O	or
O	wizard-knight
O	should
O	assail
O	him
O	in
O	that
O	desolate
O	waste
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	defend
O	himself
O	,
O	inasmuch
O	as
O	his
O	sword--the
O	sword
O	he
O	had
O	drawn
O	from
O	the
O	stone--had
O	snapped
O	when
O	he
O	fought
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	other
O	weapon
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	Merlin
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	this
O	is
O	a
O	place
O	of
O	ancient
O	death
O	and
O	terror
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	aught
O	should
O	assail
O	us
O	of
O	evil
O	,
O	I
O	have
O	no
O	sword
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	For
O	that
O	reason
O	I
O	bring
O	thee
O	here
O	,
O	'
O	replied
O	Merlin
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	utter
O	another
O	word
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	mists
O	,
O	which
O	writhed
O	and
O	twisted
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	fell
O	shapes
O	that
O	would
O	tear
O	down
O	the
O	passing
O	riders
O	,
O	Arthur
O	became
O	aware
O	that
O	their
O	way
O	was
O	leading
O	downwards
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	the
O	smell
O	of
O	water
O	rose
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	heard
O	the
O	beat
O	and
O	suck
O	of
O	waves
O	upon
O	a
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	the
O	mists
O	cleared
O	as
O	if
O	at
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	before
O	him
O	Arthur
O	saw
O	a
O	lonely
O	lake
O	or
O	sea
O	,
O	hedged
O	round
O	with
O	salt-rimed
O	reeds
O	and
O	sedges
O	,
O	and
O	stretching
O	out
O	its
O	waters
O	,
O	dull
O	and
O	leaden-hued
O	,
O	to
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	distance
O	that
O	his
O	eye
O	could
O	see
O	no
O	end
O	.
O	'
O	What
O	is
O	this
O	place
O	?
O	'
O	he
O	asked
O	of
O	Merlin
O	.
O	'
O	It
O	is
O	the
O	Lake
O	of
O	the
O	Endless
O	Waters
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	wizard
O	.
O	'
O	Why
O	bring
O	ye
O	me
O	to
O	this
O	desolate
O	lake
O	in
O	the
O	wilderness
O	?
O	'
O	'
O	You
O	shall
O	visit
O	it
O	once
O	more--ere
O	you
O	die
O	!
O	'
O	replied
O	Merlin
O	.
O	'
O	But
O	look
O	you
O	there
O	in
O	the
O	midmost
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	'
O	Looking
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	wizard
O	pointed
O	,
O	Arthur
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	hand
O	,
O	clothed
O	in
O	white
O	samite
O	,
O	stretched
O	above
O	the
O	lapsing
O	waves
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	its
O	grasp
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	two-handed
O	sword
O	in
O	a
O	rich
O	scabbard
O	.
O	With
O	that
O	they
O	saw
O	a
O	barge
O	riding
O	over
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	came
O	without
O	oars
O	or
O	any
O	sail
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	prow
O	sat
O	a
O	woman
O	,
O	tall
O	and
O	comely
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	face
O	lovely
O	but
O	sad
O	.
O	A
O	frontlet
O	of
O	gold
O	and
O	pearls
O	was
O	bound
O	about
O	her
O	rich
O	red
O	hair
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	robes
O	,
O	of
O	green
O	samite
O	,
O	fell
O	about
O	her
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	reeds
O	of
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	'
O	What
O	lady
O	is
O	that
O	?
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	'
O	It
O	is
O	the
O	Lady
O	of
O	the
O	Lake
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Merlin
O	,
O	'
O	and
O	she
O	comes
O	to
O	you
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	speak
O	fair
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	ask
O	that
O	she
O	will
O	give
O	you
O	that
O	sword
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	the
O	barge
O	rasped
O	among
O	the
O	reeds
O	where
O	Arthur
O	sat
O	on
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	lady
O	said
O	:
O	'
O	Greeting
O	to
O	you
O	,
O	O
O	king
O	!
O	'
O	'
O	Greeting
O	,
O	fair
O	damsel
O	!
O	'
O	replied
O	Arthur
O	.
O	'
O	What
O	sword
O	is
O	that
O	which
O	the
O	arm
O	holdeth
O	above
O	the
O	water
O	?
O	I
O	would
O	it

O	mine
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	have
O	none
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Sir
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	lady
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	sword
O	is
O	mine;
O	but
O	if
O	ye
O	will
O	give
O	me
O	a
O	gift
O	when
O	I
O	ask
O	it
O	of
O	you
O	,
O	and
O	will
O	swear
O	an
O	oath
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	back
O	the
O	sword
O	when
O	ye
O	shall
O	be
O	dying
O	,
O	then
O	shall
O	ye
O	have
O	it
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	By
O	my
O	faith
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	ye
O	the
O	gift
O	when
O	ye
O	shall
O	desire
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	am
O	dying
O	I
O	will
O	truly
O	give
O	back
O	the
O	sword
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Then
O	do
O	you
O	step
O	into
O	this
O	barge
O	and
O	row
O	yourself
O	unto
O	the
O	hand
O	and
O	take
O	from
O	it
O	the
O	sword
O	.
O	And
O	know
O	ye
O	that
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	that
O	sword
O	is
O	Excalibur
O	,
O	and
O	while
O	you
O	keep
O	the
O	scabbard
O	by
O	your
O	side
O	,
O	ye
O	shall
O	lose
O	no
O	blood
O	,
O	be
O	ye
O	never
O	so
O	sore
O	wounded
O	.
O	'
O	So
O	King
O	Arthur
O	and
O	Merlin
O	alighted
O	,
O	tied
O	their
O	horses
O	to
O	two
O	stunted
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	barge
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	turned
O	to
O	look
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	tall
O	green
O	lady
O	had
O	stood
O	but
O	a
O	moment
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	marvelled
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	vanished
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	sword
O	which
O	the
O	hand
O	held
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	water
O	where
O	the
O	hand
O	rose
O	forth
O	was
O	all
O	troubled
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	naught
O	.
O	He
O	took
O	the
O	sword
O	by
O	the
O	handle
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	great
O	fingers
O	of
O	the
O	hand
O	opened
O	and
O	then
O	sank
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	came
O	afterwards
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	to
O	Camelot
O	,
O	and
O	reached
O	it
O	after
O	many
O	days
O	.
O	When
O	King
O	Arthur
O	entered
O	his
O	hall
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	been
O	welcomed
O	by
O	his
O	knights
O	,
O	the
O	seneschal
O	brought
O	forth
O	a
O	messenger
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	come
O	from
O	King
O	Rience
O	of
O	North
O	Wales
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	man
O	with
O	insolent
O	looks
O	uttered
O	this
O	message
O	:
O	'
O	My

O	burn
O	and
O	slay
O	and
O	lay

O	will

O	beard

O	'
O	'
O	Now
O	this
O	is

O	shameful
O	message
O	that
O	any

O	villainous
O	words

O	'
O	Then
O	he
O	laughed
O	a
O	little
O	grimly
O	.
O	'
O	Thou
O	seest

O	So
O	take
O	this

O	So
O	the
O	messenger
O	departed
O	,

O	Arthur
O	set

O	'
O	Next
O	morning
O	early
O	they
O	rode
O	away
O	through
O	the
O	gay
O	woods
O	,
O	drenched
O	with
O	dew
O	,
O	which
O	sparkled
O	where
O	the
O	sunlight
O	lit
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	Long
O	and
O	lonely
O	was
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	until
O	towards
O	the
O	evening
O	they
O	met
O	with
O	a
O	poor
O	old
O	man
O	on
O	foot
O	,
O	ragged
O	,
O	lame
O	,
O	and
O	dirty
O	,
O	and
O	bearing
O	a
O	great
O	burden
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	narrow
O	ride
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	but
O	room
O	for
O	one
O	person
O	to
O	pass
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	the
O	brothers
O	were
O	making
O	great
O	speed
O	,
O	since
O	they
O	doubted
O	they
O	had
O	lost
O	their

O	would

O	down
O	the
O	poor
O	man
O	,

O	many
O	knights
O	would
O	do
O	.
O	But
O	Balin
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	cheery
O	call
O	,
O	said
O	:

O	in

O	So
O	it

O	aid
O	,
O	that
O	Balin
O	and

O	came
O	upon

O	that
O	night
O	with

O	a
O	small
O	band
O	of

O	and
O	with
O	a
O	sudden
O	attack
O	out
O	of

O	wood
O	the
O	two

O	some
O	way
O	towards

O	with
O	the

O	bound
O	,
O	between
O	them
O	,
O	Merlin
O	vanished
O	from
O	beside
O	them
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	rode
O	to
O	Camelot
O	at
O	the
O	dawning
O	,
O	and
O	delivered
O	Rience
O	to
O	the
O	porter
O	at
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	led
O	to
O	King
O	Arthur
O	when
O	he
O	should
O	sit
O	in
O	hall
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	rode
O	away
O	.

O	,
O	by
O	the
O	capture
O	of
O	King
O	Rience
O	,
O	his
O	host
O	was
O	put
O	to
O	naught
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	paid
O	his
O	homage
O	to
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	and
O	swore
O	on
O	the
O	sacred
O	relics
O	of
O	the
O	Abbey
O	of
O	Camelot
O	to
O	be

O	should
O	live
O	.
O	At
O	that
O	time
O	Balin
O	could
O	not

O	felon
O	knight
O	,
O	Sir
O	Garlon
O	,

O	wrought
O	evil
O	by

O	he
O	and

O	to
O	King
O	Arthur
O	and
O	became
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	most
O	valiant
O	knights
O	.
O	It
O	happened
O	on
O	a
O	day
O	that

O	journeyed
O	with

O	knights
O	from

O	the
O	heat
O	of
O	the
O	day

O	he
O	rested

O	heard

O	noise
O	of

O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	flap
O	of
O	his
O	tent
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	strange
O	knight
O	passing
O	,
O	making
O	great
O	complaint
O	and
O	sorrowing
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	him

O	a
O	damsel
O	.

O	.

O	I
O	smote
O	the
O	evil
O	man
O	from
O	his

O	twice
O	,

O	was
O	the

O	people
O	.
O	Their

O	When

O	found
O	a
O	great
O	throng

O	ladies
O	,
O	and
O	because
O	Sir
O	Gwydion

O	.
O	But
O	Balin
O	was
O	well
O	received
O	and
O	brought
O	to
O	a
O	chamber
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	unarmed
O	him
O	.

O	squires
O	brought
O	him
O	a

O	robe
O	to

O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	weaponless
O	,
O	Balin
O	dashed
O	through
O	the
O	circle
O	of
O	guests
O	towards
O	a
O	door
O	,
O	looking
O	for
O	a
O	weapon
O	while
O	he
O	ran
O	,
O	but
O	none
O	could
O	he
O	find
O	.
O	King
O	Pellam
O	followed
O	closely
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	they
O	ran
O	from
O	chamber
O	to
O	chamber
O	,
O	and
O	up
O	the
O	narrow
O	stair
O	within
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	Balin
O	found
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	near
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	tower
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	that
O	now
O	he
O	must
O	surely
O	be
O	slain
O	,
O	for
O	no
O	weapon
O	had
O	he
O	found
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	he
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	bursting
O	it
O	open
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	large
O	room
O	marvellously
O	bright
O	and
O	richly
O	dight
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	bed
O	arrayed
O	with
O	cloth
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	old
O	and
O	white
O	and
O	reverend
O	lying
O	therein
O	.
O	And
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	bed
O	was
O	a
O	table
O	of
O	virgin
O	gold
O	on
O	pillars
O	of
O	pure
O	silver
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	it
O	stood
O	a
O	spear
O	,
O	strangely
O	wrought
O	.
O	Balin
O	seized
O	the
O	spear
O	,
O	and
O	turned
O	upon
O	King
O	Pellam
O	,
O	who
O	stood
O	still
O	in
O	the
O	doorway
O	with
O	terror
O	in
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	marking
O	naught
O	of
O	this
O	,
O	Balin
O	thrust
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	spear
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	it
O	in
O	his
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	King
O	Pellam
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	cry
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	With
O	that
O	stroke
O	the
O	walls
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	drove
O	together
O	and
O	fell
O	in
O	ruins
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	cry
O	of
O	lamentation
O	beat
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	from
O	far
O	and
O	near
O	,
O	and
O	Balin
O	lay
O	under
O	the
O	stones
O	as
O	one
O	dead
O	.
O	After
O	three
O	days
O	Merlin
O	came
O	and
O	drew
O	out
O	Balin
O	from
O	the
O	ruins
O	,
O	and
O	nourished
O	and
O	healed
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	also
O	recovered
O	his
O	sword
O	and
O	got
O	him
O	a
O	good
O	horse
O	,
O	for

O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	bade
O	him
O	ride
O	out
O	of
O	that
O	country
O	without
O	delay
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	never

O	cared

O	so
O	took
O	the
O	shield
O	with
O	a
O	device
O	upon
O	it
O	that
O	was
O	not
O	his
O	own
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	horse
O	were
O	led
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	barge
O	,

O	so
O	they
O	were
O	poled
O	across
O	the
O	wide
O	stream
O	to

O	island
O	.
O	When
O	Balin
O	had

O	the
O	trappings
O	of

O	horse
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	colour
O	.
O	They
O	couched
O	their
O	lances
O	and
O	came
O	marvellously
O	fast
O	together

O	of

O	the
O	shock
O	of

O	to
O	vanquish

O	red
O	knight
O	could
O	not
O	lift
O	his
O	shield
O	for
O	weakness
O	,

O	went
O	back
O	a
O	little

O	down
O	.

O	sank
O	to

O	,
O	to

O	None
O	knew
O	who
O	he
O	was
O	but
O	Arthur
O	,
O	who
O	kept
O	the
O	matter
O	secret
O	.
O	Many
O	had
O	smiled
O	at
O	the
O	huge
O	limbs
O	of
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	until
O	his
O	great
O	strength
O	had
O	caused
O	them
O	to
O	respect
O	him;

O	being
O	but
O	a
O	young

O	manners
O	for
O	which
O	in
O	later
O	time
O	he
O	was

O	Christendom
O	.
O	So
O	that

O	smiled
O	sourly
O	upon

O	of
O	his

O	full

O	in

O	beyond
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	spent
O	their
O	days
O	in
O	sword-play
O	and
O	all
O	knightly
O	exercises
O	.
O	Lancelot
O	was
O	the
O	stronger
O	and
O	the
O	better
O	fighter;
O	and
O	though
O	Gawaine

O	still
O	sought

O	the
O	young

O	his
O	helmet
O	under
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	slept
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	thus
O	lay
O	,
O	there
O	rode
O	by
O	him
O	on
O	white
O	mules
O	four
O	ladies
O	of
O	great
O	estate
O	,
O	with
O	four
O	knights
O	about
O	them
O	,
O	who
O	bore
O	a
O	canopy
O	of
O	green
O	silk
O	on
O	four
O	spears
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	high
O	sun
O	should
O	not
O	touch
O	the
O	faces
O	of
O	the
O	ladies
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	rode
O	by
O	,
O	they
O	heard
O	a
O	war-horse
O	grimly
O	neigh
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	aside
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	aware
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	all
O	armed
O	,
O	and
O	asleep
O	under
O	the
O	apple-tree
O	.
O	The
O	ladies
O	came
O	nigh
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	them
O	there
O	was
O	Queen
O	Morgan
O	le
O	Fay
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	wife
O	of
O	King
O	Lot
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	evil
O	witch;
O	the
O	Queen
O	of
O	Northgales
O	,
O	a
O	haughty
O	lady;
O	the
O	Lady
O	of
O	the
O	Out-Isles;
O	and
O	the
O	Lady
O	of
O	the
O	Marshes
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	Lady
O	of
O	the
O	Marshes
O	saw
O	the
O	knight
O	she
O	cried
O	:
O	'
O	Now
O	this
O	is
O	as
O	good
O	hap
O	as
O	ever
O	could
O	be
O	,
O	for
O	this
O	is
O	he
O	that
O	slew
O	my
O	brother
O	,
O	Sir
O	Caradoc
O	of
O	the
O	Dolorous
O	Tower;
O	and
O	for
O	revenge
O	of
O	that
O	,
O	I
O	would
O	have
O	this
O	knight
O	taken
O	to
O	my
O	tower
O	and
O	torture
O	him
O	before
O	I
O	slay
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	That
O	is
O	well
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Morgan
O	le
O	Fay
O	,
O	'
O	for
O	he
O	bids
O	fair
O	to
O	be
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	strong
O	knights
O	of
O	Arthur
O	,
O	whom
O	I
O	hate
O	.
O	This
O	man
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	du
O	Lake
O	,
O	is
O	the
O	favourite
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	ladies
O	at
O	that
O	court
O	,
O	who
O	hate
O	me
O	.
O	So
O	will
O	I
O	lay
O	an
O	enchantment
O	on
O	him
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	shall
O	sleep
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	the
O	evil
O	queen
O	laid
O	her
O	hands
O	over
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	strange
O	words
O	that
O	none
O	could
O	understand
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	was
O	laid
O	across
O	the
O	crupper
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	'
O	horses
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	wake
O	.
O	When
O	in
O	the
O	twilight
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	awoke
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	on
O	a
O	straw
O	pallet
O	in
O	a
O	strange
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	leaped
O	up
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	a
O	narrow
O	arrow-slit
O	in
O	the
O	wall
O	and
O	looked
O	out
O	.
O	Before
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	great
O	distance
O	was
O	a
O	black
O	watery
O	land
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	sun
O	sinking
O	far
O	away
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	edge
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	pools
O	of
O	the
O	marsh
O	were
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	of
O	blood
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	beat
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	called
O	,
O	but
O	none
O	responded
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	wrath
O	he
O	could
O	have
O	dashed
O	the
O	door
O	down
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	too
O	stout
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	weapon;
O	for
O	his
O	arms
O	had
O	been
O	taken
O	from
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	dark
O	,
O	suddenly
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	that
O	the
O	room
O	smelled
O	foul
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	carried
O	into
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	quaking
O	marsh
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	sunk
O	deep
O	in
O	the
O	slime
O	and
O	weeds
O	of
O	a
O	pool
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	arrow-slit
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	many
O	strange
O	lights
O	come
O	,
O	dim
O	and
O	blue
O	like
O	the
O	wild
O	lights
O	that
O	dance
O	and
O	flit
O	over
O	the
O	lonely
O	marshes
O	by
O	night;
O	but
O	that
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	marvel
O	was
O	that
O	these
O	lights
O	were
O	two
O	together
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	evil
O	things
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	breath
O	that
O	was
O	cold
O	and
O	dank
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	seemed
O	to
O	peer
O	into
O	his
O	face
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	naught
O	of
O	their
O	bodies
O	.
O	The
O	hair
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	rose
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	skin
O	went
O	cold
O	.
O	They
O	pressed
O	all
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	defend
O	himself
O	he
O	struck
O	at
O	the
O	eyes
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	blows
O	beat
O	only
O	the
O	air
O	.
O	Then
O	suddenly
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	felt
O	sharp
O	pains
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	small
O	keen
O	knives
O	had
O	been
O	thrust
O	into
O	his
O	flesh
O	at
O	many
O	places
O	.
O	The
O	stabs
O	increased
O	in
O	number
O	and
O	in
O	pain
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	beat
O	about
O	himself
O	and
O	ran
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	in
O	the
O	narrow
O	chamber
O	to
O	escape
O	the
O	evil
O	eyes
O	and
O	the
O	stabs
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	all
O	night
O	in
O	much
O	misery
O	he
O	suffered
O	.
O	When
O	for
O	sheer
O	weariness
O	he
O	lay
O	down
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	close
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	the
O	evil
O	things
O	would
O	not
O	let
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	ever
O	they
O	tore
O	at
O	him
O	and
O	stabbed
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	in
O	anguish
O	of
O	mind
O	more
O	than
O	he
O	could
O	bear
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	all
O	his
O	thought
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	think
O	of
O	any
O	way
O	to
O	fight
O	against
O	the
O	evil
O	powers
O	which
O	followed
O	and
O	tortured
O	him
O	wherever
O	he
O	ran
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	dawn
O	they
O	fled
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	opened
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	damsel
O	appeared
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	her
O	hands
O	was
O	a
O	manchet
O	of
O	sour
O	bread
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	beaker
O	of
O	water
O	from
O	the
O	ditch
O	of
O	the
O	moat
O	.
O	The
O	damsel
O	was
O	evilly
O	clad
O	in
O	rags
O	,
O	and
O	seemed
O	like
O	a
O	scullion-maid
O	.
O	'
O	These

O	good
O	cheer
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	,
O	she
O	led
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	thick
O	forest
O	with
O	many
O	hills
O	therein
O	,
O	and
O	anon
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	fair
O	ford
O	,
O	and
O	over
O	the
O	ford
O	there
O	grew
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	it
O	there
O	hung
O	many
O	good
O	shields
O	,
O	each
O	with
O	the
O	device
O	of
O	some
O	knight
O	thereon
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	was
O	astounded
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	shields
O	of
O	many
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	'

O	knights
O	hung
O	there
O	.
O	And
O	on
O	a
O	bole
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	bason
O	of
O	copper
O	.
O	'
O	Now
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	damsel
O	,
O	'
O	I

O	that

O	,
O	as
O	men

O	.
O	They

O	in

O	,

O	came
O	like

O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	lightly
O	avoiding
O	their
O	beasts
O	,
O	they
O	came
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	with
O	great
O	fierceness
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	fared
O	for
O	two

O	part
O	till
O	the
O	one
O	of
O	us
O	be
O	dead
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	they
O	ran
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	like
O	two
O	wild
O	boars
O	,
O	lashing
O	and
O	dashing
O	with
O	their
O	swords
O	and
O	shields
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	sometimes
O	in
O	their
O	fury
O	they
O	slipped
O	together
O	on
O	the
O	grass
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	wetted
O	with
O	blood
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	striking
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	last
O	Sir
O	Turquine
O	waxed
O	faint
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	avoid
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	'
O	s
O	blows
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	shield
O	sank
O	low
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	arm
O	was
O	very
O	weary
O	.
O	Seeing
O	this
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	leaped
O	upon
O	him
O	fiercely
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	banner
O	of
O	his
O	helmet
O	,
O	and
O	thrust
O	him
O	on
O	his
O	knees
O	,
O	and
O	slew
O	him
O	at
O	a
O	stroke
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	rested
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	Sir
O	Turquine
O	and
O	released
O	all
O	his
O	prisoners
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	rejoiced
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	damsel
O	find
O	her
O	father
O	alive
O	.
O	He
O	caused
O	the
O	old
O	knight
O	to
O	have
O	his
O	lands
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	the
O	others
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	betake
O	themselves
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	to
O	be
O	cheered
O	and
O	comforted
O	,
O	while
O	their
O	possessions
O	,
O	which
O	Sir
O	Turquine
O	had
O	robbed
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	should
O	be
O	given
O	back
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	Then
O	fared
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	further
O	afield
O	,
O	glad
O	exceedingly
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	escaped
O	the
O	foul
O	plots
O	of
O	the
O	four
O	witch
O	queens
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	vanquished
O	the
O	evil
O	Sir
O	Turquine
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	rode
O	a
O	great
O	while
O	in
O	a
O	deep
O	and
O	dark
O	forest
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	followed
O	the
O	winding
O	ways
O	,
O	suddenly
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	black
O	hound
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	nose
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	as
O	if
O	seeking
O	a
O	scent
O	.
O	He
O	followed
O	the
O	beast
O	,
O	and
O	ever
O	she
O	looked
O	behind
O	her
O	.
O	Soon
O	she
O	left
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	and
O	picked
O	her
O	way
O	through
O	a
O	great
O	marsh
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	followed
O	,
O	until
O	in
O	the
O	wide
O	distance
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	little
O	hill
O	with
O	trees
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	a
O	ruined
O	manor
O	.
O	The
O	hound
O	went
O	towards
O	the
O	ruin
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	followed
O	.
O	The
O	wall
O	was
O	broken
O	down
O	in
O	many
O	places
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	path
O	all
O	overgrown
O	and
O	weedy
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	courtyard
O	before
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	fishponds
O	choked
O	with
O	weeds
O	and
O	the
O	horseblock
O	green
O	with
O	moss
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	doorway
O	grew
O	charnel
O	and
O	hellebore
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	spiked
O	hemlock
O	waved
O	and
O	spilt
O	its
O	seed
O	in
O	the
O	wind
O	.
O	The
O	windows
O	hung
O	by
O	their
O	hinges
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	green
O	moss
O	crept
O	down
O	the
O	wide
O	wet
O	cracks
O	in
O	the
O	walls
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	dog
O	ran
O	over
O	the
O	drawbridge
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	gat
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	tethered
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	post
O	beside
O	the
O	horseblock
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	went
O	across
O	the
O	bridge
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	full
O	sodden
O	and
O	worm-eaten
O	,
O	and
O	bent
O	beneath
O	his
O	weight
O	.
O	Coming
O	into
O	a
O	great
O	hall
O	,
O	foul
O	with
O	many
O	rotting
O	leaves
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	table
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	thereof
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	knight
O	that

O	seemly
O	man
O	,
O	and

O	lay
O	as

O	were
O	dead
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	black
O	hound
O	licked
O	his
O	wound
O	.
O	And
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	lovely
O	lady
O	,
O	who
O	started
O	up
O	,
O	weeping
O	and
O	wringing
O	her
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	said
O	:

O	'
O	Right
O	so
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	departed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	near
O	its
O	setting
O	.
O	For
O	some
O	hours
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	fared
O	across
O	the
O	marsh
O	,
O	until
O	it
O	was
O	deep
O	night
O	,
O	save
O	for
O	the
O	stars;
O	then
O	he
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	broad
O	road
O	,
O	grass-grown
O	and
O	banked
O	high
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	night
O	wind
O	piped
O	in
O	the
O	long
O	grass
O	.
O	This
O	he
O	knew
O	was
O	a
O	road
O	which
O	the
O	great
O	Roman
O	necromancers
O	had
O	wrought
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	missed
O	his
O	way
O	,
O	for
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	other
O	path
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	stood
O	marvelling
O	,
O	the
O	figure
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	tall
O	and
O	gaunt
O	and
O	but
O	half
O	clad
O	,
O	came
O	down
O	the
O	broad
O	road
O	towards
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	in
O	a
O	hollow
O	voice
O	:
O	'
O	For
O	the
O	love

O	a
O	poor

O	who
O	is

O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	pitied
O	the
O	sunken
O	eyes

O	poor

O	gave
O	him
O	alms
O	.
O	'
O	God
O	give
O	thee
O	comfort
O	,
O	poor
O	soul
O	,

O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	'
O	and
O	get
O	thee
O	a
O	roof
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	night

O	chill
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	God
O	bless
O	thee
O	,
O	sir
O	knight
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	man
O	,
O	in
O	awful
O	tones
O	,
O	'
O	for
O	courtesy
O	and
O	pity
O	such
O	as
O	thine
O	are
O	rare
O	.
O	Whither
O	goest
O	thou
O	this
O	night
O	?
O	'
O	'
O	I
O	seek
O	the
O	Chapel
O	Perilous
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	.
O	At
O	which
O	the
O	shape
O	threw
O	back
O	its
O	head
O	and
O	cried
O	out
O	as
O	if
O	with
O	great
O	sorrow
O	.
O	'
O	God
O	fend
O	thee
O	,
O	sir
O	knight
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	and
O	bring
O	thee
O	safe
O	alive
O	.
O	What
O	thou
O	gettest
O	there
O	,
O	keep
O	thou
O	in
O	thy
O	hands
O	until
O	the
O	dawn
O	,
O	or
O	thy
O	soul
O	shall
O	suffer
O	death
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	he
O	vanished
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	knew
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	phantom
O	.
O	Then
O	as
O	he
O	crossed
O	himself
O	,
O	he
O	looked
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	through
O	some
O	thin
O	and
O	withered
O	trees
O	a
O	little
O	way
O	off
O	upon
O	a
O	slope
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	shimmer
O	of
O	light
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	a
O	chapel
O	was
O	lit
O	up
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	towards
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	high
O	wall
O	that
O	was
O	broken
O	down
O	in
O	many
O	places
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	old
O	grey
O	chapel
O	beyond
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	windows
O	were
O	shimmering
O	with
O	a
O	ghostly
O	light
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	came
O	through
O	the
O	trees
O	he
O	saw
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	dead
O	,
O	with
O	neither
O	leaf
O	nor
O	twig
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	their
O	roots
O	were
O	crooked
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	ground
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	throw
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	limbs
O	were
O	stretched
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	strained
O	to
O	clutch
O	him
O	.
O	Coming
O	to
O	the
O	gate
O	in
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	his
O	horse
O	trembled
O	and
O	plunged
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	go
O	no
O	further;
O	whereat
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	alighted
O	,
O	and
O	tied
O	it
O	to
O	a
O	thorn-tree
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	through
O	the
O	gate
O	.
O	By
O	the
O	ghostly
O	light
O	that
O	came
O	from
O	the
O	windows
O	of
O	the
O	ruined
O	chapel
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	under
O	the
O	eaves
O	were
O	hung
O	fair
O	shields
O	,
O	with
O	rich
O	devices
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	were
O	turned
O	upside
O	down
O	.
O	Many
O	of
O	them
O	were
O	those
O	of
O	knights
O	he
O	had
O	known
O	or
O	heard
O	of
O	,
O	long
O	since
O	dead
O	or
O	lost
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	a
O	few
O	steps
O	on
O	the
O	grass-grown
O	pathway
O	towards
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	of
O	a
O	sudden
O	he
O	saw
O	,
O	coming
O	from
O	the
O	church
O	,
O	thirty
O	tall
O	knights
O	,
O	each
O	a
O	foot
O	higher
O	than
O	he
O	,
O	each
O	in
O	black
O	armour
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	with
O	sword
O	uplifted
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	rushed
O	towards
O	him
O	.
O	Their
O	feet
O	and
O	their
O	armour
O	made
O	no
O	sound
O	as
O	they
O	pressed
O	forwards
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	thin
O	blue
O	flame
O	licked
O	about
O	each
O	naked
O	sword
O	.
O	They
O	came
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	prayer
O	to
O	God
O	,
O	dressed
O	his
O	shield
O	and
O	sword
O	and
O	stood
O	firm
O	,
O	though
O	his
O	flesh
O	quaked
O	and
O	his
O	tongue
O	clave
O	to
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	his
O	mouth
O	.
O	They
O	mowed
O	and
O	gnashed
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	heaved
O	their
O	swords
O	about
O	him;
O	then
O	suddenly
O	their
O	vizors
O	went
O	up
O	and
O	he
O	looked
O	into
O	their
O	faces
O	.
O	And
O	at
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	sore
O	adread
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	they
O	were
O	dead
O	men
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	overcome
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	in
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	:
O	'
O	In
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	God
O	,
O	avaunt
O	ye
O	!
O	'
O	He
O	made
O	a
O	step
O	forward
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	scattered
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	followed
O	closely
O	behind
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	chapel
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	saw
O	no
O	light
O	but
O	a
O	dim
O	lamp
O	burning
O	upon
O	the
O	altar
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	an
O	old
O	,
O	old
O	chapel
O	,
O	with
O	dust
O	upon
O	its
O	floor
O	like
O	a
O	thick
O	carpet
O	,
O	the
O	walls
O	and
O	windows
O	were
O	holed
O	and
O	broken
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	timber
O	of
O	the
O	seats
O	was
O	rotten
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	high
O	altar
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	before
O	it
O	a
O	trestle
O	,
O	and
O	upon
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	dead
O	man
O	,
O	all
O	covered
O	with
O	a
O	cloth
O	of
O	silk
O	.
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	stooped
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	cut
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	that
O	cloth
O	away
O	.
O	With
O	that
O	his
O	blood
O	seemed
O	turned
O	to
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	feet
O	seemed
O	eager
O	to
O	run
O	towards
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	for
O	with
O	a
O	mighty
O	roar
O	the
O	earth
O	shook
O	beneath
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	walls
O	of
O	the
O	chapel
O	rocked
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	looked
O	for
O	the
O	sword
O	which
O	he
O	must
O	take
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	it
O	under
O	the
O	trestle
O	,
O	and
O	picked
O	it
O	up
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	chapel
O	.
O	The
O	ghosts
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	pressed
O	about
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	walked
O	,
O	and
O	strove
O	to
O	tear
O	the
O	sword
O	from
O	his
O	grasp
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	suffer
O	them
O	to
O	take
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	gate
O	they
O	could
O	no
O	further
O	go
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	left
O	him
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	gate

O	came

O	up
O	to

O	fair
O	damsel

O	to
O	him
O	:

O	may
O	take
O	them
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	my
O	mistress
O	,
O	the
O	lady

O	,

O	at

O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	remembered
O	the

O	phantom
O	beggar
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	reply
O	:

O	The
O	damsel
O	would
O	have
O	torn
O	the
O	sword
O	and
O	the
O	cloth
O	full
O	hastily
O	from
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	aware

O	hindered
O	her
O	,
