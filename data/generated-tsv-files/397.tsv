O	along
O	,
O	their
O	oars
O	were
O	only
O	just
O	sufficient
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	boat
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	the
O	right
O	way
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	they
O	made
O	but
O	slow
O	progress
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	they
O	rose
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	swell
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	still
O	very
O	long
O	and
O	high
O	in
O	consequence
O	of
O	the
O	gale
O	,
O	they
O	could
O	only
O	just
O	discover
O	the
O	distant
O	land
O	,
O	Muckish
O	,
O	a
O	remarkable
O	flat-topped
O	mountain
O	on
O	the
O	northwest
O	coast
O	of
O	Ireland
O	,
O	not
O	very
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	promontory
O	called
O	the
O	Bloody
O	Foreland
O	.
O	There
O	appeared
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	little
O	discipline
O	among
O	this
O	forlorn
O	crew
O	,
O	even
O	when
O	the
O	breeze
O	was
O	in
O	their
O	favour
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	wind
O	chopped
O	round
O	,
O	and
O	blew
O	off
O	shore
O	,
O	they
O	gave
O	themselves
O	up
O	to
O	despair
O	,
O	laid
O	in
O	their
O	oars
O	,
O	let
O	the
O	sail
O	flap
O	to
O	pieces
O	,
O	gobbled
O	up
O	all
O	their
O	provisions
O	,
O	and
O	drank
O	out
O	their
O	whole
O	stock
O	of
O	water
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	partially
O	stove
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	confusion
O	of
O	clearing
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	fill
O	with
O	water
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	all
O	admitted
O	afterwards
O	,
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	for
O	the
O	courage
O	and
O	patience
O	of
O	the
O	women
O	under
O	this
O	sharp
O	trial
O	,
O	they
O	must
O	have
O	gone
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	.
O	As
O	it
O	was
O	both
O	cold
O	and
O	rainy
O	,
O	the
O	poor
O	children
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	too
O	young
O	to
O	understand
O	the
O	nature
O	of
O	their
O	situation
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	inutility
O	of
O	complaining
O	,
O	incessantly
O	cried
O	out
O	for
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	begged
O	that
O	more
O	clothes
O	might
O	be
O	wrapped
O	round
O	them
O	.
O	Even
O	after
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	us
O	the
O	little
O	things
O	were
O	still
O	crying
O	,
O	``
O	Oh
O	!
O	do
O	give
O	us
O	some
O	water
O	``
O	--
O	words
O	which
O	long
O	sounded
O	in
O	our
O	ears
O	.
O	None
O	of
O	these
O	women
O	were
O	by
O	any
O	means
O	strong
O	--
O	on
O	the
O	contrary
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	delicate
O	;
O	yet
O	they
O	managed
O	to
O	rouse
O	the
O	men
O	to
O	a
O	sense
O	of
O	their
O	duty
O	by
O	a
O	mixture
O	of
O	reproaches
O	and
O	entreaties
O	,
O	combined
O	with
O	the
O	example
O	of
O	that
O	singular
O	fortitude
O	which
O	often
O	gives
O	more
O	than
O	masculine
O	vigour
O	to
O	female
O	minds
O	in
O	seasons
O	of
O	danger
O	.
O	How
O	long
O	this
O	might
O	have
O	lasted
O	I
O	can
O	not
O	say
O	;
O	but
O	probably
O	the
O	strength
O	of
O	the
O	men
O	,
O	however
O	stimulated
O	,
O	must
O	have
O	given
O	way
O	before
O	night
O	,
O	especially
O	as
O	the
O	wind
O	freshened
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boat
O	was
O	driving
O	further
O	to
O	sea
O	.
O	Had
O	it
O	not
O	been
O	for
O	the
O	accident
O	of
O	the
O	officer
O	of
O	the
O	forenoon
O	watch
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	_Endymion_
O	being
O	unaware
O	of
O	the
O	captain
O	'
O	s
O	intention
O	to
O	tack
O	before
O	dinner
O	,
O	these
O	poor
O	people
O	,
O	most
O	probably
O	,
O	would
O	all
O	have
O	perished
O	.
O	The
O	women
O	,
O	dripping
O	wet
O	,
O	and
O	scarcely
O	capable
O	of
O	moving
O	hand
O	or
O	foot
O	,
O	were
O	lifted
O	up
O	the
O	side
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	state
O	almost
O	of
O	stupor
O	;
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	confused
O	by
O	the
O	hurry
O	of
O	the
O	scene
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	fortitude
O	had
O	given
O	way
O	the
O	moment
O	all
O	high
O	motive
O	to
O	exertion
O	was
O	over
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	on
O	reaching
O	the
O	quarterdeck
O	,
O	slipped
O	through
O	our
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	falling
O	on
O	her
O	knees
O	,
O	wept
O	violently
O	as
O	she
O	returned
O	thanks
O	for
O	such
O	a
O	wonderful
O	deliverance
O	;
O	but
O	her
O	thoughts
O	were
O	bewildered
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	fancying
O	that
O	her
O	child
O	was
O	lost
O	,
O	she
O	struck
O	her
O	hands
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	leaping
O	again
O	on
O	her
O	feet
O	,
O	screamed
O	out
O	,
O	``
O	Oh
O	!
O	where
O	'
O	s
O	my
O	bairn
O	--
O	my
O	wee
O	bairn
O	?
O	``
O	At
O	this
O	instant
O	a
O	huge
O	quarter-master
O	,
O	whose
O	real
O	name
O	or
O	nickname
O	(
O	I
O	forget
O	which
O	)
O	was
O	Billy
O	Magnus
O	,
O	appeared
O	over
O	the
O	gangway
O	hammocks
O	,
O	holding
O	the
O	missing
O	urchin
O	in
O	his
O	immense
O	paw
O	,
O	where
O	it
O	squealed
O	and
O	twisted
O	itself
O	about
O	,
O	like
O	Gulliver
O	between
O	the
O	finger
O	and
O	thumb
O	of
O	the
O	Brobdingnag
O	farmer
O	.
O	The
O	mother
O	had
O	just
O	strength
O	enough
O	left
O	to
O	snatch
O	her
O	offspring
O	from
O	Billy
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	sank
O	down
O	flat
O	on
O	the
O	deck
O	,
O	completely
O	exhausted
O	.
O	By
O	means
O	of
O	a
O	fine
O	blazing
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	plenty
O	of
O	hot
O	tea
O	,
O	toast
O	,
O	and
O	eggs
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	easy
O	to
O	remedy
O	one
O	class
O	of
O	these
O	poor
O	people
O	'
O	s
O	wants
O	;
O	but
O	how
O	to
O	rig
O	them
O	out
O	in
O	dry
O	clothes
O	was
O	a
O	puzzle
O	,
O	till
O	the
O	captain
O	bethought
O	him
O	of
O	a
O	resource
O	which
O	answered
O	very
O	well
O	.
O	He
O	sent
O	to
O	several
O	of
O	the
O	officers
O	for
O	their
O	dressing-gowns
O	;
O	and
O	these
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	supplies
O	from
O	his
O	own
O	wardrobe
O	,
O	made
O	capital
O	gowns
O	and
O	petticoats
O	--
O	at
O	least
O	,
O	till
O	the
O	more
O	fitting
O	drapery
O	of
O	the
O	ladies
O	was
O	dried
O	.
O	The
O	children
O	were
O	tumbled
O	into
O	bed
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	compartment
O	,
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	fire
O	;
O	and
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	done
O	any
O	one
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	good
O	to
O	have
O	witnessed
O	the
O	style
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	provisions
O	vanished
O	from
O	the
O	board
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	women
O	wept
O	,
O	prayed
O	,
O	and
O	laughed
O	,
O	by
O	turns
O	.
O	The
O	rugged
O	seamen
O	,
O	when
O	taken
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	showed
O	none
O	of
O	these
O	symptoms
O	of
O	emotion
O	,
O	but
O	running
O	instinctively
O	to
O	the
O	scuttle-butt
O	,
O	asked
O	eagerly
O	for
O	a
O	drop
O	of
O	water
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	most
O	expeditious
O	method
O	of
O	feeding
O	and
O	dressing
O	them
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	distributed
O	among
O	the
O	different
O	messes
O	,
O	one
O	to
O	each
O	,
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	they
O	went
O	.
O	Thus
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	soon
O	provided
O	with
O	dry
O	clothing
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	as
O	much
O	to
O	eat
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	stow
O	away
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	doctor
O	,
O	when
O	consulted
O	,
O	said
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	fasted
O	so
O	long
O	as
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	dangerous
O	to
O	give
O	them
O	as
O	much
O	food
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	disposed
O	to
O	swallow
O	.
O	With
O	the
O	exception
O	of
O	the
O	ham
O	devoured
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	,
O	was
O	but
O	a
O	mouthful
O	apiece
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	tasted
O	nothing
O	for
O	more
O	than
O	thirty
O	hours
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	I
O	suppose
O	,
O	better
O	justice
O	was
O	never
O	done
O	to
O	his
O	Majesty
O	'
O	s
O	beef
O	,
O	pork
O	,
O	bread
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	good
O	things
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	our
O	fellows
O	insisted
O	on
O	stuffing
O	the
O	newcomers
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	fairly
O	cried
O	out
O	for
O	mercy
O	and
O	begged
O	to
O	be
O	allowed
O	a
O	little
O	sleep
O	.
O	Possibly
O	some
O	of
O	us
O	were
O	more
O	disposed
O	to
O	sympathise
O	with
O	the
O	distress
O	of
O	these
O	people
O	when
O	adrift
O	in
O	their
O	open
O	boat
O	on
O	the
O	wide
O	sea
O	,
O	from
O	having
O	ourselves
O	,
O	about
O	a
O	month
O	before
O	,
O	been
O	pretty
O	much
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	predicament
O	.
O	It
O	always
O	adds
O	,
O	as
O	any
O	one
O	knows
O	,
O	greatly
O	to
O	our
O	consideration
O	for
O	the
O	difficulties
O	and
O	dangers
O	of
O	others
O	,
O	to
O	have
O	recently
O	felt
O	some
O	touch
O	of
O	similar
O	distress
O	in
O	our
O	own
O	persons
O	.
O	This
O	maxim
O	,
O	though
O	it
O	is
O	familiar
O	enough
O	,
O	makes
O	so
O	little
O	impression
O	on
O	our
O	ordinary
O	thoughts
O	,
O	that
O	when
O	circumstances
O	occur
O	to
O	fix
O	our
O	attention
O	closely
O	upon
O	it
O	we
O	are
O	apt
O	to
O	arrive
O	as
O	suddenly
O	at
O	the
O	perception
O	of
O	its
O	truth
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	a
O	new
O	discovery
O	.
