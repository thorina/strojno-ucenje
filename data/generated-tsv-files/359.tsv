O	There
O	was
O	a
O	king
O	who
O	had
O	a
O	daughter
O	who
O	never
O	could
O	be
O	induced
O	to
O	laugh
O	;
O	she
O	was
O	always
O	sad
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	king
O	proclaimed
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	be
O	given
O	to
O	any
O	one
O	who
O	could
O	cause
O	her
O	to
O	laugh
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	also
O	a
O	shepherd
O	who
O	had
O	a
O	son
O	named
O	George
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Daddy
O	!
O	I
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	will
O	go
O	to
O	see
O	whether
O	I
O	can
O	make
O	her
O	laugh
O	.
O	I
O	want
O	nothing
O	from
O	you
O	but
O	the
O	goat
O	.
O	``
O	His
O	father
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Well
O	,
O	go
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	goat
O	was
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	nature
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	her
O	master
O	wished
O	,
O	she
O	detained
O	everybody
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	person
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	stay
O	by
O	her
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	goat
O	and
O	went
O	,
O	and
O	met
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	had
O	a
O	foot
O	on
O	his
O	shoulder
O	.
O	George
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Why
O	have
O	you
O	a
O	foot
O	on
O	your
O	shoulder
O	?
O	``
O	He
O	replied
O	:
O	``
O	If

O	it
O	off

O	``
O	``
O	Well

O	``
O	They
O	went
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	met
O	a

O	``
O	They
O	went
O	on
O	a

O	farther
O	,
O	and
O	met
O	another

O	,

O	``
O	George
O	replied
O	:
O	``
O	Well
O	,
O	come
O	,
O	too
O	!
O	``
O	Afterward
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	where
O	the
O	king
O	lived
O	,
O	and
O	bought
O	a
O	silken
O	riband
O	for
O	the
O	goat
O	.
O	They
O	came
O	to
O	an
O	inn
O	,
O	and
O	orders
O	had
O	already
O	been
O	given
O	there
O	beforehand
O	,
O	that

O	such

O	,
O	they

O	and
O	drink
O	--
O	the
O	king
O	would
O	pay
O	for
O	all
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	tied
O	the
O	goat
O	with
O	that
O	very
O	riband
O	and
O	placed
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	innkeeper
O	'
O	s
O	room
O	to
O	be
O	taken
O	care
O	of
O	,

O	he
O	put
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	side
O	room
O	where
O	his
O	daughters
O	slept
O	.
O	The

O	had
O	three
O	maiden
O	daughters
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	not
O	yet
O	asleep
O	.
O	So
O	Manka
O	said
O	:

O	``
O	The

O	,
O	Dodla

O	But
O	she

O	for
O	a
O	long

O	,
O	the

O	So
O	Dodla
O	went

O	``
O	Come

O	And
O	now
O	she

O	too
O	,
O	was
O	unable
O	to
O	withdraw
O	herself
O	from
O	her
O	.
O	So
O	Kate
O	said
O	:

O	Kate
O	went
O	and
O	gave
O	Dodla
O	a
O	pat
O	on
O	the
O	petticoat
O	;
O	and
O	now
O	she
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	couldn

O	get
O	away
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	obliged
O	to

O	by

O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	George
O	made
O	haste
O	and
O	went
O	for
O	the
O	goat
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	the
O	whole
O	set
O	away
O	--
O	Kate
O	Dodla
O	,
O	and
O	Manka
O	.
O	The
O	innkeeper
O	was
O	still
O	asleep
O	.
O	They
O	went
O	through
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	judge
O	looked
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	window
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Fie
O	,
O	Kate
O	!
O	what
O	'
O	s
O	this
O	?
O	what
O	'
O	s
O	this
O	?
O	``
O	He
O	went
O	and
O	took
O	her
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	,
O	wishing
O	to
O	pull
O	her
O	away
O	,
O	but
O	remained
O	also
O	by
O	her
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	,
O	a
O	cowherd
O	drove
O	some
O	cows
O	through
O	a
O	narrow
O	street
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bull
O	came
O	rushing
O	round
O	;
O	he
O	stuck
O	fast
O	,
O	and
O	George
O	led
O	him
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	procession
O	.
O	Thus
O	they
O	afterward
O	came
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	servants
O	came
O	out-of-doors
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	such
O	things
O	they
O	went
O	and
O	told
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	sire
O	,
O	we
O	have
O	such
O	a
O	spectacle
O	here
O	;
O	we
O	have
O	already
O	had
O	all
O	manner
O	of
O	masquerades
O	,
O	but
O	this
O	has
O	never
O	been
O	here
O	yet
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	they
O	immediately
O	led
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	to
O	the
O	square
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	looked
O	and
O	laughed
O	till
O	the
O	castle
O	shook
O	.
O	Now
O	they
O	asked
O	him
O	what
O	sort
O	of
O	person
O	he
O	was
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	shepherd
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	named
O	George
O	.
O	They
O	said
O	that
O	it
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	done
O	;
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	of
O	mean
O	lineage
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	damsel
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	must
O	accomplish
O	something
O	more
O	for
O	them
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	What
O	?
O	``
O	They
O	replied
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	spring
O	yonder
O	,
O	a
O	hundred
O	miles
O	off
O	;
O	if
O	he
O	brought
O	a
O	goblet
O	of
O	water
O	from
O	it
O	in
O	a
O	minute
O	,
O	then
O	he
O	should
O	obtain
O	the
O	damsel
O	.
O	So
O	George
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	man
O	who
O	had
O	the
O	foot
O	on
O	his
O	shoulder
O	:
O	``
O	You
O	said
O	that
O	if
O	you
O	took
O	the
O	foot
O	down
O	,
O	you
O	could
O	jump
O	a
O	hundred
O	miles
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	replied
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	'
O	ll
O	easily
O	do
O	that
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	took
O	the
O	foot
O	down
O	,
O	jumped
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	there
O	.
O	But
O	after
O	this
O	there
O	was
O	only
O	a
O	very
O	little
O	time
O	to
O	spare
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	then
O	he
O	ought
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	back
O	.
O	So
O	George
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	:
O	``
O	You
O	said
O	that

O	``
O	the

O	You

O	you
O	said
O	if
O	you
O	pulled
O	your
O	thumb
O	out
O	,
O	you
O	could
O	squirt
O	a

O	be

O	and
O	squirt
O	thither
O	,
O	that

O	may
O	get
O	up

O	And
O	you
O	,
O	look

O	drawing
O	the
O	water

O	``
O	He
O	then
O	gave
O	a
O	jump
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	there
O	exactly
O	in
O	time
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	they
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	perform
O	one
O	task
O	more
O	;
O	that
O	yonder
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	wild
O	beast
O	,
O	a
O	unicorn
O	,
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	nature
O	that
O	he
O	destroyed
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	of
O	their
O	people
O	;
O	if
O	he
O	cleared
O	him
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	he
O	should
O	obtain
O	the
O	damsel
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	people
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	They
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	firwood
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	three
O	wild
O	beasts
O	,
O	and
O	three
O	lairs
O	had
O	been
O	formed
O	by
O	wallowing
O	as
O	they
O	lay
O	.
O	Two
O	did
O	nothing
O	:
O	but
O	the
O	third
O	destroyed
O	the
O	people
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	took
O	some
O	stones
O	and
O	some
O	pine-cones
O	in
O	their
O	pockets
O	,
O	and
O	climbed
O	up
O	into
O	a
O	tree
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	beasts
O	lay
O	down
O	,
O	they
O	dropped
O	a
O	stone
O	down
O	upon
O	that
O	one
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	unicorn
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	to
O	the

O	Again
O	they
O	let
O	a

O	unicorn
O	.
O	``
O	Be
O	quiet
O	!
O	you
O	'
O	ve
O	already
O	done
O	it
O	to
O	me
O	twice
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Indeed
O	,
O	I
O	'
O	m
O	doing
O	nothing
O	to
O	you
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	they
O	attacked
O	each
O	other
O	and
O	fought
O	together
O	.
O	The
O	unicorn
O	wanted
O	to
O	pierce
O	the
O	second
O	beast
O	through
O	;
O	but
O	it
O	jumped
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	rushed
O	so
O	violently
O	after
O	it
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	struck
O	his
O	horn
O	into
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	couldn
O	'
O	t
O	pull
O	it
O	out
O	quickly
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	sprang
O	speedily
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	fir
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	beasts
O	ran
O	away
O	and
O	escaped
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	cut
O	off
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	third
O	,
O	the
O	unicorn
O	,
O	took
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	Now
O	those
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	saw
O	that
O	George
O	had
O	again
O	accomplished
O	that
O	task
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	,
O	prithee
O	,
O	shall
O	we
O	do
O	?
O	Perhaps
O	we
O	must
O	after
O	all
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	damsel
O	!
O	``
O	``
O	No
O	,
O	sire
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	attendants
O	,
O	``
O	that
O	can
O	not
O	be
O	;
O	he
O	is
O	too
O	lowborn
O	to
O	obtain
O	a
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	!
O	On
O	the
O	contrary
O	,
O	we
O	must
O	clear
O	him
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	king
O	ordered
O	them
O	to
O	note
O	his
O	words
O	,
O	what
O	he
O	should
O	say
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	hired
O	female
O	servant
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	:
O	``
O	George
O	,
O	it
O	will
O	be
O	evil
O	for
O	you
O	to-day
O	;
O	they
O	'
O	re
O	going
O	to
O	clear
O	you
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	``
O	He
O	answered
O	:
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	I
O	'
O	m
O	not
O	afraid
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	was
O	only
O	just
O	twelve
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	I
O	killed
O	twelve
O	of
O	them
O	at
O	one
O	blow
O	!
O	``
O	But
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	fact
O	:
O	when
O	his
O	mother
O	was
O	baking
O	a
O	flat-cake
O	,
O	a
O	dozen
O	flies
O	settled
O	upon
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	killed
O	them
O	all
O	at
O	a
O	single
O	blow
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	heard
O	this
O	,
O	they
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Nothing
O	else
O	will
O	do
O	but
O	we
O	must
O	shoot
O	him
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	they
O	drew
O	up
O	the
O	soldiers
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	they
O	would
O	hold
O	a
O	review
O	in
O	his
O	honour
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	would
O	celebrate
O	the
O	wedding
O	in
O	the
O	square
O	before
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	conducted
O	him
O	thither
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	soldiers
O	were
O	already
O	going
O	to
O	let
O	fly
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	George
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	man
O	who
O	held
O	his
O	thumb
O	in
O	the
O	bottle
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	a
O	stopper
O	:
O	``
O	You
O	said
O	,
O	if
O	you
O	pulled
O	your
O	thumb
O	out
O	,
O	you
O	could
O	besprinkle
O	everything
O	.
O	Pull
O	it
O	out
O	--
O	quick
O	!
O	``
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	I
O	'
O	ll
O	easily
O	perform
O	that
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	he
O	pulled
O	out
O	his
O	thumb
O	and
O	gave
O	them
O	all
O	such
O	a
O	sprinkling
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	blind
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	one
O	could
O	see
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	perceived
O	that
O	nothing
O	else
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	,
O	they
O	told
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	damsel
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	handsome
O	royal
O	robe
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wedding
O	took
O	place
O	.
O	I
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	wedding
O	;
O	they
O	had
O	music
O	there
O	,
O	sang
O	,
O	ate
O	,
O	and
O	drank
O	;
O	there
O	was
O	meat
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	cheesecakes
O	,
O	and
O	baskets
O	full
O	of
O	everything
O	,
O	and
O	buckets
O	full
O	of
O	strong
O	waters
O	.
O	To-day
O	I
O	went
O	,
O	yesterday
O	I
O	came
O	;
O	I
O	found
O	an
O	egg
O	among
O	the
O	tree-stumps
O	;
O	I
O	knocked
O	it
O	against
O	somebody
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	bald
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	'
O	s
O	got
O	it
O	still
O	.
