O	Many
O	,
O	many
O	moons
O	before
O	the
O	White
O	man
O	came
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	Indian
O	boy
O	was
O	left
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	when
O	animals
O	and
O	men
O	understood
O	each
O	other
O	better
O	than
O	they
O	do
O	now
O	.
O	An
O	old
O	mother
O	bear
O	found
O	the
O	little
O	Indian
O	boy
O	.
O	She
O	felt
O	very
O	sorry
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	She
O	told
O	the
O	little
O	boy
O	not
O	to
O	cry
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	would
O	take
O	him
O	home
O	with
O	her
O	;
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	nice
O	wigwam
O	in
O	the
O	hollow
O	of
O	a
O	big
O	tree
O	.
O	Old
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	had
O	two
O	cubs
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	place
O	between
O	her
O	great
O	paws
O	for
O	a
O	third
O	.
O	She
O	took
O	the
O	little
O	papoose
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	hugged
O	him
O	warm
O	and
O	close
O	.
O	She
O	fed
O	him
O	as
O	she
O	did
O	her
O	own
O	little
O	cubs
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	grew
O	strong
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	very
O	happy
O	with
O	his
O	adopted
O	mother
O	and
O	brothers
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	a
O	warm
O	lodge
O	in
O	the
O	hollow
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	tree
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	grew
O	older
O	,
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	found
O	for
O	them
O	all
O	the
O	honey
O	and
O	nuts
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	eat
O	.
O	From
O	sunrise
O	to
O	sunset
O	,
O	the
O	little
O	Indian
O	boy
O	played
O	with
O	his
O	cub
O	brothers
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	different
O	from
O	them
O	.
O	He
O	thought
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	bear
O	,
O	too
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	long
O	,
O	the
O	boy
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	bears
O	played
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	good
O	time
O	.
O	They
O	rolled
O	,
O	and
O	tumbled
O	,
O	and
O	wrestled
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	leaves
O	.
O	They
O	chased
O	one
O	another
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	bear
O	tree
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	they
O	had
O	a
O	matched
O	game
O	of
O	hug
O	,
O	for
O	every
O	little
O	bear
O	must
O	learn
O	to
O	hug
O	.
O	The
O	one
O	who
O	could
O	hug
O	the
O	longest
O	and
O	the
O	tightest
O	won
O	the
O	game
O	.
O	Old
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	watched
O	her
O	three
O	dear
O	children
O	at
O	their
O	play
O	.
O	She
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	content
O	and
O	happy
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	one
O	thing
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	afraid
O	some
O	harm
O	would
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	boy
O	.
O	Never
O	could
O	she
O	quite
O	forget
O	the
O	bear
O	hunters
O	.
O	Several
O	times
O	they
O	had
O	scented
O	her
O	tree
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	wind
O	had
O	thrown
O	them
O	off
O	the
O	trail
O	.
O	Once
O	,
O	from
O	her
O	bear-tree
O	window
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	thrown
O	out
O	rabbit
O	hairs
O	as
O	she
O	saw
O	them
O	coming
O	.
O	The
O	wind
O	had
O	blown
O	the
O	rabbit
O	hairs
O	toward
O	the
O	hunters
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	fell
O	near
O	the
O	hunters
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	suddenly
O	changed
O	into
O	rabbits
O	and
O	the
O	hunters
O	had
O	given
O	chase
O	.
O	At
O	another
O	time
O	,
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	tossed
O	some
O	partridge
O	feathers
O	to
O	the
O	wind
O	as
O	the
O	hunters
O	drew
O	near
O	her
O	tree
O	.
O	A
O	flock
O	of
O	partridges
O	went
O	whirring
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hunters
O	ran
O	after
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	on
O	this
O	day
O	,
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	was
O	heavy
O	.
O	She
O	knew
O	that
O	now
O	the
O	big
O	bear
O	hunters
O	were
O	coming
O	.
O	No
O	rabbits
O	or
O	partridges
O	could
O	lead
O	these
O	hunters
O	from
O	the
O	bear
O	trail
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	had
O	dogs
O	with
O	four
O	eyes
O	.
O	(
O	Foxhounds
O	have
O	a
O	yellow
O	spot
O	over
O	each
O	eye
O	which
O	makes
O	them
O	seem
O	double-eyed
O	.
O	)
O	These
O	dogs
O	were
O	never
O	known
O	to
O	miss
O	a
O	bear
O	tree
O	.
O	Sooner
O	or
O	later
O	they
O	would
O	scent
O	it
O	.
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	thought
O	she
O	might
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	save
O	herself
O	and
O	her
O	cubs
O	.
O	But
O	what
O	would
O	become
O	of
O	the
O	boy
O	?
O	She
O	loved
O	him
O	too
O	well
O	to
O	let
O	the
O	bear
O	hunters
O	kill
O	him
O	.
O	Just
O	then
O	the
O	porcupine
O	,
O	the
O	Chief
O	of
O	the
O	animals
O	,
O	passed
O	by
O	the
O	bear
O	tree
O	.
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	saw
O	him
O	.
O	She
O	put
O	her
O	head
O	out
O	the
O	bear-tree
O	window
O	and
O	called
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	came
O	and
O	sat
O	under
O	the
O	bear-tree
O	window
O	,
O	and
O	listened
O	to
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	'
O	s
O	story
O	of
O	her
O	fears
O	for
O	the
O	boy
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	had
O	finished
O	,
O	Chief
O	Porcupine
O	said
O	he
O	would
O	call
O	a
O	council
O	of
O	the
O	animals
O	,
O	and
O	see
O	if
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	save
O	the
O	boy
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	Chief
O	had
O	a
O	big
O	voice
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	raised
O	his
O	voice
O	,
O	even
O	the
O	animals
O	away
O	on
O	the
O	longest
O	trails
O	heard
O	.
O	They
O	ran
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	gathered
O	under
O	the
O	council
O	tree
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	loud
O	roar
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	flapping
O	of
O	wings
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	birds
O	came
O	,
O	too
O	.
O	Chief
O	Porcupine
O	told
O	them
O	about
O	the
O	fears
O	of
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	danger
O	to
O	the
O	boy
O	.
O	``
O	Now
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	Chief
O	,
O	``
O	which
O	one
O	of
O	you
O	will
O	take
O	the
O	boy
O	,
O	and
O	save
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	bear
O	hunters
O	?
O	``
O	It
O	happened
O	that
O	some
O	animals
O	were
O	present
O	that
O	were
O	jealous
O	of
O	man
O	.
O	These
O	animals
O	had
O	held
O	more
O	than
O	one
O	secret
O	council
O	,
O	to
O	plan
O	how
O	they
O	could
O	do
O	away
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	They
O	said
O	he
O	was
O	becoming
O	too
O	powerful
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	all
O	they
O	knew
O	,
O	--
O	and
O	more
O	.
O	The
O	beaver
O	did
O	not
O	like
O	man
O	,
O	because
O	men
O	could
O	build
O	better
O	houses
O	than
O	he
O	.
O	The
O	fox
O	said
O	that
O	man
O	had
O	stolen
O	his
O	cunning
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	now
O	outwit
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	wolf
O	and
O	the
O	panther
O	objected
O	to
O	man
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	could
O	conceal
O	himself
O	and
O	spring
O	with
O	greater
O	surety
O	than
O	they
O	.
O	The
O	raccoon
O	said
O	that
O	man
O	was
O	more
O	daring
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	climb
O	higher
O	than
O	he
O	.
O	The
O	deer
O	complained
O	that
O	man
O	could
O	outrun
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	when
O	Chief
O	Porcupine
O	asked
O	who
O	would
O	take
O	the
O	boy
O	and
O	care
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	each
O	of
O	these
O	animals
O	in
O	turn
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	gladly
O	do
O	so
O	.
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	sat
O	by
O	and
O	listened
O	as
O	each
O	offered
O	to
O	care
O	for
O	the
O	boy
O	.
O	She
O	did
O	not
O	say
O	anything
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	thinking
O	hard
O	,
O	--
O	for
O	a
O	bear
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	spoke
O	.
O	To
O	the
O	beaver
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	``

O	.
O	The
O	hunter
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	sat
O	and
O	made
O	warm
O	coats
O	from
O	the
O	fox
O	and
O	beaver
O	skins
O	which
O	the
O	hunter
O	father
O	brought
O	in
O	from
O	the
O	chase
O	.
O	But
O	never
O	was
O	the
O	hunter
O	,
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	or
O	his
O	children
O	seen

O	HOW
O	THE
O	TURKEY
O	BUZZARD
O	GOT
O	HIS
O	SUIT
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	,
O	long
O	time
O	ago
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	earth
O	was
O	very
O	young
O	.
O	Trees
O	and
O	flowers
O	were
O	growing
O	everywhere
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	birds
O	.
O	One
O	morning
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	drew
O	back
O	the
O	blanket
O	from
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	his
O	wigwam
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	upon
O	the
O	earth
O	and
O	smiled
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	his
O	work
O	was
O	good
O	.
O	``
O	Today
O	,
O	``
O	thought
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	make
O	big
O	butterflies
O	,
O	to
O	fly
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	among
O	the
O	beautiful
O	trees
O	and
O	flowers
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	They
O	shall
O	sing
O	as
O	they
O	fly
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	spoke
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	tree
O	tops
O	were
O	full
O	of
O	birds
O	,
O	--
O	but
O	they
O	had
O	no
O	feathers
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	he
O	watched
O	them
O	fly
O	and
O	listened
O	to
O	their
O	songs
O	.
O	But
O	their
O	naked
O	bodies
O	and
O	long
O	legs
O	did
O	not
O	please
O	him
O	.
O	Before
O	the
O	sun
O	had
O	set
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	feathered
O	suits
O	,
O	of
O	every
O	size
O	and
O	color
O	,
O	to
O	cover
O	them
O	.
O	That
O	night
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	birds
O	hid
O	their
O	heads
O	under
O	their
O	wings
O	,
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	spoke
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	about
O	the
O	feathered
O	suits
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	for
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	these
O	suits
O	could
O	be
O	found
O	.
O	A
O	council
O	was
O	called
O	next
O	day
O	by
O	the
O	birds
O	.
O	They
O	chose
O	_Gah
O	gah
O	go
O	wah_
O	,
O	the
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	,
O	to
O	get
O	the
O	suits
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	fly
O	over
O	a
O	long
O	trail
O	and
O	not
O	be
O	tired
O	.
O	The
O	birds
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	go
O	,
O	he
O	might
O	have
O	the
O	first
O	choice
O	of
O	the
O	suits
O	of
O	feathers
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	must
O	try
O	on
O	no
O	suit
O	more
O	than
O	once
O	.
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	promised
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	toward
O	the
O	setting
O	sun
O	.
O	Twice
O	the
O	sun
O	set
O	,
O	and
O	three
O	times
O	it
O	rose
O	,
O	before
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	feathered
O	suits
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	many
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	very
O	beautiful
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	make
O	up
O	his
O	mind
O	which
O	one
O	he
O	would
O	like
O	best
O	to
O	wear
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	remembered
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	try
O	on
O	each
O	suit
O	of
O	feathers
O	once
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	put
O	them
O	on
O	.
O	The
O	feathers
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	suit
O	were
O	too
O	long
O	.
O	They
O	trailed
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	as
O	he
O	walked
O	.
O	Neither
O	could
O	he
O	fly
O	well
O	in
O	them
O	.
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	laid
O	that
O	suit
O	aside
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	suit
O	shone
O	like
O	gold
O	.
O	The
O	feathers
O	were
O	a
O	beautiful
O	yellow
O	.
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	put
O	it
O	on
O	and
O	strutted
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	how
O	handsome
O	I
O	am
O	!
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	I
O	must
O	not
O	keep
O	this
O	,
O	for
O	if
O	I
O	did
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	shine
O	so
O	like
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	,
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	other
O	birds
O	would
O	see
O	me
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	he
O	slipped
O	off
O	the
O	suit
O	of
O	yellow
O	feathers
O	as
O	quickly
O	as
O	possible
O	.
O	A
O	third
O	suit
O	was
O	of
O	pure
O	white
O	feathers
O	.
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	thought
O	it
O	looked
O	very
O	beautiful
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	perfect
O	fit
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	it
O	will
O	get
O	dirty
O	too
O	soon
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	choose
O	this
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	this
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	was
O	laid
O	aside
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	not
O	enough
O	feathers
O	in
O	the
O	fourth
O	suit
O	.
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	shivered
O	with
O	cold
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	warm
O	enough
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	it
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	too
O	many
O	feathers
O	,
O	and
O	too
O	many
O	pieces
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	fifth
O	suit
O	.
O	It
O	took
O	too
O	much
O	time
O	to
O	put
O	it
O	on
O	.
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	did
O	not
O	want
O	that
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	went
O	from
O	one
O	suit
O	to
O	another
O	,
O	trying
O	on
O	and
O	taking
O	off
O	.
O	Always
O	he
O	had
O	some
O	new
O	fault
O	to
O	find
O	.
O	Something
O	was
O	wrong
O	with
O	each
O	one
O	.
O	Nothing
O	quite
O	pleased
O	him
O	.
O	No
O	suit
O	was
O	just
O	right
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	there
O	was
O	but
O	one
O	suit
O	left
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	pretty
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	plain
O	,
O	dull
O	color
O	,
O	--
O	and
O	very
O	short
O	of
O	feathers
O	at
O	the
O	neck
O	and
O	head
O	.
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	put
O	it
O	on
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	like
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	did
O	not
O	fit
O	him
O	well
O	:
O	it
O	was
O	cut
O	too
O	low
O	in
O	the
O	neck
O	.
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	homeliest
O	suit
O	of
O	all
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	last
O	suit
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	kept
O	it
O	on
O	.
O	Then
O	_Gah
O	gah
O	go
O	wah_
O	,
O	the
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	,
O	gathered
O	up
O	the
O	suits
O	and
O	flew
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	bird
O	lodge
O	.
O	He
O	still
O	wore
O	the
O	plain
O	,
O	dull-colored
O	suit
O	.
O	The
O	birds
O	again
O	called
O	a
O	council
O	.
O	Each
O	was
O	told
O	to
O	select
O	a
O	suit
O	from
O	those
O	that
O	_Gah
O	gah
O	go
O	wah_
O	had
O	brought
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	on
O	.
O	This
O	they
O	did
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	birds
O	in
O	their
O	beautiful
O	feathered
O	suits
O	began
O	to
O	walk
O	and
O	fly
O	about
O	the
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	make
O	fun
O	of
O	his
O	plain
O	,
O	dull
O	dress
O	.
O	But
O	_Gah
O	gah
O	go
O	wah_
O	held
O	his
O	head
O	high
O	.
O	He
O	walked
O	proudly
O	about
O	among
O	the
O	birds
O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	with
O	scorn
O	on
O	their
O	beautiful
O	suits
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	time
O	he
O	spoke
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	_Gah
O	gah
O	go
O	wah_
O	,
O	the
O	Turkey
O	Buzzard
O	,
O	does
O	not
O	want
O	your
O	suits
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	the
O	pick
O	of
O	them
O	all
O	.
O	He
O	likes
O	his
O	own
O	suit
O	best
O	.
O	``

O	Erminie
O	Smith

O	_Myths

O	the
O	Iroquois_
O	.
O	WHY
O	THE
O	PARTRIDGE
O	DRUMS
O	It
O	was
O	after
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	had
O	made
O	all
O	the
O	beautiful
O	birds
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	Evil
O	Spirit
O	came
O	along
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	the
O	beautiful
O	birds
O	and
O	heard
O	their
O	beautiful
O	songs
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	earth
O	people
O	liked
O	the
O	birds
O	and
O	liked
O	to
O	hear
O	them
O	sing
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	Evil
O	Spirit
O	did
O	not
O	wish
O	people
O	to
O	be
O	happy
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	make
O	a
O	bird
O	that
O	will
O	make

O	not
O	sing
O	,
O	but
O	will
O	make
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	Evil
O	Spirit
O	went
O	to
O	work
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	a
O	big
O	bird
O	,
O	that
O	could
O	not
O	sing
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	drum
O	.
O	The
O	big
O	bird
O	flew
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	That
O	night
O	a
O	drumming
O	noise
O	was
O	heard
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	The
O	people
O	were
O	afraid
O	.
O	They
O	could
O	not
O	sleep
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	noise
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	they
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	to
O	search
O	for
O	the
O	noise
O	.
O	Deep
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	could
O	still
O	be
O	heard
O	that
O	strange
O	drumming
O	.
O	They
O	followed
O	it
O	,
O	until
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	deep
O	,
O	dark
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	loud
O	fluttering
O	and
O	whirring
O	of
O	wings
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	bird
O	flew
O	out

O	along
O	the

O	over
O	the

O	The
O	people
O	were
O	afraid
O	.
O	They
O	called
O	to
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	to
O	help
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	was
O	near
O	.
O	He
O	heard
O	their
O	cry
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	after
O	the
O	bird
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	angry
O	.
O	The
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will

O	The

O	a

O	.
O	At

O	the
O	Great

O	came
O	upon

O	struck

O	,
O	drops
O	of

O	flew
O	in

O	They
O	changed
O	into

O	whirring
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	big
O	bird
O	had
O	done
O	.
O	There
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	drum
O	.
O	Like
O	the
O	big
O	bird
O	,
O	these
O	smaller
O	birds
O	like
O	to
O	startle
O	people

O	They
O	flutter
O	out
O	from
O	under
O	the
O	leaves
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	whirring
O	noise
O	they
O	fly
O	far
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	There
