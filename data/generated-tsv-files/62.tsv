O	In

O	he
O	could
O	.
O	This
O	sore
O	Combat
O	lasted
O	for
O	above
O	half
O	a
O	day
O	,
O	even
O	till
O	_Christian_
O	was
O	almost
O	quite
O	spent;
O	for
O	you
O	must
O	know
O	that
O	_Christian
O	,
O	_
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	his
O	wounds
O	,
O	must
O	needs
O	grow
O	weaker
O	and
O	weaker
O	.
O	Then
O	_Apollyon_
O	espying
O	his
O	opportunity
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	gather
O	up
O	close
O	to
O	_Christian
O	,
O	_
O	and
O	wrestling
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	dreadful
O	fall;
O	and
O	with
O	that
O	_Christian
O	'
O	s_
O	Sword
O	flew
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	_Apollyon
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	sure
O	of
O	thee
O	now
O	:
O	_
O	and
O	with
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	almost
O	pressed
O	him
O	to
O	death
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	_Christian_
O	began
O	to
O	despair
O	of
O	life
O	:
O	but
O	as
O	God
O	would
O	have
O	it
O	,
O	while
O	_Apollyon_
O	was
O	fetching
O	of
O	his
O	last
O	blow
O	,
O	thereby
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	full
O	end
O	of
O	this
O	good
O	man
O	,
O	_Christian_
O	nimbly
O	stretched
O	out
O	his
O	hand
O	for
O	his
O	Sword
O	,
O	and
O	caught
O	it
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	_Rejoice
O	not
O	against
O	me
O	,
O	O
O	mine
O	Enemy
O	!
O	when
O	I
O	fall
O	I
O	shall
O	arise;_
O	and
O	with
O	that
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	deadly
O	thrust
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	give
O	back
O	,
O	as
O	one
O	that
O	had
O	received
O	his
O	mortal
O	wound
O	:
O	_Christian
O	,
O	_
O	perceiving
O	that
O	,
O	made
O	at
O	him
O	again
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	_Nay
O	,
O	in
O	all
O	these
O	things
O	we
O	are
O	more
O	than
O	Conquerors
O	through
O	him
O	that
O	loved
O	us
O	.
O	_
O	And
O	with
O	that
O	_Apollyon_
O	spread
O	forth
O	his
O	Dragon
O	'
O	s
O	wings
O	,
O	and
O	sped
O	him
O	away
O	,
O	that
O	_Christian_
O	for
O	a
O	season
O	saw
O	him
O	no
O	more
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	Combat
O	no
O	man
O	can
O	imagine
O	,
O	unless
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	and
O	heard
O	as
O	I
O	did
O	,
O	what
O	yelling
O	and
O	hideous
O	roaring
O	_Apollyon_
O	made
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	the
O	fight
O	,
O	he
O	spake
O	like
O	a
O	Dragon;
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	,
O	what
O	sighs
O	and
O	groans
O	burst
O	from
O	_Christian
O	'
O	s_
O	heart
O	.
O	I
O	never
O	saw
O	him
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	give
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	one
O	pleasant
O	look
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	perceived
O	he
O	had
O	wounded
O	_Apollyon_
O	with
O	his
O	two-
O	edged
O	Sword;
O	then
O	indeed
O	he
O	did
O	smile
O	,
O	and
O	look
O	upward;
O	but
O	'
O	twas
O	the
O	dreadfullest
O	sight
O	that
O	ever
O	I
O	saw
O	.
O	So
O	when
O	the
O	Battle
O	was
O	over
O	,
O	_Christian_
O	said
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	here
O	give
O	thanks
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	hath
O	delivered
O	me
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	Lion
O	,
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	did
O	help
O	me
O	against
O	_Apollyon_
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	he
O	did
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	Great
O	_Beelzebub_
O	,
O	the
O	Captain
O	of
O	this
O	Fiend
O	,
O	Design
O	'
O	d
O	my
O	ruin;
O	therefore
O	to
O	this
O	end
O	He
O	sent
O	him
O	harness
O	'
O	d
O	out
O	:
O	and
O	he
O	with
O	rage
O	That
O	hellish
O	was
O	,
O	did
O	fiercely
O	me
O	engage
O	:
O	But
O	blessed
O	_Michael_
O	helped
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	By
O	dint
O	of
O	Sword
O	did
O	quickly
O	make
O	him
O	fly
O	.
O	Therefore
O	to
O	him
O	let
O	me
O	give
O	lasting
O	praise
O	,
O	And
O	thank
O	and
O	bless
O	his
O	holy
O	name
O	always
O	.
O	Then
O	there
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	a
O	hand
O	,
O	with
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	leaves
O	of
O	the
O	Tree
O	of
O	Life
O	,
O	the
O	which
O	_Christian_
O	took
O	,
O	and
O	applied
O	to
O	the
O	wounds
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	received
O	in
O	the
O	Battle
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	healed
O	immediately
O	.
O	He
O	also
O	sat
O	down
O	in
O	that
O	place
O	to
O	eat
O	Bread
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	drink
O	of
O	the
O	Bottle
O	that
O	was
O	given
O	him
O	a
O	little
O	before;
O	so
O	being
O	refreshed
O	,
O	he
O	addressed
O	himself
O	to
O	his
O	Journey
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	Sword
O	drawn
O	in
O	his
O	hand;
O	for
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	I
O	know
O	not
O	but
O	some
O	other
O	Enemy
O	may
O	be
O	at
O	hand
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	met
O	with
O	no
O	other
O	affront
O	from
O	_Apollyon_
O	quite
O	through
O	this
O	Valley
O	.
O	CHRISTIAN
O	AND
O	HOPEFUL
O	ARE
O	CAPTIVES
O	IN
O	DOUBTING
O	CASTLE
O	By
O	John
O	Bunyan
O	I
O	saw
O	then
O	that
O	they
O	went
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	to
O	a
O	pleasant
O	River
O	,
O	which
O	_David_
O	the
O	King
O	called
O	the
O	_River
O	of
O	God_
O	,
O	but
O	_John_
O	,
O	_the
O	River
O	of
O	the
O	Water
O	of
O	Life_
O	.
O	Now
O	their
O	way
O	lay
O	just
O	upon
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	the
O	River;
O	here
O	therefore
O	_Christian_
O	and
O	his
O	Companion
O	walked
O	with
O	great
O	delight;
O	they
O	drank
O	also
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	the
O	River
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	pleasant
O	and
O	enlivening
O	to
O	their
O	weary
O	spirits;
O	besides
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	this
O	River
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	were
O	_green
O	Trees_
O	,
O	that
O	bore
O	all
O	manner
O	of
O	Fruit;
O	and
O	the
O	Leaves
O	of
O	the
O	Trees
O	were
O	good
O	for
O	Medicine;
O	with
O	the
O	Fruit
O	of
O	these
O	Trees
O	they
O	were
O	also
O	much
O	delighted;
O	and
O	the
O	Leaves
O	they
O	ate
O	to
O	prevent
O	Surfeits
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	Diseases
O	that
O	are
O	incident
O	to
O	those
O	that
O	heat
O	their
O	blood
O	by
O	Travels
O	.
O	On
O	either
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	River
O	was
O	also
O	a
O	Meadow
O	,
O	curiously
O	beautified
O	with
O	Lilies;
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	green
O	all
O	the
O	year
O	long
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	Meadow
O	they
O	lay
O	down
O	and
O	slept
O	,
O	for
O	here
O	they
O	might
O	_lie
O	down
O	safely
O	.
O	_
O	When
O	they
O	awoke
O	,
O	they
O	gathered
O	again
O	of
O	the
O	Fruit
O	of
O	the
O	Trees
O	,
O	and
O	drank
O	again
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	the
O	River
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	lay
O	down
O	again
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	Thus
O	they
O	did
O	several
O	days
O	and
O	nights
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	disposed
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	they
O	eat
O	and
O	drank
O	,
O	and
O	departed
O	.
O	Now
O	I
O	beheld
O	in
O	my
O	Dream
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	journeyed
O	far
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	River
O	and
O	the
O	way
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	parted;
O	at
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	a
O	little
O	sorry
O	,
O	yet
O	they
O	durst
O	not
O	go
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	way
O	from
O	the
O	River
O	was
O	rough
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	feet
O	tender
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	their
O	Travels;
O	_so
O	the
O	soul
O	of
O	the
O	Pilgrims
O	was
O	much
O	discouraged
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	.
O	_
O	Now
O	a
O	little
O	before
O	them
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	left
O	hand
O	of
O	the
O	road
O	a
O	_Meadow_
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	Stile
O	to
O	go
O	over
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	Meadow
O	is
O	called
O	_By-path-Meadow_
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	_Christian_
O	to
O	his
O	fellow
O	,
O	If
O	this
O	Meadow
O	lieth
O	along
O	by
O	our
O	way-side
O	,
O	let
O	'
O	s
O	go
O	over
O	into
O	it
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	Stile
O	to
O	see
O	,
O	and
O	behold
O	a
O	Path
O	lay
O	along
O	by
O	the
O	way
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	fence
O	.
O	'
O	Tis
O	according
O	to
O	my
O	wish
O	,
O	said
O	_Christian_
O	,
O	here

O	easiest
O	going;
O	come
O	good
O	Hopeful
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	us
O	go

O	HOPE
O	.
O	But
O	how
O	if
O	this

O	,
O	doth
O	it
O	not

O	?
O	So
O	_Hopeful_
O	,
O	being
O	persuaded
O	by
O	his
O	fellow
O	,
O	went
O	after
O	him
O	over
O	the
O	Stile
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	were
O	gone
O	over
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	got
O	into
O	the
O	Path
O	,
O	they
O	found
O	it
O	very
O	easy
O	for
O	their
O	feet
O	:
O	and
O	withal
O	,
O	they
O	looking
O	before
O	them
O	,
O	espied
O	a
O	man
O	walking
O	as
O	they
O	did
O	,
O	(

O	his
O	name
O	was

O	so
O	they
O	called
O	after
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	whither
O	that
O	way
O	led

O	He
O	said

O	behold

O	Then
O	for
O	their
O	encouragement
O	,
O	they
O	heard
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	one
O	saying
O	,
O	_Let

O	But
O	by

O	reason
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	way
O	of
O	going
O	back
O	was
O	very
O	dangerous
O	.
O	(

O	easier
O	going
O	out
O	of

O	than
O	going

O	out

O	)
O	Yet
O	they
O	adventured
O	to
O	go
O	back;
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	dark
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	flood
O	was
O	so
O	high
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	their
O	going
O	back
O	they
O	had
O	like
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	drowned
O	nine
O	or
O	ten
O	times
O	.
O	Neither
O	could
O	they
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	skill
O	they
O	had
O	,
O	get
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	Stile
O	that
O	night
O	.
O	Wherefore
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	lighting
O	under
O	a
O	little
O	shelter
O	,
O	they
O	sat
O	down
O	there
O	till
O	the
O	day
O	brake;
O	but
O	being
O	weary
O	,
O	they
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	Now
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	they
O	lay
O	,
O	a
O	Castle
O	called
O	_Doubting
O	Castle_
O	,
O	the
O	owner
O	whereof
O	was
O	Giant
O	_Despair_
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	grounds
O	they
O	were
O	now
O	sleeping
O	:
O	wherefore
O	he
O	,
O	getting
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	early
O	,
O	and
O	walking
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	in
O	his
O	fields
O	,
O	caught
O	_Christian_
O	and
O	_Hopeful_
O	asleep
O	in
O	his
O	grounds
O	.
O	Then
O	with
O	a
O	_grim_
O	and
O	_surly_
O	voice
O	he
O	bid
O	them
O	awake
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	them
O	whence
O	they
O	were
O	?
O	and
O	what
O	they
O	did
O	in
O	his
O	grounds
O	?
O	They
O	told
O	him
O	they
O	were
O	Pilgrims
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	lost
O	their
O	way
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	the
O	Giant
O	,
O	You
O	have
O	this
O	night
O	trespassed
O	on
O	me
O	,
O	by
O	trampling
O	in
O	and
O	lying
O	on
O	my
O	grounds
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	you
O	must
O	go
O	along
O	with
O	me
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	were
O	forced
O	to
O	go
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	stronger
O	than
O	they
O	.
O	They
O	also
O	had
O	but
O	little
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	knew
O	themselves
O	in
O	a
O	fault
O	.
O	The
O	Giant
O	therefore
O	drove
O	them
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	them
O	into
O	his
O	Castle
O	,
O	into
O	a
O	very
O	dark
O	Dungeon
O	,
O	nasty
O	and
O	stinking
O	to
O	the
O	spirits
O	of
O	these
O	two
O	men
O	.
O	Here
O	then
O	they
O	lay
O	from
O	_Wednesday_
O	morning
O	till
O	_Saturday_
O	night
O	,
O	without
O	one
O	bit
O	of
O	bread
O	,
O	or
O	drop
O	of
O	drink
O	,
O	or
O	light
O	,
O	or
O	any
O	to
O	ask
O	how
O	they
O	did;
O	they
O	were
O	therefore
O	here
O	in
O	evil
O	case
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	far
O	from
O	friends
O	and
O	acquaintance
O	.
O	Now
O	in
O	this
O	place
O	_Christian_
O	had
O	double
O	sorrow
O	,
O	because
O	'
O	twas
O	through
O	his
O	unadvised
O	haste
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	brought
O	into
O	this
O	distress
O	.
O	Now
O	Giant
O	_Despair_
O	had
O	a
O	Wife
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	name
O	was
O	_Diffidence_
O	.
O	So
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	gone
O	to
O	bed
O	,
O	he
O	told
O	his
O	Wife
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	,
O	to
O	wit
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	a
O	couple
O	of
O	Prisoners
O	and
O	cast
O	them
O	into
O	his
O	Dungeon
O	,
O	for
O	trespassing
O	on
O	his
O	grounds
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	asked
O	her
O	also
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	best
O	do
O	further
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	So
O	she
O	asked
O	him
O	what
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	whence
O	they
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	whither
O	they
O	were
O	bound;
O	and
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	counselled
O	him
O	that
O	when
O	he
O	arose
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	he
O	should
O	beat
O	them
O	without
O	any
O	mercy
O	.
O	So
O	when
O	he
O	arose
O	,
O	he
O	getteth
O	him
O	a
O	grievous
O	Crab-tree
O	Cudgel
O	,
O	and
O	goes
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	Dungeon
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	first
O	falls
O	to
O	rating
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	dogs
O	,
O	although
O	they
O	gave
O	him
O	never
O	a
O	word
O	of
O	distaste
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	falls
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	beats
O	them
O	fearfully
O	,
O	in
O	such
O	sort
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	help
O	themselves
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	turn
O	them
O	upon
O	the
O	floor
O	.
O	This
O	done
O	,
O	he
O	withdraws
O	and
O	leaves
O	them
O	,
O	there
O	to
O	condole
O	their
O	misery
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	mourn
O	under
O	their
O	distress
O	:
O	so
O	all
O	that
O	day
O	they
O	spent
O	the
O	time
O	in
O	nothing
O	but
O	sighs
O	and
O	bitter
O	lamentations
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	night
O	she
O	talking
O	with
O	her
O	Husband
O	about
O	them
O	further
O	,
O	and
O	understanding
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	yet
O	alive
O	,
O	did
O	advise
O	him
O	to
O	counsel
O	them
O	to
O	make
O	away
O	themselves
O	.
O	So
O	when
O	morning
O	was
O	come
O	,
O	he
O	goes
O	to
O	them
O	in
O	a
O	surly
O	manner
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	perceiving
O	them
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	sore
O	with
O	the
O	stripes
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	them
O	the
O	day
O	before
O	,
O	he
O	told
O	them
O	,
O	that
O	since
O	they
O	were
O	never
O	like
O	to
O	come
O	out
O	of
O	that
O	place
O	,
O	their
O	only
O	way
O	would
O	be
O	forthwith
O	to
O	make
O	an
O	end
O	of
O	themselves
O	,
O	either
O	with
O	Knife
O	,
O	Halter
O	,
O	or
O	Poison;
O	For
O	why
O	,
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	should
O	you
O	chuse
O	life
O	,
O	seeing
O	it
O	is
O	attended
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	bitterness
O	?
O	But
O	they
O	desired
O	him
O	to
O	let
O	them
O	go
O	.
O	With
O	that
O	he
O	looked
O	ugly
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	rushing
O	to
O	them
O	had
O	doubtless
O	made
O	an
O	end
O	of
O	them
O	himself
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	fell
O	into
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	Fits
O	,
O	(
O	for
O	he
O	sometimes
O	in
O	Sun-shine
O	weather
O	fell
O	into
O	Fits
O	)
O	and
O	lost
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	the
O	use
O	of
O	his
O	hand;
O	wherefore
O	he
O	withdrew
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	them
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	to
O	consider
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	Then
O	did
O	the
O	Prisoners
O	consult
O	between
O	themselves
O	,
O	whether
O	'
O	twas
O	best
O	to
O	take
O	his
O	counsel
O	or
O	no;
O	and
O	thus
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	discourse
O	:

O	The
O	life

O	utmost
O	to
O	get
O	from
O	under
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	a
O	fool
O	that
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	try
O	to
O	do
O	it
O	before;
O	but
O	however
O	,
O	my
O	Brother
O	,
O	let
O	'
O	s
O	be
O	patient
O	,
O	and
O	endure
O	a
O	while;
O	the
O	time
O	may
O	come
O	that
O	may
O	give
O	us
O	a
O	happy
O	release;
O	but
O	let
O	us
O	not
O	be
O	our
O	own
O	murderers
O	.
O	With
O	these
O	words
O	_Hopeful_
O	at
O	present
O	did
O	moderate
O	the
O	mind
O	of
O	his
O	Brother;
O	so
O	they
O	continued
O	together
O	(
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	)
O	that
O	day
O	,
O	in
O	their
O	sad
O	and
O	doleful
O	condition
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	towards
O	evening
O	the
O	Giant
O	goes
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	Dungeon
O	again
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	his
O	prisoners
O	had
O	taken
O	his
O	counsel;
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	there
O	he
O	found
O	them
O	alive
O	,
O	and
O	truly
O	,
O	alive
O	was
O	all;
O	for
O	now
O	,
O	what
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	Bread
O	and
O	Water
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	the
O	Wounds
O	they
O	received
O	when
O	he
O	beat
O	them
O	,
O	they
O	could
O	do
O	little
O	but
O	breathe
O	:
O	But
O	,
O	I
O	say
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	them
O	alive;
O	at
O	which
O	he
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	grievous
O	rage
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	that
O	seeing
O	they
O	disobeyed
O	his
O	counsel
O	,
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	worse
O	with
O	them
O	than
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	born
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	they
O	trembled
O	greatly
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	think
O	that
O	_Christian_
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	Swoon;
O	but
O	coming
O	a
O	little
O	to
O	himself
O	again
O	,
O	they
O	renewed
O	their
O	discourse
O	about
O	the
O	Giant
O	'
O	s
O	counsel
O	,
O	and
O	whether
O	yet
O	they
O	had
O	best
O	to
O	take
O	it
O	or
O	no
O	.
O	Now
O	_Christian_
O	again
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	for
O	doing
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	_Hopeful_
O	made
O	his
O	second
O	reply
O	as
O	followeth
O	:
O	HOPE
O	.
O	My
O	Brother
O	,
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	rememberest
O	thou
O	not
O	how
O	valiant
O	thou
O	hast
O	been
O	heretofore
O	?
O	_Apollyon_
O	could
O	not
O	crush
O	thee
O	,
O	nor
O	could
O	all
O	that
O	thou
O	didst
O	hear
O	,
O	or
O	see
O	,
O	or
O	feel
O	in
O	the
O	Valley
O	of
O	the
O	_Shadow
O	of
O	Death_
O	.
O	What
O	hardship
O	,
O	terror
O	,
O	and
O	amazement
O	hast
O	thou
O	already
O	gone
O	through
O	,
O	and
O	art
O	thou
O	now
O	nothing
O	but
O	fear
O	?
O	Thou
O	seest
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	in
O	the
O	Dungeon
O	with
O	thee
O	,
O	a
O	far
O	weaker
O	man
O	by
O	nature
O	than
O	thou
O	art;
O	also
O	this
O	Giant
O	has
O	wounded
O	me
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	thee
O	,
O	and
O	hath
O	also
O	cut
O	off
O	the
O	Bread
O	and
O	Water
O	from
O	my
O	mouth;
O	and
O	with
O	thee
O	I
O	mourn
O	without
O	the
O	light
O	.
O	But
O	let
O	'
O	s
O	exercise
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	patience
O	,
O	remember
O	how
O	thou
O	playedst
O	the
O	man
O	at
O	Vanity
O	Fair
O	,
O	and
O	wast
O	neither
O	afraid
O	of
O	the
O	Chain
O	,
O	nor
O	Cage
O	,
O	nor
O	yet
O	of
O	bloody
O	Death
O	:
O	wherefore
O	let
O	us
O	(
O	at
O	least
O	to
O	avoid
O	the
O	shame
O	that
O	becomes
O	not
O	a
O	Christian
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	in
O	)
O	bear
O	up
O	with
O	patience
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	we
O	can
O	.
O	Now
O	night
O	being
O	come
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Giant
O	and
O	his
O	Wife
O	being
O	in
O	bed
O	,
O	she
O	asked
O	him
O	concerning
O	the
O	Prisoners
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	taken
O	his
O	counsel
O	:
O	To
O	which
O	he
O	replied
O	,
O	They
O	are
O	sturdy
O	Rogues
O	,
O	they
O	chuse
O	rather
O	to
O	bear
O	all
O	hardship
O	,
O	than
O	to
O	make
O	away
O	themselves
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	she
O	,
O	Take
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	Castle-yard
O	to-morrow
O	,
O	and
O	shew
O	them
O	the
O	Bones
O	and
O	Skulls
O	of
O	those
O	that
O	thou
O	hast
O	already
O	dispatch
O	'
O	d
O	,
O	and
O	make
O	them
O	believe
O	,
O	e
O	'
O	er
O	a
O	week
O	comes
O	to
O	an
O	end
O	,
O	thou
O	also
O	wilt
O	tear
O	them
O	in
O	pieces
O	,
O	as
O	thou
O	hast
O	done
O	their
O	fellows
O	before
O	them
O	.
O	So
O	when
O	the
O	morning
O	was
O	come
O	,
O	the
O	Giant
O	goes
O	to
O	them
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	takes
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	Castle-yard
O	and
O	shews
O	them
O	as
O	his
O	Wife
O	had
O	bidden
O	him
O	.
O	These
O	,
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	were
O	Pilgrims
O	as
O	you
O	are
O	,
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	trespassed
O	in
O	my
O	grounds
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	have
O	done;
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	thought
O	fit
O	,
O	I
O	tore
O	them
O	in
O	pieces
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	within
O	ten
O	days
O	I
O	will
O	do
O	you
O	.
O	Go
O	get
O	you
O	down
O	to
O	your
O	Den
O	again;
O	and
O	with
O	that
O	he
O	beat
O	them
O	all
O	the
O	way
O	thither
O	.
O	They
O	lay
O	therefore
O	all
O	day
O	on
O	_Saturday_
O	in
O	a
O	lamentable
O	case
O	,
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	night
O	was
O	come
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Diffidence
O	and
O	her
O	Husband
O	the
O	Giant
O	were
O	got
O	to
O	bed
O	,
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	renew
O	their
O	discourse
O	of
O	their
O	Prisoners;
O	and
O	withal
O	the
O	old
O	Giant
O	wondered
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	neither
O	by
O	his
O	blows
O	nor
O	counsel
O	bring
O	them
O	to
O	an
O	end
O	.
O	And
O	with
O	that
O	his
O	Wife
O	replied
O	,
O	I
O	fear
O	,
O	said
O	she
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	live
O	in
O	hope
O	that
O	some
O	will
O	come
O	to
O	relieve
O	them
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	they
O	have
O	pick-locks
O	about
O	them
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	means
O	of
O	which
O	they
O	hope
O	to
O	escape
O	.
O	And
O	sayest
O	thou
O	so
O	,
O	my
O	dear
O	?
O	said
O	the
O	Giant
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	therefore
O	search
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	.
O	Well
O	on
O	_Saturday_
O	about
O	midnight
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	_pray_
O	,
O	and
O	continued
O	in
O	Prayer
O	till
O	almost
O	break
O	of
O	day
O	.
O	Now
O	a
O	little
O	before
O	it
O	was
O	day
O	,
O	good
O	_Christian_
O	,
O	as
O	one
O	half
O	amazed
O	,
O	brake
O	out
O	in
O	passionate
O	speech
O	:
O	_What
O	a
O	fool_
O	,
O	quoth
O	he
O	,
O	_am
O	I
O	,
O	thus
O	to
O	lie
O	in
O	a
O	stinking
O	Dungeon
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	may
O	as
O	well
O	walk
O	at
O	liberty
O	.
O	I_
O	have
O	a
O	Key
O	in
O	my
O	bosom
O	called
O	Promise
O	,
O	that
O	will
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	persuaded
O	,
O	open
O	any
O	Lock
O	in
O	_Doubting_
O	Castle
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	_Hopeful_
O	,
O	That
O	'
O	s
O	good
O	news;
O	good
O	Brother
O	,
O	pluck
O	it
O	out
O	of
O	thy
O	bosom
O	and
O	try
O	.
O	Then
O	_Christian_
O	pulled
O	it
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	bosom
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	try
O	at
O	the
O	Dungeon
O	door
O	,
O	whose
O	bolt
O	(
O	as
O	he
O	turned
O	the
O	Key
O	)
O	gave
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	door
O	flew
O	open
O	with
O	ease
O	,
O	and
O	_Christian_
O	and
O	_Hopeful_
O	both
O	came
O	out
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	outward
O	door
O	that
O	leads
O	into
O	the
O	Castle-yard
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	his
O	Key
O	opened
O	that
O	door
O	also
O	.
O	After
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	iron
O	Gate
O	,
O	for
O	that
O	must
O	be
O	opened
O	too
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	Lock
O	went
O	damnable
O	hard
O	,
O	yet
O	the
O	Key
O	did
O	open
O	it
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	thrust
O	open
O	the
O	Gate
O	to
O	make
O	their
O	escape
O	with
O	speed;
O	but
O	that
O	Gate
O	as
O	it
O	opened
O	made
O	such
O	a
O	creaking
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	waked
O	Giant
O	_Despair_
O	,
O	who
O	hastily
O	rising
O	to
O	pursue
O	his
O	Prisoners
O	,
O	felt
O	his
O	limbs
O	to
O	fail
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	Fits
O	took
O	him
O	again
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	by
O	no
O	means
O	go
O	after
O	them
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	went
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	High-way
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	were
O	safe
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	were
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	jurisdiction
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	gone
O	over
O	the
O	Stile
O	,
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	contrive
O	with
O	themselves
O	what
O	they
O	should
O	do
O	at
O	that
O	Stile
O	,
O	to
O	prevent
O	those
O	that
O	should
O	come
O	after
O	from
O	falling
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	Giant
O	_Despair_
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	consented
O	to
O	erect
O	there
O	a
O	Pillar
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	engrave
O	upon
O	the
O	side
O	thereof
O	this
O	sentence
O	,
O	_Over
O	this
O	Stile
O	is
O	the
O	way
O	to_
O	Doubting
O	_Castle

O	is
O	kept
O	by
O	Giant_
O	Despair
O	,
O	_who
O	despiseth
O	the

O	Country
O	,
O	and
O	seeks
O	to
O	destroy
O	his

O	.
O	_
O	Many
O	therefore
O	that
O	followed
O	after
O	read
O	what
O	was
O	written
O	,
O	and
O	escaped
O	the
O	danger
O	.
O	This
O	done
O	,
O	they
O	sang
O	as
O	follows
O	:
O	Out
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	we
O	went
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	we
O	found
O	What
O	'
O	twas
O	to

O	upon

O	a

O	,
O	Lest
O	heedlessness
O	makes
O	them
O	,

O	we
O	,
O	to

O	.
O	Lest

O	CHRISTIAN
O	AND
O	HOPEFUL
O	ARRIVE
O	AT
O	THE
O	CAELESTIAL
O	CITY
O	By
O	John
O	Bunyan
O	I
O	saw
O	that
O	as
O	they
O	went
O	on
O	,
O	there
O	met
O	them
O	two
O	men
O	,
O	in
O	Raiment
O	that
O	shone
O	like
O	Gold
O	,
O	also
O	their
O	faces
O	shone
O	as
O	the
O	light
O	.
O	These
O	men
O	asked
O	the
O	Pilgrims
O	whence
O	they
O	came
O	?
O	and
O	they
O	told
O	them
O	.
O	They
O	also
O	asked
O	them
O	where
O	they
O	had
O	lodged
O	,
O	what
O	difficulties
O	and
O	dangers
O	,
O	what
O	comforts
O	and
O	pleasures
O	they
O	had
O	met
O	in
O	the
O	way
O	?
O	and
O	they
O	told
O	them
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	the
O	men
O	that
O	met
O	them
O	,
O	You
O	have
O	but
O	two
O	difficulties
O	more
O	to
O	meet
O	with
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	you
O	are
O	in
O	the
O	City
O	.
O	And
O	I
O	slept
O	,
O	and
O	Dreamed
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	same
O	two
O	Pilgrims
O	going
O	down
O	the
O	Mountains
O	along
O	the
O	High-way
O	towards
O	the
O	City
O	.
O	Now
O	you
O	must
O	note
O	that
O	the
O	City
O	stood
O	upon
O	a
O	mighty
O	Hill
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	Pilgrims
O	went
O	up
O	that
O	Hill
O	with
O	ease
O	because
O	they
O	had
O	these
O	two
O	men
O	to
O	lead
O	them
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	arms;
O	also
O	they
O	had
O	left
O	their
O	_mortal
O	Garments_
O	behind
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	River
O	.
O	They
O	therefore
O	went
O	up
O	here
O	with
O	much
O	agility
O	and
O	speed
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	foundation
O	upon
O	which
O	the
O	City
O	was
O	framed
O	was
O	higher
O	than
O	the
O	Clouds
O	.
O	They
O	therefore
O	went
O	up
O	through
O	the
O	Regions
O	of
O	the
O	Air
O	,
O	sweetly
O	talking
O	as
O	they
O	went
O	,
O	being
O	comforted
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	safely
O	got
O	over
O	the
O	River
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	such
O	glorious
O	Companions
O	to
O	attend
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	talk
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	with
O	the
O	Shining
O	Ones
O	was
O	about
O	the
O	glory
O	of
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	who
O	told
O	them
O	that
O	the
O	beauty
O	and
O	glory
O	of
O	it
O	was
O	inexpressible
O	.
O	There
O	,
O	said
O	they
O	,
O	is
O	the
O	Mount
O	_Sion_
O	,
O	the
O	heavenly
O	_Jerusalem_
O	,
O	the
O	innumerable
O	company
O	of
O	Angels
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Spirits
O	of
O	just
O	men
O	made
O	perfect
O	.
O	You
O	are
O	going
O	now
O	,
O	said
O	they
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	Paradise
O	of
O	God
O	,
O	wherein
O	you
O	shall
O	see
O	the
O	Tree
O	of
O	Life
O	,
O	and
O	eat
O	of
O	the
O	never-fading
O	fruits
O	thereof;
O	and
O	when
O	you
O	come
O	there
O	,
O	you
O	shall
O	have
O	white
O	Robes
O	given
O	you
O	,
O	and
O	your
O	walk
O	and
O	talk
O	shall
O	be
O	every
O	day
O	with
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	even
O	all
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	Eternity
O	.
O	There
O	you
O	shall
O	not
O	see
O	again
O	such
O	things
O	as
O	you
O	saw
O	when
O	you
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	lower
O	Region
O	upon
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	to
O	wit
O	,
O	sorrow
O	,
O	sickness
O	,
O	affliction
O	,
O	and
O	health
O	,
O	_for
O	the
O	former
O	things
O	are
O	passed
O	away_
O	.
O	You
O	are
O	now
O	going
O	to
O	_Abraham_
O	,
O	to
O	_Isaac_
O	,
O	and
O	_Jacob_
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	the
O	Prophets
O	,
O	men
O	that
O	God
O	hath
O	taken
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	evil
O	to
O	come
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	are
O	now
O	resting
O	upon
O	their
O	beds
O	,
O	each
O	one
O	walking
O	in
O	his
O	righteousness
O	.
O	The
O	men
O	then
O	asked
O	,
O	What
O	must
O	we
O	do
O	in
O	the
O	holy
O	place
O	?
O	To
O	whom
O	it
O	was
O	answered
O	,
O	You
O	must
O	there
O	receive
O	the
O	comfort
O	of
O	all
O	your
O	toil
O	,
O	and
O	have
O	joy
O	for
O	all
O	your
O	sorrow;
O	you
O	must
O	reap
O	what
O	you
O	have
O	sown
O	,
O	even
O	the
O	fruit
O	of
O	all
O	your
O	Prayers
O	and
O	Tears
O	,
O	and
O	sufferings
O	for
O	the
O	King
O	by
O	the
O	way
O	.
O	In
O	that
O	place
O	you
O	must
O	wear
O	Crowns
O	of
O	Gold
O	,
O	and
O	enjoy
O	the
O	perpetual
O	sight
O	and
O	vision
O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	One
O	,
O	_for
O	there
O	you
O	shall
O	see
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	is_
O	.
O	There
O	also
O	you
O	shall
O	serve
O	him
O	continually
O	with
O	praise
O	,
O	with
O	shouting
O	,
O	and
O	thanksgiving
O	,
O	whom
O	you
O	desired
O	to
O	serve
O	in
O	the
O	World
O	,
O	though
O	with
O	much
O	difficulty
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	infirmity
O	of
O	your
O	flesh
O	.
O	There
O	your
O	eyes
O	shall
O	be
O	delighted
O	with
O	seeing
O	,
O	and
O	your
O	ears
O	with
O	hearing
O	the
O	pleasant
O	voice
O	of
O	the
O	Mighty
O	One
O	.
O	There
O	you
O	shall
O	enjoy
O	your
O	friends
O	again
O	,
O	that
O	are
O	gone
O	thither
O	before
O	you;
O	and
O	there
O	you
O	shall
O	with
O	joy
O	receive
O	even
O	every
O	one
O	that
O	follows
O	into
O	the
O	holy
O	place
O	after
O	you
O	.
O	There
O	also
O	shall
O	you
O	be
O	cloathed
O	with
O	Glory
O	and
O	Majesty
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	into
O	an
O	equipage
O	fit
O	to
O	ride
O	out
O	with
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Glory
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	shall
O	come
O	with
O	sound
O	of
O	Trumpet
O	in
O	the
O	Clouds
O	,
O	as
O	upon
O	the
O	wings
O	of
O	the
O	Wind
O	,
O	you
O	shall
O	come
O	with
O	him;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	shall
O	sit
O	upon
O	the
O	Throne
O	of
O	Judgment
O	,
O	you
O	shall
O	sit
O	by
O	him;
O	yea
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	shall
O	pass
O	sentence
O	upon
O	all
O	the
O	workers
O	of
O	iniquity
O	,
O	let
O	them
O	be
O	Angels
O	or
O	Men
O	,
O	you
O	also
O	shall
O	have
O	a
O	voice
O	in
O	that
O	Judgment
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	were
O	his
O	and
O	your
O	Enemies
O	.
O	Also
O	when
O	he
O	shall
O	again
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	City
O	,
O	you
O	shall
O	go
O	too
O	,
O	with
O	sound
O	of
O	Trumpet
O	,
O	and
O	be
O	ever
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	Now
O	while
O	they
O	were
O	thus
O	drawing
O	towards
O	the
O	Gate
O	,
O	behold
O	a
O	company
O	of
O	the
O	Heavenly
O	Host
O	came
O	out
O	to
O	meet
O	them;
O	to
O	whom
O	it
O	was
O	said
O	by
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	Shining
O	Ones
O	,
O	These
O	are
O	the
O	men
O	that
O	have
O	loved
O	our
O	Lord
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	World
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	have
O	left
O	all
O	for
O	his
O	Holy
O	Name
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	hath
O	sent
O	us
O	to
O	fetch
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	have
O	brought
O	them
O	thus
O	far
O	on
O	their
O	desired
O	Journey
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	may
O	go
O	in
O	and
O	look
O	their
O	Redeemer
O	in
O	the
O	face
O	with
O	joy
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Heavenly
O	Host
O	gave
O	a
O	great
O	shout
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	_Blessed
O	are
O	they
O	that
O	are
O	called
O	to
O	the
O	Marriage
O	Supper
O	of
O	the
O	Lamb
O	.
O	_
O	There
O	came
O	out
O	also
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	to
O	meet
O	them
O	,
O	several
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	Trumpeters
O	,
O	cloathed
O	in
O	white
O	and
O	shining
O	Raiment
O	,
O	who
O	with
O	melodious
O	noises
O	and
O	loud
O	,
O	made
O	even
O	the
O	Heavens
O	to
O	echo
O	with
O	their
O	sound
O	.
O	These
O	Trumpeters
O	saluted
O	_Christian_
O	and
O	his
O	fellow
O	with
O	ten
O	thousand
O	welcomes
O	from
O	the
O	World
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	they
O	did
O	with
O	shouting
O	and
O	sound
O	of
O	Trumpet
O	.
O	This
O	done
O	,
O	they
O	compassed
O	them
O	round
O	on
O	every
O	side;
O	some
O	went
O	before
O	,
O	some
O	behind
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	on
O	the
O	right
O	hand
O	,
O	some
O	on
O	the
O	left
O	,
O	(
O	as
O	'
O	twere
O	to
O	guard
O	them
O	through
O	the
O	upper
O	Regions
O	)
O	continually
O	sounding
O	as
O	they
O	went
O	with
O	melodious
O	noise
O	,
O	in
O	notes
O	on
O	high
O	:
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	very
O	sight
O	was
O	to
O	them
O	that
O	could
O	behold
O	it
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	Heaven
O	itself
O	was
O	come
O	down
O	to
O	meet
O	them
O	.
O	Thus
O	therefore
O	they
O	walked
O	on
O	together;
O	and
O	as
O	they
O	walked
O	,
O	ever
O	and
O	anon
O	these
O	Trumpeters
O	,
O	even
O	with
O	joyful
O	sound
O	,
O	would
O	,
O	by
O	mixing
O	their
O	musick
O	with
O	looks
O	and
O	gestures
O	,
O	still
O	signify
O	to
O	_Christian_
O	and
O	his
O	Brother
O	,
O	how
O	welcome
O	they
O	were
O	into
O	their
O	company
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	what
O	gladness
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	meet
O	them;
O	and
O	now
O	were
O	these
O	two
O	men
O	as
O	'
O	twere
O	in
O	Heaven
O	before
O	they
O	came
O	at
O	it
O	,
O	being
O	swallowed
O	up
O	with
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	Angels
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	hearing
O	of
O	their
O	melodious
O	notes
O	.
O	Here
O	also
O	they
O	had
O	the
O	City
O	itself
O	in
O	view
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	thought
O	they
O	heard
O	all
O	the
O	Bells
O	therein
O	ring
O	to
O	welcome
O	them
O	thereto
O	.
O	But
O	above
O	all
O	,
O	the
O	warm
O	and
O	joyful
O	thoughts
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	about
O	their
O	own
O	dwelling
O	there
O	,
O	with
O	such
O	company
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	for
O	ever
O	and
O	ever
O	.
O	Oh
O	,
O	by
O	what
O	tongue
O	or
O	pen
O	can
O	their
O	glorious
O	joy
O	be
O	expressed
O	!
O	And
O	thus
O	they
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	Gate
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	come
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	Gate
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	written
O	over
O	it
O	in
O	Letters
O	of
O	Gold
O	,
O	_Blessed
O	are
O	they
O	that
O	do
O	his
O	Commandments
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	may
O	have
O	right
O	to
O	the
O	Tree
O	of
O	Life
O	,
O	and
O	may
O	enter
O	in
O	through
O	the
O	Gates
O	into
O	the
O	City_
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	saw
O	in
O	my
O	Dream
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	Shining
O	Men
O	bid
O	them
O	call
O	at
O	the
O	Gate;
O	the
O	which
O	when
O	they
O	did
O	,
O	some
O	from
O	above
O	looked
O	over
O	the
O	Gate
O	,
O	to
O	wit
O	,
O	_Enoch_
O	,
O	_Moses_
O	,
O	and
O	_Elijah_
O	,
O	_&c_
O	.
O	,
O	to
O	whom
O	it
O	was
O	said
O	,
O	These
O	Pilgrims
O	are
O	come
O	from
O	the
O	City
O	of
O	_Destruction_
O	for
O	the
O	love
O	that
O	they
O	bear
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	this
O	place;
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	Pilgrims
O	gave
O	in
O	unto
O	them
O	each
O	man
O	his
O	Certificate
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	received
O	in
O	the
O	beginning;
O	those
O	therefore
O	were
O	carried
O	in
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	who
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	read
O	them
O	,
O	said
O	,
O	Where
O	are
O	the
O	men
O	?
O	To
O	whom
O	it
O	was
O	answered
O	,
O	They
O	are
O	standing
O	without
O	the
O	Gate
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	then
O	commanded
O	to
O	open
O	the
O	Gate
O	,
O	_That
O	the
O	righteous
O	nation_
O	,
O	saith
O	he
O	,
O	_that
O	keepeth
O	Truth
O	may
O	enter
O	in_
O	.
O	Now
O	I
O	saw
O	in
O	my
O	Dream
O	that
O	these
O	two
O	men
O	went
O	in
O	at
O	the
O	Gate
O	:
O	and
O	lo
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	entered
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	transfigured
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	Raiment
O	put
O	on
O	that
O	shone
O	like
O	Gold
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	also
O	that
O	met
O	them
O	with
O	Harps
O	and
O	Crowns
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	them
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	the
O	Harps
O	to
O	praise
O	withal
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Crowns
O	in
O	token
O	of
O	honour
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	heard
O	in
O	my
O	Dream
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	Bells
O	in
O	the
O	City
O	rang
O	again
O	for
O	joy
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	said
O	unto
O	them
O	,
O	_Enter
O	ye
O	into
O	the
O	joy
O	of
O	your
O	Lord_
O	.
O	I
O	also
O	heard
O	the
O	men
O	themselves
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	sang
O	with
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	_Blessing
O	,
O	Honour
O	,
O	Glory
O	,
O	and
O	Power
O	,
O	be
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	sitteth
O	upon
O	the
O	Throne
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	the
O	Lamb
O	for
O	ever
O	and
O	ever_
O	.
O	Now
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	Gates
O	were
O	opened
O	to
O	let
O	in
O	the
O	men
O	,
O	I
O	looked
O	in
O	after
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	behold
O	,
O	the
O	City
O	shone
O	like
O	the
O	Sun;
O	the
O	Streets
O	also
O	were
O	paved
O	with
O	Gold
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	them
O	walked
O	many
O	men
O	,
O	with
O	Crowns
O	on
O	their
O	heads
O	,
O	Palms
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	golden
O	Harps
O	to
O	sing
O	praises
O	withal
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	also
O	of
O	them
O	that
O	had
O	wings
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	answered
O	one
O	another
O	without
O	intermission
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	_Holy
O	,
O	Holy
O	,
O	Holy
O	,
O	is
O	the
O	Lord_
O	.
O	And
O	after
O	that
O	they
O	shut
O	up
O	the
O	Gates
O	.
O	Which
O	when
O	I
O	had
O	seen
O	,
O	I
O	wished
O	myself
O	among
O	them
O	.
O	Now
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	gazing
O	upon
O	all
O	these
O	things
O	,
O	I
O	turned
O	my
O	head
O	to
O	look
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	Ignorance
O	come
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	River-side;
O	but
O	he
O	soon
O	got
O	over
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	without
O	half
O	that
O	difficulty
O	which
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	men
O	met
O	with
O	.
O	For
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	then
O	in
O	that
O	place
O	one
O	Vain-hope
O	a
O	Ferry-man
O	,
O	that
O	with
O	his
O	Boat
O	helped
O	him
O	over;
O	so
O	he
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	other
O	I
O	saw
O	,
O	did
O	ascend
O	the
O	Hill
O	to
O	come
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	Gate
O	,
O	only
O	he
O	came
O	alone;
O	neither
O	did
O	any
O	man
O	meet
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	least
O	encouragement
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	was
O	come
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	Gate
O	,
O	he
O	looked
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	writing
O	that
O	was
O	above
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	began
O	to
O	knock
O	,
O	supposing
O	that
O	entrance
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	quickly
O	administered
O	to
O	him;
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	asked
O	by
O	the
O	men
O	that
O	looked
O	over
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	Gate
O	,
O	Whence
O	came
O	you
O	?
O	and
O	what
O	would
O	you
O	have
O	?
O	He
O	answered
O	,
O	I
O	have
O	eat
O	and
O	drank
O	in
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	has
O	taught
O	in
O	our
O	Streets
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	asked
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	Certificate
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	go
O	in
O	and
O	shew
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	fumbled
O	in
O	his
O	bosom
O	for
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	none
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	they
O	,
O	Have
O	you
O	none
O	?
O	But
O	the
O	man
O	answered
O	never
O	a
O	word
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	told
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	come
O	down
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	commanded
O	the
O	two
O	Shining
O	Ones
O	that
O	conducted
O	_Christian_
O	and
O	_Hopeful_
O	to
O	the
O	City
O	,
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	and
O	take
O	_Ignorance_
O	,
O	and
O	bind
O	him
O	hand
O	and
O	foot
O	,
O	and
O	have
O	him
O	away
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	took
O	him
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	him
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	that
O	I
O	saw
O	in
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	Hill
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	him
O	in
O	there
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	saw
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	way
O	to
O	Hell
O	even
O	from
O	the
O	Gates
O	of
O	Heaven
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	from
O	the
O	City
O	of
O	_Destruction_
O	.
O	So
O	I
O	awoke
O	,
O	and
O	behold
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	Dream
O	.
