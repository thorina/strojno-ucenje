O	When
O	the
O	day
O	appointed
O	was
O	come
O	,
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	armed
O	his
O	sons
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	armed
O	him
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	rode
O	through
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	their
O	house
O	,
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	with
O	a
O	company
O	of
O	dames
O	met
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	Don
O	Arias
O	,
O	weeping
O	,
O	Remember
O	now
O	how
O	my
O	father
O	,
O	King
O	Don
O	Ferrando
O	,
O	left
O	me
O	to
O	your
O	care
O	,
O	and
O	you
O	swore
O	between
O	his
O	hands
O	that
O	you
O	would
O	never
O	forsake
O	me
O	;
O	and
O	lo
O	!
O	now
O	you
O	are
O	forsaking
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	beseech
O	you
O	remain
O	with
O	me
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	took
O	hold
O	on
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	let
O	him
O	go
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	him
O	be
O	disarmed
O	.
O	Then
O	came
O	many
O	knights
O	around
O	him
O	,
O	to
O	demand
O	arms
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	request
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	do
O	battle
O	in
O	his
O	stead
O	;
O	nevertheless
O	he
O	would
O	give
O	them
O	to
O	none
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	called
O	for
O	his
O	son
O	Pedro
O	Arias
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	right
O	brave
O	knight
O	,
O	though
O	but
O	of
O	green
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	Don
O	Arias
O	armed
O	him
O	completely
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	instructed
O	him
O	how
O	to
O	demean
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	his
O	blessing
O	with
O	his
O	right
O	hand
O	.
O	Then
O	went
O	they
O	into
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	where
O	Don
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	was
O	awaiting
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	Pedro
O	Arias
O	entered
O	the
O	lists
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	judges
O	placed
O	them
O	each
O	in
O	his
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	divided
O	the
O	sun
O	between
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	leaving
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	lists
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	turned
O	their
O	horses
O	one
O	against
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	full
O	bravely
O	,
O	like
O	good
O	knights
O	.
O	Five
O	times
O	they
O	encountered
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	sixth
O	encounter
O	their
O	spears
O	brake
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	laid
O	hand
O	upon
O	their
O	swords
O	,
O	and
O	dealt
O	each
O	other
O	such
O	heavy
O	blows
O	that
O	the
O	helmets
O	failed
O	;
O	and
O	in
O	this
O	manner
O	the
O	combat
O	between
O	them
O	continued
O	till
O	noon
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Don
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	lasted
O	so
O	long
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	yet
O	conquer
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	called
O	to
O	mind
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	there
O	fighting
O	to
O	revenge
O	his
O	lord
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	slain
O	by
O	a
O	foul
O	treason
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	collected
O	together
O	all
O	his
O	strength
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	sword
O	and
O	smote
O	Pedro
O	Arias
O	upon
O	the
O	helmet
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	cut
O	through
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	through
O	the
O	hood
O	of
O	the
O	mail
O	also
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	wound
O	in
O	the
O	head
O	.
O	And
O	Pedro
O	Arias
O	with
O	the
O	agony
O	of
O	death
O	bowed
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	neck
O	of
O	the
O	horse
O	;
O	yet
O	with
O	all
O	this
O	he
O	neither
O	lost
O	his
O	stirrups
O	,
O	nor
O	let
O	go
O	his
O	sword
O	.
O	And
O	Don
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	seeing
O	him
O	thus
O	,
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	dead
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	strike
O	him
O	again
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	called
O	aloud
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	Don
O	Arias
O	,
O	send
O	me
O	another
O	son
O	,
O	for
O	this
O	one
O	will
O	never
O	fulfil
O	your
O	bidding
O	.
O	When
O	Pedro
O	Arias
O	heard
O	this
O	,
O	grievously
O	wounded
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	fiercely
O	against
O	him
O	:
O	and
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	sword
O	in
O	both
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	to
O	give
O	it
O	him
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	blow
O	missed
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	horse
O	immediately
O	ran
O	away
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	wound
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	received
O	.
O	And
O	Don
O	Diego
O	had
O	no
O	reins
O	wherewith
O	to
O	stop
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	perceiving
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	else
O	be
O	carried
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	lists
O	,
O	he
O	threw
O	himself
O	off
O	.
O	And
O	while
O	he
O	did
O	this
O	,
O	Pedro
O	Arias
O	fell
O	down
O	dead
O	,
O	just
O	without
O	the
O	mark
O	.
O	And
O	Don
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	laid
O	hand
O	on
O	the
O	bar
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Praised
O	be
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	God
O	,
O	one
O	is
O	conquered
O	.
O	And
O	incontinently
O	the
O	judges
O	came
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	tent
O	and
O	disarmed
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	three
O	sops
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	drank
O	of
O	the
O	wine
O	and
O	rested
O	awhile
O	.
O	And
O	afterwards
O	they
O	gave
O	him
O	other
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	horse
O	that
O	was
O	a
O	right
O	good
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	lists
O	.
O	Then
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	called
O	for
O	another
O	son
O	,
O	whose
O	name
O	was
O	Diego
O	Arias
O	,
O	gave
O	him
O	his
O	blessing
O	and
O	went
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	lists
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	judges
O	took
O	the
O	reins
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	champions
O	and
O	led
O	them
O	each
O	to
O	his
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	and
O	left
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	lists
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	ran
O	against
O	each
O	other
O	with
O	such
O	force
O	that
O	both
O	shields
O	failed
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	another
O	career
O	they
O	brake
O	their
O	lances
O	.
O	Then
O	laid
O	they
O	hand
O	on
O	their
O	good
O	swords
O	,
O	and
O	delivered
O	such
O	blows
O	that
O	their
O	helmets
O	were
O	cut
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sleeves
O	of
O	the
O	mail
O	.
O	And
O	at
O	length
O	Diego
O	Arias
O	received
O	such
O	a
O	blow
O	near
O	the
O	heart
O	that
O	he
O	fell
O	dead
O	.
O	And
O	Don
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	bar
O	and
O	laid
O	hold
O	on
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	out
O	to
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	,
O	Send
O	me
O	another
O	son
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	have
O	conquered
O	two
O	,
O	thanks
O	be
O	to
O	God
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	judges
O	came
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	the
O	dead
O	knight
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	lists
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	alight
O	and
O	cast
O	him
O	out
O	.
O	Don
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	did
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	directed
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	went
O	and
O	laid
O	hand
O	upon
O	the
O	bar
O	again
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	the
O	judges
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	tent
O	,
O	and
O	disarmed
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	the
O	three
O	sops
O	and
O	the
O	wine
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	done
O	before
O	.
O	Then
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	,
O	in
O	great
O	rage
O	called
O	for
O	his
O	son
O	Rodrigo
O	Arias
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	knight
O	,
O	right
O	hardy
O	and
O	valiant
O	,
O	the
O	elder
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	brethren
O	.
O	And
O	Don
O	Arias
O	said
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	Son
O	,
O	go
O	now
O	and
O	do
O	battle
O	with
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	,
O	to
O	save
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	your
O	lady
O	,
O	and
O	yourself
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Council
O	of
O	Zamora
O	;
O	and
O	if
O	you
O	do
O	this
O	,
O	in
O	happy
O	hour
O	were
O	you
O	born
O	.
O	Then
O	Rodrigo
O	Arias
O	kissed
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	answered
O	,
O	Father
O	,
O	I
O	thank
O	you
O	much
O	for
O	what
O	you
O	have
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	be
O	sure
O	that
O	I
O	will
O	save
O	them
O	,
O	or
O	take
O	my
O	death
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	mounted
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	father
O	gave
O	him
O	his
O	blessing
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	lists
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	judges
O	took
O	his
O	reins
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	in
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	judges
O	were
O	gone
O	out
O	,
O	they
O	twain
O	ran
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	Don
O	Diego
O	missed
O	his
O	blow
O	,
O	but
O	Rodrigo
O	Arias
O	,
O	did
O	not
O	miss
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	gave
O	him
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	stroke
O	with
O	the
O	lance
O	that
O	it
O	pierced
O	through
O	the
O	shield
O	,
O	and
O	broke
O	the
O	saddle-bow
O	behind
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	him
O	lose
O	his
O	stirrups
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	embraced
O	the
O	neck
O	of
O	his
O	horse
O	.
O	But
O	albeit
O	that
O	Don
O	Diego
O	was
O	sorely
O	bested
O	with
O	that
O	stroke
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	heart
O	presently
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	bravely
O	against
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	dealt
O	him
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	blow
O	that
O	he
O	broke
O	the
O	lance
O	in
O	him
O	;
O	for
O	it
O	went
O	through
O	the
O	shield
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	other
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	lance
O	remained
O	in
O	his
O	flesh
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	they
O	laid
O	hand
O	to
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	each
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	great
O	blows
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	wounds
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	Rodrigo
O	Arias
O	gave
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	wound
O	to
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	cut
O	his
O	left
O	arm
O	through
O	to
O	the
O	bone
O	.
O	And
O	Don
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	felt
O	himself
O	so
O	sorely
O	wounded
O	,
O	went
O	against
O	Rodrigo
O	Arias
O	and
O	delivered
O	him
O	a
O	blow
O	upon
O	the
O	head
O	which
O	cut
O	through
O	the
O	helmet
O	and
O	the
O	hood
O	of
O	the
O	mail
O	,
O	and
O	entered
O	into
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	When
O	Rodrigo
O	Arias
O	felt
O	himself
O	wounded
O	to
O	death
O	,
O	he
O	let
O	go
O	the
O	reins
O	and
O	took
O	his
O	sword
O	in
O	both
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	blow
O	to
O	the
O	horse
O	of
O	Don
O	Diego
O	that
O	the
O	horse
O	ran
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	lists
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	Don
O	Diego
O	out
O	also
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	died
O	.
O	And
O	Rodrigo
O	Arias
O	fell
O	dead
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	following
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	Don
O	Diego
O	Ordonez
O	would
O	have
O	returned
O	into
O	the
O	field
O	to
O	do
O	battle
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	judges
O	would
O	not
O	permit
O	this
O	,
O	neither
O	did
O	they
O	think
O	good
O	to
O	decide
O	whether
O	they
O	of
O	Zamora
O	were
O	overcome
O	in
O	this
O	third
O	duel
O	or
O	not
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	this
O	manner
O	the
O	thing
O	was
O	left
O	undecided
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	though
O	no
O	sentence
O	was
O	given
O	,
O	there
O	remained
O	no
O	infamy
O	upon
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	Zamora
O	.
O	Better
O	had
O	it
O	been
O	for
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	up
O	Vellido
O	to
O	the
O	Castillians
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	have
O	died
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	a
O	traitor
O	;
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	then
O	have
O	lost
O	these
O	three
O	sons
O	,
O	who
O	died
O	like
O	good
O	men
O	,
O	in
O	their
O	duty
O	.
O	Now
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	Vellido
O	the
O	history
O	sayeth
O	not
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	believed
O	,
O	that
O	because
O	the
O	impeachment
O	was
O	not
O	made
O	within
O	three
O	days
O	,
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	thrust
O	him
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	as
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	had
O	requested
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	fled
O	into
O	other
O	lands
O	,
O	peradventure
O	among
O	the
O	Moors
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	the
O	Infanta
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	wrote
O	letters
O	secretly
O	and
O	sent
O	messengers
O	with
O	them
O	to
O	Toledo
O	to
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	,
O	telling
O	him
O	that
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	his
O	brother
O	was
O	dead
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	left
O	no
O	heir
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	come
O	as
O	speedily
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	kingdoms
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	arrived
O	at
O	Zamora
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	counsel
O	with
O	his
O	sister
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Infanta
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	right
O	prudent
O	lady
O	and
O	a
O	wise
O	,
O	sent
O	letters
O	throughout
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	that
O	a
O	cortes
O	should
O	assemble
O	and
O	receive
O	him
O	for
O	their
O	lord
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	Leonese
O	and
O	the
O	Gallegos
O	knew
O	that
O	their
O	lord
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	was
O	come
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	full
O	joyful
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	Zamora
O	and
O	received
O	him
O	for
O	their
O	lord
O	and
O	king
O	.
O	And
O	afterwards
O	the
O	Castillians
O	arrived
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	of
O	Navarre
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	also
O	received
O	him
O	for
O	their
O	lord
O	and
O	king
O	,
O	but
O	upon
O	this
O	condition
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	swear
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	taken
O	counsel
O	for
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	his
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	.
O	Howbeit
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	come
O	forward
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	oath
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	kissed
O	his
O	hands
O	in
O	homage
O	,
O	all
O	,
O	save
O	only
O	Ruydiez
O	,
O	my
O	Cid
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	Cid
O	did
O	not
O	do
O	homage
O	and
O	kiss
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	Since
O	now
O	ye
O	have
O	all
O	received
O	me
O	for
O	your
O	lord
O	,
O	and
O	given
O	me
O	authority
O	over
O	ye
O	,
O	I
O	would
O	know
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	Ruydiez
O	why
O	he
O	will
O	not
O	kiss
O	my
O	hand
O	and
O	acknowledge
O	me
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Cid
O	arose
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Sir
O	,
O	all
O	whom
O	you
O	see
O	here
O	present
O	,
O	suspect
O	that
O	by
O	your
O	counsel
O	the
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	your
O	brother
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	death
O	;
O	and
O	therefore
O	,
O	I
O	say
O	unto
O	you
O	that
O	,
O	unless
O	you
O	clear
O	yourself
O	of
O	this
O	,
O	as
O	by
O	right
O	you
O	should
O	do
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	never
O	kiss
O	your
O	hand
O	,
O	nor
O	receive
O	you
O	for
O	my
O	lord
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	Cid
O	,
O	what
O	you
O	say
O	pleases
O	me
O	well
O	;
O	and
O	here
O	I
O	swear
O	to
O	God
O	and
O	to
O	St
O	.
O	Mary
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	never
O	slew
O	him
O	,
O	nor
O	took
O	counsel
O	for
O	his
O	death
O	,
O	neither
O	did
O	it
O	please
O	me
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	my
O	kingdom
O	from
O	me
O	.
O	And
O	I
O	beseech
O	ye
O	therefore
O	all
O	,
O	as
O	friends
O	and
O	true
O	vassals
O	,
O	that
O	ye
O	tell
O	me
O	how
O	I
O	may
O	clear
O	myself
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	chiefs
O	who
O	were
O	present
O	said
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	and
O	twelve
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	who
O	came
O	with
O	him
O	from
O	Toledo
O	,
O	should
O	make
O	this
O	oath
O	in
O	the
O	church
O	at
O	St
O	.
O	Gadea
O	at
O	Burgos
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	so
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	cleared
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	company
O	took
O	horse
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	Burgos
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	day
O	appointed
O	for
O	the
O	oath
O	was
O	come
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	went
O	to
O	hear
O	mass
O	in
O	the
O	church
O	of
O	Gadea
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	came
O	forward
O	upon
O	a
O	high
O	stage
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	might
O	see
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	Cid
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	oath
O	;
O	and
O	my
O	Cid
O	took
O	the
O	book
O	of
O	the
O	Gospels
O	and
O	opened
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	laid
O	it
O	upon
O	the
O	altar
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	laid
O	his
O	hands
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Cid
O	said
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	,
O	you
O	come
O	here
O	to
O	swear
O	concerning
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	your
O	brother
O	,
O	that
O	you
O	neither
O	slew
O	him
O	nor
O	took
O	counsel
O	for
O	his
O	death
O	;
O	say
O	now
O	you
O	and
O	these
O	hidalgos
O	,
O	if
O	ye
O	swear
O	this
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	the
O	hidalgos
O	answered
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Yea
O	,
O	we
O	swear
O	it
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Cid
O	said
O	,
O	If
O	ye
O	knew
O	of
O	this
O	thing
O	,
O	or
O	gave
O	command
O	that
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	done
O	,
O	may
O	you
O	die
O	even
O	such
O	a
O	death
O	as
O	your
O	brother
O	the
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	of
O	a
O	villain
O	whom
O	you
O	trust
O	;
O	one
O	who
O	is
O	not
O	a
O	hidalgo
O	,
O	from
O	another
O	land
O	,
O	not
O	a
O	Castillian
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	the
O	knights
O	who
O	were
O	with
O	him
O	said
O	Amen
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	colour
O	changed
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	Cid
O	repeated
O	the
O	oath
O	unto
O	him
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	the
O	twelve
O	knights
O	said
O	Amen
O	to
O	it
O	in
O	like
O	manner
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	like
O	manner
O	the
O	countenance
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	changed
O	again
O	.
O	And
O	my
O	Cid
O	repeated
O	the
O	oath
O	unto
O	him
O	a
O	third
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	the
O	knights
O	said
O	Amen
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	wrath
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	exceeding
O	great
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	Ruydiez
O	,
O	why
O	dost
O	thou
O	thus
O	press
O	me
O	,
O	man
O	?
O	To-day
O	thou
O	swearest
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	to-morrow
O	thou
O	wilt
O	kiss
O	my
O	hand
O	.
O	And
O	from
O	that
O	day
O	forward
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	love
O	towards
O	my
O	Cid
O	in
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	was
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	crowned
O	King
O	of
O	Castille
O	,
O	and
O	Leon
O	,
O	and
O	Galicia
O	,
O	and
O	Portugal
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	called
O	himself
O	King
O	and
O	Emperor
O	of
O	all
O	Spain
O	,
O	even
O	as
O	his
O	father
O	had
O	done
O	before
O	him
O	.
