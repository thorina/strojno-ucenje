O	A

O	marquis

O	He
O	was
O	young
O	,
O	strong
O	,
O	and
O	handsome
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	several
O	faults
O	for
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	blame
O	;
O	he
O	took
O	no
O	thought
O	for
O	the
O	future
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	his
O	youth
O	liked
O	to
O	do
O	nothing
O	but
O	hawk
O	and
O	hunt
O	all
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	all
O	other
O	cares
O	go
O	unheeded
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	thing
O	which
O	seemed
O	to
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	Saluzzo
O	to
O	be
O	worst
O	of
O	all
O	was
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	marry
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	his
O	subjects
O	came
O	to

O	in
O	a
O	body
O	to
O	urge

O	to
O	take
O	a

O	he
O	told
O	no
O	one
O	who

O	to

O	.
O	Near
O	the
O	great
O	palace
O	of
O	the
O	marquis
O	there
O	stood
O	a
O	small
O	village
O	,
O	where
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	poor
O	folk
O	dwelt
O	.
O	Among
O	them
O	lived
O	a
O	man
O	called
O	Janicola
O	,
O	the
O	poorest
O	of
O	them
O	all
O	.
O	Janicola
O	had
O	a
O	daughter
O	named
O	Griselda
O	,
O	the
O	fairest
O	maiden
O	under
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	best
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	been
O	brought
O	up
O	simply
O	,
O	knowing
O	more
O	of
O	labour
O	than
O	of
O	ease
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	worked
O	hard
O	to
O	keep
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	old
O	age
O	in
O	comfort
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	long
O	she
O	sat
O	spinning
O	and
O	watching
O	sheep
O	in
O	the
O	fields
O	;
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	home
O	to
O	their
O	poor
O	cottage
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	she
O	would
O	bring
O	with
O	her
O	a
O	few
O	herbs
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	would
O	cut
O	up
O	and
O	cook
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	herself
O	a
O	meal
O	before
O	she
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	rest
O	on
O	her
O	hard
O	bed
O	;
O	and
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	a
O	moment
O	idle
O	till
O	she
O	was
O	asleep
O	.
O	Walter
O	had
O	often
O	seen
O	this
O	maiden
O	as
O	he
O	rode
O	out
O	a-hunting
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	pleasure
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	her
O	loveliness
O	and
O	her
O	gentle
O	,
O	kindly
O	life
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	heart
O	he
O	had
O	vowed
O	to
O	marry
O	none
O	other
O	than
O	her
O	,
O	if
O	ever
O	he
O	did
O	marry
O	.
O	The
O	day
O	appointed
O	for
O	the
O	wedding
O	came
O	,
O	but
O	still
O	no
O	one
O	knew
O	who
O	would
O	be
O	the
O	bride
O	.
O	Men
O	wondered
O	and
O	murmured
O	and
O	gossiped
O	secretly
O	,
O	But
O	the
O	marquis
O	had
O	ordered
O	all
O	kinds
O	of
O	costly
O	gems
O	,
O	brooches
O	,
O	and
O	rings
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	ready
O	,
O	and
O	rich
O	dresses
O	were
O	prepared
O	for
O	the
O	bride
O	(

O	his
O	service
O	about

O	s
O	stature
O	,
O	so
O	that

O	knew
O	how
O	to

O	the
O	cloth
O	and
O	silks
O	and
O	fine
O	linen
O	for

O	wedding
O	garments

O	Yet
O	still
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	very
O	hour
O	for
O	the
O	marriage
O	arrived
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	but
O	Walter
O	knew
O	who
O	would
O	be
O	the
O	bride
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	palace
O	was
O	put
O	in
O	array
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	board
O	set
O	for
O	the
O	feast
O	.

O	and
O	attended
O	by
O	all
O	his
O	lords
O	and
O	ladies
O	.
O	They
O	set
O	out
O	in
O	all
O	their
O	pomp
O	and
O	magnificence
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	joyful
O	music
O	,
O	and
O	rode

O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	village

O	``
O	So
O	they
O	went
O	apart
O	to
O	confer
O	privately
O	about
O	it
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	the
O	courtiers
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	yard
O	of
O	the
O	mean
O	little
O	cottage
O	,
O	marvelling
O	at
O	the
O	care

O	kindness
O	which
O	Griselda
O	showed
O	in
O	tending
O	her
O	old
O	father
O	.
O	But
O	their
O	wonder
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	great
O	as
O	hers
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	had
O	never
O	before
O	seen
O	so
O	splendid
O	a
O	sight
O	as
O	these
O	richly-dressed
O	lords
O	and
O	ladies
O	,
O	nor
O	received
O	such
O	noble
O	guests
O	;
O	and
O	she
O	stood
O	in
O	their
O	presence
O	pale
O	with
O	astonishment
O	.
O	But
O	her
O	father
O	and
O	the
O	marquis
O	called
O	her
O	.
O	``
O	Griselda

O	Then

O	poorly

O	rags
O	which
O	Griselda
O	wore
O	,
O	still
O	,
O	at
O	his

O	They
O	combed
O	her
O	hair

O	set
O	a
O	crown
O	on
O	her
O	head

O	so
O	that

O	;
O	and
O	in
O	this
O	rich
O	array
O	she
O	seemed
O	more
O	lovely
O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	The
O	marquis
O	put
O	a
O	ring
O	on

O	where
O	they

O	.
O	Thus
O	Griselda

O	married
O	to
O	Walter
O	.
O	By
O	her
O	marriage
O	her
O	gentleness
O	and
O	beauty
O	seemed
O	only
O	to
O	increase
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	folk
O	who
O	had
O	known
O	her
O	many
O	a
O	year
O	would
O	not

O	that
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	same
O	Griselda
O	,
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	Janicola
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	mean
O	hut
O	in
O	a
O	poor
O	village
O	.
O	Every
O	one

O	loved
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	fame
O	spread
O	all
O	over
O	Walter
O	'
O	s
O	realm
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	young
O	and
O	old
O	used
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	Saluzzo
O	merely
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	.
O	Thus
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	Walter
O	and
O	Griselda
O	lived
O	together
O	in
O	great
O	happiness
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	Griselda
O	had
O	a
O	daughter
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	liked
O	a
O	son
O	better
O	,
O	Walter
O	and
O	Griselda
O	were
O	very
O	glad
O	and
O	joyful
O	at
O	the
O	event
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	were
O	all
O	their
O	subjects
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	child
O	was
O	still
O	quite
O	young
O	a
O	strange
O	desire
O	came
O	upon
O	the
O	marquis
O	to
O	try
O	his
O	wife
O	'
O	s
O	goodness
O	and
O	obedience
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	had
O	tested
O	it
O	in
O	many
O	ways
O	times
O	enough
O	already
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	discovered
O	no
O	faults
O	in
O	her
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	cruel
O	to
O	put
O	her
O	to
O	such
O	pains
O	for
O	no
O	need
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	rid
O	himself
O	of
O	the
O	wish
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	set
O	about
O	carrying
O	it
O	out
O	.
O	One
O	night
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	lay
O	alone
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	to

O	with
O	a
O	stern
O	,
O	grave
O	face
O	.
O	``
O	Griselda
O	,

O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``

O	shameful
O	to
O	be
O	subjects

O	one
O	of
O	such
O	mean
O	birth
O	;

O	babe
O	with
O	all
O	care
O	and
O	secrecy
O	to
O	his
O	sister
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	Countess
O	of
O	Bologna
O	,
O	and
O	tell
O	her
O	the
O	whole
O	story
O	,
O	asking
O	her
O	to
O	bring
O	the
O	child
O	up
O	honourably
O	,
O	without
O	saying
O	whose
O	it
O	was
O	.
O	But
O	Walter
O	'
O	s
O	mind
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	softened
O	from
O	his
O	wicked
O	intent
O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	eagerly
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	would
O	make
O	his
O	wife
O	show
O	in
O	her
O	face
O	any
O	signs
O	of
O	grief
O	or
O	anger
O	.
O	But
O	Griselda
O	did
O	not
O	seem
O	to
O	be
O	changed
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	always
O	gentle
O	and
O	kind
O	,
O	and
O	still
O	as
O	glad
O	,
O	as
O	humble
O	,
O	as
O	ready
O	to
O	obey
O	him
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	ever
O	been
O	;
O	and
O	not
O	a
O	word
O	either
O	in
O	jest
O	or
O	in
O	earnest
O	did
O	she
O	say
O	of
O	her
O	little
O	daughter
O	.
O	Thus
O	there
O	passed
O	four
O	years
O	or
O	so
O	more
O	,
O	until
O	Griselda
O	had
O	a
O	little
O	son
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	Walter
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	subjects
O	were
O	overjoyed
O	,
O	giving
O	thanks
O	to
O	God
O	because
O	now
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	heir
O	to
O	the
O	kingdom
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	boy
O	was
O	some
O	two
O	years
O	old
O	Walter
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	again
O	became
O	cruel
O	and
O	perverse
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	made
O	up
O	his
O	mind
O	to
O	test
O	his
O	wife
O	'
O	s
O	patience
O	once
O	more
O	.
O	Her
O	gentle
O	obedience
O	seemed
O	only
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	wish
O	to
O	torment
O	her
O	still
O	further
O	.
O	``
O	Wife
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	have
O	told
O	you
O	that
O	my
O	subjects
O	did
O	not
O	like
O	our
O	marriage
O	,
O	but
O	now
O	,
O	since
O	our
O	son
O	was
O	born
O	,
O	their
O	murmuring
O	has
O	been
O	worse
O	than
O	ever
O	before
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	greatly
O	afraid
O	of
O	what
O	they
O	may
O	do
O	.
O	They
O	speak
O	openly
O	of
O	the
O	matter
O	.
O	'
O	When
O	Walter
O	dies
O	,
O	'
O	they
O	say
O	,
O	'
O	we
O	shall
O	be

O	not
O	but
O	hear
O	their
O	words
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	fear
O	them
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	live
O	in
O	peace
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	resolved
O	to
O	serve
O	our
O	son
O	as
O	I
O	did
O	his
O	sister
O	before
O	;
O	and
O	I
O	warn
O	you
O	now
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	you
O	may
O	have
O	patience
O	to
O	bear
O	his
O	loss
O	when
O	the
O	time
O	comes
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	I
O	have
O	always
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	always
O	will
O	say
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	Griselda
O	,
O	``
O	that
O	I
O	will
O	do
O	nothing
O	but
O	what
O	you
O	wish
O	.
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	grieved
O	that
O	both
O	my
O	son
O	and
O	my
O	daughter
O	are
O	slain
O	,
O	if
O	it

O	.
O	You
O	are
O	my

O	,
O	and
O	can
O	do
O	with
O	me
O	as
O	you

O	When
O	I
O	left
O	my
O	home
O	and
O	my
O	poor
O	rags
O	I
O	left
O	there
O	my
O	freedom
O	also
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	your
O	clothing
O	,
O	and
O	became
O	obedient
O	to
O	your
O	commands
O	.
O	Therefore
O	do
O	as

O	will

O	if

O	I
O	would
O	gladly
O	die
O	.
O	``
O	When
O	Walter
O	heard
O	these
O	words
O	he
O	cast
O	down
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	wondering
O	at
O	the
O	patience
O	of
O	his
O	wife
O	.
O	Yet
O	he
O	went
O	away
O	from
O	her
O	with
O	a
O	stern
O	and
O	cruel
O	face
O	,
O	though
O	his
O	heart
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	joy
O	at
O	her
O	goodness
O	.
O	The
O	fierce
O	officer
O	came
O	to
O	her
O	again
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	,
O	and
O	seized
O	her
O	son
O	.
O	Again
O	she
O	prayed
O	him
O	to
O	give
O	the
O	babe
O	proper
O	burial
O	,
O	and
O	kissed
O	its
O	little
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	blessed
O	it
O	,
O	without
O	a
O	word
O	of
O	complaint
O	or
O	bitterness
O	.
O	Again
O	the
O	child
O	was
O	taken
O	to
O	Bologna
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	brought
O	up
O	there
O	.
O	The
O	marquis
O	watched
O	for
O	signs
O	of
O	grief
O	in
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	but
O	found
O	none
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	more
O	he
O	regarded
O	her
O	the
O	more
O	he
O	wondered
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	rumours
O	crept
O	about
O	among
O	the
O	people
O	that
O	Walter
O	had
O	murdered
O	his
O	two
O	children
O	secretly
O	because
O	their
O	mother
O	was
O	nothing
O	but
O	a
O	poor
O	village
O	maiden
O	of
O	low
O	birth
O	.
O	The
O	report
O	spread
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	marquis
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	hated
O	by
O	the
O	subjects
O	who
O	had
O	formerly
O	loved
O	him
O	so
O	well
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	change
O	his
O	purpose
O	.
O	He
O	sent
O	a
O	secret
O	message
O	to
O	Rome
O	,
O	asking
O	that
O	a
O	decree
O	from
O	the
O	Pope
O	should
O	be
O	forged
O	which
O	would
O	allow
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	good
O	of
O	his
O	subjects
O	to
O	put
O	away
O	his
O	wife
O	Griselda
O	and
O	wed
O	another
O	.
O	In
O	due
O	time
O	the
O	false
O	decree
O	arrived
O	.
O	It
O	said
O	that
O	,
O	since
O	great
O	strife
O	had
O	arisen
O	between
O	the
O	Marquis
O	of
O	Saluzzo
O	and
O	his
O	people
O	because
O	he
O	had
O	married
O	a
O	poor
O	wife
O	of
O	humble
O	birth
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	put
O	away
O	this
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	be
O	free
O	to
O	marry
O	another
O	if
O	he
O	pleased
O	.
O	The
O	common
O	people
O	believed
O	these
O	lying
O	orders
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	news
O	came
O	to
O	Griselda
O	her
O	heart
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	woe
O	.
O	Yet
O	she
O	resolved
O	to
O	endure
O	patiently
O	whatever
O	was
O	done
O	by
O	the
O	husband
O	whom
O	she
O	loved
O	so
O	dearly
O	.
O	Walter
O	now
O	sent
O	a
O	letter
O	secretly
O	to
O	Bologna
O	to
O	the
O	count
O	who
O	had
O	married
O	his
O	sister
O	asking
O	him
O	to
O	bring
O	to
O	Saluzzo
O	Griselda
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	and
O	daughter
O	,
O	openly
O	and
O	in
O	state
O	,
O	but
O	without
O	saying
O	to
O	any
O	man
O	whose
O	children
O	they
O	really
O	were
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	proclaim
O	that
O	the
O	young
O	maiden
O	was
O	soon
O	to
O	be
O	married
O	to
O	the
O	Marquis
O	of
O	Saluzzo
O	.
O	The
O	count
O	did
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	asked
O	.
O	He
O	set
O	out
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	train
O	of
O	lords
O	and
O	ladies
O	in
O	rich
O	array
O	,
O	bringing
O	the
O	girl
O	with
O	her
O	brother
O	riding
O	beside
O	her
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	decked
O	in
O	bright
O	jewelled
O	robes
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	for
O	marriage
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boy
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	was
O	nobly
O	and
O	fittingly
O	dressed
O	.
O	When
O	all
O	this
O	plan
O	was
O	being
O	carried
O	out
O	,
O	the
O	marquis
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	his
O	wicked
O	design
O	,
O	put
O	yet
O	another
O	trial
O	upon
O	Griselda
O	'
O	s
O	patience
O	by
O	saying
O	to
O	her
O	boisterously
O	,
O	before
O	all
O	his
O	court
O	:
O	``
O	Griselda

O	,
O	and
O	went
O	forth
O	clad
O	only
O	in
O	her
O	smock
O	,
O	barefoot
O	and
O	bareheaded
O	.
O	The
O	people
O	followed
O	her
O	weeping
O	and
O	railing
O	at
O	her
O	hard
O	lot
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	made
O	no
O	complaint
O	,
O	and
O	spoke
O	never
O	a
O	word
O	.
O	Her
O	father
O	met
O	her
O	at
O	his
O	door
O	,
O	lamenting
O	the
O	day
O	that
O	he
O	saw
O	her
O	cast
O	off
O	thus
O	.
O	So
O	Griselda
O	went
O	home
O	and
O	lived
O	for
O	a
O	while
O	with
O	Janicola
O	as
O	though
O	she
O	had
O	never
O	left
O	him
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	the
O	count
O	drew
O	near
O	from
O	Bologna
O	with
O	Griselda
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	and
O	daughter
O	.
O	The
O	news
O	spread
O	among
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	one
O	talked
O	of
O	the
O	grand
O	wife
O	who
O	was
O	coming
O	to
O	be
O	married
O	to
O	the
O	marquis
O	with
O	such
O	splendour
O	as
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	seen
O	in
O	all
O	West
O	Lombardy
O	.
O	When
O	Walter
O	heard
O	of
O	their
O	approach
O	he
O	sent
O	for
O	Griselda
O	.
O	She
O	came
O	humbly
O	and
O	reverently
O	,
O	and
O	knelt
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	``
O	Griselda
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	desire
O	that

O	``
O	she
O	answered
O	.
O	With
O	that
O	she
O	turned
O	to
O	her
O	task
O	of
O	setting
O	the
O	house
O	in
O	order
O	for
O	the
O	guests
O	of
O	the

O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	the
O	Count
O	of
O	Bologna
O	arrived
O	with
O	Griselda
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	and
O	daughter
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	people
O	ran
O	out
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	fine
O	sight
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	younger

O	even
O	fairer

O	Griselda
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fickle
O	people
O	,
O	ever
O	changeable
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	weathercock
O	,
O	were
O	full
O	of
O	praises
O	for
O	the
O	choice
O	of
O	the
O	marquis
O	.
O	Griselda
O	had
O	made
O	everything
O	ready
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	courtyard
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	folk
O	to
O	greet
O	the
O	marquis
O	and
O	his
O	bride
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	procession
O	reached
O	the
O	banquet-hall
O	,
O	she
O	took
O	no
O	shame
O	in

O	torn
O	old
O	clothes
O	,
O	but
O	went
O	busily
O	about

O	with

O	Suddenly

O	till
O	every

O	Then
O	the

O	into

O	dressed

O	set
O	a
O	golden

O	brought
O	her
O	back

O	Full

O	Walter
O	and

O	together
O	in
