O	This
O	is
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	Alexander
O	Gordon
O	of
O	Earlstoun
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	province
O	of
O	Galloway
O	,
O	Scotland
O	.
O	Earlstoun
O	is
O	a
O	bonny
O	place
O	,
O	sitting
O	above
O	the
O	waterside
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	Ken
O	.
O	The
O	gray
O	tower
O	stands
O	ruinous
O	and
O	empty
O	to-day
O	,
O	but
O	once
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	pleasant
O	dwelling
O	,
O	and
O	dear
O	to
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	had
O	dwelt
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	foreign
O	lands
O	or
O	hiding
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	wild
O	wide
O	moors
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	time
O	when
O	Charles
O	II
O	wished
O	to
O	compel
O	the
O	most
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	Scotland
O	to
O	change
O	their
O	religion
O	and
O	worship
O	as
O	he
O	bade
O	them
O	.
O	Some
O	obeyed
O	the
O	king;
O	but
O	most
O	hated
O	the
O	new
O	order
O	of
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	cleaved
O	in
O	their
O	hearts
O	to
O	their
O	old
O	ways
O	and
O	to
O	their
O	old
O	ministers
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	put
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	churches
O	and
O	homes
O	at
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	Many
O	even
O	set
O	themselves
O	to
O	resist
O	the
O	king
O	in
O	open
O	battle
O	rather
O	than
O	obey
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	matter
O	of
O	their
O	consciences
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	only
O	in
O	this
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	rebellious
O	,
O	for
O	many
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	been
O	active
O	in
O	bringing
O	him
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	throne
O	.
O	Among
O	those
O	who
O	thus
O	went
O	out
O	to
O	fight
O	were
O	William
O	Gordon
O	and
O	his
O	son
O	Alexander
O	.
O	William
O	Gordon
O	was
O	a
O	grave
O	,
O	courteous
O	,
O	and
O	venerable
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	estate
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	best
O	in
O	all
O	Galloway
O	.
O	Like
O	nearly
O	all
O	the
O	lairds
O	in
O	the
O	south
O	and
O	west
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	strongly
O	of
O	the
O	Presbyterian
O	party
O	,
O	and
O	resolved
O	to
O	give
O	up
O	life
O	and
O	lands
O	rather
O	than
O	his
O	principles
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	doubtless
O	ill-advised
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	councillors
O	did
O	not
O	take
O	the
O	kindly
O	or
O	the
O	wise
O	way
O	with
O	the
O	people
O	at
O	this
O	time;
O	for
O	a
O	host
O	of
O	wild
O	Highlanders
O	had
O	been
O	turned
O	into
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	who
O	plundered
O	in
O	cotter
O	'
O	s
O	and
O	laird
O	'
O	s
O	hall
O	without
O	much
O	distinction
O	between
O	those
O	that
O	stood
O	for
O	the
O	Covenants
O	and
O	those
O	that
O	held
O	for
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	So
O	in
O	the
O	year
O	1679
O	Galloway
O	was
O	very
O	hot
O	and
O	angry
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	were
O	ready
O	to
O	fight
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	forces
O	wherever
O	they
O	could
O	be
O	met
O	with
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	hearing
O	news
O	of
O	a
O	revolt
O	in
O	the
O	west
O	,
O	William
O	Gordon
O	rode
O	away
O	,
O	with
O	many
O	good
O	riders
O	at
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	to
O	take
O	his
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	ranks
O	of
O	the
O	rebels
O	.
O	His
O	son
O	Alexander
O	,
O	whose
O	story
O	we
O	are
O	to
O	tell
O	,
O	was
O	there
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	Covenanting
O	army
O	had
O	gained
O	one
O	success
O	in
O	Drumclog
O	,
O	which
O	gave
O	them
O	some
O	hope
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	Bothwell
O	Bridge
O	their
O	forces
O	were
O	utterly
O	broken
O	,
O	largely
O	through
O	their
O	own
O	quarrels
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Monmouth
O	and
O	the
O	disciplined
O	troops
O	of
O	the
O	government
O	.
O	Alexander
O	Gordon
O	had
O	to
O	flee
O	from
O	the
O	field
O	of
O	Bothwell
O	.
O	He
O	came
O	home
O	to
O	Earlstoun
O	alone
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	father
O	had
O	been
O	met
O	about
O	six
O	miles
O	from
O	the
O	battle-field
O	by
O	a
O	troop
O	of
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	refused
O	to
O	surrender
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	slain
O	there
O	and
O	buried
O	in
O	the
O	parish
O	of
O	Glassford
O	.
O	Immediately
O	after
O	Bothwell
O	,
O	Alexander
O	Gordon
O	was
O	compelled
O	to
O	go
O	into
O	hiding
O	with
O	a
O	price
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	Unlike
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	ready-witted
O	,
O	free
O	with
O	his
O	tongue
O	,
O	even
O	boisterous
O	upon
O	occasion
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	very
O	great
O	bodily
O	strength
O	.
O	These
O	qualities
O	stood
O	him
O	in
O	good
O	stead
O	during
O	the
O	long
O	period
O	of
O	his
O	wandering
O	and
O	when
O	lying
O	in
O	concealment
O	among
O	the
O	hills
O	.
O	The
O	day
O	after

O	,

O	His
O	faithful

O	Alexander

O	a
