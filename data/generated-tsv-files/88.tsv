O	Benedict
O	Bellefontaine
O	,
O	Evangeline
O	'
O	s
O	father
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	wealthiest
O	farmer
O	in
O	the
O	neighborhood
O	.
O	His
O	goodly
O	acres
O	were
O	somewhat
O	apart
O	from
O	the
O	little
O	village
O	of
O	Grand-Prae
O	,
O	but
O	near
O	enough
O	for
O	Evangeline
O	not
O	to
O	feel
O	lonely
O	.
O	The
O	people
O	of
O	Grand-Prae
O	were
O	simple
O	and
O	kindly
O	,
O	and
O	dwelt
O	together
O	in
O	the
O	love
O	of
O	God
O	and
O	man
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	neither
O	locks
O	to
O	their
O	doors
O	nor
O	bars
O	to
O	their
O	windows;
O	visitors
O	were
O	always
O	welcome
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	gave
O	of
O	their
O	best
O	to
O	whoever
O	might
O	come
O	.
O	The
O	house
O	of
O	Benedict
O	Bellefontaine
O	,
O	firmly
O	builded
O	with
O	rafters
O	of
O	oak
O	,
O	was
O	on
O	a
O	hill
O	commanding
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	The
O	barns
O	stood
O	toward
O	the
O	north
O	,
O	shielding
O	the
O	house
O	from
O	storms
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	bursting
O	with
O	hay
O	and
O	corn
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	so
O	numerous
O	as
O	to
O	form
O	almost
O	a
O	village
O	by
O	themselves
O	.
O	The
O	horses
O	,
O	the
O	cattle
O	,
O	the
O	sheep
O	and
O	the
O	poultry
O	were
O	all
O	well-fed
O	and
O	well
O	cared
O	for
O	.
O	At
O	Benedict
O	Bellefontaine
O	'
O	s
O	there
O	was
O	comfort
O	and
O	plenty
O	.
O	The
O	men
O	and
O	the
O	maids
O	never
O	grumbled
O	.
O	All
O	men
O	were
O	equal
O	,
O	all
O	were
O	brothers
O	and
O	sisters
O	.
O	In
O	Acadia
O	the
O	richest
O	man
O	was
O	poor
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	poorest
O	lived
O	in
O	abundance
O	.
O	Evangeline
O	was
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	housekeeper;
O	her
O	mother
O	was
O	dead
O	.
O	Benedict
O	was
O	seventy
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	hale
O	and
O	hearty
O	and
O	managed
O	his
O	prosperous
O	farm
O	himself
O	.
O	His
O	hair
O	was
O	as
O	white
O	as
O	snow
O	and
O	his
O	face
O	was
O	as
O	brown
O	as
O	oak
O	leaves
O	.
O	Evangeline
O	'
O	s
O	hair
O	was
O	dark
O	brown
O	and
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	black
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	the
O	loveliest
O	girl
O	in
O	Grand-Prae
O	and
O	many
O	a
O	lad
O	was
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	her
O	.
O	Among
O	all
O	Evangeline
O	'
O	s
O	suitors
O	only
O	one
O	was
O	welcome
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	Gabriel
O	Lajeunesse
O	,
O	son
O	of
O	Basil
O	the
O	blacksmith
O	.
O	Gabriel
O	and
O	Evangeline
O	had
O	grown
O	up
O	together
O	like
O	brother
O	and
O	sister
O	.
O	The
O	priest
O	had
O	taught
O	them
O	their
O	letters
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	selfsame
O	book
O	,
O	and
O	together
O	they
O	had
O	learned
O	their
O	hymns
O	and
O	their
O	verses
O	.
O	Together
O	they
O	had
O	watched
O	Basil
O	at
O	his
O	forge
O	and
O	with
O	wondering
O	eyes
O	had
O	seen
O	him
O	handle
O	the
O	hoof
O	of
O	a
O	horse
O	as
O	easily
O	as
O	a
O	plaything
O	,
O	taking
O	it
O	into
O	his
O	lap
O	and
O	nailing
O	on
O	the
O	shoe
O	.
O	Together
O	they
O	had
O	ridden
O	on
O	sledges
O	in
O	winter
O	and
O	hunted
O	birds
O	'
O	nests
O	in
O	summer
O	,
O	seeking
O	eagerly
O	that
O	marvellous
O	stone
O	which
O	the
O	swallow
O	is
O	said
O	to
O	bring
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	to
O	restore
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	its
O	fledglings
O	.
O	Lucky
O	is
O	he
O	who
O	finds
O	that
O	stone
O	!
O	And
O	now
O	they
O	were
O	man
O	and
O	woman
O	.
O	Benedict
O	and
O	Basil
O	were
O	old
O	friends
O	and
O	they
O	desired
O	the
O	marriage
O	of
O	the
O	children
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	ready
O	to
O	marry
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	had
O	built
O	them
O	a
O	house
O	and
O	a
O	barn
O	.
O	The
O	barn
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	hay
O	and
O	the
O	house
O	was
O	stored
O	with
O	food
O	enough
O	to
O	last
O	a
O	year
O	.
O	One
O	beautiful
O	evening
O	in
O	Indian
O	summer
O	Evangeline
O	and
O	Gabriel
O	were
O	betrothed
O	.
O	Benedict
O	was
O	sitting
O	in-doors
O	by
O	the
O	wide-mouthed
O	fireplace
O	singing
O	fragments
O	of
O	songs
O	such
O	as
O	his
O	fathers
O	before
O	him
O	had
O	sung
O	in
O	their
O	orchards
O	in
O	sunny
O	France
O	,
O	and
O	Evangeline
O	was
O	close
O	beside
O	him
O	at
O	her
O	wheel
O	industriously
O	spinning
O	flax
O	for
O	her

O	.
O	Up-stairs

O	linen
O	which
O	Evangeline

O	Every

O	of
O	it

O	been
O	spun
O	and
O	woven

O	the

O	ships
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	confusion
O	families
O	were
O	separated
O	.
O	Mothers
O	were
O	torn
O	from
O	their
O	children
O	and
O	wives
O	from
O	their
O	husbands
O	.
O	Basil
O	was
O	put
O	on
O	one
O	ship
O	and
O	Gabriel
O	on
O	another
O	,
O	while
O	Evangeline
O	stood
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	with
O	her
O	father
O	.
O	When
O	night
O	came
O	not
O	half
O	the
O	work
O	of
O	embarking
O	was
O	done
O	.
O	The
O	people
O	on
O	shore
O	camped
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	their
O	household
O	goods
O	and
O	their
O	wagons
O	.
O	None
O	could
O	escape
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	soldiers
O	were
O	watching
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	priest
O	moved
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	moonlight
O	trying
O	to
O	comfort
O	the
O	people
O	.
O	He
O	laid
O	his
O	hand
O	on
O	Evangeline
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	and
O	blessed
O	her
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	columns
O	of
O	shining
O	smoke
O	arose
O	and
O	flashes
O	of
O	flame
O	were
O	seen
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	of
O	Grand-Prae
O	.
O	The
O	village
O	was
O	on
O	fire
O	.
O	The
O	people
O	felt
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	never
O	return
O	to
O	their
O	homes
O	and
O	their
O	hearts
O	were
O	swelled
O	with
O	anguish
O	.
O	Evangeline
O	and
O	the
O	priest
O	turned
O	to
O	Benedict
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	motionless
O	,
O	his
O	soul
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	Heaven
O	.
O	There
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	burning
O	village
O	for
O	a
O	torch
O	,
O	they
O	buried
O	the
O	farmer
O	of
O	Grand-Prae
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	priest
O	repeated
O	the
O	burial
O	service
O	to
O	the
O	accompaniment
O	of
O	the
O	roaring
O	sea
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	the
O	work
O	of
O	embarking
O	was
O	finished
O	and
O	toward
O	night
O	the
O	ships
O	sailed
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	harbor
O	leaving
O	the
O	dead
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	and
O	the
O	village
O	in
O	ruins
O	.
O	The
O	Acadians
O	were
O	scattered
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	land
O	from
O	north
O	to
O	south
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	bleak
O	shores
O	of
O	the
O	ocean
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	Mississippi
O	River
O	.
O	Evangeline
O	wandered
O	from
O	place
O	to
O	place
O	looking
O	for
O	Gabriel
O	Lajeunesse
O	,
O	and
O	Gabriel
O	sought
O	Evangeline
O	as
O	earnestly
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	they
O	heard
O	of
O	one
O	another
O	but
O	through
O	long
O	years
O	they
O	never
O	met
O	.
O	Evangeline
O	was
O	growing
O	old
O	and
O	her
O	hair
O	showed
O	faint
O	streaks
O	of
O	gray
O	when
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	made
O	her
O	home
O	in
O	Philadelphia
O	.
O	She
O	became
O	a
O	Sister
O	of
O	Mercy
O	and
O	by
O	day
O	and
O	by
O	night
O	ministered
O	to
O	the
O	sick
O	and
O	the
O	dying
O	.
O	A
O	pestilence
O	fell
O	on
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	carrying
O	away
O	rich
O	and
O	poor
O	alike
O	.
O	Evangeline
O	lovingly
O	tended
O	the
O	very
O	poorest
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	day
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	almshouse
O	on
O	her
O	errand
O	of
O	mercy
O	.
O	One
O	morning
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	pallet
O	on
O	which
O	lay
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	thin
O	and
O	gray
O	.
O	As
O	she
O	looked
O	at
O	him
O	his
O	face
O	seemed
O	to
O	assume
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	earlier
O	manhood
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	cry
O	she
O	fell
O	on
O	her
O	knees
O	.
O	""""
O	Gabriel
O	,
O	my

O	The
O	old
O	man
O	heard
O	the

O	to
