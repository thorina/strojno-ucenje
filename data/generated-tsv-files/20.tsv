O	yet
O	we
O	may
O	come
O	on
O	her
O	unawares
O	in
O	the
O	din
O	of
O	a
O	noisy
O	city
O	.
O	She
O	will
O	answer
O	us
O	where
O	the
O	waves
O	are
O	lashing
O	themselves
O	against
O	the
O	rugged

O	hot
O	in
O	the

O	to

O	blue
O	water
O	of

O	.
O	At
O	nightfall
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	lonely
O	northern
O	moors
O	,
O	she
O	mimics
O	the
O	cry
O	of
O	a
O	wailing
O	bird
O	that
O	calls
O	for
O	its
O	mate
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	is
O	she
O	who
O	prolongs
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	great
O	organ
O	in
O	a
O	vast
O	cathedral
O	,

O	.
O	In
O	the
O	desolate
O	Australian
O	bush
O	she
O	makes
O	the
O	crash

O	a
O	dead
O	gum

O	the

O	death
O	,
O	by

O	calls
O	for
O	help
O	.
O	Through
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	in
O	old
O	country-houses
O	,
O	she
O	sports
O	at

O	new
O	life
O	to
O	sad
O	old
O	tales
O	of
O	the
O	restless
O	dead
O	who
O	restlessly
O	walk
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	echoes
O	the
O	children
O	'
O	s
O	voices
O	as
O	they
O	play
O	by

O	They
O	may

O	when

O	gone
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	when

O	left
O	all

O	they
O	begin

O	dread
O	her
O	mockery
O	.
O	Yet
O	the

O	who
O	sought
O	for
O	love
O	and
O	failed
O	to
O	gain
O	what

O	sought
O	must
O	surely

O	their

O	When

O	was
O	young
O	,
O	and
O	nymphs
O	and
O	fauns

O	dwelt
O	in

O	lovely
O	and
O	more
O	gay
O	than
O	she
O	whose

O	Diana
O	would
O	smile
O	on

O	followed

O	she
O	met
O	in
O	the
O	leafy
O	pathways
O	of
O	the
O	dim
O	,
O	green
O	woods
O	,
O	would
O	pass
O	on
O	smiling
O	at
O	the
O	remembrance
O	of
O	her
O	merry
O	chatter
O	and

O	tricksy

O	.
O	It
O	was
O	an
O	evil
O	day
O	for

O	crossed
O	the

O	until
O	the

O	fled
O	to
O	safety
O	.
O	Hera

O	furious

O	when

O	out
O	that

O	The

O	and
O	there
O	,
O	serenely
O	peeping
O	Through
O	tendril
O	wreaths
O	fantastically
O	creeping
O	.
O	``
O	As
O	he
O	stooped
O	down
O	to
O	drink
O	,
O	a
O	face
O	looked
O	at
O	his
O	through
O	the
O	crystal
O	clear
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	beautiful
O	eyes

O	His
O	surprise

O	joy
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	felt
O	sure
O	must
O	be
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	creature
O	on
O	earth
O	,
O	was
O	evidently
O	shared
O	by
O	the
O	nymph
O	of
O	the
O	pool
O	,
O	who
O	gazed
O	fearlessly
O	up
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	Round
O	her
O	head
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	nimbus
O	of
O	curls
O	than
O	which
O	that
O	of
O	Adonis
O	--
O	nay
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	sun-god
O	himself
O	,
O	was
O	not
O	more
O	perfect
O	,
O	while
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	like
O	the
O	brown
O	pools
O	of
O	water
O	in
O	a
O	rippling
O	mountain
O	stream
O	,
O	flecked
O	with
O	sunshine
O	,
O	yet
O	with
O	depths
O	untold
O	.
O	When
O	Narcissus
O	smiled
O	at
O	her
O	in
O	rapture
O	,
O	her
O	red
O	lips
O	also
O	parted
O	in
O	a
O	smile
O	.
O	He
O	stretched
O	out
O	his
O	arms
O	towards
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	arms
O	were
O	stretched
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	Almost
O	trembling
O	in
O	his
O	delight
O	,
O	he
O	slowly
O	stooped
O	to
O	kiss
O	her
O	.
O	Nearer
O	she
O	drew
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	nearer
O	still
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	his
O	mouth
O	would
O	have
O	given
O	itself
O	to
O	that
O	other
O	mouth
O	that
O	was
O	formed
O	like
O	the
O	bow
O	of
O	Eros
O	--
O	a
O	thing
O	to
O	slay
O	hearts
O	--
O	only
O	the
O	chilly
O	water
O	of
O	the
O	pool
O	touched
O	his
O	lips
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	thing
O	of
O	his
O	delight
O	vanished
O	away
O	.
O	In
O	passionate
O	disappointment
O	Narcissus
O	waited
O	for
O	her
O	to
O	return
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	the
O	pool
O	grew
O	still
O	,
O	once
O	more
O	he
O	saw
O	her
O	exquisite
O	face
O	gazing
O	wistfully
O	up
O	into
O	his
O	.
O	Passionately
O	he
O	pled
O	with
O	the
O	beautiful
O	creature
O	--
O	spoke
O	of
O	his
O	love
O	--
O	besought
O	her
O	to
O	have
O	pity
O	on
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	although
O	the
O	face
O	in
O	the
O	pool
O	reflected
O	his
O	every
O	look
O	of
O	adoration
O	and
O	of
O	longing
O	,
O	time
O	and
O	again
O	he
O	vainly
O	tried
O	to
O	clasp
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	what
O	was
O	but
O	the
O	mirrored
O	likeness
O	of
O	himself
O	.
O	In
O	full
O	measure
O	had
O	the
O	avenging
O	goddess
O	meted
O	out
O	to
O	Narcissus
O	the
O	restless
O	longing
O	of
O	unsatisfied
O	love
O	.
O	By
O	day
O	and
O	by
O	night
O	he
O	haunted
O	the
O	forest
O	pool
O	,
O	and
O	ere
O	long
O	the
O	face
O	that
O	looked
O	back
O	at
O	his
O	was
O	pale
O	as
O	a
O	lily
O	in
O	the
O	dawn
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	moonbeams
O	came
O	straying
O	down
O	through
O	the
O	branches
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	night
O	was
O	still
O	,
O	they
O	found
O	him
O	kneeling
O	by
O	the
O	pool
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	white
O	face
O	that
O	the
O	water
O	mirrored
O	had
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	things
O	of
O	the
O	woods
O	to
O	which
O	a
O	huntsman
O	has
O	given
O	a
O	mortal
O	wound
O	.
O	Mortally
O	wounded
O	he
O	truly
O	was
O	,
O	slain
O	,
O	like
O	many
O	another
O	since
O	his
O	day
O	,
O	by
O	a
O	hopeless
O	love
O	for
O	what
O	was
O	in
O	truth
O	but
O	an
O	image
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	an
O	image
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	creation
O	.
O	Even
O	when
O	his
O	shade
O	passed
O	across
O	the
O	dark
O	Stygian
O	river
O	,
O	it
O	stooped
O	over
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	that
O	it
O	might
O	try
O	to
O	catch
O	a
O	glimpse
O	of
O	the
O	beloved
O	one
O	in
O	the
O	inky
O	waters
O	.
O	Echo
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	nymphs
O	were
O	avenged
O	,
O	yet
O	when
O	they
O	looked
O	on
O	the
O	beautiful
O	dead
O	Narcissus
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	sorrow
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	filled
O	the
O	air
O	with
O	their
O	lamentations
O	,
O	most
O	piteously
O	did
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	Echo
O	repeat
O	each
O	mournful
O	cry
O	.
O	Even
O	the
O	gods
O	were
O	pitiful
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	nymphs
O	would
O	have
O	burned
O	the
O	body
O	on
O	a
O	funeral
O	pyre
O	which
O	their
O	own
O	fair
O	hands
O	had
O	built
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	they
O	sought
O	it
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	Olympians
O	had
O	turned
O	Narcissus
O	into
O	a
O	white
O	flower
O	,
O	the
O	flower
O	that
O	still
O	bears
O	his
O	name
O	and
O	keeps
O	his
O	memory
O	sweet
O	.
