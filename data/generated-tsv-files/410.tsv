O	The

O	is
O	early
O	in
O	the
O	spring
O	,
O	at
O	maple-sugar
O	time
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	sap
O	begins
O	to
O	flow
O	,
O	the
O	Maple
O	Feast
O	is
O	called
O	.
O	The
O	Indians
O	gather
O	about
O	a
O	large
O	maple
O	tree
O	.
O	A
O	fire
O	is
O	lighted
O	near
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	one
O	of
O	their
O	number
O	sprinkles
O	tobacco
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	smoke
O	rises
O	,
O	a
O	prayer
O	of
O	thanksgiving
O	is
O	made
O	to
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	,
O	for
O	causing
O	the
O	sweet
O	waters
O	of
O	the
O	maple
O	to
O	flow
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	maple
O	trees
O	are
O	thanked
O	for
O	their
O	service
O	to
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	protection
O	is
O	asked
O	for
O	the
O	trees
O	during
O	the
O	coming
O	year
O	.
O	When
O	``
O	the

O	s
O	ear

O	an
O	Indian
O	maid
O	goes
O	into
O	the
O	fields
O	and
O	scatters
O	a
O	few
O	grains
O	of
O	corn
O	,
O	asking
O	the
O	aid
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	for
O	the
O	harvest
O	.
O	The
O	Indian
O	always
O	plants
O	his
O	seed
O	with
O	the
O	growing
O	moon
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	may

O	The

O	Indian
O	who
O	has
O	been
O	very
O	ill

O	When
O	the
O	strawberry
O	ripens

O	the

O	Children

O	They
O	sing
O	their
O	praises
O	to
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit

O	dance
O	with
O	joy

O	have
O	helped
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	berries
O	beautiful
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	have
O	a
O	song
O	of
O	praise
O	and
O	dance
O	of
O	thanks
O	for
O	them
O	as

O	Without
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	,
O	the
O	strawberries
O	would
O	not

O	.
O	At
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	the
O	Harvest
O	Moon
O	comes
O	the
O	last
O	feast
O	of
O	the
O	summer
O	.
O	This
O	thanksgiving
O	feast
O	lasts
O	four
O	days
O	.
O	The
O	Indians
O	not
O	only
O	give
O	thanks
O	for
O	the
O	ripening
O	of
O	the
O	corn
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	every
O	growing
O	thing
O	.
O	Therefore
O	this
O	feast
O	is
O	longer
O	than

O	were

O	But
O	one
O	day
O	_Ona

O	wandered
O	away
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	dews
O	for

O	kernels
O	.
O	The
O	Evil

O	seized
O	_Ona

O	,
O	the

O	the

O	and
O	sent

O	In
O	the

O	did
O	not
O	always
O	live
O	in
O	one
O	place
O	as
O	they
O	do
O	now
O	.
O	They
O	sometimes
O	wandered
O	from
O	one
O	valley
O	or
O	woodland
O	to
O	another
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	sheltered
O	place
O	,
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	pure
O	running
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	plenty
O	of
O	game
O	and
O	wood
O	were
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	build
O	their
O	lodges
O	and
O	light
O	their
O	council
O	fires
O	.
O	There
O	they
O	might
O	camp
O	for
O	one
O	moon
O	,
O	or
O	for
O	many
O	moons
O	.
O	As
O	long
O	as
O	their
O	arrows
O	brought
O	game
O	on
O	the
O	hunting
O	trails
O	near
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	break
O	camp
O	.
O	But
O	if
O	game
O	grew
O	scarce
O	,
O	or
O	if
O	for
O	any
O	reason
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	like
O	the
O	camp
O	ground
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	move
O	farther
O	on
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	they
O	would
O	go
O	several
O	days
O	'
O	journey
O	,
O	before
O	they
O	found
O	a
O	camping
O	place
O	such
O	as
O	they
O	liked
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	thing
O	that
O	was
O	done
O	in
O	making
O	a
O	camp
O	was
O	to
O	secure
O	fire
O	and
O	light
O	the
O	council
O	fire
O	.
O	This
O	fire
O	was
O	always
O	kept
O	burning
O	.
O	It
O	never
O	went
O	out
O	while
O	they
O	remained
O	.
O	The
O	Indians
O	loved
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	gift
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	to
O	the
O	Red
O	Children
O	.
O	It
O	kept
O	them
O	warm
O	and
O	cooked
O	their
O	food
O	by
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	protected
O	them
O	by
O	night
O	.
O	A
O	line
O	of
O	fires
O	was
O	kept
O	burning
O	around
O	the
O	camp
O	.
O	This
O	protected
O	the
O	Red
O	Children
O	from
O	the
O	wild
O	animals
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	animals
O	fear
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	are
O	charmed
O	by
O	it
O	.
O	They
O	might
O	prowl
O	and
O	howl
O	all
O	night
O	long
O	outside
O	the
O	fire
O	ring
O	,
O	but
O	never
O	would
O	they
O	attempt
O	to
O	come
O	within
O	that
O	ring
O	.
O	There
O	the
O	Indians
O	could
O	sleep
O	in
O	peace
O	,
O	guarded
O	by
O	the
O	spirits
O	of
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	The
O	Indian
O	that
O	could
O	make
O	fire
O	first
O	became
O	a
O	chief
O	and
O	leader
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	decided
O	to
O	camp
O	at
O	a
O	certain
O	place
O	,
O	a
O	signal
O	would
O	be
O	given
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	the
O	young
O	braves
O	would
O	leap
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	which
O	one
O	first
O	could
O	bring
O	back
O	fire
O	.
O	Each
O	had
O	his
O	own
O	secret
O	way
O	of
O	making
O	it
O	.
O	Usually
O	a
O	bowstring
O	was
O	twisted
O	about
O	a
O	fire
O	stick
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	stick
O	was
O	turned
O	rapidly
O	in
O	a
O	groove
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	seconds
O	,
O	smoke
O	would
O	rise
O	from
O	the
O	sawdust
O	that
O	formed
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	little
O	fanning
O	a
O	flame
O	would
O	leap
O	forth
O	.
O	The
O	Indian
O	whose
O	brain
O	and
O	hand
O	worked
O	swiftest
O	and
O	surest
O	was
O	the
O	smartest
O	and
O	best
O	man
O	.
O	He
O	became
O	a
O	Firemaker
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	made
O	a
O	chief
O	of
O	the
O	tribe
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	do
O	something
O	that
O	the
O	rest
O	could
O	not
O	,
O	--
O	at
O	least
O	he
O	had
O	proved
O	himself
O	to
O	be
O	more
O	skillful
O	.
O	Such
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	thought
O	,
O	had
O	a
O	better
O	understanding
O	of
O	all
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	could
O	tell
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	tribe
O	what
O	ought
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	.
O	He
O	no
O	longer
O	was
O	just
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	ate
O	and
O	slept
O	,
O	walked
O	and
O	ran
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	with
O	a
O	mind
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	think
O	and
O	could
O	do
O	things
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	became
O	a
O	Firemaker
O	chief
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	helped
O	the
O	tribe
O	to
O	think
O	and
O	do
O	.
O	The
O	Iroquois
O	Red
O	Children
O	believe
O	that
O	there
O	are
O	three
O	kinds
O	of
O	men
O	:
O	those
O	that
O	use
O	the
O	body
O	only
O	;
O	those
O	that
O	use
O	body
O	and
O	mind
O	;
O	and
O	those
O	that
O	use
O	body
O	,
O	mind
O	,
O	and
O	spirit
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	sometimes
O	an
O	Indian
O	grew
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	kind
O	and
O	so
O	great
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	only
O	strike
O	the
O	fire
O	we
O	see
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	fire
O	we
O	do
O	not
O	see
O	,
O	--
O	the
O	fire
O	of
O	love
O	that
O	burns
O	in
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	people
O	.
O	When
O	an
O	Indian
O	could
O	strike
O	this
O	kind
O	of
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	warm
O	the
O	hearts
O	not
O	only
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	tribe
O	but
O	of
O	all
O	tribes
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	love
O	one
O	another
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	chief
O	,
O	a
O	Peacemaker
O	chief
O	.
O	Such
O	a
O	man
O	would
O	go
O	from
O	tribe
O	to
O	tribe
O	,
O	teaching
O	the
O	people
O	how
O	they
O	should
O	do
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	all
O	might
O	live
O	in
O	peace
O	and
O	plenty
O	,
O	like
O	brothers
O	.
O	To
O	be
O	a
O	Peacemaker
O	was
O	the
O	highest
O	seat
O	an
O	Indian
O	could
O	take
O	.
O	Few
O	Indians
O	became
O	Peacemaker
O	chiefs
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	the
O	great
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	tribe
O	.
O	Indian
O	women
O	also
O	might
O	become
O	Peacemakers
O	.
O	At
O	one
O	time
O	the
O	Iroquois
O	had
O	a
O	Peace
O	Wigwam
O	,
O	where
O	all
O	disputes
O	and
O	quarrels
O	were
O	settled
O	.
O	The
O	most
O	beautiful
O	,
O	just
O	,
O	and
O	fair-minded
O	woman
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	tribes
O	was
O	chosen
O	to
O	sit
O	in
O	this
O	wigwam
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	her
O	duty
O	to
O	tend
O	the
O	Peace
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	it
O	never
O	went
O	out
O	.
O	She
O	also
O	kept
O	a
O	pot
O	of
O	hominy
O	always
O	steaming
O	over
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	If
O	two
O	Indians
O	had
O	a
O	dispute
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	custom
O	for
O	them
O	to
O	run
O	to
O	the
O	Peacemaker
O	'
O	s
O	wigwam
O	.
O	They
O	entered
O	from
O	opposite
O	sides
O	.
O	Inside
O	the
O	wigwam
O	,
O	a
O	deerskin
O	curtain
O	separated
O	them
O	from
O	each
O	other
O	.
O	The
O	Peacemaker
O	would
O	listen
O	to
O	the
O	grievance
O	of
O	the
O	one
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	would
O	draw
O	aside
O	the
O	curtain
O	,
O	get
O	the
O	enemies
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	settle
O	the
O	dispute
O	with
O	justice
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	would
O	then
O	eat
O	of
O	the
O	hominy
O	,
O	and
O	depart
O	in
O	peace
O	,
O	--
O	no
O	longer
O	enemies
O	,
O	but
O	friends
O	.
O	No
O	nation
O	could
O	fight
O	another
O	nation
O	without
O	the
O	consent
O	of
O	the
O	Peacemaker
O	.
O	Because
O	the
O	peacewomen
O	were
O	wise
O	,
O	and
O	just
O	,
O	and
O	kind
O	,
O	and
O	taught
O	men
O	to
O	love
O	,
O	not
O	fight
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	the
O	Iroquois
O	were
O	for
O	many
O	years
O	at
O	peace
O	.
O	But
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	said
O	,
O	a
O	Peacewoman
O	proved
O	untrue
O	to
O	her
O	trust
O	.
O	She
O	thought
O	more
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	happiness
O	than
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	nation
O	.
O	This
O	woman
O	was
O	very
O	beautiful
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	loved
O	her
O	.
O	For
O	some
O	time
O	she
O	sat
O	in
O	the
O	Peace
O	Wigwam
O	,
O	and
O	tended
O	faithfully
O	the
O	Peace
O	fire
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	an
O	Oneida
O	and
O	a
O	Cayuga
O	chief
O	fell
O	to
O	quarreling
O	.
O	They
O	sought
O	the
O	Peace
O	Wigwam
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	entered
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	young
O	Peacewoman
O	tending
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	each
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	a
O	woman
O	so
O	beautiful
O	.
O	Into
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	each
O	there
O	leaped
O	the
O	desire
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	tend
O	his
O	wigwam
O	fire
O	.
O	The
O	Peacemaker
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	quarrel
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	chiefs
O	and
O	settled
O	it
O	justly
O	.
O	Then
O	each
O	tried
O	to
O	persuade
O	her
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	Peace
O	fire
O	and
O	return
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	lodge
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	Peacemaker
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	No
O	,
O	I
O	must
O	tend
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	kept
O	burning
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	chiefs
O	departed
O	with
O	heavy
O	hearts
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	Oneida
O	chief
O	could
O	not
O	forget
O	the
O	beautiful
O	woman
O	.
O	When
O	a
O	moon
O	had
O	passed
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	Peace
O	Wigwam
O	.
O	This
O	time
O	he
O	persuaded
O	the
O	Peacemaker
O	to
O	leave
O	her
O	fire
O	and
O	return
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	sit
O	at
O	his
O	wigwam
O	door
O	.
O	The
O	Peace
O	fire
O	flickered
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	.
O	The
O	Iroquois
O	again
O	went
O	on
O	the
O	warpath
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	many
O	,
O	many
O	moons
O	,
O	they
O	fought
O	and
O	suffered
O	and
O	died
O	.
