O	One
O	day
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	winter
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	snowflakes
O	fell
O	from
O	the
O	sky
O	like
O	feathers
O	,
O	a
O	queen
O	sat
O	at
O	a
O	window
O	netting
O	.
O	Her
O	netting-needle
O	was
O	of
O	black
O	ebony
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	worked
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	snow
O	glittered
O	,
O	she
O	pricked
O	her
O	finger
O	,
O	and
O	three
O	drops
O	of
O	blood
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	snow
O	.
O	The
O	red
O	spots
O	looked
O	so
O	beautiful
O	in
O	the
O	white
O	snow
O	that
O	the
O	queen
O	thought
O	to
O	herself
O	:
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	only
O	had
O	a
O	little
O	child
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	like
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	as
O	fair
O	as
O	snow
O	,
O	as
O	rosy
O	as
O	the
O	red
O	blood
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	hair
O	and
O	eyes
O	as
O	black
O	as
O	ebony
O	.
O	``
O	Very
O	soon
O	after
O	this
O	the
O	queen
O	had
O	a
O	little
O	daughter
O	who
O	was
O	very
O	fair
O	,
O	had
O	rosy
O	cheeks
O	,
O	and
O	hair
O	as
O	black
O	as
O	ebony
O	;
O	and
O	they
O	gave
O	her
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Snow-white
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	the
O	birth
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	child
O	the
O	queen
O	died
O	.
O	When
O	Snow-white
O	was
O	a
O	year
O	old
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	took
O	another
O	wife
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	very
O	handsome
O	,
O	but
O	so
O	proud
O	and
O	vain
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	endure
O	that
O	anyone
O	should
O	surpass
O	her
O	in
O	beauty
O	.
O	She
O	possessed
O	a
O	wonderful
O	mirror
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	stood
O	before
O	it
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	herself
O	she
O	would
O	say
O	:
O	``
O	Mirror
O	,
O	mirror
O	on
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	Am
O	I
O	most
O	beautiful
O	of
O	all
O	?
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	mirror
O	would
O	reply
O	:
O	``
O	Young
O	queen
O	,
O	thou
O	are
O	so
O	wondrous
O	fair
O	,
O	None
O	can
O	with
O	thee
O	at
O	all
O	compare
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	she
O	would
O	go
O	away
O	quite
O	contented
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	the
O	magic
O	mirror
O	could
O	speak
O	only
O	the
O	truth
O	.
O	Years
O	went
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	Snow-white
O	grew
O	up
O	,
O	she
O	became
O	day
O	after
O	day
O	more
O	beautiful
O	,
O	till
O	she
O	reached
O	the
O	age
O	of
O	seven
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	people
O	began
O	to
O	talk
O	about
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	say
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	more
O	lovely
O	even
O	than
O	the
O	queen
O	herself
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	proud
O	woman
O	went
O	to
O	her
O	magic
O	looking-glass
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	:
O	``
O	Mirror
O	,
O	mirror
O	on
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	Am
O	I
O	most
O	beautiful
O	of
O	all
O	?
O	``
O	But
O	the
O	mirror
O	answered
O	:
O	``
O	Queen
O	,
O	thou
O	are
O	lovely
O	still
O	to
O	see
O	,
O	But
O	Snow-white
O	will
O	be
O	A
O	thousand
O	times
O	more
O	beautiful
O	than
O	thee
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	queen
O	was
O	terrified
O	,
O	and
O	turned
O	green
O	and
O	yellow
O	with
O	jealousy
O	.
O	If
O	she
O	had
O	caught
O	sight
O	of
O	Snow-white
O	at
O	that
O	moment
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	ready
O	to
O	tear
O	her
O	heart
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	body
O	,
O	she
O	hated
O	the
O	maiden
O	so
O	fiercely
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	jealousy
O	and
O	envy
O	grew
O	every
O	day
O	stronger
O	and
O	stronger
O	in
O	her
O	heart
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	disease
O	,
O	till
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	rest
O	day
O	or
O	night
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	sent
O	for
O	a
O	hunter
O	,
O	who
O	lived
O	near
O	a
O	forest
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	``
O	Hunter
O	,
O	I
O	want
O	to
O	get
O	rid
O	of
O	that
O	child
O	.
O	Take
O	her
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	you
O	bring
O	me
O	some
O	proofs
O	that
O	she
O	is
O	dead
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	reward
O	you
O	handsomely
O	.
O	Never
O	let
O	her
O	appear
O	before
O	my
O	eyes
O	again
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	hunter
O	enticed
O	the
O	child
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	took
O	out
O	his
O	hunting-knife
O	to
O	thrust
O	into
O	Snow-white
O	'
O	s
O	innocent
O	heart
O	,
O	she
O	fell
O	on
O	her
O	knees
O	and
O	wept
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Ah
O	,
O	dear
O	hunter
O	,
O	leave
O	me
O	my
O	life
O	;
O	I
O	will
O	run
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	wild
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	,
O	never
O	come
O	home
O	any
O	more
O	.
O	``
O	She
O	looked
O	so
O	innocent
O	and
O	beautiful
O	as
O	she
O	knelt
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	hunter
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	was
O	moved
O	with
O	compassion
O	:
O	``
O	Run
O	away
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	thou
O	poor
O	child
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	cried
O	;
O	``
O	I
O	can
O	not
O	harm
O	thee
O	.
O	``
O	Snow-white
O	thanked
O	him
O	so
O	sweetly
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	.
O	``
O	She
O	will
O	be
O	devoured
O	by
O	wild
O	beasts
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	himself
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	killed
O	her
O	was
O	as
O	if
O	a
O	stone-weight
O	had
O	been
O	lifted
O	from
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	To
O	satisfy
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	inside
O	of
O	a
O	young
O	fawn
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	wicked
O	woman
O	thought
O	was
O	poor
O	little
O	Snow-white
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	overjoyed
O	to
O	think
O	she
O	was
O	dead
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	poor
O	little
O	motherless
O	child
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	found
O	herself
O	alone
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	nothing
O	but
O	trees
O	and
O	leaves
O	,
O	was
O	dreadfully
O	frightened
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	run
O	over
O	the
O	sharp
O	stones
O	and
O	through
O	the
O	thorns
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	sprang
O	out
O	before
O	her
O	,
O	they
O	did
O	her
O	no
O	harm
O	.
O	She
O	ran
O	on
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	she
O	could
O	till
O	her
O	little
O	feet
O	became
O	quite
O	sore
O	;
O	and
O	towards
O	evening
O	she
O	saw
O	,
O	to
O	her
O	great
O	joy
O	,
O	a
O	pretty
O	little
O	house
O	.
O	So
O	she
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	door
O	open
O	and
O	no
O	one
O	at
O	home
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	tiny
O	little
O	house
O	,
O	but
O	everything
O	in
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	clean
O	and
O	neat
O	and
O	elegant
O	that
O	it
O	is
O	beyond
O	description
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	stood
O	a
O	small
O	table
O	,
O	covered
O	with
O	a
O	snow-white
O	table-cloth
O	,
O	ready
O	for
O	supper
O	.
O	On
O	it
O	were
O	arranged
O	seven
O	little
O	plates
O	,
O	seven
O	little
O	spoons
O	,
O	seven
O	little
O	knives
O	and
O	forks
O	,
O	and
O	seven
O	mugs
O	.
O	By
O	the
O	wall
O	stood
O	seven
O	little
O	beds
O	,
O	near
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	covered
O	with
O	white
O	quilts
O	.
O	Poor
O	Snow-white
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	hungry
O	and
O	thirsty
O	,
O	ate
O	a
O	few
O	vegetables
O	and
O	a
O	little
O	bread
O	from
O	each
O	plate
O	,
O	and
O	drank
O	a
O	little
O	drop
O	of
O	wine
O	from
O	each
O	cup
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	like
O	to
O	take
O	all
O	she
O	wanted
O	from
O	one
O	alone
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	,
O	feeling
O	very
O	tired
O	,
O	she
O	thought
O	she
O	would
O	lie
O	down
O	and
O	rest
O	on
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	beds
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	found
O	it
O	difficult
O	to
O	choose
O	one
O	to
O	suit
O	her
O	.
O	One
O	was
O	too
O	long
O	,
O	another
O	too
O	short
O	;
O	so
O	she
O	tried
O	them
O	all
O	till
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	seventh
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	was
O	so
O	comfortable
O	that
O	she
O	laid
O	herself
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	soon
O	fast
O	asleep
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	dark
O	the
O	masters
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	came
O	home
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	seven
O	little
O	dwarfs
O	,
O	who
O	dug
O	and
O	searched
O	in
O	the
O	mountains
O	for
O	minerals
O	.
O	First
O	they
O	lighted
O	seven
O	little
O	lamps
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	room
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	light
O	they
O	saw
O	that
O	some
O	one
O	had
O	been
O	there
O	,
O	for
O	everything
O	did
O	not
O	stand
O	in
O	the
O	order
O	in
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	left
O	it
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	the
O	first
O	,
O	``
O	Who
O	has
O	been
O	sitting
O	in
O	my
O	little
O	chair
O	?
O	``
O	The
O	second
O	exclaimed
O	,
O	``
O	Who
O	has
O	been
O	eating
O	from
O	my
O	little
O	plate
O	?
O	``
O	The
O	third
O	cried
O	,
O	``
O	Some
O	one
O	has
O	taken
O	part
O	of
O	my
O	bread
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Who
O	has
O	been
O	eating
O	my
O	vegetables
O	?
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	fourth
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	the
O	fifth
O	,
O	``
O	Some
O	one
O	has
O	used
O	my
O	fork
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	sixth
O	cried
O	,
O	``
O	And
O	who
O	has
O	been
O	cutting
O	with
O	my
O	knife
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	And
O	some
O	one
O	has
O	been
O	drinking
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	cup
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	seventh
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	eldest
O	looked
O	at
O	his
O	bed
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	seeing
O	that
O	it
O	looked
O	tumbled
O	,
O	cried
O	out
O	that
O	some
O	one
O	had
O	been
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	others
O	came
O	running
O	forward
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	all
O	their
O	beds
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	condition
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	seventh
O	approached
O	his
O	bed
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	Snow-white
O	lying
O	there
O	fast
O	asleep
O	,
O	he
O	called
O	the
O	others
O	,
O	who
O	came
O	quickly
O	,
O	and
O	holding
O	their
O	lights
O	over
O	their
O	heads
O	,
O	cried
O	out
O	in
O	wonder
O	as
O	they
O	beheld
O	the
O	sleeping
O	child
O	.
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	what
O	a
O	beautiful
O	little
O	child
O	!
O	``
O	they
O	said
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	so
O	delighted
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	awaken
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	left
O	her
O	to
O	sleep
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	she
O	liked
O	in
O	the
O	little
O	bed
O	,
O	while
O	its
O	owner
O	slept
O	with
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	companions
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	the
O	night
O	passed
O	away
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	Snow-white
O	awoke
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	all
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	terribly
O	frightened
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	spoke
O	kindly
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	till
O	she
O	lost
O	all
O	fear
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	asked
O	her
O	name
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	called
O	Snow-white
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	replied
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	how
O	came
O	you
O	to
O	our
O	house
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	one
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	related
O	to
O	them
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	happened
O	;
O	how
O	her
O	stepmother
O	had
O	sent
O	her
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	with
O	the
O	hunter
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	spared
O	her
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	after
O	wandering
O	about
O	for
O	a
O	whole
O	day
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	found
O	their
O	house
O	.
O	The
O	dwarfs
O	talked
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	one
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Do
O	you
O	think
O	you
O	could
O	be
O	our
O	little
O	housekeeper
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	beds
O	,
O	cook
O	the
O	dinner
O	,
O	and
O	wash
O	and
O	sew
O	and
O	knit
O	for
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	keep
O	everything
O	neat
O	and
O	clean
O	and
O	orderly
O	?
O	If
O	you
O	can
O	,
O	then
O	you
O	shall
O	stay
O	here
O	with
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	nobody
O	shall
O	hurt
O	you
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Oh
O	yes
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	try
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Snow-white
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	let
O	her
O	stay
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	clever
O	little
O	thing
O	.
O	She
O	managed
O	very
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	kept
O	the
O	house
O	quite
O	clean
O	and
O	in
O	order
O	.
O	And
O	while
O	they
O	were
O	gone
O	to
O	the
O	mountains
O	to
O	find
O	gold
O	,
O	she
O	got
O	their
O	supper
O	ready
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	very
O	happy
O	together
O	.
O	But
O	every
O	morning
O	when
O	they
O	left
O	her
O	,
O	the
O	kind
O	little
O	dwarfs
O	warned
O	Snow-white
O	to
O	be
O	careful
O	.
O	While
O	the
O	maiden
O	was
O	alone
O	they
O	knew
O	she
O	was
O	in
O	danger
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	not
O	to
O	show
O	herself
O	,
O	for
O	her
O	stepmother
O	would
O	soon
O	find
O	out
O	where
O	she
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Whatever
O	you
O	do
O	,
O	let
O	nobody
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	while
O	we
O	are
O	gone
O	.
O	``
O	After
O	the
O	wicked
O	queen
O	had
O	proved
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	thought
O	,
O	that
O	Snow-white
O	was
O	dead
O	,
O	she
O	felt
O	quite
O	satisfied
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	one
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	now
O	likely
O	to
O	become
O	so
O	beautiful
O	as
O	herself
O	,
O	so
O	she
O	stepped
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	mirror
O	and
O	asked
O	:
O	``
O	Mirror
O	,
O	mirror
O	on
O	the

O	of
O	all
O	?
O	``
O	To
O	her
O	vexation
O	the
O	mirror
O	replied
O	:
O	``
O	Fair
O	queen
O	,
O	at
O	home
O	there
O	is
O	none
O	like
O	thee
O	,
O	But
O	over
O	the
O	mountains
O	is
O	Snow-white
O	free
O	,
O	With
O	seven
O	little
O	dwarfs
O	,
O	who
O	are
O	strange
O	to
O	see
O	;
O	A
O	thousand
O	times
O	fairer
O	than
O	thou
O	is
O	she
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	queen
O	was
O	furious
O	when
O	she
O	heard
O	this
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	the
O	mirror
O	was
O	truthful
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	hunter
O	must
O	have
O	deceived
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	Snow-white
O	still
O	lived
O	.
O	So
O	she
O	sat
O	and
O	pondered
O	over
O	these
O	facts
O	,
O	thinking
O	what
O	would
O	be
O	best
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	for
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	not
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	woman
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	her
O	jealousy
O	gave
O	her
O	no
O	peace
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	she
O	decided
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	First
O	,
O	she
O	painted
O	her
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	whitened
O	her
O	hair
O	;
O	then
O	she
O	dressed
O	herself
O	in
O	old
O	woman
O	'
O	s
O	clothes
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	so
O	disguised
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	could
O	have
O	recognised
O	her
O	.
O	Watching
O	an
O	opportunity
O	,
O	she
O	left
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	her
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	wood
O	near
O	the
O	mountains
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	seven
O	little
O	dwarfs
O	lived
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	reached
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	she
O	knocked
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	,
O	``
O	Beautiful
O	goods
O	to
O	sell
O	;
O	beautiful
O	goods
O	to
O	sell
O	.
O	``
O	Snow-white
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	heard
O	it
O	,
O	peeped
O	through
O	the
O	window
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Good-day
O	,
O	old

O	What

O	you
O	in

O	for
O	me
O	to
O	buy
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	Everything
O	that
O	is
O	pretty
O	,
O	``
O	she
O	replied
O	;

O	bracelets
O	of
O	every
O	colour
O	;
O	``
O	and
O	she
O	held
O	up
O	her
O	basket
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	lined
O	with
O	glittering
O	silk
O	.
O	``
O	I

O	Snow-white
O	;
O	``
O	she
O	will
O	not

O	``
O	So
O	she
O	unbolted
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	to
O	come
O	in
O	.
O	Oh
O	,
O	how
O	delighted
O	Snow-white
O	was
O	with
O	the
O	pretty
O	things
O	;
O	she
O	bought
O	several
O	trinkets
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	beautiful
O	silk
O	lace
O	for
O	her
O	stays
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	see
O	the
O	evil
O	eye
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	who
O	was
O	watching
O	her
O	.
O	Presently
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Child
O	,
O	come
O	here
O	;
O	I
O	will
O	show
O	you

O	lace
O	your
O	stays
O	properly
O	.
O	``
O	Snow-white
O	had
O	no
O	suspicion
O	,
O	so
O	she
O	placed
O	herself
O	before
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	lace
O	her
O	stays
O	.
O	But
O	no
O	sooner
O	was
O	the
O	lace
O	in
O	the
O	holes
O	than
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	lace
O	so
O	fast
O	and
O	pull
O	so
O	tight
O	that
O	Snow-white
O	could
O	not
O	breathe
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	fell
O	down
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	as
O	if
O	dead
O	.
O	``
O	Now
O	you

O	said
O	the
O	woman
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	fancying
O	she
O	heard
O	footsteps
O	,
O	she
O	rushed
O	away
O	as
O	quickly
O	as
O	she
O	could
O	.
O	Not
O	long
O	after
O	,
O	the
O	seven
O	dwarfs
O	came
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	terribly
O	frightened
O	to
O	see
O	dear
O	little
O	Snow-white
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	without
O	motion
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	dead
O	.
O	They
O	lifted
O	her
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	that
O	her
O	stays
O	had
O	been
O	laced
O	too
O	tight
O	Quickly
O	they
O	cut
O	the
O	stay-lace
O	in
O	two
O	,
O	till
O	Snow-white
O	began
O	to
O	breathe
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	time
O	was
O	restored
O	to
O	life
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	heard
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	,
O	they
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	That

O	comb
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	whoever
O	used
O	it

O	This

O	soon

O	returned
O	home
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	saw
O	Snow-white
O	lying
O	dead
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	they
O	knew
O	at
O	once
O	that
O	the
O	stepmother
O	had
O	been
O	there
O	again
O	;
O	but
O	on
O	seeing
O	the
O	poisoned
O	comb
O	in
O	her
O	hair
O	they
O	pulled
O	it
O	out
O	quickly
O	,
O	and
O	Snow-white
O	very
O	soon
O	came
O	to
O	herself
O	,
O	and
O	related
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	passed
O	.
O	Again
O	they
O	warned
O	her
O	not
O	to
O	let
O	anyone
O	enter
O	the
O	house
O	during
O	their
O	absence
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	no
O	account
O	to
O	open
O	the
O	door
O	;
O	but
O	Snow-white
O	was
O	not
O	clever
O	enough
O	to
O	resist
O	her
O	clever
O	wicked
O	stepmother
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	forgot
O	to
O	obey
O	.
O	The
O	wicked
O	queen
O	felt
O	sure
O	now
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	really
O	killed
O	Snow-white
O	;
O	so
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	she
O	returned
O	home
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	her
O	looking-glass
O	,
O	and
O	inquired
O	:
O	``
O	Mirror
O	,
O	mirror
O	on
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	Who
O	is
O	most
O	beautiful
O	of
O	all
O	?
O	``
O	But
O	the
O	mirror
O	replied
O	:
O	``
O	Queen
O	,
O	thou
O	art
O	the
O	fairest
O	here
O	,
O	But
O	not
O	when
O	Snow-white
O	is
O	near
O	;
O	Over
O	the
O	mountains
O	still
O	is
O	she
O	,
O	Fairer
O	a
O	thousand
O	times
O	than
O	thee
O	.
O	``
O	As
O	the
O	looking-glass
O	thus
O	replied
O	,
O	the
O	queen
O	trembled
O	and
O	quaked
O	with
O	rage
O	.
O	``
O	Snow-white
O	shall

O	cried
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	if

O	my

O	``
O	Then
O	she
O	went
O	into
O	a
O	lonely
O	forbidden
O	chamber
O	where
O	no
O	one
O	was
O	allowed
O	to
O	come
O	,
O	and
O	poisoned
O	a
O	beautiful
O	apple
O	.
O	Outwardly
O	it
O	looked
O	ripe
O	and
O	tempting
O	,
O	of
O	a
O	pale
O	green
O	with
O	rosy
O	cheeks
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	made
O	everyone
O	'
O	s
O	mouth
O	water
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	whoever
O	ate
O	even
O	a
O	small
O	piece
O	must
O	die
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	this
O	apple
O	was
O	ready
O	,
O	the
O	wicked
O	queen
O	painted
O	her
O	face
O	,
O	disguised
O	her
O	hair
O	,
O	dressed
O	herself
O	as
O	a
O	farmer
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	again
O	over
O	the
O	mountains
O	to
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	'
O	cottage
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	knocked
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	Snow-white
O	stretched
O	her
O	head
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	,
O	and
O	said

O	poisoned
O	?
O	Look
O	here
O	now
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	cut
O	the
O	apple
O	in
O	halves
O	;
O	you
O	shall
O	have
O	the

O	``
O	The
O	apple
O	was
O	so
O	cleverly
O	made
O	that
O	the
O	red
O	side
O	alone
O	was
O	poisonous
O	.
O	Snow-white
O	longed
O	so
O	much
O	for
O	the
O	beautiful
O	fruit
O	as
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	farmer
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	eat
O	one
O	half
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	any
O	longer
O	resist
O	,
O	but
O	stretched
O	out
O	her
O	hand
O	from
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	poisoned
O	half
O	.
O	But
O	no
O	sooner
O	had
O	she
O	taken
O	one
O	mouthful
O	than
O	she
O	fell
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	dead
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	wicked
O	queen
O	glanced
O	in
O	at
O	the
O	window
O	with
O	a
O	horrible
O	look
O	in
O	her
O	eye
O	,
O	and
O	laughed
O	aloud
O	as
O	she
O	exclaimed
O	:
O	``
O	White
O	as
O	snow

O	this
O	time
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	will
O	not
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	awake
O	thee
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	she
O	arrived
O	at
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	her
O	mirror
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	it
O	replied
O	:
O	``

O	beautiful
O	as
O	thou
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	had
O	her
O	envious
O	heart
O	rest
O	,
O	at
O	least
O	such
O	rest
O	as
O	a
O	heart
O	full
O	of
O	envy
O	and
O	malice
O	ever
O	can
O	have
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	dwarfs
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	came
O	home
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	,
O	found
O	poor
O	Snow-white
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	;
O	but
O	though
O	they
O	lifted
O	her
O	up
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	signs
O	of
O	breath
O	from
O	her
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	found
O	she
O	was
O	really
O	dead
O	.
O	Yet
O	they
O	tried
O	in
O	every
O	way
O	to
O	restore
O	her
O	;
O	they
O	tried
O	to
O	extract
O	the
O	poison
O	from
O	her
O	lips
O	,
O	they
O	combed
O	her
O	hair
O	,
O	and
O	washed
O	it
O	with
O	wine
O	and
O	water
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	to
O	no
O	purpose
O	:
O	the
O	dear
O	child
O	gave
O	no
O	signs
O	of
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	knew
O	she
O	was
O	dead
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	laid
O	her
O	on
O	a
O	bier
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	seven
O	dwarfs
O	seated
O	themselves
O	round
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	wept
O	and
O	mourned
O	for
O	three
O	days
O	.
O	They
O	would
O	have
O	buried
O	her
O	then
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	change
O	in
O	her
O	appearance
O	;
O	her
O	face
O	was
O	as
O	fresh
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	cheeks
O	and
O	lips
O	had
O	their
O	usual
O	colour
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	one
O	,
O	``
O	We
O	can
O	not
O	lay
O	this
O	beautiful
O	child
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	,
O	cold
O	earth
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	they
O	agreed
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	coffin
O	made
O	entirely
O	of
O	glass
O	,
O	transparent
O	all
O	over
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	watch
O	for
O	any
O	signs
O	of
O	decay
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	wrote
O	in
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	her
O	name
O	on
O	the
O	lid
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	a
O	king
O	.
O	The
O	coffin
O	was
O	placed
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	watched
O	it
O	by
O	turns
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	never
O	left
O	alone
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	birds
O	of
O	the
O	air
O	came
O	near
O	and
O	mourned
O	for
O	Snow-white
O	;
O	first
O	the
O	owl
O	,
O	then
O	the
O	raven
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	dove
O	.
O	Snow-white
O	lay
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	,
O	long
O	time
O	in
O	the
O	glass
O	coffin
O	,
O	but
O	showed
O	not
O	the
O	least
O	signs
O	of
O	decay
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	slept
O	;
O	for
O	her
O	skin
O	was
O	snow
O	white
O	,
O	her
O	cheeks
O	rosy
O	red
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	hair
O	black
O	as
O	ebony
O	.
O	It
O	happened
O	one
O	day
O	that
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	a
O	king
O	,
O	while
O	riding
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	came
O	by
O	chance
O	upon
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	'
O	house
O	and
O	asked
O	for
O	a
O	night
O	'
O	s
O	lodging
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	left
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	coffin
O	on
O	the
O	mountain-side
O	,
O	with
O	beautiful
O	Snow-white
O	lying
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	read
O	what
O	was
O	written
O	upon
O	the
O	lid
O	in
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	,
O	``
O	Let
O	me
O	have
O	this

O	whatever
O	you
O	ask
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	the
O	elder
O	dwarf
O	answered
O	,
O	``
O	We

O	``
O	But
O	the
O	prince
O	answered
O	,
O	``
O	Let

O	then
O	.
O	I
O	know
O	not

O	,
O	but
O	my
O	heart
O	is
O	drawn
O	towards
O	this

O	child
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	feel

O	If

O	.
O	``
O	As
O	he
O	thus
O	spoke
O	the
O	good
O	little
O	dwarfs
O	were
O	full
O	of
O	sympathy
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	the
O	coffin
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	prince
O	called
O	his
O	servants
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	coffin
O	was
O	placed
O	on
O	their
O	shoulders
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	carried
O	it
O	away
O	,
O	followed
O	by
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	who
O	watched
O	it
O	carefully
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	made
O	a
O	false
O	step
O	and
O	stumbled
O	.
O	This
O	shook
O	the
O	coffin
O	,
O	and
O	caused
O	the
O	poisoned
O	piece
O	of
O	apple
O	which
O	Snow-white
O	had
O	bitten
O	to
O	roll
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	mouth
O	.
O	A
O	little
O	while
O	after
O	she
O	suddenly
O	opened
O	her
O	eyes
O	,
O	lifted
O	up
O	the
O	coffin-lid
O	,
O	raised
O	herself
O	and
O	was
O	again
O	alive
O	.
O	``
O	Oh
O	!
O	where
O	am
O	I
O	?
O	``
O	she
O	cried
O	.
O	Full
O	of
O	joy
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	approached
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Dear

O	you

O	``
O	Then
O	he
O	related
O	to
O	her
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	happened
O	,
O	and
O	what
O	the
O	little

O	had
O	told
O	him
O	about

O	of
O	the
O	coffin
O	and
O	placed
O	in
O	a
O	carriage
O	to
O	travel
O	with
O	the
O	prince
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	so
O	pleased
O	with
O	his
O	son
O	'
O	s
O	choice
O	that
O	the
O	marriage
O	was
O	soon
O	after
O	celebrated
O	with
O	great
O	pomp
O	and
O	magnificence
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	the
O	stepmother
O	of
O	Snow-white
O	was
O	invited
O	,
O	among
O	other
O	guests
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	wedding-feast
O	.
O	Before
O	she
O	left
O	her
O	house
O	she
O	stood
O	in
O	all
O	her
O	rich
O	dress
O	before
O	the
O	magic
O	mirror
O	to
O	admire
O	her
O	own
O	appearance
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	saying
O	;
O	``
O	Mirror
O	,
O	mirror
O	on
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	Am
O	I
O	most
O	beautiful
O	of
O	all
O	?
O	``
O	Then
O	to
O	her
O	surprise
O	the
O	mirror
O	replied
O	:
O	``
O	Fair
O	queen
O	,
O	thou
O	art
O	the
O	fairest
O	here
O	,
O	But
O	at
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	now
O	,
O	The
O	bride
O	will
O	prove
O	a
O	thousand
O	times
O	More
O	beautiful
O	than
O	thou
O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	wicked
O	woman
O	uttered
O	a
O	curse
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	so
O	dreadfully
O	alarmed
O	that
O	she
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	she
O	declared
O	she
O	would
O	not
O	go
O	to
O	this
O	wedding
O	at
O	all
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	felt
O	it
O	impossible
O	to
O	rest
O	until
O	she
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	bride
O	,
O	so
O	she
O	determined
O	to
O	go
O	.
O	But
O	what
O	was
O	her
O	astonishment
O	and
O	vexation
O	when
O	she
O	recognised
O	in
O	the
O	young
O	bride
O	Snow-white
O	herself
O	,
O	now
O	grown
O	a
O	charming
O	young
O	woman
O	,
O	and
O	richly
O	dressed
O	in
O	royal
O	robes
O	!
O	Her
O	rage
O	and
O	terror
O	were
O	so
O	great
O	that
O	she
O	stood
O	still
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	move
O	for
O	some
O	minutes
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	ballroom
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	slippers
O	she
O	wore
O	were
O	to
O	her
O	as
O	iron
O	bands
O	full
O	of
O	coals
O	of
O	fire
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	she
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	dance
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	in
O	the
O	red
O	,
O	glowing
O	shoes
O	she
O	continued
O	to
O	dance
O	till
O	she
O	fell
O	dead
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	a
O	sad
O	example
O	of
O	envy
O	and
O	jealousy
O	.
