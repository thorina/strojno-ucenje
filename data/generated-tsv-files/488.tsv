O	A
O	famous
O	hunter
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	remote
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	North
O	had
O	a
O	fair
O	wife
O	and
O	two
O	sons
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	left
O	in
O	the
O	lodge
O	every
O	day
O	while
O	he
O	went
O	out
O	in
O	quest
O	of
O	the
O	animals
O	whose
O	flesh
O	was
O	their
O	principal
O	support
O	.
O	Game
O	was
O	very
O	abundant
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	labors
O	in
O	the
O	chase
O	were
O	well
O	rewarded
O	.
O	They
O	lived
O	a
O	long
O	distance
O	from
O	any
O	other
O	lodge
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	seldom
O	that
O	they
O	saw
O	any
O	other
O	faces
O	than
O	those
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	household
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	sons
O	were
O	still
O	too
O	young
O	to
O	follow
O	their
O	father
O	in
O	the
O	hunt
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	diverting
O	themselves
O	within
O	reach
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	While
O	thus
O	engaged
O	,
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	take
O	note
O	that
O	a
O	young
O	man
O	visited
O	the
O	lodge
O	during
O	their
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	absence
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	these
O	visits
O	were
O	constantly
O	renewed
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	the
O	elder
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	said
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	:
O	``
O	My
O	mother
O	,
O	who
O	is
O	this
O	tall
O	young
O	man
O	that
O	comes
O	here
O	so
O	often
O	during
O	our
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	absence
O	?
O	Does
O	he
O	wish
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	?
O	Shall
O	I
O	tell
O	him
O	when
O	he
O	comes
O	back
O	this
O	evening
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	Naubesah
O	,
O	you
O	little
O	fool

O	said
O	the
O	mother
O	,
O	``
O	mind
O	your
O	bow
O	and

O	to
O	enter
O	the

O	in
O	search
O	of
O	birds
O	and
O	squirrels
O	,
O	with
O	your

O	Nor

O	boys
O	obeyed

O	grew
O	older
O	and

O	noticed
O	the
O	visits
O	of
O	the
O	stranger
O	,
O	they
O	resolved
O	to
O	speak
O	again
O	to
O	their
O	mother
O	.
O	They
O	now
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	they
O	meant
O	to
O	make
O	known
O	to
O	their
O	father
O	all
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	witnessed
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	frequently
O	saw
O	this
O	young
O	man
O	passing
O	through
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	walk
O	in
O	the
O	path
O	,
O	nor
O	did
O	he
O	carry
O	any
O	thing
O	to
O	eat
O	.
O	If
O	he
O	had
O	any
O	message
O	to
O	deliver
O	at
O	their
O	lodge
O	,
O	why
O	did
O	he
O	not
O	give
O	it
O	to
O	their
O	father
O	?
O	for
O	they
O	had
O	observed
O	that
O	messages
O	were
O	always
O	addressed
O	to
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	to

O	.
O	When
O	her
O	sons
O	spoke
O	thus
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	the
O	mother
O	was
O	greatly
O	vexed
O	.
O	``

O	at

O	to

O	Accordingly
O	one
O	day
O	,

O	were
O	out
O	in
O	the

O	,

O	.
O	The

O	grew
O	dark
O	.

O	was
O	still
O	for
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	and
O	when

O	he
O	looked
O	up
O	--
O	``

O	The

O	left

O	at
O	a
O	slow
O	pace
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	remained
O	sporting
O	away
O	their
O	time
O	till
O	the
O	hour
O	for
O	their
O	return
O	had
O	come
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	lodge
O	the
O	mother
O	was
O	not
O	there
O	.
O	They
O	dared
O	not
O	to
O	ask
O	their

O	had
O	gone
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	that
O	day
O	forth
O	her
O	name
O	was
O	never

O	again
O	in
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	In
O	course
O	of
O	time
O	the
O	two
O	boys
O	had
O	grown
O	to
O	be
O	men
O	,

O	although
O	the

O	never
O	more
O	seen
O	in

O	lodge
O	,

O	ever
O	,
O	near
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	Changed
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	same
O	,
O	with
O	ghastly
O	looks
O	and
O	arms
O	that
O	were
O	withered
O	,
O	she
O	appeared
O	to
O	her
O	sons
O	as
O	they
O	returned
O	from
O	the
O	hunt
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	twilight
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	close
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	.
O	At
O	night
O	she
O	darkly
O	unlatched
O	the
O	lodge-door
O	and
O	glided
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	bent
O	over
O	them
O	as
O	they
O	sought
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	Oftenest
O	it
O	was
O	her
O	bare
O	brow
O	,
O	white
O	,
O	and
O	bony
O	,
O	and
O	bodyless
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	saw
O	floating
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	a
O	mock
O	of
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	wild
O	paths
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	or
O	in
O	the
O	midnight
O	darkness
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	a
O	terror
O	to
O	all
O	their
O	lives
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	made
O	every
O	spot
O	where
O	they
O	had
O	seen
O	her
O	,
O	hideous
O	to
O	the
O	living
O	eye
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	after
O	being
O	long
O	buffeted
O	and
O	beset
O	,
O	they
O	at
O	last
O	resolved
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	their
O	father
O	,
O	now
O	stricken
O	in
O	years
O	,
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	They
O	began
O	a
O	journey
O	toward
O	the
O	South
O	.
O	After
O	traveling
O	many
O	days
O	along
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	lake
O	,
O	they
O	passed
O	around
O	a
O	craggy
O	bluff
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	scene
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	rough
O	fall
O	of
O	waters
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	river
O	issuing
O	forth
O	from
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	come
O	in
O	sight
O	of
O	this
O	fall
O	of
O	water
O	,
O	than
O	they
O	heard
O	a
O	rolling
O	sound
O	behind
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	back
O	,
O	they
O	beheld
O	the
O	skull
O	of
O	a
O	woman
O	rolling
O	along
O	the
O	beach
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	pursuing
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	came
O	on
O	with
O	great
O	speed
O	;
O	when
O	,
O	behold
O	,
O	from
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	woods
O	hard
O	by
O	,
O	appeared
O	a
O	headless
O	body
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	for
O	the
O	beach
O	with
O	the
O	utmost
O	dispatch
O	.
O	The
O	skull
O	too
O	advanced
O	toward
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	looked
O	again
O	,
O	lo
O	!
O	they
O	had
O	united
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	making
O	all
O	haste
O	to
O	come
O	up
O	with
O	the
O	hunter
O	and
O	his
O	two
O	sons
O	.
O	They
O	now
O	might
O	well
O	be
O	in
O	extreme
O	fear
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	knew
O	not
O	how
O	to
O	escape
O	her
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	moment
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	looked
O	out
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	stately
O	crane
O	sitting
O	on
O	a
O	rock
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	rapids
O	.
O	They
O	called
O	out
O	to
O	the
O	bird
O	,
O	``
O	See
O	,

O	may
O	escape
O	her
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	crane
O	so
O	addressed
O	was
O	of
O	extraordinary
O	size
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	arrived
O	at
O	a
O	great
O	old
O	age
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	might
O	be
O	expected
O	,
O	he
O	sat
O	,
O	when
O	first
O	descried
O	by
O	the
O	two
O	sons
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	state
O	of
O	profound
O	thought

O	long
O	experience
O	of
O	life
O	there
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	violent
O	eddies
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	heard
O	himself
O	appealed
O	to
O	,
O	the
O	crane
O	stretched
O	forth
O	his
O	neck
O	with
O	great
O	deliberation
O	,
O	and
O	lifting
O	himself
O	slowly
O	by
O	his
O	wings
O	,
O	he
O	flew
O	across
O	to
O	their
O	assistance
O	.
O	``
O	Be
O	careful

O	said
O	the
O	old
O	crane
O	,

O	paid
O	strict
O	heed
O	to

O	safely
O	landed
O	on

O	shore

O	carried
O	the

O	then
O	took
O	his
