O	certainly
O	come
O	against
O	the
O	boat
O	and
O	sink
O	it
O	.
O	Besides
O	,
O	how
O	could
O	one
O	land
O	on
O	the
O	opposite
O	bank
O	among
O	willows
O	which
O	would
O	scuttle
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	flood
O	of
O	unknown
O	extent
O	?
O	The
O	leader
O	concluded
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	operation
O	was
O	physically
O	impossible
O	.
O	In
O	vain
O	did
O	the
O	emperor
O	tempt
O	them
O	with
O	an
O	offer
O	of
O	6
O	,
O	000
O	francs
O	per
O	man;
O	even
O	this
O	could
O	not
O	persuade
O	them
O	,
O	though
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	said
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	poor
O	boatmen
O	with
O	families
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	sum
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	fortune
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	already
O	said
O	,
O	some
O	lives
O	must
O	be
O	sacrificed
O	to
O	save
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	greater
O	number
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	knowledge
O	of
O	this
O	makes
O	commanders
O	sometimes
O	pitiless
O	.
O	The
O	emperor
O	was
O	inflexible
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	grenadiers
O	received
O	orders
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	poor
O	men
O	,
O	whether
O	they
O	would
O	or
O	not
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	went
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	The
O	corporal
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	assigned
O	to
O	me
O	was
O	an
O	intelligent
O	man
O	.
O	Taking
O	him
O	for
O	my
O	interpreter
O	,
O	I
O	charged
O	him
O	as
O	we
O	went
O	along
O	to
O	tell
O	the
O	leader
O	of
O	the
O	boatmen
O	that
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	come
O	along
O	with
O	us
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	better
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	interest
O	show
O	us
O	his
O	best
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	point
O	out
O	everything
O	that
O	we
O	should
O	require
O	for
O	her
O	fitting
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	man
O	obeyed;
O	so
O	we
O	got
O	an
O	excellent
O	vessel
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	took
O	all
O	that
O	we
O	wanted
O	from
O	the
O	others
O	.
O	We
O	had
O	two
O	anchors
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	think
O	we
O	should
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	make
O	use
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	sewn
O	to
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	each
O	cable
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	canvas
O	with
O	a
O	large
O	stone
O	wrapped
O	in
O	it
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	seen
O	in
O	the
O	south
O	of
O	France
O	the
O	fishermen
O	use
O	an
O	apparatus
O	of
O	this
O	kind
O	to
O	hold
O	their
O	boats
O	by
O	throwing
O	the
O	cord
O	over
O	the
O	willows
O	at
O	the
O	water
O	'
O	s
O	edge
O	.
O	I
O	put
O	on
O	a
O	cap
O	,
O	the
O	grenadiers
O	took
O	their
O	forage
O	caps
O	,
O	we
O	had
O	provisions
O	,
O	ropes
O	,
O	axes
O	,
O	saws
O	,
O	a
O	ladder--everything
O	,
O	in
O	short
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	could
O	think
O	of
O	to
O	take
O	.
O	Our
O	preparations
O	ended
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	give
O	the
O	signal
O	to
O	start
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	five
O	boatmen
O	implored
O	me
O	with
O	tears
O	to
O	let
O	the
O	soldiers
O	escort
O	them
O	to
O	their
O	houses
O	,
O	to
O	take
O	perhaps
O	the
O	last
O	farewell
O	of
O	their
O	wives
O	and
O	children;
O	but
O	,
O	fearing
O	that
O	a
O	tender
O	scene
O	of
O	this
O	kind
O	would
O	further
O	reduce
O	their
O	small
O	stock
O	of
O	courage
O	,
O	I
O	refused
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	leader
O	said
O	,

O	and
O	as
O	our
O	oars
O	could
O	make
O	very
O	little
O	way
O	against
O	it
O	to
O	give
O	us
O	the
O	necessary
O	slant

O	,
O	and
O	that
O	my
O	expedition
O	would
O	fail
O	.
O	By
O	dint
O	of
O	hard
O	rowing
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	we
O	had
O	got
O	three-quarters

O	I
O	saw
O	an
O	immense
O	black
O	mass
O	looming
O	over
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	Then
O	a
O	sharp

O	replied
O	that
O	we
O	were
O	on
O	an
O	island
O	covered
O	with
O	willows
O	and
O	had
O	succeeded
O	in
O	passing
O	the
O	obstacle
O	,
O	we
O	found
O	the
O	stream
O	much
O	less
O	furious
O	than
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	reached
O	the
O	left
O	bank
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	Austrian
O	camp
O	.
O	This
O	shore
O	was
O	bordered
O	with
O	very
O	thick
O	trees
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	overhanging
O	the
O	bank
O	like
O	a
O	dome
O	,
O	made
O	the
O	approach
O	difficult
O	,
O	no
O	doubt
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	concealed
O	our
O	boat
O	from
O	the
O	camp
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	shore
O	was
O	lighted
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	bivouac
O	fires
O	,
O	while
O	we
O	remained
O	in
O	the
O	shadow
O	thrown
O	by
O	the
O	branches
O	of
O	the
O	willows
O	.
O	I
O	let
O	the
O	boat
O	float
O	downward
O	,
O	looking
O	for
O	a
O	suitable
O	landing-place
O	.
O	Presently
O	I
O	perceived
O	that
O	a
O	sloping
O	path
O	had
O	been
O	made
O	down
O	the
O	bank
O	by
O	the
O	enemy
O	to
O	allow
O	the
O	men
O	and
O	horses
O	to
O	get
O	to
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	The
O	corporal
O	adroitly
O	threw
O	into
O	the
O	willows
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	stones
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	made
O	ready
O	,
O	the
O	cord
O	caught
O	in
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boat
O	brought
O	up
O	against
O	the
O	land
O	a
O	foot
O	or
O	two
O	from
O	the
O	slope
O	.
O	It
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	just
O	about
O	midnight
O	.
O	The
O	Austrians
O	,
O	having
O	the
O	swollen
O	Danube
O	between
O	them
O	and
O	the
O	French
O	,
O	felt
O	themselves
O	so
O	secure
O	that
O	,
O	except
O	the
O	sentry
O	,
O	the
O	whole
O	camp
O	was
O	asleep
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	usual
O	in
O	war
O	for
O	the
O	guns
O	and
O	the
O	sentinels
O	always
O	to
O	face
O	toward
O	the
O	enemy
O	,
O	however
O	far
O	off
O	he
O	may
O	be
O	.
O	A
O	battery
O	placed
O	in
O	advance
O	of
O	the
O	camp
O	was
O	therefore
O	turned
O	toward
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	and
O	sentries
O	were
O	walking
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	bank
O	.
O	The
O	trees
O	prevented
O	them
O	from
O	seeing
O	the
O	extreme
O	edge
O	,
O	while
O	from
O	the
O	boat
O	I
O	could
O	see
O	through
O	the
O	branches
O	a
O	great
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	bivouac
O	.
O	So
O	far
O	my
O	mission
O	had
O	been
O	more
O	successful
O	than
O	I
O	had
O	ventured
O	to
O	hope
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	success
O	complete
O	I
O	had
O	to
O	bring
O	away
O	a
O	prisoner
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	execute
O	such
O	an
O	operation
O	fifty
O	paces
O	away
O	from
O	several
O	thousand
O	enemies
O	,
O	whom
O	a
O	single
O	cry
O	would
O	rouse
O	,
O	seemed
O	very
O	difficult
O	.
O	Still
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	to
O	do
O	something
O	.
O	I
O	made
O	the
O	five
O	sailors
O	lie
O	down
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	under
O	guard
O	of
O	two
O	grenadiers
O	,
O	another
O	grenadier
O	I
O	posted
O	at
O	the
O	bow
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	bank
O	,
O	and
O	myself
O	disembarked
O	,
O	sword
O	in
O	hand
O	,
O	followed
O	by
O	the
O	corporal
O	and
O	two
O	grenadiers
O	.
O	The
O	boat
O	was
O	a
O	few
O	feet
O	from
O	dry
O	land;
O	we
O	had
O	to
O	walk
O	in
O	the
O	water

O	We

O	up

O	I
O	was
O	making
O	ready
O	to
O	rush
O	on
O	the

O	gag
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	drag

O	off

O	the
O	ring
O	of
O	metal
O	and
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	singing
O	in
O	a
O	low
O	voice
O	fell
O	on
O	my
O	ears
O	.
O	A
O	man
O	,
O	carrying
O	a
O	great
O	tin
O	pail
O	,
O	was
O	coming
O	to
O	draw
O	water
O	,
O	humming
O	a
O	song
O	as
O	he
O	went;
O	we
O	quickly
O	went
O	down
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	river
O	to
O	hide
O	under
O	the
O	branches
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	Austrian
O	stooped
O	to
O	fill
O	his
O	pail
O	,
O	my
O	grenadiers
O	seized
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	throat
O	,
O	put
O	a
O	handkerchief
O	full
O	of
O	wet
O	sand
O	over
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	placing
O	their
O	sword-points
O	against
O	his
O	body
O	,
O	threatened
O	him
O	with
O	death
O	if
O	he
O	resisted
O	or
O	uttered
O	a
O	sound
O	.
O	Utterly
O	bewildered
O	,
O	the
O	man
O	obeyed
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	us
O	take
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	boat;
O	we
O	hoisted
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	grenadiers
O	posted
O	there
O	,
O	who
O	made
O	him
O	lie
O	down
O	beside
O	the
O	sailors
O	.
O	While
O	this
O	Austrian
O	was
O	lying
O	captured
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	by
O	his
O	clothes
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	,
O	strictly
O	speaking
O	,
O	a
O	soldier
O	,
O	but
O	an
O	officer
O	'
O	s
O	servant
O	.
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	preferred
O	to
O	catch
O	a
O	combatant
O	who
O	could
O	have
O	given
O	me
O	more
O	precise
O	information;
O	but
O	I
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	content
O	myself
O	with
O	this
O	capture
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	a
O	better
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	saw
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	slope
O	,
O	two
O	soldiers
O	carrying
O	a
O	caldron
O	between
O	them
O	on
O	a
O	pole
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	only
O	a
O	few
O	paces
O	off
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	impossible
O	for
O	us
O	to
O	re-embark
O	without
O	being
O	seen
O	.
O	I
O	therefore
O	signed
O	to
O	my
O	grenadiers
O	to
O	hide
O	themselves
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	two
O	Austrians
O	stooped
O	to
O	fill
O	their
O	vessel
O	,
O	powerful
O	arms
O	seized
O	them
O	from
O	behind
O	and
O	plunged
O	their
O	heads
O	under
O	water
O	.
O	We
O	had
O	to
O	stupefy
O	them
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	since
O	they
O	had
O	their
O	swords
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	feared
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	resist
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	were
O	picked
O	up
O	in
O	turn
O	,
O	their
O	mouths
O	covered
O	with
O	a
O	handkerchief
O	full
O	of
O	sand
O	,
O	and
O	sword-points
O	against
O	their
O	breasts
O	constrained
O	them
O	to
O	follow
O	us
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	shipped
O	as
O	the
O	servant
O	had
O	been
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	men
O	and

O	So
O	far
O	,
O	all
O	had
O	gone
O	well
O	.
O	I
O	made
O	the
O	sailors
O	get
O	up
O	and
O	take
O	their
O	oars
O	,
O	and
O	ordered

O	held
