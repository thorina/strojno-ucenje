O	Four
O	hundred
O	years
O	of
O	the
O	Roman
O	dominion
O	had
O	entirely
O	tamed
O	the
O	once
O	wild
O	and
O	independent
O	Gauls
O	.
O	Everywhere
O	,
O	except
O	in
O	the
O	moorlands
O	of
O	Brittany
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	become
O	as
O	much
O	like
O	Romans
O	themselves
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	accomplish
O	;
O	they
O	had
O	Latin
O	names
O	,
O	spoke
O	the
O	Latin
O	tongue
O	,
O	all
O	their
O	personages
O	of
O	higher
O	rank
O	were
O	enrolled
O	as
O	Roman
O	citizens
O	,
O	their
O	chief
O	cities
O	were
O	colonies
O	where
O	the
O	laws
O	were
O	administered
O	by
O	magistrates
O	in
O	the
O	Roman
O	fashion
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	houses
O	,
O	dress
O	,
O	and
O	amusements
O	were
O	the
O	same
O	as
O	those
O	of
O	Italy
O	.
O	The
O	greater
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	towns
O	had
O	been
O	converted
O	to
O	Christianity
O	,
O	though
O	some
O	paganism
O	still
O	lurked
O	in
O	the
O	more
O	remote
O	villages
O	and
O	mountainous
O	districts
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	upon
O	these
O	civilized
O	Gauls
O	that
O	the
O	terrible
O	attacks
O	came
O	from
O	the
O	wild
O	nations
O	who
O	poured
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	center
O	and
O	east
O	of
O	Europe
O	.
O	The
O	Franks
O	came
O	over
O	the
O	Rhine
O	and
O	its
O	dependent
O	rivers
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	furious
O	attacks
O	upon
O	the
O	peaceful
O	plains
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	Gauls
O	had
O	long
O	lived
O	in
O	security
O	,
O	and
O	reports
O	were
O	everywhere
O	heard
O	of
O	villages
O	harried
O	by
O	wild
O	horsemen
O	,
O	with
O	short
O	double-headed
O	battle-axes
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	horrible
O	short
O	pike
O	covered
O	with
O	iron
O	and
O	with
O	several
O	large
O	hooks
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	gigantic
O	artificial
O	minnow
O	,
O	and
O	like
O	it
O	fastened
O	to
O	a
O	long
O	rope
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	prey
O	which
O	it
O	had
O	grappled
O	might
O	be
O	pulled
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	owner
O	.
O	Walled
O	cities
O	usually
O	stopped
O	them
O	,
O	but
O	every
O	farm
O	or
O	villa
O	outside
O	was
O	stripped
O	of
O	its
O	valuables
O	,
O	set
O	on
O	fire
O	,
O	the
O	cattle
O	driven
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	more
O	healthy
O	inhabitants
O	seized
O	for
O	slaves
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	during
O	this
O	state
O	of
O	things
O	that
O	a
O	girl
O	was
O	born
O	to
O	a
O	wealthy
O	peasant
O	at
O	the
O	village
O	now
O	called
O	Nanterre
O	,
O	about
O	two
O	miles
O	from
O	Lutetia
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	already
O	a
O	prosperous
O	city
O	,
O	though
O	not
O	as
O	yet
O	so
O	entirely
O	the
O	capital
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	destined
O	to
O	become
O	under
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Paris
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	christened
O	by
O	an
O	old
O	Gallic
O	name
O	,
O	probably
O	Gwenfrewi
O	,
O	or
O	White
O	Stream
O	,
O	in
O	Latin
O	Genovefa
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	is
O	best
O	known
O	by
O	the
O	late
O	French
O	form
O	of
O	Genevieve
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	was
O	about
O	seven
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	two
O	celebrated
O	bishops
O	passed
O	through
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	Germanus
O	,
O	of
O	Auxerre
O	,
O	and
O	Lupus
O	,
O	of
O	Troyes
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	invited
O	to
O	Britain
O	to
O	dispute
O	the
O	false
O	doctrines
O	of
O	Pelagius
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	flocked
O	into
O	the
O	church
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	,
O	pray
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	receive
O	their
O	blessing
O	;
O	and
O	here
O	the
O	sweet
O	childish
O	devotion
O	of
O	Geneviaeve
O	so
O	struck
O	Germanus
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	called
O	her
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	talked
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	made
O	her
O	sit
O	beside
O	him
O	at
O	the
O	feast
O	,
O	gave
O	her
O	his
O	special
O	blessing
O	,
O	and
O	presented
O	her
O	with
O	a
O	copper
O	medal
O	with
O	a
O	cross
O	engraven
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	From
O	that
O	time
O	the
O	little
O	maiden
O	always
O	deemed
O	herself
O	especially
O	consecrated
O	to
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	Heaven
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	still
O	remained
O	at
O	home
O	,
O	daily
O	keeping
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	sheep
O	,
O	and
O	spinning
O	their
O	wool
O	as
O	she
O	sat
O	under
O	the
O	trees
O	watching
O	them
O	,
O	but
O	always
O	with
O	her
O	heart
O	full
O	of
O	prayer
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	St
O	.
O	Germanus
O	proceeded
O	to
O	Britain
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	encouraged
O	his
O	converts
O	to
O	meet
O	the
O	heathen
O	Picts
O	at
O	Maes
O	Garmon
O	,
O	in
O	Flintshire
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	exulting
O	shout
O	of
O	the
O	white-robed
O	catechumens
O	turned
O	to
O	flight
O	the
O	wild
O	superstitious
O	savages
O	of
O	the
O	north
O	,
O	--
O	and
O	the
O	Hallelujah
O	victory
O	was
O	gained
O	without
O	a
O	drop
O	of
O	bloodshed
O	.
O	He
O	never
O	lost
O	sight
O	of
O	Geneviaeve
O	,
O	the
O	little
O	maid
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	so
O	early
O	distinguished
O	for
O	her
O	piety
O	.
O	After
O	she
O	lost
O	her
O	parents
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	live
O	with
O	her
O	godmother
O	,
O	and
O	continued
O	the
O	same
O	simple
O	habits
O	,
O	leading
O	a
O	life
O	of
O	sincere
O	devotion
O	and
O	strict
O	self-denial
O	,
O	constant
O	prayer
O	and
O	much
O	charity
O	to
O	her
O	poorer
O	neighbors
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	year
O	451
O	the
O	whole
O	of
O	Gaul
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	dreadful
O	state
O	of
O	terror
O	at
O	the
O	advance
O	of
O	Attila
O	,
O	the
O	savage
O	chief
O	of
O	the
O	Huns
O	,
O	who
O	came
O	from
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	Danube
O	with
O	a
O	host
O	of
O	savages
O	of
O	hideous
O	features
O	,
O	scarred
O	and
O	disfigured
O	to
O	render
O	them
O	more
O	frightful
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	enemies
O	,
O	the
O	Goths
O	and
O	the
O	Franks
O	,
O	seemed
O	like
O	friends
O	compared
O	with
O	these
O	formidable
O	beings
O	,
O	whose
O	cruelties
O	were
O	said
O	to
O	be
O	intolerable
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	whom
O	every
O	exaggerated
O	story
O	was
O	told
O	that
O	could
O	add
O	to
O	the
O	horrors
O	of
O	the
O	miserable
O	people
O	who
O	lay
O	in
O	their
O	path
O	.
O	Tidings
O	came
O	that
O	this
O	``
O	Scourge
O	of
O	God
O	,
O	``
O	as
O	Attila
O	called
O	himself
O	,
O	had
O	passed
O	the
O	Rhine
O	,
O	destroyed
O	Tongres
O	and
O	Metz
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	in
O	full
O	march
O	for
O	Paris
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	country
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	utmost
O	terror
O	.
O	Every
O	one
O	seized
O	their
O	most
O	valuable
O	possessions
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	fled
O	;
O	but
O	Geneviaeve
O	placed
O	herself
O	on
O	the
O	only
O	bridge
O	across
O	the
O	Seine
O	,
O	and
O	argued
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	assuring
O	them
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	strain
O	that
O	was
O	afterwards
O	thought
O	of
O	as
O	prophetic
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	pray
O	,
O	repent
O	,
O	and
O	defend
O	instead
O	of
O	abandoning
O	their
O	homes
O	,
O	God
O	would
O	protect
O	them
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	at
O	first
O	almost
O	ready
O	to
O	stone
O	her
O	for
O	thus
O	withstanding
O	their
O	panic
O	,
O	but
O	just
O	then
O	a
O	priest
O	arrived
O	from
O	Auxerre
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	present
O	for
O	Geneviaeve
O	from
O	St
O	.
O	Germanus
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	thus
O	reminded
O	of
O	the
O	high
O	estimation
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	held
O	her
O	;
O	they
O	became
O	ashamed
O	of
O	their
O	violence
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	led
O	them
O	back
O	to
O	pray
O	and
O	to
O	arm
O	themselves
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	they
O	heard
O	that
O	Attila
O	had
O	paused
O	to
O	besiege
O	Orleans
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	Aaetius
O	,
O	the
O	Roman
O	general
O	,
O	hurrying
O	from
O	Italy
O	,
O	had
O	united
O	his
O	troops
O	with
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	Goths
O	and
O	Franks
O	,
O	and
O	given
O	Attila
O	so
O	terrible
O	a
O	defeat
O	at
O	Chaelons
O	that
O	the
O	Huns
O	were
O	fairly
O	driven
O	out
O	of
O	Gaul
O	.
O	And
O	here
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	mentioned
O	that
O	when
O	in
O	the
O	next
O	year
O	,
O	452
O	,
O	Attila
O	with
O	his
O	murderous
O	host
O	,
O	came
O	down
O	into
O	Italy
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	horrible
O	devastation
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	northern
O	provinces
O	,
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	Rome
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	dared
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	but
O	one
O	venerable
O	bishop
O	,
O	Leo
O	,
O	the
O	Pope
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	when
O	his
O	flock
O	were
O	in
O	transports
O	of
O	despair
O	,
O	went
O	forth
O	only
O	accompanied
O	by
O	one
O	magistrate
O	to
O	meet
O	the
O	invader
O	,
O	and
O	endeavored
O	to
O	turn
O	his
O	wrath
O	aside
O	.
O	The
O	savage
O	Huns
O	were
O	struck
O	with
O	awe
O	by
O	the
O	fearless
O	majesty
O	of
O	the
O	unarmed
O	old
O	man
O	.
O	They
O	conducted
O	him
O	safely
O	to
O	Attila
O	,
O	who
O	listened
O	to
O	him
O	with
O	respect
O	,
O	and
O	promised
O	not
O	to
O	lead
O	his
O	people
O	into
O	Rome
O	,
O	provided
O	a
O	tribute
O	should
O	be
O	paid
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	retreated
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	joy
O	of
O	all
O	Europe
O	,
O	died
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	native
O	dominions
O	.
O	But
O	with
O	the
O	Huns
O	the
O	danger
O	and
O	suffering
O	of
O	Europe
O	did
O	not
O	end
O	.
O	The
O	happy
O	state
O	described
O	in
O	the
O	Prophets
O	as
O	``
O	dwelling
O	safely
O	,
O	with
O	none
O	to
O	make
O	them
O	afraid
O	,
O	``
O	was
O	utterly
O	unknown
O	in
O	Europe
O	throughout
O	the
O	long
O	break-up
O	of
O	the
O	Roman
O	Empire
O	;
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	more
O	years
O	the
O	Franks
O	were
O	overrunning
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	Seine
O	,
O	and
O	actually
O	venturing
O	to
O	lay
O	siege
O	to
O	the
O	Roman
O	walls
O	of
O	Paris
O	itself
O	.
O	The
O	fortifications
O	were
O	strong
O	enough
O	,
O	but
O	hunger
O	began
O	to
O	do
O	the
O	work
O	of
O	the
O	besiegers
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	garrison
O	,
O	unwarlike
O	and
O	untrained
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	despair
O	.
O	But
O	Geneviaeve
O	'
O	s
O	courage
O	and
O	trust
O	never
O	failed
O	;
O	and
O	finding
O	no
O	warriors
O	willing
O	to
O	run
O	the
O	risk
O	of
O	going
O	beyond
O	the
O	walls
O	to
O	obtain
O	food
O	for
O	the
O	women
O	and
O	children
O	who
O	were
O	perishing
O	around
O	them
O	,
O	this
O	brave
O	shepherdess
O	embarked
O	alone
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	guiding
O	it
O	down
O	the
O	stream
O	,
O	landed
O	beyond
O	the
O	Frankish
O	camp
O	,
O	and
O	repairing
O	to
O	the
O	different
O	Gallic
O	cities

O	to

O	.
O	She

O	complete

O	the

O	had
O	no
O	means
O	of
O	obstructing
O	the
O	passage
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	a
O	convoy
O	of
O	boats
O	could
O	easily
O	penetrate
O	into
O	the
O	town
O	:
O	at
O	any
O	rate
O	they
O	looked
O	upon
O	Geneviaeve
O	as
O	something
O	sacred
O	and
O	inspired
O	whom
O	they
O	durst
O	not
O	touch
O	;
O	probably
O	as
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	battle-maids
O	in
O	whom
O	their
O	own
O	myths
O	taught
O	them
O	to
O	believe
O	.
O	One
O	account
O	indeed
O	says
O	that
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	going
O	alone
O	to
O	obtain
O	help
O	,
O	Geneviaeve
O	placed
O	herself
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	a
O	forage
O	party
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	mere
O	sight
O	of
O	her
O	inspired
O	bearing
O	caused
O	them
O	to
O	be
O	allowed
O	to
O	enter
O	and
O	return
O	in
O	safety
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	boat
O	version
O	seems
O	the
O	more
O	probable
O	,
O	since
O	a
O	single
O	boat
O	on
O	the
O	broad
O	river
O	would
O	more
O	easily
O	elude
O	the
O	enemy
O	than
O	a
O	troop
O	of
O	Gauls
O	pass
O	through
O	their
O	army
O	.
O	But
O	a
O	city
O	where
O	all
O	the
O	valor
O	resided
O	in
O	one
O	woman
O	could
O	not
O	long
O	hold
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	another
O	inroad
O	,
O	when
O	Genevieve
O	was
O	absent
O	,
O	Paris
O	was
O	actually
O	seized
O	by
O	the
O	Franks
O	.
O	Their
O	leader
O	,
O	Hilperik
O	,
O	was
O	absolutely
O	afraid
O	of
O	what
O	the
O	mysteriously
O	brave
O	maiden
O	might
O	do
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	commanded
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	to
O	be
O	carefully
O	guarded
O	lest
O	she
O	should
O	enter
O	;
O	but
O	Geneviaeve
O	learnt
O	that
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	chief
O	citizens
O	were
O	imprisoned
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	Hilperik
O	intended
O	their
O	death
O	,
O	and
O	nothing
O	could
O	withhold
O	her
O	from
O	making
O	an
O	effort
O	in
O	their
O	behalf
O	.
O	The
O	Franks
O	had
O	made
O	up
O	their
O	minds
O	to
O	settle
O	and
O	not
O	to
O	destroy
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	not
O	burning
O	and
O	slaying
O	indiscriminately
O	,
O	but
O	while
O	despising
O	the
O	Romans
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	called
O	the
O	Gauls
O	,
O	for
O	their
O	cowardice
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	awe
O	of
O	their
O	superior
O	civilization
O	and
O	knowledge
O	of
O	arts
O	.
O	The
O	country
O	people
O	had
O	free
O	access
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	and
O	Geneviaeve
O	in
O	her
O	homely
O	gown
O	and
O	veil
O	passed
O	by
O	Hilperik
O	'
O	s
O	guards
O	without
O	being
O	suspected
O	of
O	being
O	more
O	than
O	any
O	ordinary
O	Gaulish
O	village-maid
O	;
O	and
O	thus
O	she
O	fearlessly
O	made
O	her
O	way
O	,
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	old
O	Roman
O	halls
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	long-haired
O	Hilperik
O	was
O	holding
O	his
O	wild
O	carousal
O	.
O	Would
O	that
O	we
O	knew
O	more
O	of
O	that
O	interview
O	--
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	striking
O	that
O	ever
O	took
O	place
O	!
O	We
O	can
O	only
O	picture
O	to
O	ourselves
O	the
O	Roman
O	tesselated
O	pavement
O	bestrewn
O	with
O	wine
O	,
O	bones
O	,
O	and
O	fragments
O	of
O	the
O	barbarous
O	revelry
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	,
O	untamed
O	Franks
O	,
O	their
O	sun-burnt
O	hair
O	tied
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	knot
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	their
O	heads
O	,
O	and
O	falling
O	down
O	like
O	a
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	tail
O	,
O	their
O	faces
O	close-shaven
O	,
O	except
O	two
O	huge
O	mustaches
O	,
O	and
O	dressed
O	in
O	tight
O	leather
O	garments
O	,
O	with
O	swords
O	at
O	their
O	wide
O	belts
O	.
O	Some
O	slept
O	,
O	some
O	feasted
O	,
O	some
O	greased
O	their
O	long
O	locks
O	,
O	some
O	shouted
O	out
O	their
O	favorite
O	war-songs
O	around
O	the
O	table
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	the
O	spoils
O	of
O	churches
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	their
O	head
O	sat
O	the
O	wild
O	,
O	long-haired
O	chieftain
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	few
O	years
O	later
O	driven
O	away
O	by
O	his
O	own
O	followers
O	for
O	his
O	excesses
O	,
O	--
O	the
O	whole
O	scene
O	was
O	all
O	that
O	was
O	abhorrent
O	to
O	a
O	pure
O	,
O	devout
O	,
O	and
O	faithful
O	nature
O	,
O	most
O	full
O	of
O	terror
O	to
O	a
O	woman
O	.
O	Yet
O	there
O	,
O	in
O	her
O	strength
O	,
O	stood
O	the
O	peasant
O	maiden
O	,
O	her
O	heart
O	full
O	of
O	trust
O	and
O	pity
O	,
O	her
O	looks
O	full
O	of
O	the
O	power
O	that
O	is
O	given
O	by
O	fearlessness
O	of
O	them
O	that
O	can
O	kill
O	the
O	body
O	.
O	What
O	she
O	said
O	we
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	--
O	we
O	only
O	know
O	that
O	the
O	barbarous
O	Hilperik
O	was
O	overawed
O	;
O	he
O	trembled
O	before
O	the
O	expostulations
O	of
O	the
O	brave
O	woman
O	,
O	and
O	granted
O	all
O	she
O	asked
O	--
O	the
O	safety
O	of
O	his
O	prisoners
O	,
O	and
O	mercy
O	to
O	the
O	terrified
O	inhabitants
O	.
O	No
O	wonder
O	that
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	Paris
O	have
O	ever
O	since
O	looked
O	back
O	to
O	Genevieve
O	as
O	their
O	protectress
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	in
O	after-ages
O	she
O	has
O	grown
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	patron
O	saint
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	She
O	lived
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	Hilperik
O	,
O	Chlodwig
O	,
O	or
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	more
O	commonly
O	called
O	,
O	Clovis
O	,
O	marry
O	a
O	Christian
O	wife
O	,
O	Clotilda
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	time
O	become
O	a
O	Christian
O	.
O	She
O	saw
O	the
O	foundation
O	of
O	the
O	Cathedral
O	of
O	Notre
O	Dame
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	famous
O	churches
O	of
O	St
O	.
O	Denys
O	and
O	of
O	St
O	.
O	Martin
O	of
O	Tours
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	her
O	full
O	share
O	to
O	the
O	first
O	efforts
O	for
O	bringing
O	the
O	rude
O	and
O	bloodthirsty
O	conquerors
O	to
O	some
O	knowledge
O	of
O	Christian
O	faith
O	,
O	mercy
O	,
O	and
O	purity
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	life
O	of
O	constant
O	prayer
O	and
O	charity
O	she
O	died
O	,
O	three
O	months
O	after
O	King
O	Clovis
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	year
O	512
O	,
O	the
O	89th
O	of
O	her
O	age
O	.
