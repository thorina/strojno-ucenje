O	As
O	we
O	approached
O	Molokai
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	slow
O	work
O	of
O	centuries
O	had
O	nearly
O	covered
O	its
O	lava
O	with
O	verdure
O	.
O	At
O	dawn
O	we
O	were
O	opposite
O	Kalaupapa
O	.
O	Two
O	little
O	spired
O	churches
O	,
O	looking
O	precisely
O	alike
O	,
O	caught
O	my
O	eye
O	first
O	,
O	and
O	around
O	them
O	were
O	dotted
O	the
O	white
O	cottages
O	of
O	the
O	lepers
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	sea
O	was
O	too
O	rough
O	for
O	us
O	to
O	land
O	.
O	The
O	waves
O	dashed
O	against
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	spray
O	rose
O	fifty
O	feet
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	.
O	We
O	went
O	on
O	to
O	Kalawao
O	,
O	but
O	were
O	again
O	disappointed
O	;
O	it
O	was
O	too
O	dangerous
O	to
O	disembark
O	.
O	Finally
O	it
O	was
O	decided
O	to
O	put
O	off
O	a
O	boat
O	for
O	a
O	rocky
O	point
O	about
O	a
O	mile
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	distant
O	from
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	Climbing
O	down
O	this
O	point
O	we
O	saw
O	about
O	twenty
O	lepers
O	,
O	and
O	``
O	There
O	is
O	Father
O	Damien
O	!
O	``
O	said
O	our
O	purser
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	slowly
O	moving
O	along
O	the
O	hillside
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	dark
O	figure
O	with
O	a
O	large
O	straw
O	hat
O	.
O	He
O	came
O	rather
O	painfully
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	near
O	the
O	water-side
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	exchanged
O	friendly
O	signals
O	across
O	the
O	waves
O	while
O	my
O	baggage
O	was
O	being
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	hold
O	--
O	a
O	long
O	business
O	,
O	owing
O	to
O	the
O	violence
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	all
O	was
O	ready
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	went
O	swinging
O	across
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	chose
O	a
O	fit
O	moment
O	for
O	leaping
O	on
O	shore
O	.
O	Father
O	Damien
O	caught
O	me
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	hearty
O	welcome
O	shone
O	from
O	his
O	kindly
O	face
O	as
O	he
O	helped
O	me
O	up
O	the
O	rock
O	.
O	He
O	immediately
O	called
O	me
O	by
O	my
O	name
O	,
O	``
O	Edward
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	``
O	like
O	everything
O	else
O	,
O	a
O	providence
O	,
O	``
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	met
O	me
O	at
O	that
O	irregular
O	landing-place
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	expected
O	the
O	ship
O	to
O	stop
O	at
O	Kalaupapa
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	now
O	forty-nine
O	years
O	old
O	--
O	a
O	thick-set
O	,
O	strongly
O	built
O	man
O	,
O	with
O	black
O	curly
O	hair
O	and
O	short
O	beard
O	,
O	turning
O	gray
O	.
O	His
O	countenance
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	handsome
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	full
O	,
O	well-curved
O	mouth
O	and
O	a
O	short
O	,
O	straight
O	nose
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	now
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	disfigured
O	by
O	leprosy
O	,
O	though
O	not
O	so
O	badly
O	as
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	anything
O	but
O	a
O	pleasure
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	his
O	bright
O	,
O	sensible
O	face
O	.
O	His
O	forehead
O	was
O	swollen
O	and
O	rigid
O	,
O	the
O	eyebrows
O	gone
O	,
O	the
O	nose
O	somewhat
O	sunk
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	ears
O	greatly
O	enlarged
O	.
O	His
O	hands
O	and
O	face
O	looked
O	uneven
O	with
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	incipient
O	boils
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	body
O	also
O	showed
O	many
O	signs
O	of
O	the
O	disease
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	assured
O	me
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	felt
O	little
O	or
O	no
O	pain
O	since
O	he
O	had
O	tried
O	Dr
O	.
O	Goto
O	'
O	s
O	system
O	of
O	hot
O	baths
O	and
O	Japanese
O	medicine
O	.
O	The
O	bathrooms
O	that
O	have
O	been
O	provided
O	by
O	the
O	Government
O	are
O	very
O	nice
O	.
O	A
O	large
O	wooden
O	box
O	of
O	presents
O	from
O	English
O	friends
O	,
O	had
O	been
O	unshipped
O	with
O	the
O	gurjun
O	oil
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	so
O	large
O	that
O	Father
O	Damien
O	said
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	impossible
O	for
O	his
O	lepers
O	either
O	to
O	land
O	it
O	from
O	the
O	boat
O	or
O	to
O	carry
O	it
O	to
O	Kalawao
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	steamer
O	and
O	landed
O	on
O	some
O	voyage
O	when
O	the
O	sea
O	was
O	quieter
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	give
O	up
O	the
O	pleasure
O	of
O	his
O	enjoyment
O	in
O	its
O	contents
O	,
O	so
O	after
O	some
O	delay
O	it
O	was
O	forced
O	open
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	things
O	were
O	handed
O	out
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	across
O	the
O	waves
O	.
O	The
O	lepers
O	all
O	came
O	round
O	with
O	their
O	poor
O	marred
O	faces
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	presents
O	were
O	carried
O	home
O	by
O	them
O	and
O	our
O	two
O	selves
O	.
O	As
O	we
O	ascended
O	the
O	hill
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	village
O	is
O	built
O	Father
O	Damien
O	showed
O	me
O	on
O	our
O	left
O	the
O	chicken
O	farm
O	.
O	The
O	lepers
O	are
O	justly
O	proud
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	many
O	days
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	fine
O	fowl
O	sent
O	me
O	for
O	dinner
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	little
O	natural
O	timidity
O	,
O	I
O	ate
O	with
O	thankfulness
O	.
O	On
O	arriving
O	at
O	Kalawao
O	we
O	speedily
O	found
O	ourselves
O	inside
O	the
O	half-
O	finished
O	church
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	darling
O	of
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	How
O	he
O	enjoyed
O	planning
O	the
O	places
O	where
O	the
O	pictures
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	just
O	brought
O	him
O	should
O	be
O	placed
O	!
O	By
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	this
O	church
O	he
O	showed
O	me
O	the
O	palm-
O	tree
O	under
O	which
O	he
O	lived
O	for
O	some
O	weeks
O	when
O	he
O	first
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	settlement
O	,
O	in
O	1873
O	.
O	His
O	own
O	little
O	four-roomed
O	house
O	almost
O	joins
O	the
O	church
O	.
O	After
O	dinner
O	we
O	went
O	up
O	the
O	little
O	flight
O	of
O	steps
O	which
O	led
O	to
O	Father
O	Damien
O	'
O	s
O	balcony
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	shaded
O	by
O	a
O	honeysuckle
O	in
O	blossom
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	my
O	happiest
O	times
O	at
O	Molokai
O	were
O	spent
O	in
O	this
O	little
O	balcony
O	,
O	sketching
O	him
O	and
O	listening
O	to
O	what
O	he
O	said
O	.
O	The
O	lepers
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	watch
O	my
O	progress
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	pleasant
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	happy
O	and
O	at
O	home
O	they
O	were
O	.
O	Their
O	poor
O	faces
O	were
O	often
O	swelled
O	and
O	drawn
O	and
O	distorted
O	,
O	with
O	bloodshot
O	goggle
O	eyes
O	.
O	I
O	offered
O	to
O	give
O	a
O	photograph
O	of
O	the
O	picture
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	in
O	Belgium
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	said
O	perhaps
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	better
O	not
O	to
O	do
O	so
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	might
O	pain
O	him
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	he
O	was
O	disfigured
O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	mournfully
O	at
O	my
O	work
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	an
O	ugly
O	face
O	!
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	;
O	``
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	the
O	disease
O	had
O	made
O	such
O	progress
O	.
O	``
O	Looking-glasses
O	are
O	not
O	in
O	great
O	request
O	at
O	Molokai
O	!
O	While
O	I
O	sketched
O	him
O	he
O	often
O	read
O	his
O	breviary
O	.
O	At
O	other
O	times
O	we
O	talked
O	on
O	subjects
O	that
O	interested
O	us
O	both
O	,
O	especially
O	about
O	the
O	work
O	of
O	the
O	Church
O	Army
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	I
O	sang
O	hymns
O	to
O	him
O	--
O	among
O	others
O	,
O	``
O	Brief
O	life
O	is
O	here
O	our
O	portion

O	``
O	Art
O	thou
O	weary
O	,

O	languid
O	?
O	``
O	and
O	``
O	Safe
O	home
O	in
O	port
O	.
O	``
O	At
O	such
O	times
O	the
O	expression
O	of
O	his
O	face
O	was
O	particularly
O	sweet
O	and
O	tender
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	I
O	asked
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	like
O	to
O	send
O	a
O	message
O	to
O	Cardinal
O	Manning
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	for
O	such
O	as
O	he
O	to
O	send
O	a
O	message
O	to
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	dignitary
O	,
O	but
O	after
O	a
O	moment
O	'
O	s
O	hesitation
O	he
O	added
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	send
O	my
O	humble
O	respects
O	and
O	thanks
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	need
O	scarcely
O	say
O	that

O	gave
O	himself
O	no
O	airs
O	of
O	martyr
O	,
O	saint
O	,
O	or
O	hero
O	--
O	a
O	humbler
O	man
O	I
O	never
O	saw
O	.
O	He
O	smiled
O	modestly
O	and
O	deprecatingly
O	when
O	I
O	gave
O	him
O	the
O	Bishop
O	of
O	Peterborough
O	'
O	s
O	message
O	--
O	``

O	my
O	prayers
O	,
O	and
O	ask
O	him
O	to

O	``
O	``
O	Does
O	he
O	call
O	himself
O	a
O	heretic
O	bishop
O	?
O	``
O	he
O	asked
O	doubtfully
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	to
O	explain
O	that
O	the
O	bishop
O	had
O	probably
O	used
O	the
O	term
O	playfully
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	he
O	told
O	me
O	about
O	his
O	early
O	history
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	born
O	on
O	the
O	3rd
O	of
O	January
O	,
O	1841
O	,
O	near
O	Louvain
O	in
O	Belgium
O	.
O	On
O	his
O	nineteenth
O	birthday
O	his
O	father
O	took
O	him
O	to
O	see
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	then
O	preparing
O	for
O	the
O	priesthood
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	left
O	him
O	there
O	to
O	dine
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	himself
O	went
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	neighbouring
O	town
O	.
O	Young
O	Joseph
O	(
O	this
O	was
O	his
O	baptismal
O	name
O	)
O	decided
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	the
O	opportunity
O	for
O	taking
O	the
O	step
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	long
O	been
O	desiring
O	to
O	take
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	his
O	father
O	came
O	back
O	he
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	return
O	home
O	no
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	better
O	thus
O	to
O	miss
O	the
O	pain
O	of
O	farewells
O	.
O	His
O	father
O	consented
O	unwillingly
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	hurry
O	to
O	the
O	conveyance
O	which
O	was
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	home
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	time
O	for
O	demur
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	parted
O	at
O	the
O	station
O	.
O	Afterward
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	was
O	settled
O	,
O	Joseph
O	revisited
O	his
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	received
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	approval
O	and
O	blessing
O	.
O	His
O	brother
O	was
O	bent
O	on
O	going
O	to
O	the
O	South
O	Seas
O	for
O	mission
O	work
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	was
O	arranged
O	accordingly
O	;
O	but
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	he
O	was
O	laid

O	and
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	bitter
O	disappointment
O	,
O	forbidden
O	to
O	go
O	.
O	The
O	impetuous
O	Joseph
O	asked
O	if
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	consolation
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	to
O	go
O	instead
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	receiving
O	an
O	affirmative
O	answer
O	,
O	he
O	wrote
O	surreptitiously
O	,
O	offering
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	begging
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	sent
O	,
O	though
O	his
O	education
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	finished
O	.
O	The
O	students
O	were
O	not
O	allowed
O	to
O	send
O	out
O	letters
O	till
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	submitted
O	to
O	the
O	Superior
O	,
O	but
O	Joseph
O	ventured
O	to
O	disobey
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	sat
O	at
O	his
O	studies
O	,
O	the
O	Superior
O	came
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	tender
O	reproach
O	,
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	you
O	impatient

O	``
O	Joseph
O	jumped
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	leaped
O	about
O	like
O	a
O	young
O	colt
O	.
O	``
O	Is
O	he
O	crazy
O	?
O	``
O	said
O	the

O	worked
O	for
O	some
O	years
O	on
O	other
O	islands
O	in
O	the
O	Pacific
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	one
O	day
O	in
O	1873
O	present
O	at
O	the
O	dedication
O	of
O	a
O	chapel
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	Maui
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	bishop
O	was
O	lamenting
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	impossible
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	send
O	a
O	missioner
O	to
O	the
O	lepers
O	at
O	Molokai
O	and
O	still
O	less
O	to
O	provide
O	them
O	with
O	a
O	pastor
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	only
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	send
O	them
O	occasional
O	and
O	temporary
O	help
O	.
O	Some
O	young
O	priests
O	had
O	just
O	arrived
O	in
O	Hawaii
O	for
O	mission
O	work
O	,
O	and
O	Father
O	Damien
O	instantly
O	spoke
O	.
O	``
O	Monseigneur

O	His

O	and
O	that
O	very
O	day
O	,
O	without
O	any

O	,
O	he
O	embarked
O	on

O	that
O	was
O	taking
O	some
O	cattle
O	to
O	the
O	leper

O	When
O	he
O	first
O	put
O	his
O	foot
O	on
O	the

O	said
O	to

O	Father

O	told

O	it
O	was
O	not

O	on

O	The

O	of
O	Molokai
O	was
O	a
O	pleasant
O	subject
O	with
O	Father
O	Damien
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	first
O	arrived
O	the
O	lepers
O	could
O	only
O	obtain
O	water
O	by
O	carrying
O	it
O	from
O	the
O	gulch
O	on
O	their
O	poor
O	shoulders
O	;
O	they
O	had
O	also
O	to
O	take
O	their
O	clothes
O	to
O	some
O	distance
O	when
O	they
O	required
O	washing
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	wonder
O	that
O	they
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	dirty
O	state
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	much
O	exercised
O	about
O	the
O	matter
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	joy
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	told
O	that
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	a
O	valley
O	called
O	Waihanau
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	natural
O	reservoir
O	.
O	He
O	set
O	out
O	with
O	two
O	white
O	men
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	his
O	boys
O	,
O	and
O	travelled
O	up
O	the
O	valley
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	with
O	delight
O	to
O	a
O	nearly
O	circular
O	basin
O	of
O	most
O	delicious
O	ice-cold
O	water
O	.
O	Its
O	diameter
O	was
O	seventy-two
O	feet
O	by
O	fifty-five
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	bank
O	they
O	found
O	,
O	on
O	sounding
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	eighteen
O	feet
O	deep
O	.
O	There
O	it
O	lay
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	a
O	high
O	cliff
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	informed
O	by
O	the
O	natives
O	that
O	there
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	a
O	drought
O	in
O	which
O	this
O	basin
O	had
O	dried
O	up
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	rest
O	till
O	a
O	supply
O	of
O	waterpipes
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	them
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	able
O	lepers
O	went
O	to
O	work
O	and
O	laid
O	.
O	Henceforth
O	clear
O	sweet
O	water
O	has
O	been
O	available
O	for
O	all
O	who
O	desire
O	to
O	drink
O	,
O	to
O	wash
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	bathe
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	after
O	living
O	at
O	the
O	leper
O	settlement
O	for
O	about
O	ten
O	years
O	that
O	Father
O	Damien
O	began
O	to
O	suspect
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	leper
O	.
O	The
O	doctors
O	assured
O	him
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	not
O	the
O	case
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	once
O	scalded
O	himself
O	in
O	his
O	foot
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	his
O	horror
O	he
O	felt
O	no
O	pain
O	.
O	Anaesthesia
O	had
O	begun
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	other
O	fatal
O	signs
O	appeared
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	he
O	asked
O	Dr
O	.
O	Arning
O	,
O	the
O	great
O	German
O	doctor
O	who
O	was
O	then
O	resident
O	in
O	Molokai
O	,
O	to
O	examine
O	him
O	carefully
O	.
O	``
O	I

O	the
O	tubercular

O	of
O	the

O	.
O	``
O	Whenever

O	to
O	the

O	said

O	,
O	jumped
O	up
O	for
O	joy
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	kneeled
O	down
O	and
O	returned
O	thanks
O	,
O	with
O	tears
O	in
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	that
O	so
O	mercifully
O	,
O	and
O	without
O	any

O	on
O	his

O	in
O	so

O	free
O	from
