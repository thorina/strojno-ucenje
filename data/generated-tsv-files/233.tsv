O	And

O	Yet

O	new
O	regulations
O	between
O	the
O	bears
O	and
O	their
O	masters
O	.
O	With
O	this
O	view
O	,
O	he
O	issued
O	an
O	edict
O	that
O	henceforward
O	the
O	bears
O	should
O	eat
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	table
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	Indians
O	were
O	to
O	wait
O	upon
O	them;
O	that
O	in
O	all
O	public
O	processions
O	of
O	an
O	honorable
O	character
O	the
O	bears
O	should
O	go
O	first;
O	and
O	that
O	when
O	any
O	fighting

O	to
O	be

O	,
O	the

O	of

O	A

O	fairly
O	established
O	,
O	Grasshopper
O	fixed
O	his
O	mind
O	upon
O	further
O	adventures
O	.
O	He
O	determined
O	to
O	go
O	abroad

O	having
O	an
O	old

O	he
O	turned
O	every

O	in

O	lodge
O	upside
O	down

O	killed
