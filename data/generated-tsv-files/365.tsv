O	""""
O	Long
O	seemed
O	that
O	night
O	to
O	me
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	I
O	arose
O	and
O	equipped
O	myself
O	,
O	mounted
O	my
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	proceeded
O	straight
O	through
O	the
O	valley
O	to
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	I
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	glade
O	.
O	The
O	black
O	man
O	was
O	there
O	,
O	sitting
O	upon
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	mound;
O	and
O	I
O	was
O	three
O	times
O	more
O	astonished
O	at
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	wild
O	animals
O	that
O	I
O	beheld
O	than
O	the
O	man
O	had
O	said
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	.
O	I
O	inquired
O	of
O	him
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	asked
O	me
O	roughly
O	whither
O	I
O	would
O	go
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	who
O	I
O	was
O	and
O	what
O	I
O	sought
O	,
O	'
O	Take
O	,

O	said
O	he
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	path
O	that
O	leads
O	toward
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	glade

O	and
O	there
O	thou
O	wilt
O	find
O	an
O	open
O	space
O	like
O	to
O	a
O	large
O	valley
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	it
O	a
O	tall
O	tree
O	.
O	Under
O	this
O	tree
O	is
O	a
O	fountain
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	fountain
O	a
O	marble
O	slab
O	,
O	and
O	on

O	and
O	throw
O	a

O	'
O	""""
O	So
O	I
O	journeyed
O	on
O	until
O	I
O	reached
O	the
O	summit
O	of
O	the
O	steep
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	I
O	found
O	everything
O	as
O	the
O	black
O	man
O	had
O	described
O	it
O	to
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	beneath
O	it
O	I
O	saw
O	the
O	fountain
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	its
O	side
O	the
O	marble
O	slab
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	silver
O	bowl
O	fastened
O	by
O	the
O	chain
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	took
O	the
O	bowl
O	,
O	and
O	cast
O	a
O	bowlful
O	of
O	water
O	upon
O	the
O	slab
O	.
O	Immediately
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	mighty
O	peal
O	of
O	thunder
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	heaven
O	and
O	earth
O	seemed
O	to
O	tremble
O	with
O	its
O	fury
O	.
O	And
O	after
O	the
O	thunder
O	came
O	a
O	shower;
O	and
O	of
O	a
O	truth
O	I
O	tell
O	thee
O	,
O	Kay
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	shower
O	as
O	neither
O	man
O	nor
O	beast
O	could
O	endure
O	and
O	live
O	.
O	I
O	turned
O	my
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	flank
O	toward
O	the
O	shower
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	my
O	shield
O	over
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	neck
O	,
O	while
O	I
O	held
O	the
O	upper
O	part
O	of
O	it
O	over
O	my
O	own
O	neck
O	.
O	And
O	thus
O	I
O	withstood
O	the
O	shower
O	.
O	Presently
O	the
O	sky
O	became
O	clear
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	that
O	,
O	behold
O	,
O	the
O	birds
O	lighted
O	upon
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	sang
O	.
O	Truly
O	,
O	Kay
O	,
O	I
O	never
O	heard
O	any
O	melody
O	equal
O	to
O	that
O	,
O	either
O	before
O	or
O	since
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	most
O	charmed
O	with
O	listening
O	to
O	the
O	birds
O	,
O	lo
O	!
O	a
O	chiding
O	voice
O	was
O	heard
O	of
O	one
O	approaching
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	saying
O	:
O	'
O	O
O	knight
O	,
O	what
O	has
O	brought
O	thee
O	hither
O	?
O	What
O	evil
O	have
O	I
O	done
O	to
O	thee
O	,
O	that
O	thou
O	shouldst
O	act
O	toward
O	me
O	and
O	my
O	possessions
O	as
O	thou
O	hast
O	this
O	day
O	?
O	Dost
O	thou
O	not
O	know
O	that
O	the
O	shower
O	to-day
O	has
O	left
O	in
O	my
O	dominions
O	neither
O	man
O	nor
O	beast
O	alive
O	that
O	was
O	exposed
O	to
O	it
O	?
O	'
O	And
O	thereupon
O	,
O	behold
O	,
O	a
O	knight
O	on
O	a
O	black
O	horse
O	appeared
O	,
O	clothed
O	in
O	jet-black
O	velvet
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	tabard
O	of
O	black
O	linen
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	We
O	charged
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	onset
O	was
O	furious
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	I
O	was
O	overthrown
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	knight
O	passed
O	the
O	shaft
O	of
O	his
O	lance
O	through
O	the
O	bridle-rein
O	of
O	my
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	off
O	with
O	the
O	two
O	horses
O	,
O	leaving
O	me
O	where
O	I
O	was
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	even
O	bestow
O	so
O	much
O	notice
O	upon
O	me
O	as
O	to
O	imprison
O	me
O	,
O	nor
O	did
O	he
O	despoil
O	me
O	of
O	my
O	arms
O	.
O	So
O	I
O	returned
O	along
O	the
O	road
O	by
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	come
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	I
O	reached
O	the
O	glade
O	where
O	the
O	black
O	man
O	was
O	,
O	I
O	confess
O	to
O	thee
O	,
O	Kay
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	a
O	marvel
O	that
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	melt
O	down
O	into
O	a
O	liquid
O	pool
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	shame
O	that
O	I
O	felt
O	at
O	the
O	black
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	derision
O	.
O	That
O	night
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	same
O	castle
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	spent
O	the
O	night
O	preceding
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	was
O	more
O	agreeably
O	entertained
O	that
O	night
O	than
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	night
O	before
O	.
O	I
O	conversed
O	freely
O	with
O	the
O	inmates
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	none
O	of
O	them
O	alluded
O	to
O	my
O	expedition
O	to
O	the
O	fountain
O	,
O	neither
O	did
O	I
O	mention
O	it
O	to
O	any
O	.
O	And
O	I
O	remained
O	there
O	that
O	night
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	arose
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	I
O	found
O	ready
O	saddled
O	a
O	dark
O	bay
O	palfrey
O	,
O	with
O	nostrils
O	as
O	red
O	as
O	scarlet
O	.
O	After
O	putting
O	on
O	my
O	armor
O	,
O	and
O	leaving
O	there
O	my
O	blessing
O	,
O	I
O	returned
O	to
O	my
O	own
O	court
O	.
O	That
O	horse
O	I
O	still
O	possess
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	is
O	in
O	the
O	stable
O	yonder
O	.
O	And
O	I
O	declare
O	that
O	I
O	would
O	not
O	part
O	with
O	him
O	for
O	the
O	best
O	palfrey
O	in
