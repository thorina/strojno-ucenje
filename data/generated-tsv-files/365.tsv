O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	king
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	a
O	daughter
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	lovely
O	that
O	the
O	reports
O	of
O	her
O	beauty
O	went
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	;
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	melancholy
O	that
O	she
O	never
O	laughed
O	,
O	and
O	besides
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	grand
O	and
O	proud
O	that
O	she
O	said
O	``
O	No
O	``
O	to
O	all
O	who
O	came
O	to
O	woo
O	her
O	--
O	she
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	any
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	were
O	they
O	ever
O	so
O	fine
O	,
O	whether
O	they
O	were
O	princes
O	or
O	noblemen
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	was
O	tired
O	of
O	this
O	whim
O	of
O	hers
O	long
O	ago
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	she
O	ought
O	to
O	get
O	married
O	like
O	other
O	people
O	;
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	she
O	need
O	wait
O	for
O	--
O	she
O	was
O	old
O	enough
O	and
O	she
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	any
O	richer
O	either
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	to
O	have
O	half
O	the
O	kingdom
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	inherited
O	after
O	her
O	mother
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	made
O	known
O	every
O	Sunday
O	after
O	the
O	service
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	steps
O	outside
O	the
O	church
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	that
O	could
O	make
O	his
O	daughter
O	laugh
O	should
O	have
O	both
O	her
O	and
O	half
O	the
O	kingdom
O	.
O	But
O	if
O	there
O	were
O	any
O	one
O	who
O	tried
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	make
O	her
O	laugh
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	three
O	red
O	stripes
O	cut
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	back
O	and
O	salt
O	rubbed
O	into
O	them
O	--
O	and
O	,
O	sad
O	to
O	relate
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	many
O	sore
O	backs
O	in
O	that
O	kingdom
O	.
O	Lovers
O	from
O	south
O	and
O	from
O	north
O	,
O	from
O	east
O	and
O	from
O	west
O	,
O	came
O	to
O	try
O	their
O	luck
O	--
O	they
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	an
O	easy
O	thing
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	princess
O	laugh
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	a
O	queer
O	lot
O	altogether
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	all
O	their
O	cleverness
O	and
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	tricks
O	and
O	pranks
O	they
O	played
O	,
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	just
O	as
O	serious
O	and
O	immovable
O	as
O	ever
O	.
O	But
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	lived
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	had
O	three
O	sons
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	also
O	heard
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	made
O	known
O	that
O	he
O	who
O	could
O	make
O	the
O	princess
O	laugh
O	should
O	have
O	her
O	and
O	half
O	the
O	kingdom
O	.
O	The
O	eldest
O	of
O	the
O	brothers
O	wanted
O	to
O	try
O	first
O	,
O	and
O	away
O	he
O	went
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	he
O	told
O	the
O	king
O	he
O	wouldn
O	'
O	t
O	mind
O	trying
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	princess
O	laugh
O	.
O	``
O	Yes
O	,
O	yes
O	!
O	that
O	'
O	s
O	all
O	very
O	well
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	;
O	``
O	but
O	I
O	am
O	afraid
O	it
O	'
O	s
O	of
O	very
O	little

O	,
O	my
O	man
O	.
O	There
O	have
O	been
O	many
O	here
O	to
O	try
O	their
O	luck
O	,
O	but
O	my
O	daughter
O	is
O	just
O	as
O	sad
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	am
O	afraid
O	it
O	is
O	no
O	good
O	trying
O	.
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	like
O	to
O	see
O	any
O	more
O	suffer
O	on
O	that
O	account
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	the
O	lad
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	try
O	anyhow
O	.
O	It
O	couldn
O	'
O	t
O	be
O	such
O	a
O	difficult
O	thing
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	princess
O	laugh
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	had
O	not
O	everybody
O	,
O	both
O	grand
O	and
O	simple
O	,
O	laughed
O	so
O	many
O	a
O	time
O	at
O	him
O	when
O	he
O	served
O	as
O	soldier
O	and
O	went
O	through
O	his
O	drill
O	under
O	Sergeant
O	Nils
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	went
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	terrace
O	outside
O	the
O	princess
O	'
O	s
O	windows
O	and
O	began
O	drilling
O	just
O	as
O	if
O	Sergeant
O	Nils
O	himself
O	were
O	there
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	in
O	vain
O	!
O	The
O	princess
O	sat
O	just
O	as
O	serious
O	and
O	immovable
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	they
O	took
O	him
O	and
O	cut
O	three
O	broad
O	,
O	red
O	stripes
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	back
O	and
O	sent
O	him
O	home
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	arrived
O	home
O	than
O	his
O	second
O	brother
O	wanted
O	to
O	set
O	out
O	and
O	try
O	his
O	luck
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	schoolmaster
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	funny
O	figure
O	he
O	was
O	altogether
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	one
O	leg
O	shorter
O	than
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	limped
O	terribly
O	when
O	he
O	walked
O	.
O	One
O	moment
O	he
O	was
O	no
O	bigger
O	than
O	a
O	boy
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	next
O	moment
O	when
O	he
O	raised
O	himself
O	up
O	on
O	his
O	long
O	leg
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	big
O	and
O	tall
O	as
O	a
O	giant
O	--
O	and
O	besides
O	he
O	was
O	great
O	at
O	preaching
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	wanted
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	princess
O	laugh
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	thought
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	unlikely
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	;
O	``
O	but
O	I
O	pity
O	you
O	,
O	if
O	you
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	succeed
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	``
O	for
O	we
O	cut
O	the
O	stripes
O	broader
O	and
O	broader
O	for
O	every
O	one
O	that
O	tries
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	schoolmaster
O	went
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	terrace
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	his
O	place
O	outside
O	the
O	princess
O	'
O	s
O	window
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	began
O	preaching
O	and
O	chanting
O	imitating
O	seven
O	of
O	the
O	parsons
O	,
O	and
O	reading
O	and
O	singing
O	just
O	like
O	seven
O	of
O	the
O	clerks
O	whom
O	they
O	had
O	had
O	in
O	the
O	parish
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	laughed
O	at
O	the
O	schoolmaster
O	till
O	he
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	hold
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	door-post
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	just
O	on
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	smiling
O	,
O	but
O	suddenly
O	she
O	was
O	as
O	sad
O	and
O	immovable
O	as
O	ever
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	it
O	fared
O	no
O	better
O	with
O	Paul
O	the
O	schoolmaster
O	than
O	with
O	Peter
O	the
O	soldier
O	--
O	for
O	Peter
O	and
O	Paul
O	were
O	their
O	names
O	,
O	you
O	must
O	know
O	!
O	So
O	they
O	took
O	Paul
O	and
O	cut
O	three
O	red
O	stripes
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	put
O	salt
O	into
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	him
O	home
O	again
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	the
O	youngest
O	brother
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	a
O	try
O	next
O	.
O	His
O	name
O	was
O	Hans
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	brothers
O	laughed
O	and
O	made
O	fun
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	him
O	their
O	sore
O	backs
O	.
O	Besides
O	,
O	the
O	father
O	would
O	not
O	give
O	him
O	leave
O	to
O	go
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	use
O	his
O	trying
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	so
O	little
O	sense
O	;
O	all
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	was
O	to
O	sit
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	on
O	the
O	hearth
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	cat
O	,
O	rooting
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	ashes
O	and
O	cutting
O	chips
O	.
O	But
O	Hans
O	would
O	not
O	give
O	in
O	--
O	he
O	begged
O	and
O	prayed
O	so
O	long
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	got
O	tired
O	of
O	his
O	whimpering
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	he
O	got
O	leave
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	palace
O	and
O	try
O	his
O	luck
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	palace
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	say
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	try
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	princess
O	laugh
O	,
O	but
O	asked
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	get
O	a
O	situation
O	there
O	.
O	No
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	no
O	situation
O	for
O	him
O	;
O	but
O	Hans
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	easily
O	put
O	off
O	--
O	they
O	might
O	want
O	one
O	to
O	carry
O	wood
O	and
O	water
O	for
O	the
O	kitchenmaid
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	big
O	place
O	as
O	that
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	.
O	Yes
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	thought
O	so
O	too
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	get
O	rid
O	of
O	the
O	lad
O	he
O	gave
O	him
O	leave
O	to
O	remain
O	there
O	and
O	carry
O	wood
O	and
O	water
O	for
O	the
O	kitchenmaid
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	fetch
O	water
O	from
O	the
O	brook
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	big
O	fish
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	just
O	under
O	an
O	old
O	root
O	of
O	a
O	fir-tree
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	current
O	had
O	carried
O	all
O	the
O	soil
O	away
O	from
O	.
O	He
O	put
O	his
O	bucket
O	quietly
O	under
O	the
O	fish
O	and
O	caught
O	it
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	home
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	he
O	met
O	an
O	old
O	woman
O	leading
O	a
O	golden
O	goose
O	.
O	``
O	Good
O	day
O	,

O	``

O	and
O	spoke
O	so
O	nicely
O	to
O	Hans
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	to
O	let
O	her
O	stroke
O	that
O	lovely
O	golden
O	goose
O	of
O	his
O	.
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	yes

O	said
O	Hans
O	,
O	``
O	but
O	you

O	off
O	any

O	!
O	``
O	Just
O	as
O	she
O	stroked
O	the
O	bird
O	,
O	Hans
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	If

O	along
O	,
O	then

O	``
O	The
O	woman
O	pulled
O	and
O	tore
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	had
O	to
O	hang
O	on
O	,
O	whether
O	she
O	would
O	or
O	no
O	,
O	and
O	Hans
O	walked
O	on
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	only
O	had
O	the
O	goose
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	When

O	gone
O	some

O	,
O	he
O	met
O	a
O	man

O	against
O	the
O	woman
O	for
O	a
O	trick
O	she
O	had
O	played
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	When

O	saw
O	that

O	so
O	hard
O	to
O	get
O	free
O	and
O	seemed
O	to

O	her
O	off

O	the
O	grudge
O	he
O	owed
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	he
O	gave
O	her
O	a
O	kick
O	.
O	``
O	If

O	,
O	then
O	hang
O	on

O	``
O	said
O	Hans
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	man
O	had
O	to
O	hang
O	on
O	and
O	limp
O	along
O	on
O	one
O	leg
O	,
O	whether
O	he
O	would
O	or
O	no
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	tried
O	to
O	tear
O	himself
O	loose
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	it
O	still
O	worse
O	for
O	himself
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	nearly
O	falling
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	whenever
O	he
O	struggled
O	to
O	get
O	free
O	.
O	So
O	on
O	they
O	went
O	till
O	they
O	came
O	in
O	the
O	neighborhood
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	There
O	they
O	met
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	smith
O	;
O	he
O	was
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	smithy
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	large
O	pair
O	of
O	tongs
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	This
O	smith
O	was
O	a
O	merry
O	fellow
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	always
O	full
O	of
O	mad
O	pranks
O	and
O	tricks
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	this
O	procession
O	coming
O	jumping
O	and
O	limping
O	along
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	laughing
O	till
O	he
O	was
O	bent
O	in
O	two
O	,
O	but
O	suddenly
O	he
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	This
O	must
O	be
O	a
O	new
O	flock
O	of
O	geese
O	for
O	the
O	princess
O	:
O	but
O	who
O	can
O	tell
O	which
O	is
O	goose
O	and
O	which
O	is
O	gander
O	?
O	I
O	suppose
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	the
O	gander
O	toddling
O	on
O	in
O	front
O	.
O	Goosey
O	,
O	goosey
O	!
O	``
O	he
O	called
O	,
O	and
O	pretended
O	to
O	be
O	strewing
O	corn
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	hands
O	as
O	when
O	feeding
O	geese
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	stop
O	.
O	The
O	woman
O	and
O	the
O	man
O	only
O	looked
O	in
O	great
O	rage
O	at
O	the
O	smith
O	for
O	making
O	game
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	So
O	said
O	the
O	smith
O	:
O	``
O	It
O	would
O	be
O	great
O	fun
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	I
O	could
O	stop
O	the
O	whole
O	flock
O	,
O	many
O	as
O	they
O	are
O	!
O	``
O	--
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	strong
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	seized
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	with
O	his
O	tongs
O	from
O	behind
O	in
O	his
O	trousers
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	man
O	shouted
O	and
O	struggled
O	hard
O	,
O	but
O	Hans
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	If
O	you
O	'
O	ll
O	come
O	along
O	,
O	then
O	hang
O	on
O	!
O	``
O	And
O	so
O	the
O	smith
O	had
O	to
O	hang
O	on
O	too
O	.
O	He
O	bent
O	his
O	back
O	and
O	stuck
O	his
O	heels
O	in
O	the
O	ground
O	when
O	they
O	went
O	up
O	a
O	hill
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	get
O	away
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	of
O	no
O	use
O	;
O	he
O	stuck
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	screwed
O	fast
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	vise
O	in
O	the
O	smithy
O	,
O	and
O	whether
O	he
O	liked
O	it
O	or
O	not
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	dance
O	along
O	with
O	the
O	others
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	near
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	the
O	farm-dog
O	ran
O	against
O	them
O	and
O	barked
O	at
O	them
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	a
O	gang
O	of
O	tramps
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	princess
O	came
O	to
O	look
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	window
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	this
O	procession
O	,
O	she
O	burst
O	out
O	laughing
O	.
O	But
O	Hans
O	was
O	not
O	satisfied
O	with
O	that
O	.
O	``
O	Just
O	wait
O	a
O	bit
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	will
O	laugh
O	still
O	louder
O	very
O	soon
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	tour
O	round
O	the
O	palace
O	with
O	his
O	followers
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	past
O	the
O	kitchen
O	,
O	the
O	door
O	was
O	open
O	and
O	the
O	cook
O	was
O	just
O	boiling
O	porridge
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	Hans
O	and
O	his
O	train
O	after
O	him
O	,
O	she
O	rushed
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	door
O	with
O	the
O	porridge-stick
O	in
O	one
O	hand
O	and
O	a
O	big
O	ladle
O	full
O	of
O	boiling
O	porridge
O	in
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	laughed
O	till
O	her
O	sides
O	shook
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	smith
O	there
O	as
O	well
O	,
O	she
O	thought
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	burst
O	with
O	laughter
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	had
O	had
O	a
O	regular
O	good
O	laugh
O	,
O	she
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	golden
O	goose
O	again
O	and
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	lovely
O	that
O	she
O	must
O	stroke
O	it
O	.
O	``
O	Hans
O	,
O	Hans
O	!
O	``
O	she
O	cried
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	after

O	;
O	``

O	``
O	Rather
O	let
O	her
O	stroke

O	said
O	the
O	smith
O	.
O	``
O	Very
O	well

O	said
O	Hans
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	cook
O	heard
O	this
O	,
O	she
O	got
O	very
O	angry
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	is
O	it
O	you
O	say
O	!
O	``
O	she
O	cried
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	the
O	smith
O	a
O	smack
O	with
O	the
O	ladle
O	.
O	``
O	If

O	'
O	ll
O	come
O	along
O	,
O	then
O	hang
O	on

O	``
O	said
O	Hans
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	she
O	stuck
O	fast
O	to
O	the
O	others
O	too
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	all
O	her
O	scolding
O	and
O	all
O	her
O	tearing
O	and
O	pulling
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	to
O	limp
O	along
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	came
O	past
O	the
O	princess
O	'
O	s
O	window
O	again
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	still
O	there
O	waiting
O	for
O	them
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	got
O	hold
O	of
O	the
O	cook
O	too
O	,
O	with
O	the

O	laughed
O	till
O	the

O	So
O	Hans
O	got
O	the
O	princess
O	and
O	half
O	the
O	kingdom
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	a

O	wide
O	.
