O	The

O	s
O	best

O	is
O	the

O	by

O	and

O	As
O	long
O	as
O	the

O	'
O	s
O	dog
O	has
O	strength
O	,
O	he
O	will
O	fight
O	for

O	The
O	Indian
O	says
O	this
O	is
O	how
O	the
O	dog
O	came
O	to
O	take
O	his
O	part
O	.
O	An
O	Indian
O	and
O	his
O	dogs
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	to
O	hunt
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	when
O	dogs
O	and
O	men
O	could
O	talk
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	understood
O	the
O	language
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	the
O	dogs
O	began
O	to
O	talk
O	with
O	the
O	Indian
O	.
O	They
O	told
O	him
O	many
O	wonderful
O	things
O	about
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	.
O	They
O	taught
O	him
O	many
O	tricks
O	of
O	the
O	chase
O	:
O	how
O	to
O	scent
O	and
O	track
O	the
O	game
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	trails
O	.
O	The
O	man
O	listened
O	to
O	what
O	the
O	dogs
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	did
O	as
O	they
O	told
O	him
O	.
O	Soon
O	the
O	sledge
O	which
O	the
O	dogs
O	had
O	drawn
O	to
O	the
O	woods
O	was
O	piled
O	high
O	with
O	deer
O	and
O	other
O	game
O	.
O	Never
O	had
O	the
O	Indian
O	'
O	s
O	arrows
O	brought
O	him
O	so
O	much
O	game
O	.
O	Never
O	had
O	he
O	met
O	with
O	such
O	success
O	in
O	hunting
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	pleased
O	that
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	dogs
O	,
O	``
O	Always
O	shall
O	I

O	When

O	meet
O	for

O	they
O	try

O	sunrise
O	give
O	his

O	Indians
O	always

O	From

O	In

O	grew

O	cooking

O	bit
O	of
O	this
O	chestnut
O	grated
O	into

O	,
O	and

O	little
O	son
O	Greedy
O	Fawn

O	The

O	,
O	and

O	went

O	promised

O	He
O	watched
O	his
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	disappear
O	down
O	the
O	western
O	trail
O	.

O	he
O	ran
O	and
O	gathered
O	some
O	sticks
O	.
O	He
O	built
O	a
O	fire
O	with
O	the
O	sticks
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	hung
O	the
O	kettle
O	over
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	some
O	water
O	in
O	it
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	chestnut
O	.
O	He
O	grated
O	a
O	little
O	of
O	the
O	chestnut
O	into
O	the
O	kettle
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	stir
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	grated
O	some
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	more
O	.
O	Faster
O	and
O	faster
O	Greedy
O	Fawn
O	stirred
O	the
O	boiling
O	porridge
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	began
O	to
O	swell
O	and
O	fill
O	the
O	kettle
O	.
O	Larger
O	and
O	larger
O	,

O	grew

O	Greedy
O	Fawn
O	was
O	so
O	frightened
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	will
O	it
O	never
O	stop
O	swelling
O	?
O	``
O	he
O	thought
O	.
O	Harder
O	and
O	harder
O	he
O	stirred
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	porridge
O	from
O	boiling
O	over
O	.
O	Beads
O	of
O	perspiration
O	ran
O	down
O	his
O	little
O	bronze
O	face
O	,
O	yet
O	still
O	he
O	stirred
O	.
O	He
O	dared
O	not
O	stop
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	remembered
O	that
O	sometimes
O	his
O	mother
O	would
O	rap
O	the
O	kettle
O	with
O	the
O	porridge
O	stick
O	,
O	if
O	it
O	became
O	too
O	full
O	.
O	Rap
O	,
O	rap
O	,
O	rap
O	,
O	went
O	the
O	porridge
O	stick
O	on
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	kettle
O	.
O	Instantly
O	the
O	_kettle_
O	began
O	to
O	swell
O	.
O	Larger
O	,
O	and
O	larger
O	,
O	and
O	larger
O	it
O	grew
O	.
O	Greedy
O	Fawn
O	was
O	so
O	frightened
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	Now
O	Greedy
O	Fawn
O	could
O	not
O	reach
O	across
O	the
O	kettle
O	,
O	to
O	stir
O	the
O	porridge
O	with
O	his
O	stick
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	run
O	around
O	it
O	.
O	And
O	around
O	,
O	and
O	around
O	,
O	and
O	around
O	the
O	kettle
O	he
O	ran
O	,
O	stirring
O	,
O	and
O	stirring
O	,
O	and
O	stirring
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	kettle
O	was
O	so
O	large
O	that
O	it
O	nearly
O	filled
O	the
O	wigwam
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	just
O	space
O	enough
O	left
O	for
O	Greedy
O	Fawn
O	to
O	run
O	around
O	it
O	.
O	And
O	around
O	,
O	and
O	around
O	,
O	and
O	around
O	the
O	kettle
O	he
O	ran
O	,
O	stirring
O	,
O	and
O	stirring
O	,
O	and
O	stirring
O	.
O	Oh
O	,
O	how
O	his
O	little
O	arms
O	ached
O	!
O	And
O	,
O	oh
O	,
O	how
O	tired
O	his
O	small
O	legs
O	were
O	!
O	But
O	still
O	he
O	ran
O	.
O	He
O	dared
O	not
O	stop
O	.
O	Here
O	was
O	porridge
O	enough
O	to
O	last
O	a
O	small
O	boy
O	a
O	lifetime
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	stop
O	to
O	taste
O	one
O	mouthful
O	!
O	At
O	last
O	Greedy
O	Fawn
O	could
O	run
O	no
O	longer
O	.
O	He
O	stumbled
O	and
O	fell
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	kettle
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	too
O	weak
O	to
O	rise
O	.
O	The
O	stick
O	fell
O	from
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	porridge
O	boiled
O	on
O	.
O	Higher
O	,
O	and
O	higher
O	,
O	and
O	higher
O	it
O	rose
O	,
O	until
O	it
O	ran
O	over
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	kettle
O	.
O	Closer
O	,
O	and
O	closer
O	the
O	boiling
O	porridge
O	crept
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	Indian
O	boy
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	Greedy
O	Fawn
O	and
O	his
O	stick
O	were
O	nearly
O	buried
O	in
O	porridge
O	.
O	For
O	once
O	Greedy
O	Fawn
O	had
O	all
O	the
O	porridge
O	he
O	wanted
O	.
O	And
O	never
O	again
O	would
O	he
O	have
O	wanted
O	anything
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	Deerheart
O	and
O	Sky
O	Elk
O	heard
O	his
O	cries
O	,
O	and
O	come
O	running
O	like
O	deer
O	up
O	the
O	trail
O	to
O	save
O	him
O	.
