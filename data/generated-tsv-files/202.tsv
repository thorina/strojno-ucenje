O	In
O	a
O	far-off
O	country
O	there
O	was
O	once
O	a
O	little
O	girl
O	who
O	was
O	called
O	Silver-hair
O	,
O	because
O	her
O	curly
O	hair
O	shone
O	brightly
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	a
O	sad
O	romp
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	restless
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	kept
O	quiet
O	at
O	home
O	,
O	but
O	must
O	needs
O	run
O	out
O	and
O	away
O	,
O	without
O	leave
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	she
O	started
O	off
O	into
O	a
O	wood
O	to
O	gather
O	wild
O	flowers
O	,
O	and
O	into
O	the
O	fields
O	to
O	chase
O	butterflies
O	.
O	She
O	ran
O	here
O	and
O	she
O	ran
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	so
O	far
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	found
O	herself
O	in
O	a
O	lonely
O	place
O	,
O	where
O	she
O	saw
O	a
O	snug
O	little
O	house
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	three
O	bears
O	lived;
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	then
O	at
O	home
O	.
O	The
O	door
O	was
O	ajar
O	,
O	and
O	Silver-hair
O	pushed
O	it
O	open
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	place
O	to
O	be
O	quite
O	empty
O	,
O	so
O	she
O	made
O	up
O	her
O	mind
O	to
O	go
O	in
O	boldly
O	,
O	and
O	look
O	all
O	about
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	little
O	thinking
O	what
O	sort
O	of
O	people
O	lived
O	there
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	three
O	bears
O	had
O	gone
O	out
O	to
O	walk
O	a
O	little
O	before
O	this
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	the
O	Big
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Middle-sized
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Little
O	Bear;
O	but
O	they
O	had
O	left
O	their
O	porridge
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	to
O	cool
O	.
O	So
O	when
O	Silver-hair
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	kitchen
O	,
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	three
O	bowls
O	of
O	porridge
O	.
O	She
O	tasted
O	the
O	largest
O	bowl
O	,
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	the
O	Big
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	too
O	cold;
O	then
O	she
O	tasted
O	the
O	middle-sized
O	bowl
O	,
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	the
O	Middle-sized
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	too
O	hot;
O	then
O	she
O	tasted
O	the
O	smallest
O	bowl
O	,
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	the
O	Little
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	just
O	right
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	ate
O	it
O	all
O	.
O	She
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	parlour
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	were
O	three
O	chairs
O	.
O	She
O	tried
O	the
O	biggest
O	chair
O	,
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	the
O	Big
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	too
O	high;
O	then
O	she
O	tried
O	the
O	middle-sized
O	chair
O	,
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	the
O	Middle-sized
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	found
O	it
O	too
O	broad;
O	then
O	she
O	tried
O	the
O	little
O	chair
O	,
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	the
O	Little
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	just
O	right
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	sat
O	in
O	it
O	so
O	hard
O	that
O	she
O	broke
O	it
O	.
O	Now
O	Silver-hair
O	was
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	very
O	tired
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	went
O	upstairs
O	to
O	the
O	chamber
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	she
O	found
O	three
O	beds
O	.
O	She
O	tried
O	the
O	largest
O	bed
O	,
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	the
O	Big
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	too
O	soft;
O	then
O	she
O	tried
O	the
O	middle-sized
O	bed
O	,
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	the
O	Middle-sized
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	found
O	it
O	too
O	hard;
O	then
O	she
O	tried
O	the
O	smallest
O	bed
O	,
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	the
O	Little
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	just
O	right
O	,
O	so
O	she
O	lay
O	down
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	fast
O	asleep
O	.
O	While
O	Silver-hair
O	was
O	lying
O	fast
O	asleep
O	,
O	the
O	three
O	bears
O	came
O	home
O	from
O	their
O	walk
O	.
O	They
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	kitchen
O	,
O	to
O	get
O	their
O	porridge
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	Big
O	Bear
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	,
O	he
O	growled
O	out

O	:
