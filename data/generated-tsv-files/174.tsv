O	Murray
O	was
O	King
O	of
O	Suddenne
O	in
O	the
O	west
O	country
O	,
O	a
O	wise
O	king
O	whom
O	all
O	his
O	subjects
O	honoured
O	.
O	Godhild
O	was
O	his
O	queen
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	woman
O	of
O	that
O	day
O	was
O	lovelier
O	than
O	she
O	.
O	Their
O	son
O	was
O	named
O	Horn
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	Horn
O	was
O	fifteen
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	the
O	sun
O	shone
O	and
O	the
O	rain
O	fell
O	on
O	no
O	fairer
O	boy
O	.
O	Twelve
O	squires
O	,
O	each
O	one
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	noble
O	birth
O	,
O	were
O	chosen
O	to
O	be
O	Horn
O	'
O	s
O	companions
O	.
O	Athulf
O	was
O	the
O	best
O	and
O	truest
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	dearest
O	to
O	Horn
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	;
O	and
O	one
O	Fikenhild
O	was
O	the
O	basest
O	among
O	them
O	.
O	It
O	pleased
O	King
O	Murry
O	,
O	on
O	a
O	certain
O	summer
O	'
O	s
O	day
O	,
O	to
O	ride
O	,
O	as
O	was
O	his
O	wont
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	with
O	only
O	two
O	comrades
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	rode
O	,
O	they
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	strange
O	sight
O	.
O	There
O	before
O	them
O	on
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	lay
O	fifteen
O	ships
O	beached
O	,
O	full
O	of
O	fierce
O	Saracens
O	;
O	and
O	many
O	other
O	Saracens
O	went
O	busily
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	upon
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	seek
O	you
O	here
O	,
O	pagan
O	men
O	?
O	``
O	cried
O	Murry
O	at
O	that
O	sight
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	wares
O	do
O	you
O	bring
O	to
O	this
O	my
O	land
O	of
O	Suddenne
O	?
O	``
O	For
O	he
O	thought
O	them
O	to

O	,
O	``

O	``
O	Thereat
O	Murry
O	was
O	sorely
O	troubled
O	in
O	heart
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	no
O	sign
O	of
O	fear
O	.
O	He
O	and
O	his
O	two
O	companions
O	,
O	with
O	bold
O	mien
O	,
O	leapt
O	down
O	from
O	their
O	horses
O	,
O	to
O	fight
O	more
O	readily
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	their
O	swords
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	pagans
O	.
O	Many
O	a
O	stout
O	blow
O	they
O	dealt
O	;
O	many
O	a
O	Saracen
O	felt
O	the
O	strength
O	of
O	their
O	arms
O	:
O	but
O	for
O	all
O	their
O	might
O	and
O	valour
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	but
O	three
O	against
O	a
O	host
O	.
O	From
O	every
O	side
O	the
O	enemy
O	fell
O	upon
O	them
O	unceasingly
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	they
O	lay
O	there
O	dead
O	upon
O	the
O	sand
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Saracens
O	left
O	their
O	ships
O	and
O	spread
O	over
O	the
O	whole
O	of
O	Suddenne
O	,
O	slaying
O	and
O	burning
O	and
O	laying
O	waste

O	None

O	he
O	forswore
O	the

O	Of
O	all
O	women
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	Godhild
O	the
O	queen
O	was
O	saddest

O	Her

O	,
O	and

O	But
O	worse
O	befell
O	her
O	,
O	for
O	on
O	a
O	certain
O	day
O	the
O	Saracens
O	came
O	suddenly
O	and
O	took
O	Horn
O	prisoner
O	and
O	carried
O	him
O	away
O	.
O	Godhild
O	escaped
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	her
O	dire
O	distress
O	fled
O	alone
O	to

O	But
O	their

O	on

O	wringing
O	their

O	and
O	his
O	comrades
O	were
O	led
O	down
O	to
O	the

O	There
O	a

O	All
O	their
O	tears
O	were
O	vain
O	:

O	and
O	turned
O	the
O	little

O	,
O	and

O	the

O	,

O	The

O	sorely
O	at
