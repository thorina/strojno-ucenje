O	Then
O	the

O	was
O	sounded
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	and

O	sat
O	down
O	to

O	When

O	Owain
O	withdrew

O	lodging
O	,

O	arms
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morrow
O	with
O	the
O	dawn
O	of
O	day
O	he
O	put
O	on
O	his

O	and
O	travelled
O	through

O	lands
O	,
O	and
O	over
O	desert
O	mountains
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	he
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	valley
O	which
O	Kynon
O	had
O	described
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he

O	the

O	that

O	sought

O	Journeying

O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	by
O	the

O	of
O	the

O	,
O	he
O	followed
O	its

O	to
O	the
O	plain
O	,
O	and
O	within
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	approached
O	the
O	castle
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	youths
O	shooting
O	with
O	their
O	bows
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	Kynon
O	had
O	seen
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	yellow
O	man
O	,
O	to
O	whom
O	the
O	castle
O	belonged
O	,
O	standing
O	hard
O	by
O	.
O	And
O	no
O	sooner
O	had
O	Owain
O	saluted
O	the
O	yellow
O	man
O	,
O	than
O	he
O	was
O	saluted
O	by
O	him
O	in
O	return
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	forward
O	towards
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	chamber
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	entered
O	the
O	chamber
O	,
O	he
O	beheld
O	the
O	maidens
O	working
O	at
O	satin
O	embroidery
O	,
O	in
O	chains
O	of
O	gold
O	.
O	Their
O	beauty
O	and
O	their
O	comeliness
O	seemed
O	to
O	Owain
O	far
O	greater
O	than
O	Kynon
O	had
O	represented
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	They
O	arose
O	to
O	wait
O	upon
O	Owain
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	done
O	to
O	Kynon
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	meal
O	which
O	they
O	set
O	before
O	him
O	gave
O	even
O	more
O	satisfaction
O	to
O	Owain
O	than
O	it
O	had
O	done
O	to
O	Kynon
O	.
O	About
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	repast
O	the
O	yellow
O	man
O	asked
O	Owain
O	the
O	object
O	of
O	his
O	journey
O	.
O	Owain
O	made
O	it
O	known
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	in
O	quest
O	of
O	the
O	knight
O	who
O	guards
O	the
O	fountain
O	.
O	``
O	Upon
O	this
O	the
O	yellow
O	man
O	smiled
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	loath
O	to
O	point
O	out
O	that
O	adventure
O	to
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	to
O	Kynon
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	he
O	described
O	the
O	whole
O	to
O	Owain
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	retired
O	to
O	rest
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	Owain
O	found
O	his
O	horse
O	made
O	ready
O	for
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	damsels
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	set
O	forward
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	glade
O	where
O	the
O	black
O	man
O	was
O	.
O	The
O	stature
O	of
O	the
O	black
O	man
O	seemed
O	more
O	wonderful
O	to
O	Owain
O	than
O	it
O	had
O	done
O	to
O	Kynon
O	;
O	and
O	Owain
O	asked
O	of
O	him
O	his
O	road
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	showed
O	it
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	Owain
O	followed
O	the
O	road
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	green
O	tree
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	beheld
O	the
O	fountain
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	slab
O	beside
O	the
O	fountain
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	bowl
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	Owain
O	took
O	the
O	bowl
O	and
O	threw
O	a
O	bowlful
O	of
O	water
O	upon
O	the
O	slab
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	lo
O	!
O	the
O	thunder
O	was
O	heard
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	the
O	thunder
O	came
O	the
O	shower
O	,
O	more
O	violent
O	than
O	Kynon
O	had
O	described
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	the
O	shower
O	the
O	sky
O	became
O	bright
O	.
O	Immediately
O	the
O	birds
O	came
O	and
O	settled
O	upon
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	sang
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	their
O	song
O	was
O	most
O	pleasing
O	to
O	Owain
O	he
O	beheld
O	a
O	knight
O	coming
O	towards
O	him
O	through
O	the
O	valley
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	prepared
O	to
O	receive
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	encountered
O	him
O	violently
O	.
O	Having
O	broken
O	both
O	their
O	lances
O	,
O	they
O	drew
O	their
O	swords
O	and
O	fought
O	blade
O	to
O	blade
O	.
O	Then
O	Owain
O	struck
O	the
O	knight
O	a
O	blow
O	through
O	his
O	helmet
O	,
O	head-piece
O	,
O	and
O	visor
O	,
O	and
O	through
O	the
O	skin
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	flesh
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bone
O	,
O	until
O	it
O	wounded
O	the
O	very
O	brain
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	black
O	knight
O	felt
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	received
O	a
O	mortal
O	wound
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	he
O	turned
O	his
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	and
O	fled
O	.
O	Owain
O	pursued
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	followed
O	close
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	although
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	near
O	enough
O	to
O	strike
O	him
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	.
O	Then
O	Owain
O	descried
O	a
O	vast
O	and
O	resplendent
O	castle
O	;
O	and
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	gate
O	.
O	The
O	black
O	knight
O	was
O	allowed
O	to
O	enter
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	portcullis
O	was
O	let
O	fall
O	upon
O	Owain
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	struck
O	his
O	horse
O	behind
O	the
O	saddle
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	him
O	in
O	two
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	away
O	the
O	rowels
O	of
O	the
O	spurs
O	that
O	were
O	upon
O	Owain
O	'
O	s
O	heels
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	portcullis
O	descended
O	to
O	the
O	floor
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	rowels
O	of
O	the
O	spurs
O	and
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	horse
O	were
O	without
O	,
O	and
O	Owain
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	horse
O	remained
O	between
O	the
O	two
O	gates
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	inner
O	gate
O	was
O	closed
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	Owain
O	could
O	not
O	go
O	thence
O	;
O	and
O	Owain
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	perplexing
O	situation
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	this
O	state
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	through
O	an
O	aperture
O	in
O	the
O	gate
O	a
O	street
O	facing
O	him
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	row
O	of
O	houses
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	.
O	He
O	beheld
O	a
O	maiden
O	with
O	yellow
O	,
O	curling
O	hair
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	frontlet
O	of
O	gold
O	upon
O	her
O	head
O	;
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	clad
O	in
O	a
O	dress
O	of
O	yellow
O	satin
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	her
O	feet
O	were
O	shoes
O	of
O	variegated
O	leather
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	approached
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	desired
O	that
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	opened
O	.
O	``
O	Heaven
O	knows
O	,
O	lady

O	said
O	Owain
O	,
O	``

O	And
O	,
O	following

O	falling
O	over

O	shoulders
O	,
O	and

O	Upon

O	``
O	Bring
O	him
O	here
O	to
O	visit
O	me
O	tomorrow
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	countess
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	I

O	time
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	Luned
O	returned
O	home
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	at
O	noon
O	,
O	Owain
O	arrayed
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	coat
O	and
O	a
O	surcoat
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	mantle
O	of
O	yellow
O	satin
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	broad
O	band
O	of
O	gold
O	lace
O	;
O	and
O	on
O	his
O	feet
O	were
O	high
O	shoes
O	of
O	variegated
O	leather
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	fastened
O	by
O	golden
O	clasps
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	lions
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	proceeded
O	to
O	the
O	chamber
O	of
O	the
O	countess
O	.
O	Right
O	glad
O	was
O	the
O	countess
O	of
O	their
O	coming
O	.
O	She
O	gazed
O	steadfastly
O	upon
O	Owain
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Luned
O	,
O	this
O	knight
O	has
O	not
O	the

O	``
O	``
O	What

O	Luned
O	.
O	``
O	I

O	said
O	the

O	,
O	``

O	``
O	``
O	So
O	much

O	Luned
O	,
O	``
O	for

O	There

O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Go
O	back
O	to
O	thine
O	abode
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	countess
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	take
O	counsel
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	the
O	countess
O	caused
O	all
O	her
O	subjects
O	to
O	assemble
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	them
O	that
O	her
O	earldom
O	was
O	left
O	defenceless
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	protected
O	but
O	with
O	horse
O	and
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	military
O	skill
O	.
O	``
O	Therefore
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	this
O	is
O	what
O	I
O	offer
O	for
O	your
O	choice
O	:
O	either
O	let
O	one
O	of
O	you
O	take
O	me
O	,
O	or
O	give
O	your
O	consent
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	husband
O	from
O	elsewhere
O	,
O	to
O	defend
O	my
O	dominions
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	determination
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	better
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	have
O	permission
O	to
O	marry
O	some
O	one
O	from
O	elsewhere
O	;
O	and
O	thereupon
O	she
O	sent
O	for
O	the
O	bishops
O	and
O	archbishops
O	,
O	to
O	celebrate
O	her
O	nuptials
O	with
O	Owain
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	earldom
O	did
O	Owain
O	homage
O	.
O	Owain
O	defended
O	the
O	fountain
O	with
O	lance
O	and
O	sword
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	is
O	the
O	manner
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	defended
O	it
O	.
O	Whensoever
O	a
O	knight
O	came
O	there
O	,
O	he
O	overthrew
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	sold
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	full
O	worth
O	.
O	What
O	he
O	thus
O	gained
O	he
O	divided
O	among
O	his
O	barons
O	and
O	his
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	man
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	world
O	could
O	be
O	more
O	beloved
O	than
O	he
O	was
O	by
O	his
O	subjects
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	was
O	thus
O	for
O	the
O	space
O	of
O	three
O	years
O	.
