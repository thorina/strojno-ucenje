O	Many
O	,
O	many
O	years
O	ago
O	in
O	the
O	far-off
O	land
O	of
O	Hellas
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	call
O	Greece
O	,
O	lived
O	a
O	happy
O	young
O	couple
O	whose
O	names
O	were
O	Alcmene
O	and
O	Amphitryon
O	.
O	Now
O	Amphitryon
O	,
O	the
O	husband
O	,
O	owned
O	many
O	herds
O	of
O	cattle
O	.
O	So
O	also
O	the
O	father
O	of
O	Alcmene
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	King
O	of
O	Mycenae
O	,
O	owned
O	many
O	.
O	All
O	these
O	cattle
O	grazing
O	together
O	and
O	watering
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	springs
O	became
O	united
O	in
O	one
O	herd
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	much
O	trouble
O	,
O	for
O	Amphitryon
O	fell
O	to
O	quarreling
O	with
O	the
O	father
O	of
O	his
O	wife
O	about
O	his
O	portion
O	of
O	the
O	herd
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	slew
O	his
O	father-in-law
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	that
O	day
O	he
O	fled
O	his
O	old
O	home
O	at
O	Mycenae
O	.
O	Alcmene
O	went
O	with
O	her
O	husband
O	and
O	the
O	young
O	couple
O	settled
O	at
O	Thebes
O	,
O	where
O	were
O	born
O	to
O	them
O	two
O	boys
O	--
O	twins
O	--
O	which
O	were
O	later
O	named
O	Hercules
O	and
O	Iphicles
O	.
O	From
O	the
O	child
O	'
O	s
O	very
O	birth
O	Zeus
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	all
O	heaven
O	that
O	is
O	the
O	air
O	and
O	clouds
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	father
O	of
O	gods
O	and
O	men
O	--
O	from
O	the
O	boy
O	'
O	s
O	very
O	birth
O	Zeus
O	loved
O	Hercules
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	Hera
O	,
O	wife
O	of
O	Zeus
O	,
O	who
O	shared
O	his
O	honours
O	,
O	saw
O	this
O	love
O	she
O	was
O	angry
O	.
O	Especially
O	she
O	was
O	angry
O	because
O	Zeus
O	foretold
O	that
O	Hercules
O	should
O	become
O	the
O	greatest
O	of
O	men
O	.
O	Therefore
O	one
O	night
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	two
O	babies
O	were
O	but
O	eight
O	months
O	old
O	,
O	Hera
O	sent
O	two
O	huge
O	serpents
O	to
O	destroy
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	children
O	were
O	asleep
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	shield
O	of
O	brass
O	which
O	Amphitryon
O	carried
O	in
O	battle
O	for
O	his
O	defence
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	bed
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	round
O	and
O	curved
O	toward
O	the
O	centre
O	,
O	and
O	filled
O	with
O	soft
O	blankets
O	which
O	Alcmene
O	and
O	the
O	maids
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	had
O	woven
O	at
O	their
O	looms
O	.
O	Forward
O	toward
O	this
O	shield
O	the
O	huge
O	snakes
O	were
O	creeping
O	,
O	and
O	just
O	as
O	they
O	lifted
O	their
O	open
O	mouths
O	above
O	the
O	rim
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	making
O	ready
O	to
O	seize
O	them
O	,
O	the
O	twins
O	opened
O	their
O	eyes
O	.
O	Iphicles
O	screamed
O	with
O	fright
O	.
O	His
O	cries
O	wakened
O	their
O	mother
O	,
O	Alcmene
O	,
O	who
O	called
O	in
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	for
O	help
O	.
O	But
O	before
O	Amphitryon
O	and
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	household
O	could
O	draw
O	their
O	swords
O	and
O	rush
O	to
O	the
O	rescue
O	,
O	the
O	baby
O	Hercules
O	,
O	sitting
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	shield
O	unterrified
O	and
O	seizing
O	a
O	serpent
O	in
O	each
O	hand
O	,
O	had
O	choked
O	and
O	strangled
O	them
O	till
O	they
O	died
O	.
O	From
O	his
O	early
O	years
O	Hercules
O	was
O	instructed
O	in
O	the
O	learning
O	of
O	his
O	time
O	.
O	Castor
O	,
O	the
O	most
O	experienced
O	charioteer
O	of
O	his
O	day
O	,
O	taught
O	him
O	,
O	Eurytus
O	also
O	,
O	how
O	to
O	shoot
O	with
O	a
O	bow
O	and
O	arrows
O	;
O	Linus
O	how
O	to
O	play
O	upon
O	the
O	lyre
O	;
O	and
O	Eumolpus
O	,
O	grandson
O	of
O	the
O	North
O	Wind
O	,
O	drilled
O	him
O	in
O	singing
O	.
O	Thus
O	time
O	passed
O	to
O	his
O	eighteenth
O	year
O	when
O	,
O	so
O	great
O	already
O	had
O	become
O	his
O	strength
O	and
O	knowledge
O	,
O	he
O	killed
O	a
O	fierce
O	lion
O	which
O	had
O	preyed
O	upon
O	the
O	flocks
O	of
O	Amphitryon
O	while
O	they
O	were
O	grazing
O	on
O	Mount
O	Cithaeron
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	had
O	in
O	fact
O	laid
O	waste
O	many
O	a
O	fat
O	farm
O	of
O	the
O	surrounding
O	country
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	anger
O	of
O	Hera
O	still
O	followed
O	Hercules
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	goddess
O	sent
O	upon
O	him
O	a
O	madness
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	craze
O	the
O	hero
O	did
O	many
O	unhappy
O	deeds
O	.
O	For
O	punishment
O	and
O	in
O	expiation
O	he
O	condemned
O	himself
O	to
O	exile
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	shrine
O	of
O	the
O	god
O	Apollo
O	at
O	Delphi
O	to
O	ask
O	whither
O	he
O	should
O	go
O	and
O	where
O	settle
O	.
O	The
O	Pythia
O	,
O	or
O	priestess
O	in
O	the
O	temple
O	,
O	desired
O	him
O	to
O	settle
O	at
O	Tiryns
O	,
O	to
O	serve
O	as
O	bondman
O	to
O	Eurystheus
O	,
O	who
O	ruled
O	at
O	Mycenae
O	as
O	King
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	perform
O	the
O	great
O	labours
O	which
O	Eurystheus
O	should
O	impose
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	these
O	tasks
O	were
O	all
O	accomplished
O	,
O	the
O	inspired
O	priestess
O	added
O	,
O	Hercules
O	should
O	be
O	numbered
O	among
O	the
O	immortal
O	gods
O	.
O	THE
O	FIRST
O	LABOUR
O	--
O	WRESTLING
O	WITH
O	THE
O	NEMEAN
O	LION
O	The
O	first
O	task
O	which
O	Eurystheus
O	required
O	of
O	Hercules
O	was
O	to
O	bring
O	him
O	the
O	skin
O	of
O	a
O	lion
O	which
O	no
O	arrow
O	nor
O	other
O	weapon
O	could
O	wound
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	had
O	long
O	been
O	a
O	terror
O	to
O	the
O	good
O	people
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	Nemea
O	.
O	Hercules
O	set
O	forth
O	armed
O	with
O	bow
O	and
O	quiver
O	,
O	but
O	paused
O	in
O	the
O	outer
O	wood
O	of
O	Nemea
O	long
O	enough
O	to
O	cut
O	himself
O	his
O	famous
O	club
O	.
O	There
O	too
O	he
O	fell
O	in
O	with
O	an
O	honest
O	countryman
O	who
O	pledged
O	him
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	sacrifice
O	to
O	Zeus
O	,
O	the
O	saviour
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	,
O	Hercules
O	,
O	should
O	return
O	victorious
O	;
O	but
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	slain
O	by
O	the
O	monstrous
O	lion
O	,
O	then
O	the
O	countryman
O	should
O	make
O	the
O	sacrifice
O	a
O	funeral
O	offering
O	to
O	himself
O	as
O	a
O	hero
O	.
O	So
O	Hercules
O	proceeded
O	,
O	far
O	into
O	a
O	dense
O	wood
O	,
O	deserted
O	because
O	all
O	people
O	feared
O	the
O	fierce
O	beast
O	it
O	protected
O	.
O	On
O	he
O	went
O	till
O	after
O	many
O	days
O	he
O	sighted
O	the
O	lion
O	at
O	rest
O	near
O	the
O	cave
O	which
O	was
O	its
O	den
O	.
O	Standing
O	behind
O	a
O	tree
O	of
O	great
O	girth
O	,
O	Hercules
O	fitted
O	and
O	let
O	fly
O	an
O	arrow
O	.
O	It
O	struck
O	and
O	glanced
O	,
O	leaving
O	the
O	animal
O	unharmed
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	tried
O	another
O	shot
O	,
O	aiming
O	at
O	the
O	heart
O	.
O	Again
O	the
O	arrow
O	failed
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	lion
O	was
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	roused
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	eyes
O	shot
O	fiery
O	glances
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	heavy
O	roar
O	from
O	his
O	throat
O	made
O	the
O	woods
O	most
O	horribly
O	resound
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	devoted
O	Hercules
O	seized
O	his
O	heavy
O	wooden
O	club
O	,
O	and
O	rushing
O	forward
O	drove
O	the
O	lion
O	by
O	the
O	suddenness
O	and
O	fierceness
O	of
O	his
O	assault
O	into
O	his
O	den
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	den
O	had
O	two
O	entrances
O	.
O	Against
O	one
O	Hercules
O	rolled
O	huge
O	stones
O	,
O	and
O	entering
O	the
O	cave
O	by
O	the
O	other
O	he
O	grasped
O	the
O	lion
O	'
O	s
O	throat
O	with
O	both
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	held
O	him
O	struggling
O	and
O	gasping
O	for
O	breath
O	till
O	he
O	lay
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	dead
O	.
O	Hercules
O	swung
O	the
O	mighty
O	bulk
O	upon
O	his
O	shoulders
O	and
O	proceeded
O	to
O	seek
O	the
O	countryman
O	with
O	whom
O	his
O	pledge
O	stood
O	.
O	So
O	great
O	had
O	been
O	his
O	journey
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	hard
O	his
O	search
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	find
O	the
O	good
O	man
O	till
O	the
O	last
O	of
O	the
O	thirty
O	days
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	stood
O	just
O	on
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	offering
O	a
O	sheep
O	to
O	Hercules
O	,
O	supposing
O	him
O	dead
O	.
O	Together
O	they
O	sacrificed
O	the
O	sheep
O	to
O	Zeus
O	instead
O	,
O	and
O	Hercules
O	,
O	vigorous
O	and
O	victorious
O	,
O	bore
O	the
O	mighty
O	lion
O	'
O	s
O	body
O	to
O	Eurystheus
O	at
O	Mycenae
O	.
O	Entering
O	the
O	place
O	and
O	throwing
O	the
O	carcass
O	down
O	before
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	Hercules
O	so
O	terrified
O	Eurystheus
O	by
O	this
O	token
O	of
O	his
O	wonderful
O	strength
O	that
O	the
O	King
O	forbade
O	him
O	ever
O	again
O	to
O	enter
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	Indeed
O	some
O	say
O	that
O	the
O	terror
O	of
O	Eurystheus
O	was
O	so
O	great
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	jar
O	or
O	vessel
O	of
O	brass
O	secretly
O	constructed
O	underground
O	which
O	he
O	might
O	use
O	as
O	a
O	safe
O	retreat
O	in
O	case
O	of
O	danger
O	.
O	This
O	``
O	jar
O	``
O	was
O	probably
O	a
O	chamber
O	and
O	its
O	walls
O	covered
O	within
O	with
O	plates
O	of
O	brass
O	.
O	For
O	now
O	in
O	our
O	own
O	day
O	is
O	seen
O	there
O	at
O	Mycenae
O	a
O	room
O	under
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	nails
O	which
O	fastened
O	the
O	brass
O	plates
O	to
O	the
O	wall
O	still
O	remain
O	.
O	Ever
O	after
O	the
O	conquest
O	of
O	this
O	lion
O	Hercules
O	clothed
O	himself
O	with
O	the
O	skin
O	.
O	THE
O	SECOND
O	LABOUR
O	--
O	DESTROYING
O	THE
O	LERNEAN
O	HYDRA
O	The
O	second
O	task
O	of
O	Hercules
O	was
O	to
O	destroy
O	a
O	hydra
O	or
O	water
O	snake
O	which
O	dwelt
O	in
O	the
O	marsh
O	of
O	Lerna
O	,
O	a
O	small
O	lake
O	near
O	Mycenae
O	.
O	The
O	body
O	of
O	this
O	snake
O	was
O	large
O	and
O	from
O	its
O	body
O	sprang
O	nine
O	heads
O	.
O	Eight
O	of
O	these
O	heads
O	were
O	mortal
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	ninth
O	head
O	was
O	undying
O	.
O	Hercules
O	stepped
O	into
O	his
O	chariot
O	and
O	his
O	dear
O	nephew
O	Iolaus
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	permitted
O	by
O	the
O	Delphic
O	priestess
O	to
O	drive
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	took
O	up
O	the
O	reins
O	.
O	The
O	way
O	to
O	Lerna
O	was
O	pleasant
O	.
O	In
O	spring-time
O	crocuses
O	and
O	hyacinths
O	sprang
O	by
O	the
O	roadside
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	early
O	summer
O	the
O	nightingales
O	sang
O	in
O	the
O	olive
O	groves
O	,
O	vineyard
O	and
O	forest
O	.
O	That
O	so
O	great
O	and
O	horrible
O	a
O	monster
O	could
O	be
O	near
O	!
O	When
O	Hercules
O	and
O	Iolaus
O	came
O	to
O	Lerna
O	they
O	drew
O	close
O	to
O	ground
O	rising
O	near
O	a
O	spring
O	,
O	and
O	Hercules
O	dismounting
O	and
O	searching
O	found
O	the
O	very
O	hole
O	into
O	which
O	the
O	hydra
O	had
O	retired
O	.
O	Into
O	this
O	he
O	shot
O	fiery
O	arrows
O	.
O	The
O	arrows
O	discomforting
O	the
O	snake
O	it
O	crawled
O	forth
O	and
O	,
O	darting
O	at
O	him
O	furiously
O	,
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	twine
O	itself
O	about
O	his
O	legs
O	.
O	The
O	hero
O	began
O	then
O	to
O	wield
O	his
O	mighty
O	club
O	.
O	He
O	crushed
O	head
O	after
O	head
O	upon
O	the
O	snake
O	'
O	s
O	body
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	every
O	one
O	crushed
O	two
O	sprang
O	in
O	its
O	place
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	the
O	hydra
O	had
O	coiled
O	so
O	firmly
O	round
O	one
O	leg
O	,
O	that
O	Hercules
O	could
O	not
O	move
O	an
O	inch
O	from
O	the
O	spot
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	an
O	enormous
O	crab
O	came
O	from
O	the
O	water
O	out
O	of
O	friendship
O	for
O	the
O	hydra
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	too
O	crept
O	up
O	to
O	Hercules
O	and
O	,
O	seizing
O	his
O	foot
O	,
O	painfully
O	wounded
O	him
O	.
O	Swinging
O	his
O	club
O	with
O	heroic
O	vigor
O	Hercules
O	beat
O	the
O	crab
O	to
O	death
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	called
O	to
O	Iolaus
O	to
O	fire
O	a
O	little
O	grove
O	of
O	trees
O	near
O	by
O	.
O	Iolaus
O	at
O	once
O	set
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	saplings
O	were
O	well
O	aflame
O	he
O	seized
O	them
O	and
O	,
O	standing
O	by
O	the
O	hero
O	,
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	Hercules
O	cut
O	off
O	a
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	hydra
O	he
O	seared
O	the
O	neck
O	with
O	a
O	flaming
O	brand
O	.
O	The
O	searing
O	prevented
O	the
O	heads
O	from
O	growing
O	again
O	.
O	When
O	all
O	the
O	eight
O	mortal
O	heads
O	had
O	thus
O	been
O	dispatched
O	Hercules
O	struck
O	off
O	the
O	one
O	said
O	to
O	be
O	immortal
O	and
O	buried
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	roadway
O	,
O	setting
O	a
O	heavy
O	stone
O	above
O	.
O	The
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	hydra
O	he
O	cut
O	up
O	and
O	dipped
O	his
O	arrows
O	in
O	the
O	gall
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	so
O	full
O	of
O	poison
O	that
O	the
O	least
O	scratch
O	from
O	such
O	an
O	arrow
O	would
O	bring
O	certain
O	death
O	.
O	Eurystheus
O	received
O	the
O	news
O	of
O	the
O	destruction
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	snake
O	with
O	bad
O	grace
O	.
O	He
O	claimed
O	that
O	Hercules
O	had
O	not
O	destroyed
O	the
O	monster
O	alone
O	,
O	but
O	only
O	with
O	the
O	assistance
O	of
O	Iolaus
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	rejoiced
O	greatly
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	hastened
O	to
O	drain
O	the
O	marsh
O	where
O	the
O	hydra
O	had
O	dwelt
O	so
O	that
O	never
O	again
O	could
O	such
O	an
O	enemy
O	abide
O	upon
O	their
O	lands
O	.
O	THE
O	THIRD
O	LABOUR
O	--
O	CAPTURING
O	THE
O	ARCADIAN
O	HIND
O	In
O	the
O	days
O	in
O	which
O	Hercules
O	lived
O	,
O	Arcadia
O	was
O	a
O	beautiful
O	country
O	of
O	cool
O	,
O	sweet-scented
O	woods
O	,
O	clear
O	mountain
O	streams
O	,
O	and
O	sloping
O	meadow-sides
O	from
O	which
O	rose
O	every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	a
O	hunter
O	'
O	s
O	cottage
O	or
O	a
O	shepherd
O	'
O	s
O	hutch
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	country
O	also
O	peculiarly
O	pleasing
O	to
O	Artemis
O	,
O	the
O	goddess
O	of
O	the
O	chase
O	,
O	and
O	peculiarly
O	also
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	haunt
O	of
O	all
O	animals
O	especially
O	dear
O	to
O	the
O	goddess
O	.
O	A
O	hind
O	was
O	there
O	of
O	such
O	loveliness
O	and
O	grace
O	that
O	Artemis
O	had
O	marked
O	her
O	for
O	her
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	given
O	her
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	golden
O	horns
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	be
O	known
O	from
O	all
O	other
O	deer
O	and
O	her
O	life
O	thus
O	preserved
O	.
O	For
O	no
O	good
O	Hellen
O	,
O	or
O	Greek
O	,
O	would
O	slay
O	for
O	food
O	any
O	animal
O	sacred
O	to
O	a
O	god
O	.
O	This
O	beautiful
O	golden-horned
O	hind
O	Eurystheus
O	ordered
O	Hercules
O	to
O	bring
O	to
O	him
O	alive
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	irreverence
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	did
O	not
O	go
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	to
O	demand
O	her
O	dead
O	.
O	So
O	Hercules
O	went
O	forth
O	for
O	the
O	hunting
O	and
O	,
O	not
O	wishing
O	to
O	wound
O	the
O	hind
O	,
O	pursued
O	her
O	for
O	one
O	entire
O	year
O	.
O	Up
O	hill
O	he
O	went
O	,
O	down
O	many
O	a
O	mountain
O	dale
O	,
O	across
O	many
O	a
O	gleaming
O	river
O	,
O	through
O	deep
O	forest
O	and
O	open
O	field
O	,
O	and
O	always
O	dancing
O	before
O	him
O	were
O	the
O	golden
O	tips
O	of
O	horns
O	of
O	the
O	hind
O	--
O	near
O	enough
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	,
O	too
O	far
O	to
O	be
O	seized
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	tired
O	with
O	the
O	pursuit
O	the
O	lovely
O	beast
O	one
O	day
O	took
O	refuge
O	upon
O	a
O	mountain
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	as
O	she
O	sought
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	a
O	river
O	,
O	Hercules
O	struck
O	her
O	with
O	an
O	arrow
O	.
O	The
O	wound
O	was
O	slight
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	helped
O	the
O	hero
O	to
O	catch
O	the
O	creature
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	lift
O	her
O	to
O	his
O	shoulders
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	,
O	he
O	started
O	for
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	Eurystheus
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	way
O	was
O	long
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	lay
O	through
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	Arcadia
O	where
O	the
O	bush
O	was
O	heavy
O	,
O	and
O	forests
O	were
O	deep
O	,
O	and
O	mountains
O	were
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	while
O	Hercules
O	was
O	pursuing
O	his
O	way
O	and
O	bearing
O	his
O	meek-eyed
O	burden
O	,
O	he
O	one
O	day
O	met
O	the
O	fair
O	goddess
O	to
O	whom
O	the
O	hind
O	was
O	sacred
O	.
O	Her
O	brother
O	,
O	the
O	beautiful
O	god
O	Apollo
O	,
O	was
O	with
O	her
O	.
O	Artemis
O	seeing
O	her
O	captured
O	deer
O	cried
O	to
O	the
O	hero
O	,
O	``
O	Mortal
O	,
O	oho
O	!
O	thus
O	wilt
O	thou

O	gods
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	Mighty
O	Artemis
O	and
O	huntress

O	answered
O	Hercules
O	,
O	``

O	Eurystheus
O	commanded

O	to

O	the

O	the
O	priestess

O	sent
O	him
O	forward
O	with
O	kind
O	words
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	he
O	brought
O	the
O	golden-horned

O	to
O	Mycenae
O	and
O	sent
O	it

O	THE
O	FOURTH
O	LABOUR
O	--
O	CAPTURING
O	THE
O	BOAR
O	OF
O	ERYMANTHUS
O	In
O	the
O	northwestern
O	part

O	.
O	Over
O	the
O	high
O	tops
O	of
O	this
O	range
O	wandered
O	also
O	a
O	wild
O	beast
O	,
O	but
O	unlike
O	the

O	hind
O	he
O	was
O	fierce
O	and
O	terrible
O	of
O	aspect
O	and
O	deadly
O	in
O	encounter
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	known
O	as
O	the
O	boar
O	of
O	Erymanthus
O	.
O	This
O	tusked
O	and
O	terrible
O	being
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Mycenae
O	,
O	Eurystheus

O	Hercules
O	,
O	his
O	bondman
O	,
O	to
O	bring
O	alive
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	Again
O	Hercules
O	set
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	he
O	fared
O	over
O	hill
O	and
O	across
O	bright
O	waters
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	the
O	birds
O	sang
O	spring
O	songs
O	to
O	him
O	from
O	vine
O	and
O	tree
O	shade
O	,
O	and

O	crocuses
O	carpeted
O	the

O	In

O	day
O	to

O	Now

O	the

O	of
O	the

O	with

O	swift
O	four
O	feet
O	.
O	There

O	,
O	who
O	claim
O	that
O	the
O	centaurs
O	were
O	men
O	and
O	rode
O	their
O	mountain
O	ponies
O	so
O	deftly
O	that
O	man
O	and
O	horse
O	seemed
O	one
O	whole
O	creature
O	.
O	Be
O	that

O	upon

O	kind
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	to
O	visit
O	with

O	came
O	Hercules
O	.
O	The
O	centaur
O	with
O	his
O	hospitable
O	heart
O	and
O	own
O	hands
O	prepared
O	a
O	dinner
O	of
O	roast
O	meat
O	for
O	the
O	hungry
O	traveller
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	they
O	sat
O	at
O	the
O	board
O	in
O	genial
O	converse
O	they
O	had
O	much
O	enjoyment
O	.
O	But
O	Hercules
O	was

O	thirsty
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sparkling
O	water
O	from
O	the
O	mountain
O	spring
O	seemed
O	not
O	to

O	He
O	asked

O	skies
O	of
O	Arcadia
O	and
O	its
O	fragrance
O	was
O	like
O	a
O	scent
O	of
O	lilies
O	or
O	of
O	roses
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	soft
O	winds
O	entered
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	near
O	which
O	Hercules
O	sat
O	drinking
O	,
O	it
O	seized
O	the
O	perfume
O	and
O	bore
O	it
O	over
O	the
O	mountain
O	side
O	.
O	Now
O	hear
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	mischief
O	a
O	little
O	wine
O	may
O	make
O	.
O	The
O	fragrance
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	told
O	the
O	centaurs
O	,
O	wherever
O	each
O	happened
O	to
O	be
O	,
O	that
O	their
O	wine
O	jar
O	had
O	been
O	opened
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	rushed
O	to
O	its
O	resting
O	place
O	perhaps
O	to
O	defend
O	it
O	from
O	any
O	wayfaring
O	thief
O	,
O	perhaps
O	to
O	help
O	drink
O	it
O	,
O	we
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	.
O	But
O	each
O	came
O	angrily
O	to
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	cave
O	of
O	Pholus
O	and
O	all
O	were
O	armed
O	with
O	stones
O	and
O	staves
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	seized
O	as
O	they
O	hastened
O	onward
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	first
O	entered
O	with
O	raging
O	cries
O	and
O	threatening
O	gesture
O	Hercules
O	grasped
O	the
O	brands
O	burning
O	on
O	the
O	hospitable
O	hearth
O	and
O	drove
O	them
O	back
O	.
O	As
O	others
O	pressed
O	behind
O	them
O	the
O	hero
O	drew
O	forth
O	his
O	arrows
O	poisoned
O	with
O	the
O	gall
O	of
O	the
O	Lernean
O	hydra
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	among
O	them
O	many
O	a
O	shaft
O	.
O	Thus
O	they
O	fought
O	retreating
O	and
O	,
O	they
O	fleeing
O	and
O	Hercules
O	pursuing
O	,
O	came
O	finally
O	to
O	the
O	dwelling
O	of
O	Chiron
O	,
O	most
O	famed
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	centaurs
O	and
O	a
O	teacher
O	of
O	Hercules
O	in
O	his
O	youth
O	,
O	teacher
O	of
O	his
O	great
O	art
O	of
O	surgery
O	.
O	The
O	wine
O	raging
O	in
O	the
O	veins
O	of
O	Hercules
O	made
O	him
O	for
O	the
O	moment
O	forgetful
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	good
O	Chiron
O	had
O	bestowed
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	still
O	letting
O	fly
O	his
O	poisonous
O	arrows
O	he
O	,
O	aiming
O	at
O	another
O	,
O	hit
O	the
O	noblest
O	of
O	the
O	centaurs
O	.
O	Grief
O	seized
O	Hercules
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	and
O	he
O	ran
O	and
O	drew
O	out
O	the
O	arrow
O	and
O	applied
O	a
O	soft
O	ointment
O	which
O	Chiron
O	himself
O	had
O	taught
O	him
O	to
O	make
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	centaur
O	,
O	inspiring
O	teacher
O	and
O	famed
O	for
O	his
O	love
O	of
O	justice
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	soon
O	gave
O	up
O	the
O	ghost
O	.
O	Saddened
O	at
O	his
O	own
O	madness
O	Hercules
O	now
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	cave
O	of
O	his
O	guest-friend
O	Pholus
O	.
O	There
O	among
O	others
O	his
O	host
O	lay
O	,
O	and
O	stark
O	dead
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	drawn
O	an
O	arrow
O	from
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	one
O	who
O	had
O	died
O	from
O	its
O	wound
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	while
O	examining
O	it
O	and
O	wondering
O	how
O	so
O	slight
O	a
O	shaft
O	could
O	be
O	so
O	fatal
O	,
O	had
O	accidentally
O	dropped
O	it
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	It
O	struck
O	his
O	foot
O	and
O	he
O	expired
O	that
O	very
O	moment
O	.
O	Hercules
O	paid
O	all
O	funeral
O	honour
O	to
O	his
O	friends
O	and
O	afterward
O	departing
O	from
O	the
O	unhappy
O	neighbourhood
O	took
O	up
O	his
O	search
O	of
O	the
O	boar
O	.
O	Heavy
O	snows
O	were
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	crests
O	of
O	Erymanthus
O	when
O	Hercules
O	came
O	upon
O	the
O	tracks
O	of
O	the
O	wild
O	creature
O	,
O	and
O	following
O	patiently
O	finally
O	reached
O	his
O	lair
O	.
O	There
O	the
O	boar
O	stood
O	,
O	his
O	tusks
O	pointed
O	outward
O	ready
O	for
O	attack
O	,
O	his
O	eyes
O	snapping
O	vindictively
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	indeed
O	a
O	terrible
O	thing
O	to
O	see
O	.
O	Hercules
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	shooting
O	at
O	the
O	animal
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	call
O	,
O	and
O	shouting
O	with
O	loud
O	cries
O	he
O	so
O	confused
O	the
O	boar
O	that
O	he
O	ran
O	into
O	the
O	vast
O	snowdrift
O	standing
O	near
O	by
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	the
O	hero
O	seized
O	and
O	bound
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	wild
O	grapevine
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	for
O	the
O	purpose
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	swinging
O	him
O	over
O	his
O	shoulder
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	way
O	toward
O	Mycenae
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	Eurystheus
O	was
O	terribly
O	frightened
O	at
O	the
O	very
O	prospect
O	of
O	having
O	the
O	boar
O	to
O	keep
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	Hercules
O	was
O	coming
O	to
O	town
O	with
O	the
O	animal
O	on
O	his
O	shoulders
O	he
O	took
O	to
O	the
O	brazen
O	underground
O	chamber
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	built
O	,
O	when
O	Hercules
O	came
O	in
O	with
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	Nemean
O	lion
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	stayed
O	for
O	several
O	days
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	a
O	good
O	old
O	historian
O	,
O	Diodorus
O	,
O	who
O	in
O	writing
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	told
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	coward
O	.
O	THE
O	FIFTH
O	LABOUR
O	--
O	CLEANSING
O	THE
O	STABLES
O	OF
O	AUGEAS
O	Although
O	Eurystheus
O	was
O	seized
O	with
O	tremor
O	at
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	Hercules
O	with
O	the
O	Erymanthian
O	boar
O	,
O	still
O	he
O	continued
O	relentless
O	,
O	and
O	demanded
O	the
O	performance
O	of
O	the
O	next
O	task
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	nothing
O	less
O	than
O	the
O	cleaning
O	out
O	in
O	one
O	day
O	of
O	stables
O	where
O	numerous
O	cattle
O	had
O	been
O	confined
O	for
O	many
O	years
O	.
O	These
O	noisome
O	stalls
O	belonged
O	to
O	Augeas
O	,
O	a
O	King
O	of
O	Elis
O	and
O	a
O	man
O	rich
O	in
O	herds
O	--
O	so
O	rich
O	indeed
O	that
O	as
O	the
O	years
O	passed
O	and
O	his
O	cattle
O	increased
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	men
O	enough
O	to
O	care
O	for
O	his
O	kine
O	and
O	their
O	house
O	.
O	Thus
O	the
O	animals
O	had
O	continued
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	so
O	littered
O	their
O	abiding
O	place
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	become
O	well
O	nigh
O	intolerable
O	and
O	a
O	source
O	of
O	disease
O	and
O	even
O	of
O	pestilence
O	to
O	the
O	people
O	.
O	When
O	Hercules
O	came
O	to
O	King
O	Augeas
O	he
O	said
O	nothing
O	to
O	him
O	of
O	the
O	command
O	Eurystheus
O	had
O	laid
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	looking
O	through
O	the
O	stables
O	which
O	covered
O	a
O	space
O	of
O	many
O	meadows
O	he
O	spoke
O	of
O	the
O	cattle
O	and
O	the
O	evil
O	condition
O	of
O	their
O	housing
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	moon-eyed
O	kine
O	will
O	do
O	better
O	in
O	clean
O	stables
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	wise
O	Hercules
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	if
O	thou
O	wilt
O	pledge
O	me
O	a
O	tenth
O	of
O	thy
O	herds
O	I
O	will
O	clean
O	out
O	thy
O	stalls
O	in
O	a
O	day
O	.
O	``
O	To
O	this
O	Augeas
O	delightedly
O	agreed
O	and
O	,
O	speaking
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	Hercules
O	called
O	upon
O	the
O	prince
O	to
O	witness
O	the
O	pact
O	.
O	Now
O	Hercules
O	in
O	going
O	about
O	the
O	great
O	stables
O	had
O	noticed
O	that
O	at
O	the
O	upper
O	end
O	of
O	their
O	building
O	flowed
O	a
O	swift
O	river
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	lower
O	end
O	was
O	a
O	second
O	swift
O	stream
O	.
O	When
O	therefore
O	Augeas
O	had
O	pledged
O	himself
O	to
O	the
O	work
O	,
O	Hercules
O	,
O	beginning
O	early
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	took
O	down
O	the
O	walls
O	at
O	the
O	upper
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	stalls
O	and
O	the
O	walls
O	at
O	the
O	lower
O	end
O	.
O	Then
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	mighty
O	hands
O	he
O	dug
O	channels
O	and
O	canals
O	and
O	led
O	the
O	waters
O	of
O	the
O	upper
O	swift-flowing
O	river
O	into
O	the
O	heavily
O	littered
O	floor
O	of
O	the
O	stalls
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	waters
O	rose
O	and
O	pushed
O	the
O	litter
O	before
O	them
O	and
O	made
O	one
O	channel
O	into
O	the
O	lower
O	river
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	another
O	and
O	another
O	and
O	so
O	,
O	working
O	through
O	the
O	hours
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	upper
O	river
O	scoured
O	the
O	stables
O	clean
O	and
O	carried
O	the
O	refuse
O	to
O	the
O	lower
O	river
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	lower
O	river
O	took
O	the
O	burden
O	and
O	carried
O	it
O	out
O	to
O	the
O	salt
O	sea
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	ever
O	and
O	always
O	cleaning
O	and
O	purifying
O	whatever
O	comes
O	to
O	its
O	waters
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	night
O	fell
O	there
O	stood
O	the
O	hero
O	Hercules
O	looking
O	at
O	his
O	work
O	--
O	the
O	filthy
O	stables
O	of
O	Augeas
O	cleaned
O	.
O	When
O	next
O	day
O	Hercules
O	asked
O	for
O	the
O	tenth
O	of
O	the
O	herds
O	which
O	the
O	King
O	had
O	pledged
O	,
O	Augeas
O	refused
O	to
O	stand
O	by
O	his
O	agreement
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	learned
O	that
O	this
O	labour
O	of
O	cleaning
O	his
O	stables
O	had
O	been
O	imposed
O	upon
O	Hercules
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	claimed
O	he
O	should
O	pay
O	nothing
O	for
O	it
O	;
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	he
O	denied
O	he
O	had
O	promised
O	anything
O	,
O	and
O	offered
O	to
O	lay
O	the
O	matter
O	before
O	judges
O	.
O	The
O	cause
O	therefore
O	was
O	tried
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	trial
O	the
O	young
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	witnessed
O	the
O	pact
O	,
O	testified
O	to
O	the
O	truth
O	of
O	Hercules
O	'
O	claim
O	.
O	This
O	so
O	enraged
O	his
O	father
O	that
O	in
O	most
O	high-handed
O	manner
O	he
O	banished
O	both
O	his
O	son
O	and
O	the
O	hero
O	from
O	Elis
O	without
O	waiting
O	for
O	the
O	judgment
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	.
O	Hercules
O	returned
O	to
O	Mycenae
O	.
O	But
O	again
O	the
O	cowardly
O	and
O	contemptible
O	Eurystheus
O	refused
O	to
O	count
O	this
O	labour
O	,
O	saying

O	for

O	In
O	our
O	day
O	the
O	lake
O	is
O	a
O	resort
O	for
O	gentle
O	singing
O	birds
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	Hercules
O	other
O	birds
O	were
O	there
O	also
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	birds
O	were
O	water
O	fowls
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	gathered
O	at
O	Lake
O	Stymphalus
O	because
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	driven
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	old
O	home
O	by
O	wolves
O	,
O	who
O	alone
O	were
O	hungrier
O	and
O	more
O	destructive
O	than
O	they
O	.
O	These
O	fowls
O	had
O	claws
O	of
O	iron
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	feather
O	of
O	theirs
O	was
O	sharper
O	than
O	a
O	barbed
O	arrow
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	strong
O	and
O	fierce
O	and
O	ravenous
O	they
O	were
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	dart
O	from
O	the
O	air
O	and
O	attack
O	hunters
O	,
O	yea
O	,
O	and
O	pecking
O	them
O	down
O	would
O	tear
O	and
O	strip
O	their
O	flesh
O	till
O	but
O	a
O	bony
O	skeleton
O	remained
O	of
O	that
O	which
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	before
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	strong
O	,
O	active
O	,
O	buoyant
O	man
O	seeking
O	in
O	the
O	chase
O	food
O	for
O	his
O	hearthside
O	.
O	To
O	make
O	way
O	with
O	this
O	horrid
O	tribe
O	of
O	the
O	air
O	was
O	the
O	sixth
O	command
O	Eurystheus
O	laid
O	upon
O	Hercules
O	.
O	Toward
O	Lake
O	Stymphalus
O	therefore
O	turned
O	our
O	hero
O	.
O	Again
O	he
O	walked
O	Arcadian
O	waysides
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	as
O	he
O	fared
O	the
O	spring
O	sun
O	shone
O	above
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	birds
O	sang
O	welcome
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	narcissus
O	lifted
O	its
O	golden
O	cup
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	his
O	heart
O	rejoiced
O	in
O	his
O	life
O	,
O	whatever
O	the
O	difficulty
O	of
O	his
O	labour
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	beauty
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	before
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	he
O	walked
O	also
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	how
O	he
O	should
O	accomplish
O	the
O	great
O	undertaking
O	upon
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	bent
O	.
O	While
O	thus
O	deliberating
O	the
O	grey-eyed
O	goddess
O	of
O	wisdom
O	,
O	Athene
O	,
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	--
O	just
O	as
O	this
O	goddess
O	even
O	in
O	our
O	day
O	comes
O	to
O	those
O	who
O	think
O	--
O	and
O	she
O	suggested
O	to
O	his
O	mind
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	scare
O	the
O	fowl
O	from
O	their
O	retreat
O	by
O	brazen
O	rattles
O	.
O	The
O	goddess
O	did
O	even
O	more
O	than
O	put
O	the
O	notion
O	of
O	using
O	a
O	rattle
O	in
O	the
O	mind
O	of
O	Hercules
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	said
O	she
O	actually
O	brought
O	him
O	one
O	,
O	a
O	huge
O	,
O	bronze
O	clapper
O	made
O	for
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	forger
O	of
O	the
O	gods
O	,
O	limping
O	Hephaestus
O	.
O	Hercules
O	took
O	this
O	rattle
O	and
O	mounting
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	height
O	shook
O	it
O	in
O	his
O	great
O	hands
O	till
O	every
O	hill
O	echoed
O	and
O	the
O	very
O	trees
O	quivered
O	with
O	the
O	horrid
O	sound
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	man-eating
O	birds
O	?
O	Not
O	one
O	remained
O	hidden
O	.
O	Each
O	and
O	every
O	one
O	rose
O	terrified
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	croaking
O	and
O	working
O	its
O	steely
O	talons
O	and
O	sharp-pointed
O	feathers
O	in
O	dire
O	fear
O	.
O	Now
O	from
O	his
O	quiver
O	the
O	hero
O	fast
O	picked
O	his
O	barbed
O	arrows
O	,
O	and
O	fast
O	he
O	shot
O	and
O	every
O	shot
O	brought
O	to
O	his
O	feet
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	terrible
O	man-
O	eaters
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	had
O	slain
O	every
O	one
O	.
O	Or
O	,
O	if
O	indeed
O	,
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	tribe
O	had
O	escaped
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	flown
O	far
O	away
O	,
O	for
O	never
O	after
O	,
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	long
O	history
O	of
O	Lake
O	Stymphalus
O	,
O	have
O	such
O	creatures
O	appeared
O	again
O	above
O	its
O	fair
O	waters
O	.
O	So
O	ended
O	the
O	sixth
O	labour
O	of
O	Hercules
O	.
O	THE
O	SEVENTH
O	LABOUR
O	--
O	CAPTURING
O	THE
O	CRETAN
O	BULL
O	Just
O	as
O	Zeus
O	who
O	,
O	as
O	we
O	said
O	in
O	the
O	beginning
O	,
O	was
O	King
O	of
O	all
O	heaven
O	that
O	is
O	the
O	air
O	and
O	clouds
O	,
O	so
O	Posidon
O	was
O	King
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	With
O	his
O	queen
O	,
O	Amphitrite
O	,
O	he
O	lived
O	far
O	down
O	underneath
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	and
O	dwelt
O	in
O	a
O	palace
O	splendid
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	beautiful
O	things
O	of
O	the
O	deep
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	blue
O	waters
O	of
O	the
O	Mediterranean
O	where
O	Posidon
O	had
O	his
O	home
O	,
O	lies
O	an
O	island
O	called
O	Crete
O	,
O	and
O	long
O	ago
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	when
O	Hercules
O	laboured
O	,
O	a
O	King
O	,
O	whose
O	name
O	was
O	Minos
O	,
O	ruled
O	over
O	this
O	land
O	.
O	The
O	island
O	is
O	long
O	and
O	narrow
O	and
O	has
O	much
O	sea
O	coast
O	,
O	and
O	because
O	of
O	this
O	fact
O	King
O	Minos
O	stood
O	in
O	intimate
O	relations
O	with
O	the
O	god
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Now
O	one
O	day
O	in
O	an
O	especial
O	burst
O	of
O	friendliness
O	,
O	Minos
O	vowed
O	to
O	sacrifice
O	to
O	Posidon
O	whatever
O	should
O	come
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	salt
O	waters
O	.
O	The
O	god
O	in
O	pleasure
O	at
O	the
O	vow
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	test
O	mayhap
O	the
O	devotion
O	of
O	Minos
O	,
O	sent
O	at
O	once
O	a
O	beautiful
O	bull
O	leaping
O	and
O	swimming
O	through
O	the
O	waves
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	creature
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	rocky
O	coast
O	and
O	made
O	land
O	,
O	its
O	side
O	shone
O	with
O	such
O	beauty
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	ivory-white
O	horns
O	garlanded
O	with
O	lilies
O	set
O	so
O	like
O	a
O	crown
O	above
O	its
O	graceful
O	head
O	that
O	Minos
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	who
O	saw
O	it
O	marvelled
O	that
O	anywhere
O	could
O	have
O	grown
O	such
O	a
O	bull
O	.
O	And
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	greed
O	and
O	deceit
O	seized
O	Minos
O	as
O	he
O	gazed
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	his
O	sacrifice
O	to
O	Posidon
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	use
O	another
O	bull
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	he
O	ordered
O	his
O	herdsman
O	to
O	take
O	this
O	fair
O	creature
O	that
O	had
O	come
O	from
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	to
O	put
O	it
O	among
O	his
O	herd
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	to
O	bring
O	forth
O	another
O	for
O	the
O	offering
O	.
O	Because
O	of
O	this
O	avarice
O	of
O	Minos
O	the
O	god
O	below
O	the
O	waves
O	was
O	angry
O	and
O	he
O	made
O	the
O	bull
O	wild
O	and
O	furious
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	no
O	herdsman
O	dared
O	approach
O	to
O	feed
O	or
O	care
O	for
O	it
O	.
O	For
O	his
O	seventh
O	task
O	Eurystheus
O	commanded
O	Hercules
O	to
O	fetch
O	him
O	this
O	mad
O	bull
O	of
O	Crete
O	.
O	Hercules
O	accordingly
O	boarded
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	ships
O	that
O	plied
O	in
O	that
O	far-off
O	day
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	in
O	this
O	time
O	of
O	ours
O	,
O	between
O	the
O	rocky
O	coast
O	of
O	Crete
O	and
O	the
O	fair
O	land
O	of
O	Hellas
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	due
O	time
O	the
O	hero
O	came
O	to
O	Minos
O	'
O	court
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	have
O	come
O	,
O	sire
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Hercules
O	,
O	``
O	for
O	the
O	mad
O	bull
O	that
O	terrifies
O	thy
O	herdsmen
O	and
O	is
O	rumoured
O	beyond
O	capture
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Ay
O	,

O	it

O	,
O	``
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	laughed
O	grimly
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	strength
O	and
O	fury
O	of
O	the
O	creature
O	he
O	deemed
O	beyond
O	any
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	control
O	.
O	Hercules
O	sought
O	the
O	grove
O	where
O	Posidon
O	'
O	s
O	gift
O	had
O	strayed
O	from
O	its
O	fellows
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	deftly
O	seizing
O	it
O	by
O	the
O	horns
O	,
O	he
O	bound
O	its
O	feet
O	with
O	stout
O	straps
O	of
O	bull
O	'
O	s
O	hide
O	and
O	its
O	horns
O	he
O	padded
O	with
O	moss
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	from
O	which
O	it
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	having
O	made
O	it
O	powerless
O	he
O	lifted
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	shoulders
O	and
O	carried
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	A
O	swift
O	black
O	ship
O	was
O	just
O	spreading
O	sail
O	from
O	Crete
O	,
O	and
O	entering
O	upon
O	it
O	the
O	hero
O	soon
O	ended
O	his
O	journey
O	and
O	laid
O	his
O	capture
O	before
O	Eurystheus
O	.
O	A
O	day
O	or
O	two
O	later
O	Hercules
O	loosed
O	the
O	bull
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	after
O	wandering
O	through
O	the
O	woodlands
O	of
O	Arcadia
O	,
O	crossed
O	the
O	isthmus
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	plains
O	of
O	Marathon
O	,
O	whence
O	,
O	after
O	doing
O	much
O	damage
O	,
O	it
O	swam
O	off
O	to
O	sea
O	and
O	was
O	never
O	heard
O	of
O	after
O	.
O	So
O	far
O	we
O	have
O	told
O	how
O	Hercules
O	accomplished
O	seven
O	of
O	the
O	tasks
O	laid
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	Space
O	does
O	not
O	permit
O	us
O	to
O	recount
O	in
O	detail
O	the
O	other
O	five
O	.
O	The
O	eighth
O	task
O	was
O	to
O	bring
O	to
O	Eurystheus
O	the
O	man-
O	eating
O	mares
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Windy
O	Thrace
O	.
O	The
O	ninth
O	task
O	was
O	to
O	fetch
O	a
O	girdle
O	which
O	Ares
O	,
O	god
O	of
O	war
O	,
O	had
O	given
O	the
O	Queen
O	of
O	the
O	Amazons
O	--
O	an
O	exceedingly
O	difficult
O	labour
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	Amazons
O	were
O	a
O	nation
O	of
O	women-warriors
O	renowned
O	for
O	valour
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	tenth
O	task
O	Eurystheus
O	demanded
O	the
O	purple
O	oxen
O	of
O	a
O	famous
O	giant
O	who
O	dwelt
O	on
O	an
O	island
O	far
O	out
O	in
O	the
O	ocean
O	.
O	The
O	eleventh
O	task
O	was
O	to
O	bring
O	apples
O	from
O	the
O	garden
O	of
O	the
O	Hesperides
O	--
O	golden
O	apples
O	guarded
O	by
O	a
O	dragon
O	with
O	a
O	hundred
O	heads
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	of
O	which
O	ever
O	closed
O	its
O	eyes
O	in
O	sleep
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	twelfth
O	and
O	last
O	task
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	to
O	free
O	the
O	mighty
O	Hercules
O	from
O	his
O	bondage
O	to
O	cowardly
O	Eurystheus
O	,
O	was
O	to
O	fetch
O	Cerberus
O	,
O	the
O	three-headed
O	dog
O	,
O	who
O	guarded
O	the
O	entrance
O	to
O	Hades
O	,
O	the
O	unseen
O	abode
O	of
O	departed
O	spirits
O	.
O	Each
O	and
O	every
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	labours
O	the
O	strong
O	hero
