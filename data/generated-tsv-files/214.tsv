O	But
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	day
O	at
O	last
O	when
O	Robin
O	Hood
O	had
O	to
O	bid
O	farewell
O	to
O	the
O	greenwood
O	where
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	merry
O	men
O	had
O	spent
O	so
O	many
O	happy
O	years
O	.
O	Word
O	was
O	sent
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	that
O	the

O	more

O	that
O	unless
O	their
O	pride

O	A

O	therefore
O	called
O	,

O	seize
O	Robin

O	trusty
O	and
O	most
O	worthy
O	knight
O	,

O	be
O	caught
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	forbear
O	such
O	tricks
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	set
O	his
O	horn
O	to
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	blew
O	a
O	blast
O	or
O	two
O	;
O	the

O	did
O	the
O	same
O	.
O	Instantly
O	from
O	all
O	sides

O	came
O	running
O	,
O	some

O	Robin
O	Hood

O	some

O	men

O	Robin
O	Hood
O	was
O	no
O	whit

O	The
O	fray

O	The
O	archers
O	on
O	both

O	flight
O	the
O	gallant
O	knight
O	,

O	fury
O	,
O	and
O	lasted
O	from
O	morning
O	until
O	almost
O	noon
O	.
O	They
O	fought
O	till
O	both
O	parties
O	were
O	spent
O	,
O	and
O	only
O	ceased
O	when
O	neither
O	side
O	had
O	strength
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	.
O	Those
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	archers
O	that
O	still
O	remained
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	London
O	with
O	right
O	good
O	will
O	,
O	and
O	Robin
O	Hood
O	'
O	s
O	men
O	retreated
O	to
O	the
O	depths

O	the
O	greenwood
O	.
O	But
O	Robin
O	Hood
O	'
O	s
O	last
O	fight
O	was
O	fought
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	arrows
O	that
O	ever
O	he
O	shot
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	but
O	one
O	yet
O	to
O	fly
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	left
O	the
O	field
O	of
O	battle
O	he
O	was
O	taken
O	ill
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	felt
O	his
O	strength
O	fail
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fever
O	rise
O	in
O	his
O	veins
O	.
O	His
O	life
O	was
O	ebbing
O	fast
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	he
O	was
O	too
O	weak
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	remembered
O	his
O	little
O	bugle-horn
O	,
O	which
O	still
O	hung
O	at
O	his
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	setting
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	he
O	blew
O	once
O	,
O	twice
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	--
O	a
O	low
O	,
O	weak
O	blast
O	.
O	Away
O	in
O	the
O	greenwood
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	sat
O	under
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	Little
O	John
O	heard
O	the
O	well-known
O	call
O	,
O	but
O	so
O	faint
O	and
O	feeble
O	was
O	the
O	sound
O	it
O	struck
O	like
O	ice
O	to
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	fear
O	my
O	master

O	wearily
O	!
O	``
O	Never

O	Little

O	that
O	day
O	to
O	answer
O	his
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	dying
O	call
O	.
O	He
O	raced
O	like
O	the
O	wind
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	where
O	Robin
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	on
O	his
O	knee
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	``
O	Give
O	me
O	my
O	bent
O	bow
O	in
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Robin
O	Hood
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	let
O	fly
O	a
O	broad

O	where
O	this
O	arrow
O	is
O	taken
O	up
O	,
O	there
O	shall
O	you
O	dig
O	my
O	grave
O	.
O	``
O	Lay
O	me
O	a
O	green
O	sod
O	under
O	my

O	at
O	my
O	feet
O	;
O	And
O	lay
O	my
O	bent
O	bow
O	at
O	my
O	side

O	Which
O	was
O	my
O	music

O	make
O	my
O	grave
O	of

O	is
O	most
O	right
O	and
O	meet
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	Robin
O	Hood
O	drew
O	his
O	bow
O	for
O	the
O	last
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	where
O	the
O	arrow
O	fell
O	,
O	under
O	a
O	clump
O	of
O	the
O	greenwood
O	trees
O	,
O	they
O	dug
O	the
O	grave
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	buried
O	him
O	.
