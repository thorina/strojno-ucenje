Once there was a royal couple who grieved excessively because they had
no children . When at last , after long waiting , the queen presented her
husband with a little daughter , his majesty showed his joy by giving a
christening feast , so grand that the like of it was never known . He
invited all the fairies in the land--there were seven altogether--to
stand godmothers to the little princess; hoping that each might bestow
on her some good gift , as was the custom of good fairies in those
days . 

After the ceremony , all the guests returned to the palace , where there
was set before each fairy-godmother a magnificent covered dish , with
an embroidered table-napkin , and a knife and fork of pure gold , 
studded with diamonds and rubies . But alas ! as they placed themselves
at table , there entered an old fairy who had never been invited , 
because more than fifty years since she had left the king ' s dominion
on a tour of pleasure , and had not been heard of until this day . His
majesty , much troubled , desired a cover to be placed for her , but it
was of common delf , for he had ordered from his jeweller only seven
gold dishes for the seven fairies aforesaid . The elderly fairy thought
herself neglected , and muttered angry menaces , which were overheard by
one of the younger fairies , who chanced to sit beside her . This good
godmother , afraid of harm to the pretty baby , hastened to hide herself
behind the tapestry in the hall . She did this , because she wished all
the others to speak first--so that if any ill gift were bestowed on
the child , she might be able to counteract it . 

The six now offered their good wishes--which , unlike most wishes , were
sure to come true . The fortunate little princess was to grow up the
fairest woman in the world; to have a temper sweet as an angel; to be
perfectly graceful and gracious; to sing like a nightingale; to dance
like a leaf on a tree; and to possess every accomplishment under the
sun . Then the old fairy ' s turn came . Shaking her head spitefully , she
uttered the wish that when the baby grew up into a young lady , and
learned to spin , she might prick her finger with the spindle and die
of the wound . 

At this terrible prophecy all the guests shuddered; and some of the
more tender-hearted began to weep . The lately happy parents were
almost out of their wits with grief . Upon which the wise young fairy
appeared from behind the tapestry , saying cheerfully  " Your majesties
may comfort yourselves; the princess shall not die . I have no power
to alter the ill-fortune just wished her by my ancient sister--her
finger must be pierced; and she shall then sink , not into the sleep of
death , but into a sleep that will last a hundred years . After that
time is ended , the son of a king will find her , awaken her , and marry
her . " 

Immediately all the fairies vanished . 

The king , in the hope of avoiding his daughter ' s doom , issued an
edict , forbidding all persons to spin , and even to have
spinning-wheels in their houses , on pain of instant death . But it was
in vain . One day , when she was just fifteen years of age , the king and
queen left their daughter alone in one of their castles , when , 
wandering about at her will , she came to an ancient donjon tower , 
climbed to the top of it , and there found a very old woman--so old and
deaf that she had never heard of the king ' s edict--busy with her
wheel . 

 " What are you doing , good old woman ? " said the princess . 

 " I ' m spinning , my pretty child . " 

 " Ah , how charming ! Let me try if I can spin also . " 

She had no sooner taken up the spindle than , being lively and
obstinate , she handled it so awkwardly and carelessly that the point
pierced her finger . Though it was so small a wound , she fainted away
at once , and dropped silently down on the floor . The poor frightened
old woman called for help; shortly came the ladies in waiting , who
tried every means to restore their young mistress , but all their care
was useless . She lay , beautiful as an angel , the colour still
lingering in her lips and cheeks; her fair bosom softly stirred with
her breath : only her eyes were fast closed . When the king her father
and the queen her mother beheld her thus , they knew regret was
idle--all had happened as the cruel fairy meant . But they also knew
that their daughter would not sleep for ever , though after one hundred
years it was not likely they would either of them behold her
awakening . Until that happy hour should arrive , they determined to
leave her in repose . They sent away all the physicians and attendants , 
and themselves sorrowfully laid her upon a bed of embroidery , in the
most elegant apartment of the palace . There she slept and looked like
a sleeping angel still . 

When this misfortune happened , the kindly young fairy who had saved
the princess by changing her sleep of death into this sleep of a
hundred years , was twelve thousand leagues away in the kingdom of
Mataquin . But being informed of everything , she arrived speedily , in a
chariot of fire drawn by dragons . The king was somewhat startled by
the sight , but nevertheless went to the door of his palace , and , with
a mournful countenance , presented her his hand to descend . 

The fairy condoled with his majesty , and approved of all he had done . 
Then , being a fairy of great common sense and foresight , she suggested
that the princess , awakening after a hundred years in this ancient
castle , might be a good deal embarrassed , especially with a young
prince by her side , to find herself alone . Accordingly , without asking
any one ' s leave , she touched with her magic wand the entire population
of the palace--except the king and queen; governesses , ladies of
honour , waiting-maids , gentlemen ushers , cooks , kitchen-girls , pages , 
footmen--down to the horses that were in the stables , and the grooms
that attended them , she touched each and all . Nay , with kind
consideration for the feelings of the princess , she even touched the
little fat lap-dog , Puffy , who had laid himself down beside his
mistress on her splendid bed . He , like all the rest , fell fast asleep
in a moment . The very spits that were before the kitchen-fire ceased
turning , and the fire itself went out , and everything became as silent
as if it were the middle of the night , or as if the palace were a
palace of the dead . 

The king and queen--having kissed their daughter and wept over her a
little , but not much , she looked so sweet and content--departed from
the castle , giving orders that it was to be approached no more . The
command was unnecessary; for in one quarter of an hour there sprung up
around it a wood so thick and thorny that neither beasts nor men could
attempt to penetrate there . Above this dense mass of forest could only
be perceived the top of the high tower where the lovely princess
slept . 

A great many changes happen in a hundred years . The king , who never
had a second child , died , and his throne passed into another royal
family . So entirely was the story of the poor princess forgotten , that
when the reigning king ' s son , being one day out hunting and stopped in
the chase by this formidable wood , inquired what wood it was and what
were those towers which he saw appearing out of the midst of it , no
one could answer him . At length an old peasant was found who
remembered having heard his grandfather say to his father , that in
this tower was a princess , beautiful as the day , who was doomed to
sleep there for one hundred years , until awakened by a king ' s son , her
destined bridegroom . 

At this , the young prince , who had the spirit of a hero , determined to
find out the truth for himself . Spurred on by both generosity and
curiosity , he leaped from his horse and began to force his way through
the thick wood . To his amazement the stiff branches all gave way , and
the ugly thorns sheathed themselves of their own accord , and the
brambles buried themselves in the earth to let him pass . This done , 
they closed behind him , allowing none of his suite to follow : but , 
ardent and young , he went boldly on alone . The first thing he saw was
enough to smite him with fear . Bodies of men and horses lay extended
on the ground; but the men had faces , not death-white , but red as
peonies , and beside them were glasses half filled with wine , showing
that they had gone to sleep drinking . Next he entered a large court , 
paved with marble , where stood rows of guards presenting arms , but
motionless as if cut out of stone; then he passed through many
chambers where gentlemen and ladies , all in the costume of the past
century , slept at their ease , some standing , some sitting . The pages
were lurking in corners , the ladies of honour were stooping over their
embroidery frames , or listening apparently with polite attention to
the gentlemen of the court , but all were as silent as statues and as
immoveable . Their clothes , strange to say , were fresh and new as ever : 
and not a particle of dust or spider-web had gathered over the
furniture , though it had not known a broom for a hundred years . 
Finally the astonished prince came to an inner chamber , where was the
fairest sight his eyes had ever beheld . 

A young girl of wonderful beauty lay asleep on an embroidered bed , and
she looked as if she had only just closed her eyes . Trembling , the
prince approached and knelt beside her . Some say he kissed her , but as
nobody saw it , and she never told , we cannot be quite sure of the
fact . However , as the end of the enchantment had come , the princess
awakened at once , and looking at him with eyes of the tenderest
regard , said drowsily ,  " Is it you , my prince ? I have waited for you
very long . " 

Charmed with these words , and still more with the tone in which they
were uttered , the prince assured her that he loved her more than his
life . Nevertheless , he was the most embarrassed of the two; for , 
thanks to the kind fairy , the princess had plenty of time to dream of
him during her century of slumber , while he had never even heard of
her till an hour before . For a long time did they sit conversing , and
yet had not said half enough . Their only interruption was the little
dog Puffy , who had awakened with his mistress , and now began to be
exceedingly jealous that the princess did not notice him as much as
she was wont to do . 

Meantime all the attendants , whose enchantment was also broken , not
being in love , were ready to die of hunger after their fast of a
hundred years . A lady of honour ventured to intimate that dinner was
served; whereupon the prince handed his beloved princess at once to
the great hall . She did not wait to dress for dinner , being already
perfectly and magnificently attired , though in a fashion somewhat out
of date . However , her lover had the politeness not to notice this , nor
to remind her that she was dressed exactly like her royal grandmother , 
whose portrait still hung on the palace walls . 

During the banquet a concert took place by the attendant musicians , 
and considering they had not touched their instruments for a century
they played extremely well . They ended with a wedding march : for that
very evening the marriage of the prince and princess was celebrated , 
and though the bride was nearly one hundred years older than the
bridegroom , it is remarkable that the fact would never have been
discovered by any one unacquainted therewith . 

After a few days they went together out of the castle and enchanted
wood , both of which immediately vanished , and were never more beheld
by mortal eyes . The princess was restored to her ancestral kingdom , 
but it was not generally declared who she was , as during a hundred
years people had grown so very much cleverer that nobody then living
would ever have believed the story . So nothing was explained , and
nobody presumed to ask any questions about her , for ought not a prince
be able to marry whomsoever he pleases ? 

Nor--whether or not the day of fairies was over--did the princess ever
see anything further of her seven godmothers . She lived a long and
happy life , like any other ordinary woman , and died at length , 
beloved , regretted , but , the prince being already no more , perfectly
contented .
