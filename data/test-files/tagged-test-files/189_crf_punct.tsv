O	I
O	designed
O	,
O	after
O	my
O	first
O	voyage
O	,
O	to
O	spend
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	my
O	days
O	at
O	Bagdad
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	ere
O	I
O	grew
O	weary
O	of
O	an
O	indolent
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	put
O	to
O	sea
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	,
O	with
O	merchants
O	of
O	known
O	probity
O	.
O	We
O	embarked
O	on
O	board
O	a
O	good
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	recommending
O	ourselves
O	to
O	God
O	,
O	set
O	sail
O	.
O	We
O	traded
O	from
O	island
O	to
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	exchanged
O	commodities
O	with
O	great
O	profit
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	we
O	landed
O	on
O	an
O	island
O	covered
O	with
O	several
O	sorts
O	of
O	fruit
O	trees
O	,
O	but
O	we
O	could
O	see
O	neither
O	man
O	nor
O	animal
O	.
O	We
O	walked
O	in
O	the
O	meadows
O	,
O	along
O	the
O	streams
O	that
O	watered
O	them
O	.
O	While
O	some
O	diverted
O	themselves
O	with
O	gathering
O	flowers
O	,
O	and
O	others
O	fruits
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	my
O	wine
O	and
O	provisions
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	near
O	a
O	stream
O	betwixt
O	two
O	high
O	trees
O	,
O	which
O	formed
O	a
O	thick
O	shade
O	.
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	good
O	meal
O	,
O	and
O	afterward
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	I
O	can
O	not
O	tell
O	how
O	long
O	I
O	slept
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	I
O	awoke
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	gone
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	sad
O	condition
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	die
O	with
O	grief
O	.
O	I
O	cried
O	out
O	in
O	agony
O	,
O	beat
O	my
O	head
O	and
O	breast
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	myself
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	lay
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	despair
O	.
O	I
O	upbraided
O	myself
O	a
O	hundred
O	times
O	for
O	not
O	being
O	content
O	with
O	the
O	produce
O	of
O	my
O	first
O	voyage
O	,
O	that
O	might
O	have
O	sufficed
O	me
O	all
O	my
O	life
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	this
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	repentance
O	came
O	too
O	late
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	I
O	resigned
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	God
O	.
O	Not
O	knowing
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	I
O	climbed
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	lofty
O	tree
O	,
O	from
O	whence
O	I
O	looked
O	about
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	I
O	could
O	discover
O	anything
O	that
O	could
O	give
O	me
O	hopes
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	gazed
O	toward
O	the
O	sea
O	I
O	could
O	see
O	nothing
O	but
O	sky
O	and
O	water
O	;
O	but
O	looking
O	over
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	I
O	beheld
O	something
O	white
O	;
O	and
O	coming
O	down
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	what
O	provision
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	and
O	went
O	toward
O	it
O	,
O	the
O	distance
O	being
O	so
O	great
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	distinguish
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	approached
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	white
O	dome
O	,
O	of
O	a
O	prodigious
O	height
O	and
O	extent
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	I
O	touched
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	smooth
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	round
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	open
O	on
O	any
O	side
O	,
O	but
O	saw
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	climbing
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	smooth
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	at
O	least
O	fifty
O	paces
O	round
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	set
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	of
O	a
O	sudden
O	the
O	sky
O	became
O	as
O	dark
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	covered
O	with
O	a
O	thick
O	cloud
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	much
O	astonished
O	at
O	this
O	sudden
O	darkness
O	,
O	but
O	much
O	more
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	it
O	occasioned
O	by
O	a
O	bird
O	of
O	a
O	monstrous
O	size
O	,
O	that
O	came
O	flying
O	toward
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	remembered
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	often
O	heard
O	mariners
O	speak
O	of
O	a
O	miraculous
O	bird
O	called
O	the
C	Roc
O	,
O	and
O	conceived
O	that
O	the
O	great
O	dome
O	which
O	I
O	so
O	much
O	admired
O	must
O	be
O	its
O	egg
O	.
O	In
O	short
O	,
O	the
O	bird
O	alighted
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	over
O	the
O	egg
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	perceived
O	her
O	coming
O	,
O	I
O	crept
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	egg
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	before
O	me
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	legs
O	of
O	the
O	bird
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	as
O	big
O	as
O	the
O	trunk
O	of
O	a
O	tree
O	.
O	I
O	tied
O	myself
O	strongly
O	to
O	it
O	with
O	my
O	turban
O	,
O	in
O	hopes
O	that
O	the
O	roc
O	next
O	morning
O	would
O	carry
O	me
O	with
O	her
O	out
O	of
O	this
O	desert
O	island
O	.
O	After
O	having
O	passed
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	this
O	condition
O	,
O	the
O	bird
O	flew
O	away
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	daylight
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	me
O	so
O	high
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	discern
O	the
O	earth
O	;
O	she
O	afterward
O	descended
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	rapidity
O	that
O	I
O	lost
O	my
O	senses
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	I
O	speedily
O	untied
O	the
O	knot
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	scarcely
O	done
O	so
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	roc
O	,
O	having
O	taken
O	up
O	a
O	serpent
O	of
O	a
O	monstrous
O	length
O	in
O	her
O	bill
O	,
O	flew
O	away
O	.
O	The
O	spot
O	where
O	it
O	left
O	me
O	was
O	encompassed
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	by
O	mountains
O	,
O	that
O	seemed
O	to
O	reach
O	above
O	the
O	clouds
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	steep
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	possibility
O	of
O	getting
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	new
O	perplexity
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	I
O	compared
O	this
O	place
O	with
O	the
O	desert
O	island
O	from
O	which
O	the
O	roc
O	had
O	brought
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	gained
O	nothing
O	by
O	the
O	change
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	walked
O	through
O	this
O	valley
O	,
O	I
O	perceived
O	it
O	was
O	strewed
O	with
O	diamonds
O	,
O	some
O	of
O	which
O	were
O	of
O	surprising
O	bigness
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	pleasure
O	in
O	looking
O	upon
O	them
O	;
O	but
O	shortly
O	saw
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	such
O	objects
O	as
O	greatly
O	diminished
O	my
O	satisfaction
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	view
O	without
O	terror
O	,
O	namely
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	serpents
O	,
O	so
O	monstrous
O	that
O	the
O	least
O	of
O	them
O	was
O	capable
O	of
O	swallowing
O	an
O	elephant
O	.
O	They
O	retired
O	in
O	the
O	day-time
O	to
O	their
O	dens
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	hid
O	themselves
O	from
O	the
O	roc
O	,
O	their
O	enemy
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	out
O	only
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	.
O	I
O	spent
O	the
O	day
O	in
O	walking
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	resting
O	myself
O	at
O	times
O	in
O	such
O	places
O	as
O	I
O	thought
O	most
O	convenient
O	.
O	When
O	night
O	came
O	on
O	I
O	went
O	into
O	I
O	cave
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	thought
O	I
O	might
O	repose
O	in
O	safety
O	.
O	I
O	secured
O	the
O	entrance
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	low
O	and
O	narrow
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	,
O	to
O	preserve
O	me
O	from
O	the
O	serpents
O	;
O	but
O	not
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	to
O	exclude
O	the
O	light
O	.
O	I
O	supped
O	on
O	part
O	of
O	my
O	provisions
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	serpents
O	,
O	which
O	began
O	hissing
O	round
O	me
O	,
O	put
O	me
O	into
O	such
O	extreme
O	fear
O	that
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	sleep
O	.
O	When
O	day
O	appeared
O	the
O	serpents
O	retired
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	cave
O	trembling
O	.
O	I
O	can
O	justly
O	say
O	that
O	I
O	walked
O	upon
O	diamonds
O	without
O	feeling
O	any
O	inclination
O	to
O	touch
O	them
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	I
O	sat
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	notwithstanding
O	my
O	apprehensions
O	,
O	not
O	having
O	closed
O	my
O	eyes
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	fell
O	asleep
O	,
O	after
O	having
O	eaten
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	of
O	my
O	provisions
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	had
O	scarcely
O	shut
O	my
O	eyes
O	when
O	something
O	that
O	fell
O	by
O	me
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	awaked
O	me
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	large
O	piece
O	of
O	raw
O	meat
O	;
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	I
O	saw
O	several
O	others
O	fall
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	rocks
O	in
O	different
O	places
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	always
O	regarded
O	as
O	fabulous
O	what
O	I
O	had
O	heard
O	sailors
O	and
O	others
O	relate
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	of
O	diamonds
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	stratagems
O	employed
O	by
O	merchants
O	to
O	obtain
O	jewels
O	from
O	thence
O	;
O	but
O	now
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	stated
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	truth
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	fact
O	is
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	merchants
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	of
O	this
O	valley
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	eagles
O	have
O	young
O	ones
O	,
O	and
O	throwing
O	great
O	joints
O	of
O	meat
O	into
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	the
O	diamonds
O	,
O	upon
O	whose
O	points
O	they
O	fall
O	,
O	stick
O	to
O	them
O	;
O	the
O	eagles
O	,
O	which
O	are
O	stronger
O	in
O	this
O	country
O	than
O	anywhere
O	else
O	,
O	pounce
O	with
O	great
O	force
O	upon
O	those
O	pieces
O	of
O	meat
O	,
O	and
O	carry
O	them
O	to
O	their
O	nests
O	on
O	the
O	precipices
O	of
O	the
O	rocks
O	to
O	feed
O	their
O	young
O	:
O	the
O	merchants
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	run
O	to
O	their
O	nests
O	,
O	disturb
O	and
O	drive
O	off
O	the
O	eagles
O	by
O	their
O	shouts
O	,
O	and
O	take
O	away
O	the
O	diamonds
O	that
O	stick
O	to
O	the
O	meat
O	.
O	I
O	perceived
O	in
O	this
O	device
O	the
O	means
O	of
O	my
O	deliverance
O	.
O	Having
O	collected
O	together
O	the
O	largest
O	diamonds
O	I
O	could
O	find
O	,
O	I
O	put
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	leather
O	bag
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	used
O	to
O	carry
O	my
O	provisions
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	the
O	largest
O	of
O	the
O	pieces
O	of
O	meat
O	,
O	tied
O	it
O	close
O	round
O	me
O	with
O	the
O	cloth
O	of
O	my
O	turban
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	laid
O	myself
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	with
O	my
O	face
O	downward
O	,
O	the
O	bag
O	of
O	diamonds
O	being
O	made
O	fast
O	to
O	my
O	girdle
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	scarcely
O	placed
O	myself
O	in
O	this
O	posture
O	when
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	eagles
O	,
O	having
O	taken
O	me
O	up
O	with
O	the
O	piece
O	of
O	meat
O	to
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	fastened
O	,
O	carried
O	me
O	to
O	his
O	nest
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	.
O	The
O	merchants
O	immediately
O	began
O	their
O	shouting
O	to
O	frighten
O	the
O	eagles
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	obliged
O	them
O	to
O	quit
O	their
O	prey
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	nest
O	where
O	I
O	was
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	much
O	alarmed
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	me
O	;
O	but
O	recovering
O	himself
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	inquiring
O	how
O	I
O	came
O	thither
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	quarrel
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	why
O	I
O	stole
O	his
O	goods
O	?
O	``
O	You
O	will
O	treat
O	me
O	,
O	``
O	replied
O	I
O	,
O	``
O	with
O	more
O	civility
O	,
O	when
O	you
O	know
O	me
O	better
O	.
O	Do
O	not
O	be
O	uneasy
O	;
O	I
O	have
O	diamonds
O	enough
O	for
O	you
O	and
O	myself
O	,
O	more
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	other
O	merchants
O	together
O	.
O	Whatever
O	they
O	have
O	they
O	owe
O	to
O	chance
O	;
O	but
O	I
O	selected
O	for
O	myself
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	those
O	which
O	you
O	see
O	in
O	this
O	bag
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	had
O	scarcely
O	done
O	speaking
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	other
O	merchants
O	came
O	crowding
O	about
O	us
O	,
O	much
O	astonished
O	to
O	see
O	me
O	;
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	much
O	more
O	surprised
O	when
O	I
O	told
O	them
O	my
O	story
O	.
O	They
O	conducted
O	me
O	to
O	their
O	encampment
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	having
O	opened
O	my
O	bag
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	surprised
O	at
O	the
O	largeness
O	of
O	my
O	diamonds
O	,
O	and
O	confessed
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	any
O	of
O	such
O	size
O	and
O	perfection
O	.
O	I
O	prayed
O	the
C	merchant
O	who
O	owned
O	the
O	nest
O	to
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	carried
O	(
O	for
O	every
C	merchant
O	had
O	his
O	own
O	)
O	to
O	take
O	as
O	many
O	for
O	his
O	share
O	as
O	he
O	pleased
O	.
O	He
O	contented
O	himself
O	with
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	the
O	least
O	of
O	them
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	pressed
O	him
O	to
O	take
O	more
O	,
O	without
O	fear
O	of
O	doing
O	me
O	any
O	injury
O	,
O	``
O	No
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	very
O	well
O	satisfied
O	with
O	this
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	valuable
O	enough
O	to
O	save
O	me
O	the
O	trouble
O	of
O	making
O	any
O	more
O	voyages
O	,
O	and
O	will
O	raise
O	as
O	great
O	a
O	fortune
O	as
O	I
O	desire
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	spent
O	the
O	night
O	with
O	the
O	merchants
O	,
O	to
O	whom
O	I
O	related
O	my
O	story
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	satisfaction
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	had
O	not
O	heard
O	it
O	,
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	moderate
O	my
O	joy
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	delivered
O	from
O	the
O	danger
O	I
O	have
O	mentioned
O	.
O	I
O	thought
O	myself
O	in
O	a
O	dream
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	scarcely
O	believe
O	myself
O	out
O	of
O	danger
O	.
O	The
O	merchants
O	had
O	thrown
O	their
O	pieces
O	of
O	meat
O	into
O	the
O	valley
O	for
O	several
O	days
O	;
O	and
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	being
O	satisfied
O	with
O	the
O	diamonds
O	that
O	had
O	fallen
O	to
O	his
O	lot
O	,
O	we
O	left
O	the
O	place
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	travelled
O	near
O	high
O	mountains
O	,
O	where
O	there
O	were
O	serpents
O	of
O	a
O	prodigious
O	length
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	fortune
O	to
O	escape
O	.
O	We
O	took
O	shipping
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	port
O	we
O	reached
O	,
O	and
O	touched
O	at
O	the
O	isle
O	of
O	Roha
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	trees
O	grow
O	that
O	yield
O	camphire
O	.
O	This
O	tree
O	is
O	so
O	large
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	branches
O	so
O	thick
O	,
O	that
O	one
O	hundred
O	men
O	may
O	easily
O	sit
O	under
O	its
O	shade
O	.
O	The
O	juice
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	camphire
O	is
O	made
O	,
O	exudes
O	from
O	a
O	hole
O	bored
O	in
O	the
O	upper
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	is
O	received
O	in
O	a
O	vessel
O	,
O	where
O	it
O	thickens
O	to
O	a
O	consistency
O	,
O	and
O	becomes
O	what
O	we
O	call
O	camphire
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	juice
O	is
O	thus
O	drawn
O	out
O	,
O	the
O	tree
O	withers
O	and
O	dies
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	island
O	is
O	also
O	found
O	the
O	rhinoceros
O	,
O	an
O	animal
O	less
O	than
O	the
O	elephant
O	,
O	but
O	larger
O	than
O	the
O	buffalo
O	.
O	It
O	has
O	a
O	horn
O	upon
O	its
O	nose
O	,
O	about
O	a
O	cubit
O	in
O	length
O	;
O	this
O	horn
O	is
O	solid
O	,
O	and
O	cleft
O	through
O	the
O	middle
O	.
O	The
O	rhinoceros
O	fights
O	with
O	the
O	elephant
O	,
O	runs
O	his
O	horn
O	into
O	his
O	belly
O	,
O	and
O	carries
O	him
O	off
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	blood
O	and
O	the
O	fat
O	of
O	the
O	elephant
O	running
O	into
O	his
O	eyes
O	and
O	making
O	him
O	blind
O	,
O	he
O	falls
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	;
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	strange
O	to
O	relate
O	,
O	the
O	roc
O	comes
O	and
O	carries
O	them
O	both
O	away
O	in
O	her
O	claws
O	,
O	for
O	food
O	for
O	her
O	young
O	ones
O	.
O	I
O	pass
O	over
O	many
O	other
O	things
O	peculiar
O	to
O	this
O	island
O	,
O	lest
O	I
O	should
O	weary
O	you
O	.
O	Here
O	I
O	exchanged
O	some
O	of
O	my
O	diamonds
O	for
O	merchandise
O	.
O	From
O	hence
O	we
O	went
O	to
O	other
O	islands
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	having
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	trading
O	towns
O	of
O	the
O	continent
O	,
O	we
O	landed
O	at
O	Bussorah
O	,
O	from
O	whence
O	I
O	proceeded
O	to
O	Bagdad
O	.
O	There
O	I
O	immediately
O	gave
O	large
O	presents
O	to
O	the
O	poor
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	honourably
O	upon
O	the
O	vast
O	riches
O	I
O	had
O	brought
O	,
O	and
O	gained
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	fatigue
O	.
O	Thus
C	Sindbad
O	ended
O	the
O	relation
O	of
O	the
O	second
O	voyage
O	,
O	gave
C	Hindbad
O	another
O	hundred
O	sequins
O	,
O	and
O	invited
O	him
O	to
O	come
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	to
O	hear
O	the
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	third
O	.
