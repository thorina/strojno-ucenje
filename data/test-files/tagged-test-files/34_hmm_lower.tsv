O	slept
O	on
O	.
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	back
O	again
O	and
O	shut
O	to
O	the
O	house
O	-
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	seating
O	himself
O	on
O	his
O	stool
O	,
O	began
O	working
O	very
O	industriously
O	.
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	nearly
O	dark
O	,
O	the
O	clever
O	alice
O	awoke
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	she
O	stood
O	up
O	,
O	the
O	net
O	fell
O	all
O	over
O	her
O	hair
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bells
O	jingled
O	at
O	every
O	step
O	she
O	took
O	.
O	this
O	quite
O	frightened
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	doubt
O	whether
O	she
O	were
O	really
O	clever
O	alice
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	herself
O	,
O	""""

O	,
O	or
O	am
O	i

O	""""
O	this
O	was
O	a
O	question
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	answer
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	stood
O	still
O	a
O	long
O	while
O	considering
O	about
O	it
O	.
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	thought
O	she
O	would
O	go
O	home
O	and
O	ask
O	whether
O	she
O	were
O	really
O	herself
O	--
O	supposing
O	somebody
O	would
O	be
O	able

O	.
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	house

O	it
O	was
O	shut
O	;
O	so
O	she
O	tapped
O	at
O	the

O	at

O	answer
O	she
O	became

O	,
O	and
O	exclaiming
O	,
O	""""

O	she
O	ran
O	up
O	to
O	another

O	,
O	intending
O	to

O	same

O	.
O	but
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	folks
O	within
O	heard
O	the
O	jingling
O	of
O	the
O	bells
O	in
O	her
O	net
O	,
O	they
O	refused

O	open

O	nobody

O	receive

O	so
O	she
O	ran
O	straight

O	no
