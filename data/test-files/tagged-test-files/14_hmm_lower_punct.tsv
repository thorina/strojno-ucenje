O	in
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	king
O	alfred
O	,
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	poor
O	woman
O	,
O	whose
O	cottage
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	remote
O	country
O	village
O	,
O	many
O	miles
O	from
O	london
O	.
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	widow
O	some
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	an
O	only
O	child
O	named
O	jack
O	,
O	whom
O	she
O	indulged
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	never
O	paid
O	the
O	least
O	attention
O	to
O	anything
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	indolent
O	,
O	careless
O	,
O	and
O	extravagant
O	.
O	his
O	follies
O	were
O	not
O	owing
O	to
O	a
O	bad
O	disposition
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	foolish
O	partiality
O	.
O	by
O	degrees
O	,
O	he
O	spent
O	all
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	--
O	scarcely
O	anything
O	remained
O	but
O	a
O	cow
O	.
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	in
O	her
O	life
O	,
O	she
O	reproached
O	him
O	:
O	``
O	cruel
O	,
O	cruel
O	boy
O	!
O	you
O	have
O	at
O	last
O	brought
O	me
O	to
O	beggary
O	.
O	i
O	have
O	not
O	money
O	enough
O	to
O	purchase
O	even
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	bread
O	;
O	nothing
O	now
O	remains
O	to
O	sell
O	but
O	my
O	poor
O	cow
O	!
O	i
O	am
O	sorry
O	to
O	part
O	with
O	her
O	;
O	it
O	grieves
O	me
O	sadly
O	,
O	but
O	we
O	can
O	not
O	starve
O	.
O	``
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	jack
O	felt
O	remorse
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	soon
O	over
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	began
O	asking
O	his
O	mother
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	sell
O	the
O	cow
O	at
O	the
O	next
O	village
O	;
O	teasing
O	her
O	so
O	much
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	at
O	last
O	consented
O	.
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	along
O	he
O	met
O	a
O	butcher
O	,
O	who
O	inquired
O	why
O	he
O	was
O	driving
O	the
O	cow
O	from
O	home
O	?
O	jack
O	replied
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	sell
O	it
O	.
O	the
O	butcher
O	held
O	some
O	curious
O	beans
O	in
O	his
O	hat
O	;
O	they
O	were
O	of
O	various
O	colors
O	,
O	and
O	attracted
O	jack
O	'
O	s
O	attention
O	;
O	this
O	did
O	not
O	pass
O	unnoticed
O	by
O	the
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	knowing
O	jack
O	'
O	s
O	easy
O	temper
O	,
O	thought
O	now
O	was
O	the
O	time
O	to
O	take
O	an
O	advantage
O	of
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	determined
O	not
O	to
O	let
O	slip
O	so
O	good
O	an
O	opportunity
O	,
O	asked
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	price
O	of
O	the
O	cow
O	,
O	offering
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	all
O	the
O	beans
O	in
O	his
O	hat
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	the
O	silly
O	boy
O	could
O	not
O	conceal
O	the
O	pleasure
O	he
O	felt
O	at
O	what
O	he
O	supposed
O	so
O	great
O	an
O	offer
O	:
O	the
O	bargain
O	was
O	struck
O	instantly
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	cow
O	exchanged
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	paltry
O	beans
O	.
O	jack
O	made
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	home
O	,
O	calling
O	aloud
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	before
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	thinking
O	to
O	surprise
O	her
O	.
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	beans
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	jack
O	'
O	s
O	account
O	,
O	her
O	patience
O	quite
O	forsook
O	her
O	:
O	she
O	tossed
O	the
O	beans
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	fell
O	on
O	the
O	garden-bed
O	below
O	.
O	then
O	she
O	threw
O	her
O	apron
O	over
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	bitterly
O	.
O	jack
O	attempted
O	to
O	console
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	not
O	having
O	anything
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	they
O	both
O	went
O	supperless
O	to
O	bed
O	.
O	jack
O	awoke
O	early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	seeing
O	something
O	uncommon
O	darkening
O	the
O	window
O	of
O	his
O	bedchamber
O	,
O	ran
O	downstairs
O	into
O	the
O	garden
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	found
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	beans
O	had
O	taken
O	root
O	,
O	and
O	sprung
O	up
O	surprisingly
O	:
O	the
O	stalks
O	were
O	of
O	an
O	immense
O	thickness
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	twined
O	together
O	until
O	they
O	formed
O	a
O	ladder
O	like
O	a
O	chain
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	high
O	that
O	the
O	top
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	lost
O	in
O	the
O	clouds
O	.
O	jack
O	was
O	an
O	adventurous
O	lad
O	;
O	he
O	determined
O	to
O	climb
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	to
O	tell
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	not
O	doubting
O	but
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	equally
O	pleased
O	with
O	himself
O	.
O	she
O	declared
O	he
O	should
O	not
O	go
O	;
O	said
O	it
O	would
O	break
O	her
O	heart
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	--
O	entreated
O	and
O	threatened
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	jack
O	set
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	climbing
O	for
O	some
O	hours
O	,
O	reached
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	,
O	quite
O	exhausted
O	.
O	looking
O	around
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	strange
O	country
O	;
O	it
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	barren
O	desert
O	--
O	not
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	shrub
O	,
O	house
O	,
O	or
O	living
O	creature
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	;
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	were
O	scattered
O	fragments
O	of
O	stone
O	;
O	and
O	at
O	unequal
O	distances
O	,
O	small
O	heaps
O	of
O	earth
O	were
O	loosely
O	thrown
O	together
O	.
O	jack
O	seated
O	himself
O	pensively
O	upon
O	a
O	block
O	of
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	of
O	his
O	mother
O	;
O	he
O	reflected
O	with
O	sorrow
O	upon
O	his
O	disobedience
O	in
O	climbing
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	against
O	her
O	will
O	,
O	and
O	concluded
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	die
O	of
O	hunger
O	.
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	walked
O	on
O	,
O	hoping
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	house
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	might
O	beg
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	drink
O	.
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	find
O	it
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	saw
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	a
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	,
O	walking
O	all
O	alone
O	.
O	she
O	was
O	elegantly
O	clad
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	a
O	white
O	wand
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	which
O	sat
O	a
O	peacock
O	of
O	pure
O	gold
O	.
O	jack
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	gallant
O	fellow
O	,
O	went
O	straight
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	;
O	when
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	bewitching
O	smile
O	,
O	she
O	asked
O	him
O	how
O	he
O	came
O	there
O	.
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	all
O	about
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	.
O	the
O	lady
O	answered
O	him
O	by
O	a
O	question
O	,
O	``
O	do
O	you
O	remember
O	your
O	father
O	,
O	young
O	man
O	?
O	``
O	``
O	no

O	him
O	to
O	my

O	!
O	``
O	she
O	bestowed
O	on
O	the
O	youth
O	a
O	benignant
O	smile
O	,
O	and
O	vanished
O	.
O	jack
O	pursued
O	his
O	journey
O	.
O	he
O	walked
O	on
O	till
O	after
O	sunset
O	,
O	when
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	joy
O	,
O	he
O	espied
O	a
O	large
O	mansion
O	.
O	a
O	plain-looking
O	woman
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	:
O	he
O	accosted
O	her
O	,
O	begging
O	she
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	a
O	morsel
O	of
O	bread
O	and
O	a
O	night
O	'
O	s
O	lodging
O	.
O	she
O	expressed
O	the
O	greatest
O	surprise
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	uncommon
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	human
O	being
O	near
O	their
O	house
O	;
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	well
O	known
O	that
O	her
O	husband
O	was
O	a
O	powerful
O	giant
O	,
O	who
O	would
O	never
O	eat
O	anything
O	but
O	human
O	flesh
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	possibly
O	get
O	it
O	;
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	walk
O	fifty
O	miles
O	to
O	procure
O	it
O	,
O	usually
O	being
O	out
O	the
O	whole
O	day
O	for
O	that
O	purpose
O	.
O	this
O	account
O	greatly
O	terrified
O	jack
O	,
O	but
O	still
O	he
O	hoped
O	to
O	elude
O	the
O	giant
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	he
O	again
O	entreated
O	the
O	woman
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	in
O	for
O	one
O	night
O	only
O	,
O	and
O	hide
O	him
O	where
O	she
O	thought
O	proper
O	.
O	she
O	at
O	last
O	suffered
O	herself
O	to
O	be
O	persuaded
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	of
O	a
O	compassionate
O	and
O	generous
O	disposition
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	first
O	,
O	they
O	entered
O	a
O	fine
O	large
O	hall
O	,
O	magnificently
O	furnished
O	;
O	they
O	then
O	passed
O	through
O	several
O	spacious
O	rooms
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	style
O	of
O	grandeur
O	;
O	but
O	all
O	appeared
O	forsaken
O	and
O	desolate
O	.
O	a
O	long
O	gallery
O	came
O	next
O	;
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	dark
O	--
O	just
O	light
O	enough
O	to
O	show
O	that
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	a
O	wall
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	grating
O	of
O	iron
O	which
O	parted
O	off
O	a
O	dismal
O	dungeon
O	,
O	from
O	whence
O	issued
O	the
O	groans
O	of
O	those
O	victims
O	whom
O	the
O	cruel
O	giant
O	reserved
O	in
O	confinement
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	voracious
O	appetite
O	.
O	poor
O	jack
O	was
O	half
O	dead
O	with
O	fear
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	given
O	the
O	world
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	with
O	his
O	mother
O	again
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	doubt
O	if
O	he
O	should
O	ever
O	see
O	her
O	more
O	;
O	he
O	even
O	mistrusted
O	the
O	good
O	woman
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	she
O	had
O	let
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	for
O	no
O	other
O	purpose
O	than
O	to
O	lock
O	him
O	up
O	among
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	people
O	in
O	the
O	dungeon
O	.
O	however
O	,
O	she
O	bade
O	jack
O	sit
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	plenty
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	drink
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	,
O	not
O	seeing
O	anything
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	uncomfortable
O	,
O	soon
O	forgot
O	his
O	fear
O	and
O	was
O	just
O	beginning
O	to
O	enjoy
O	himself
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	startled
O	by
O	a
O	loud
O	knocking
O	at
O	the
O	outer
O	door
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	the
O	whole
O	house
O	shake
O	.
O	``
O	ah
O	!
O	that
O	'
O	s
O	the
O	giant

O	if
O	he
O	sees
O	you
O	he
O	will
O	kill
O	you
O	and
O	me
O	too
O	,
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	poor
O	woman
O	,
O	trembling
O	all
O	over
O	.
O	``
O	what
O	shall
O	i
O	do
O	?

O	cried
O	jack
O	,
O	now
O	as
O	bold
O	as
O	a
O	lion
O	at
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	being
O	face
O	to
O	face
O	with
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	cruel
O	murderer
O	.
O	so
O	he
O	crept
O	into
O	the
O	oven
O	--
O	for
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	fire
O	near

O	up

O	down
O	the
O	kitchen
O	scolding
O	his

O	at

O	he
O	seated

O	at
O	table
O	,

O	jack
O	,
O	peeping
O	through
O	a
O	crevice
O	in
O	the
O	oven
O	,
O	was
O	amazed
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	a
O	quantity
O	of
O	food
O	he
O	devoured
O	.
O	it
O	seemed
O	as

O	he
O	never
O	would
O	have
O	done
O	eating
O	and
O	drinking
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	leaning
O	back
O	,
O	called
O	to
O	his

O	a

O	then

O	fell
O	asleep
O	by

O	the

O	.
O	these
O	eggs
O	being
O	sold
O	,
O	jack
O	and
O	his
O	mother
O	got
O	plenty
O	of
O	money
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	some
O	months
O	lived
O	very
O	happily
O	together
O	;
O	till
O	jack
O	got
O	another
O	great
O	longing
O	to
O	climb
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	,
O	and
O	carry
O	away
O	some
O	more
O	of
O	the

O	s
O	riches
O	.
O	he
O	had
O	told
O	his
O	mother
O	of
O	his
O	adventure
O	,
O	but
O	had
O	been
O	very
O	careful
O	not
O	to
O	say
O	a
O	word
O	about
O	his
O	father
O	.
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	his
O	journey
O	again

O	again
O	,
O	but
O	still
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	summon
O	resolution
O	enough
O	to
O	break
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	being
O	well
O	assured
O	that

O	endeavour
O	to
O	prevent

O	however
O	,
O	one
O	day
O	he
O	told

O	boldly
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	take
O	another
O	journey
O	up
O	the

O	begged

O	prayed
O	him
O	not
O	to

O	,
O	and
O	tried
O	all
O	in
O	her
O	power
O	to
O	dissuade
O	him
O	.
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	that

O	s
O	wife
O	would
O	certainly
O	know
O	him
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	that

O	would
O	desire
O	nothing
O	better
O	than
O	to
O	get
O	him
O	into
O	his
O	power
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	put
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	cruel
O	death
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	be
O	revenged
O	for
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	hen
O	.
O	jack
O	,
O	finding
O	that
O	all
O	his
O	arguments
O	were
O	useless
O	,
O	ceased
O	speaking
O	,
O	though
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	at
O	all
O	events
O	.
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	dress
O	prepared
O	which
O	would
O	disguise
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	something
O	to
O	colour
O	his
O	skin
O	;
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	impossible
O	for
O	any
O	one
O	to
O	recollect
O	him
O	in
O	this
O	dress
O	.
O	a
O	few
O	mornings
O	after
O	,
O	he
O	rose
O	very
O	early
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	unperceived
O	by
O	any
O	one
O	,
O	climbed
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	.
O	he
O	was
O	greatly
O	fatigued
O	when
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	hungry
O	.
O	having
O	rested
O	some
O	time
O	on
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	stones
O	,
O	he
O	pursued
O	his
O	journey
O	to
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	mansion
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	reached
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	:
O	the
O	woman
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	jack
O	addressed
O	her
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	telling
O	her
O	a
O	pitiful
O	tale
O	,
O	and
O	requesting
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	some
O	victuals
O	and
O	drink
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	a
O	night
O	'
O	s
O	lodging
O	.
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	(
O	what
O	he
O	knew
O	before
O	very
O	well
O	)
O	about
O	her
O	husband
O	'
O	s
O	being
O	a
O	powerful
O	and
O	cruel
O	giant
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	one
O	night
O	admitted
O	a
O	poor
O	,
O	hungry
O	,
O	friendless
O	boy
O	;
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	ungrateful
O	fellow
O	had
O	stolen
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	treasures
O	;
O	and
O	ever
O	since
O	that
O	her
O	husband
O	had
O	been
O	worse
O	than
O	before
O	,
O	using
O	her
O	very
O	cruelly
O	,
O	and
O	continually
O	upbraiding
O	her
O	with
O	being
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	his
O	misfortune
O	.
O	jack
O	felt
O	sorry
O	for
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	confessed
O	nothing
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	his
O	best
O	to
O	persuade
O	her
O	to
O	admit
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	found
O	it
O	a
O	very
O	hard
O	task
O	.
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	consented
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	led
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	jack
O	observed
O	that
O	everything
O	was
O	just
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	found
O	it
O	before
O	:
O	she
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	kitchen
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	eating
O	and
O	drinking
O	,
O	she
O	hid
O	him
O	in
O	an
O	old
O	lumber-closet
O	.
O	the
O	giant
O	returned
O	at
O	the
O	usual
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	walked
O	in
O	so
O	heavily
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	house
O	was
O	shaken
O	to
O	its
O	foundation
O	.
O	he
O	seated
O	himself
O	by
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	after

O	the

O	had
O	brought
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	raw
O	meat
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	it
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	while
O	supper
O	was
O	preparing
O	,
O	the
O	giant
O	was
O	very
O	ill-tempered
O	and
O	impatient
O	,
O	frequently
O	lifting
O	up
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	strike
O	his
O	wife

O	upbraiding
O	her

O	wonderful

O	at
O	last
O	,
O	having
O	ended
O	his
O	supper
O	,
O	he
O	cried
O	,
O	``

O	so
O	the

O	crept
O	away

O	jack
O	from
O	his
O	hiding-place
O	watched
O	the
O	counting
O	of
O	the

O	,
O	which
O	he
O	knew

O	his

O	,
O	and
O	wished
O	it

O	his
O	own
O	;
O	it
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	much
O	less
O	trouble
O	than
O	going
O	about
O	selling
O	the
O	golden
O	eggs
O	.
O	the
O	giant
O	,
O	little
O	thinking
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	narrowly
O	observed
O	,
O	reckoned
O	it
O	all
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	replaced
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	two
O	bags
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	tied
O	up
O	very
O	carefully
O	and
O	put
O	beside
O	his
O	chair
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	little
O	dog
O	to
O	guard
O	them
O	.
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	fell
O	asleep
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	snored
O	so
O	loud
O	,
O	that
O	jack
O	compared
O	his
O	noise
O	to
O	the
O	roaring
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	in
O	a
O	high
O	wind
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	tide
O	is
O	coming
O	in
O	.
O	at
O	last
O	jack
O	,
O	concluding
O	all
O	secure
O	,
O	stole
O	out
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	carry
O	off
O	the
O	two
O	bags
O	of
O	money
O	;
O	but
O	just
O	as
O	he
O	laid
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	the
O	little
O	dog
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	perceived
O	before
O	,
O	started
O	from
O	under
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	chair
O	and
O	barked
O	most
O	furiously
O	.
O	instead
O	of
O	endeavouring
O	to
O	escape
O	,
O	jack
O	stood
O	still
O	,
O	though
O	expecting
O	his
O	enemy
O	to
O	awake
O	every
O	instant
O	.
O	contrary
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	expectation
O	,
O	the
O	giant
O	continued
O	in
O	a
O	sound
O	sleep
O	,
O	and
O	jack
O	,
O	seeing
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	meat
O	,
O	threw
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	dog
O	,
O	who
O	at
O	once
O	ceased
O	barking
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	devour
O	it
O	.
O	so
O	jack
O	carried
O	off
O	the
O	bags
O	,
O	one
O	on
O	each
O	shoulder
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	so
O	heavy
O	that
O	it
O	took
O	him
O	two
O	whole
O	days
O	to
O	descend
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	and
O	get
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	door
O	.
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	cottage
O	deserted
O	.
O	he
O	ran
O	from
O	one
O	room
O	to
O	another
O	,
O	without
O	being
O	able
O	to
O	find
O	any
O	one
O	;
O	he
O	then
O	hastened
O	into
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	hoping
O	to
O	see
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	neighbours
O	,
O	who
O	could
O	inform
O	him
O	where
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	his
O	mother
O	.
O	an
O	old
O	woman
O	at
O	last
O	directed
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	house
O	,
O	where
O	she
O	was
O	ill
O	of
O	a
O	fever
O	.
O	he
O	was
O	greatly
O	shocked
O	at
O	finding
O	her
O	apparently
O	dying
O	,
O	and
O	blamed
O	himself
O	bitterly
O	as
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	it
O	all
O	.
O	however
O	,
O	at
O	sight
O	of
O	her
O	dear
O	son
O	,
O	the
O	poor
O	woman
O	revived
O	,
O	and
O	slowly
O	recovered
O	health
O	.
O	jack
O	gave
O	her
O	his
O	two
O	money-bags
O	;
O	they
O	had
O	the
O	cottage
O	rebuilt
O	and
O	well
O	furnished
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	happier
O	than
O	they
O	had
O	ever
O	done
O	before
O	.
O	for
O	three
O	years
O	jack
O	heard
O	no
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	forget
O	it
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	feared
O	making
O	his
O	mother
O	unhappy
O	.
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	endeavouring
O	to
O	amuse
O	himself
O	;
O	he
O	became
O	thoughtful
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	arise
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	dawn
O	of
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	sit
O	looking
O	at
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	for
O	hours
O	together
O	.
O	his
O	mother
O	saw
O	that
O	something
O	preyed
O	upon
O	his
O	mind
O	,
O	and
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	discover
O	the
O	cause
O	;
O	but
O	jack
O	knew
O	too
O	well
O	what
O	the
O	consequence
O	would
O	be
O	should
O	she
O	succeed
O	.
O	he
O	did
O	his
O	utmost
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	to
O	conquer
O	the
O	great
O	desire
O	he
O	had
O	for
O	another
O	journey
O	up
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	.
O	finding
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	his
O	inclination
O	grew
O	too
O	powerful
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	make
O	secret
O	preparations
O	for
O	his
O	journey
O	.
O	he
O	got
O	ready
O	a
O	new
O	disguise
O	,
O	better
O	and
O	more
O	complete
O	than
O	the
O	former
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	summer
O	came
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	longest
O	day
O	he
O	awoke
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	light
O	,
O	and
O	without
O	telling
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	ascended
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	.
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	road
O	,
O	journey
O	,
O	&
O	c
O	.
O	,
O	much
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	two
O	former
O	times
O	.
O	he
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	mansion
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	wife
O	standing
O	,
O	as
O	usual
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	jack
O	had
O	disguised
O	himself
O	so
O	completely
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	least
O	recollection
O	of
O	him
O	;
O	however
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	pleaded
O	hunger
O	and
O	poverty
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	gain
O	admittance
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	it
O	very
O	difficult
O	indeed
O	to
O	persuade
O	her
O	.
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	prevailed
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	concealed
O	in
O	the
O	copper
O	.
O	when
O	the
O	giant
O	returned
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	furiously
O	,
O	``
O	i
O	smell
O	fresh
O	meat
O	!
O	``
O	but
O	jack
O	felt
O	quite
O	composed
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	said
O	so
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	been
O	soon
O	satisfied
O	.
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	giant
O	started
O	up
O	suddenly
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	notwithstanding
O	all
O	his
O	wife
O	could
O	say
O	,
O	he
O	searched
O	all
O	round
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	whilst
O	this
O	was
O	going
O	forward
O	,
O	jack
O	was
O	exceedingly
O	terrified
O	,
O	wishing
O	himself
O	at
O	home
O	a
O	thousand
O	times
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	giant
O	approached
O	the
O	copper
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	the
O	lid
O	,
O	jack
O	thought
O	his
O	death
O	was
O	certain
O	.
O	however
O	,
O	nothing
O	happened
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	giant
O	did
O	not
O	take
O	the
O	trouble
O	to
O	lift
O	up
O	the
O	lid
O	,
O	but
O	sat
O	down
O	shortly
O	by
O	the
O	fireside
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	eat
O	his
O	enormous
O	supper
O	.
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	finished
O	,
O	he
O	commanded
O	his
O	wife
O	to
O	fetch
O	down
O	his
O	harp
O	.
O	jack
O	peeped
O	under
O	the
O	copper-lid
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	most
O	beautiful
O	harp
O	.
O	the
O	giant
O	placed
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	,
O	said
O	``
O	play
O	!
O	``
O	and
O	it
O	played
O	of
O	its
O	own
O	accord
O	,
O	without
O	anybody
O	touching
O	it
O	,
O	the
O	most
O	exquisite
O	music
O	imaginable
O	.
O	jack
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	musician
O	,
O	was
O	delighted
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	anxious
O	to
O	get
O	this
O	than
O	any
O	other
O	of
O	his
O	enemy
O	'
O	s
O	treasures
O	.
O	but
O	the
O	giant
O	not
O	being
O	particularly
O	fond
O	of
O	music
O	,
O	the
O	harp
O	had
O	only
O	the
O	effect
O	of
O	lulling
O	him
O	to
O	sleep
O	earlier
O	than
O	usual
O	.
O	as
O	for
O	the
O	wife
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	bed
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	ever
O	she
O	could
O	.
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	thought
O	all
O	was
O	safe
O	,
O	jack
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	copper
O	,
O	and
O	seizing
O	the
O	harp
O	,
O	was
O	eagerly
O	running
O	off
O	with
O	it
O	.
O	but
O	the
O	harp
O	was
O	enchanted
O	by
O	a
O	fairy
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	found
O	itself
O	in
O	strange
O	hands
O	,
O	it
O	called
O	out
O	loudly
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	alive
O	,
O	``

O	the
O	giant
O	awoke
O	,

O	up
O	,

O	away
O	as
O	fast
O	as

O	could
O	carry
O	him
O	.

O	could
O	hardly

O	scrambled
O	down
O	it
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	,
O	the
O	harp
O	playing
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	the
O	most
O	melancholy
O	music
O	till
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	stop
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	it
O	stopped
O	.
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	his
O	mother
O	sitting
O	at
O	her
O	cottage-door
O	,
O	weeping
O	silently
O	.
O	``
O	here
O	,
O	mother
O	,
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	cry
O	;
O	just
O	give
O	me
O	a
O	hatchet
O	;
O	make
O	haste
O	.
O	``
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	moment
O	to
O	spare
O	;
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	giant
O	beginning
O	to
O	descend
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	.
O	however
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	too
O	late
O	--
O	the
O	monster
O	'
O	s
O	ill
O	deeds
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	an
O	end
O	.
O	jack
O	with
O	his
O	hatchet
O	cut
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	close
O	off
O	at
O	the
O	root
O	;
O	the
O	giant
O	fell
O	headlong
O	into
O	the
O	garden
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	killed
O	on
O	the
O	spot
O	.
O	instantly
O	the
O	fairy
O	appeared
O	,
O	and
O	explained
O	everything
O	to
O	jack
O	'
O	s
O	mother
O	,
O	begging
O	her
O	to
O	forgive
O	jack
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	own
O	son
O	for
O	bravery
O	and
O	generosity
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	would
O	be
O	sure
O	to
O	make
O	her
O	happy
O	for
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	her
O	days
O	.
O	so
O	all
O	ended
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	nothing
O	was
O	ever
O	beard
O	or
O	seen
O	of
O	the
O	wonderful
O	bean-stalk
O	.
