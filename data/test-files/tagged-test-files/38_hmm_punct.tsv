O	My
O	father
O	was
O	a
O	rich
O	merchant
O	.
O	He
O	bequeathed
O	me
O	a
O	large
O	estate
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	wasted
O	in
O	riotous
O	living
O	.
O	I
O	quickly
O	,
O	perceived
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	misspending
O	my
O	time
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	of
O	all
O	things
O	the
O	most
O	valuable
O	.
O	I
O	remembered
O	the
O	saying
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	Solomon
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	frequently
O	heard
O	from
O	my
O	father
O	,
O	``
O	A
O	good
O	name
O	is
O	better
O	than
O	precious
O	ointment
O	``
O	;
O	and
O	again
O	,
O	``
O	Wisdom
O	is
O	good
O	with
O	an
O	inheritance
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	walk
O	in
O	my
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	ways
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	entered
O	into
O	a
O	contract
O	with
O	some
O	merchants
O	,
O	and
O	embarked
O	with
O	them
O	on
O	board
O	a
O	ship
O	we
O	had
O	fitted
O	out
O	in
O	partnership
O	.
O	We
O	set
O	sail
O	,
O	and
O	steered
O	our
O	course
O	toward
O	the
O	Indies
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	Persian
O	Gulf
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	I
O	was
O	troubled
O	with
O	sea-sickness
O	,
O	but
O	speedily
O	recovered
O	my
O	health
O	.
O	In
O	our
O	voyage
O	we
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	islands
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	sold
O	or
O	exchanged
O	our
O	goods
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	we
O	were
O	becalmed
O	near
O	a
O	small
O	island
O	,
O	but
O	little
O	elevated
O	above
O	the
O	level
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	resembling
O	a
O	green
O	meadow
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	ordered
O	his
O	sails
O	to
O	be
O	furled
O	,
O	and
O	permitted
O	such
O	persons
O	as
O	were
O	so
O	inclined
O	to
O	land
O	.
O	While
O	we
O	were
O	enjoying
O	ourselves
O	eating
O	and
O	drinking
O	,
O	and
O	recovering
O	from
O	the
O	fatigue
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	a
O	sudden
O	trembled
O	and
O	shook
O	us
O	terribly
O	.
O	The
O	trembling
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	noticed
O	on
O	board
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	were
O	called
O	upon
O	to
O	re-embark
O	speedily
O	,
O	lest
O	we
O	should
O	all
O	be
O	lost
O	;
O	for
O	what
O	we
O	took
O	for
O	an
O	island
O	proved
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	back
O	of
O	a
O	sea
O	monster
O	.
O	The
O	nimblest
O	got
O	into
O	the
O	sloop
O	,
O	others
O	betook
O	themselves
O	to
O	swimming
O	;
O	but
O	as
O	for
O	myself
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	still
O	upon
O	the
O	island
O	when
O	it
O	disappeared
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	only
O	time
O	to
O	catch
O	hold
O	of
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	wood
O	that
O	we
O	had
O	brought
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	fire
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	having
O	received
O	on
O	board
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	sloop
O	,
O	and
O	taken
O	up
O	some
O	of
O	those
O	that
O	swam
O	,
O	resolved
O	to
O	take
O	advantage
O	of
O	the
O	favorable
O	gale
O	that
O	had
O	just
O	risen
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	hoisting
O	his
O	sails
O	,
O	pursued
O	his
O	voyage
O	.
O	Thus
O	was
O	I
O	exposed
O	to
O	the
O	mercy
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	that
O	day
O	and
O	the
O	following
O	night
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	I
O	found
O	my
O	strength
O	gone
O	,
O	and
O	despaired
O	of
O	saving
O	my
O	life
O	,
O	when
O	happily
O	a
O	wave
O	threw
O	me
O	on
O	an
O	island
O	.
O	The
O	bank
O	was
O	high
O	and
O	rugged
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	scarcely
O	have
O	got
O	up
O	had
O	it
O	not
O	been
O	for
O	some
O	roots
O	of
O	trees
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	within
O	reach
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	sun
O	arose
O	I
O	was
O	very
O	feeble
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	some
O	herbs
O	fit
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	luck
O	to
O	discover
O	a
O	spring
O	of
O	excellent
O	water
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	I
O	advanced
O	further
O	into
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	reached
O	a
O	fine
O	plain
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	perceived
O	some
O	horses
O	feeding
O	.
O	On
O	my
O	way
O	toward
O	them
O	I
O	heard
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	asked
O	me
O	who
O	I
O	was
O	.
O	I
O	related
O	to
O	him
O	my
O	adventure
O	,
O	after
O	which
O	,
O	taking
O	me
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	,
O	he
O	led
O	me
O	into
O	a
O	cave
O	,
O	where
O	there
O	were
O	several
O	other
O	people
O	,
O	no
O	less
O	amazed
O	to
O	see
O	me
O	than
O	I
O	was
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	.
O	I
O	partook
O	of
O	some
O	provisions
O	which
O	they
O	offered
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	them
O	what
O	they
O	did
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	desert
O	place
O	;
O	to
O	which
O	they
O	answered
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	grooms
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
O	sovereign
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	every
O	year
O	they
O	brought
O	thither
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	horses
O	for
O	pasturage
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	to
O	return
O	home
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	I
O	been
O	one
O	day
O	later
O	I
O	must
O	have
O	perished
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	inhabited
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	distance
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	impossible
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	have
O	reached
O	it
O	without
O	a
O	guide
O	.
O	Next
O	morning
O	they
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	capital
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	took
O	me
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	presented
O	me
O	to
O	their
O	king
O	.
O	He
O	asked
O	me
O	who
O	I
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	what
O	adventure
O	I
O	had
O	come
O	into
O	his
O	dominions
O	.
O	After
O	I
O	had
O	satisfied
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	ordered
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	want
O	for
O	nothing
O	.
O	Being
O	a
O	merchant
O	,
O	I
O	frequented
O	men
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	profession
O	,
O	and
O	particularly
O	inquired
O	for
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	strangers
O	,
O	that
O	perchance
O	I
O	might
O	hear
O	news
O	from
O	Bagdad
O	,
O	or
O	find
O	an
O	opportunity
O	to
O	return
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	Maharaja
O	'
O	s
O	capital
O	is
O	situated
O	on
O	the
O	sea-coast
O	,
O	and
O	has
O	a
O	fine
O	harbor
O	,
O	where
O	ships
O	arrive
O	daily
O	from
O	the
O	different
O	quarters
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	I
O	frequented
O	also
O	the
O	society
O	of
O	the
O	learned
O	Indians
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	delight
O	to
O	hear
O	them
O	converse
O	;
O	but
O	withal
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	make
O	my
O	court
O	regularly
O	to
O	the
O	Maharaja
O	,
O	and
O	conversed
O	with
O	the
O	governors
O	and
O	petty
O	kings
O	,
O	his
O	tributaries
O	,
O	that
O	were
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	They
O	put
O	a
O	thousand
O	questions
O	respecting
O	my
O	country
O	;
O	and
O	I
O	,
O	being
O	willing
O	to
O	inform
O	myself
O	as
O	to
O	their
O	laws
O	and
O	customs
O	,
O	asked
O	them
O	concerning
O	everything
O	which
O	I
O	thought
O	worth
O	knowing
O	.
O	There
O	belongs
O	to
O	this
O	king
O	an
O	island
O	named
O	Cassel
O	.
O	They
O	assured
O	me
O	that
O	every
O	night
O	a
O	noise
O	of
O	drums
O	was
O	heard
O	there
O	,
O	whence
O	the
O	mariners
O	fancied
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	residence
O	of
O	Degial
O	.
O	I
O	determined
O	to
O	visit
O	this
O	wonderful
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	my
O	way
O	thither
O	saw
O	fishes
O	of
O	100
O	and
O	200
O	cubits
O	long
O	that
O	occasion
O	more
O	fear
O	than
O	hurt
O	;
O	for
O	they
O	are
O	so
O	timorous
O	that
O	they
O	will
O	fly
O	upon
O	the
O	rattling
O	of
O	two
O	sticks
O	or
O	boards
O	.
O	I
O	saw
O	likewise
O	other
O	fish
O	about
O	a
O	cubit
O	in
O	length
O	,
O	that
O	had
O	heads
O	like
O	owls
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	was
O	one
O	day
O	at
O	the
O	port
O	after
O	my
O	return
O	,
O	the
O	ship
O	arrived
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	embarked
O	at
O	Bussorah

O	at
O	once
O	knew
O	the

O	,
O	from
O	whence
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	this
O	city
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	100
O	,
O	000
O	sequins
O	.
O	Sindbad
O	stopped
O	here
O	,
O	and
O	ordered
O	the
O	musicians
O	to
O	proceed
O	with
O	their
O	concert
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	story
O	had
O	interrupted
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	evening
O	,
O	Sindbad
O	sent
O	for
O	a
O	purse
O	of
O	100
O	sequins
O	,
O	and
O	giving
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	porter
O	,
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Take
O	this
O	,
O	Hindbad
O	,
O	return
O	to
O	your
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	come
O	back
O	to-morrow
O	to
O	hear
O	more
O	of
O	my
O	adventures
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	porter
O	went
O	away
O	,
O	astonished
O	at
O	the
O	honor
O	done
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	present
O	made
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	account
O	of
O	this
O	adventure
O	proved
O	very
O	agreeable
O	to
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	children
O	,
O	who
O	did
O	not
O	fail
O	to
O	return
O	thanks
O	for
O	what
O	Providence
O	had
O	sent
O	them
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	of
O	Sindbad
O	.
O	Hindbad
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	best
O	robe
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	bountiful
O	traveller
O	,
O	who
O	received
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	pleasant
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	welcomed
O	him
O	heartily
O	.
O	When
O	all
O	the
O	guests
O	had
O	arrived
O	,
O	dinner
O	was
O	served
O	,
O	and
O	continued
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	ended
O	,
O	Sindbad
O	,
O	addressing
O	himself
O	to
O	the
O	company
O	,
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Gentlemen
O	,
O	be
O	pleased
O	to
O	listen
O	to
O	the
O	adventures
O	of
O	my
O	second
O	voyage
O	.
O	They
O	deserve
O	your
O	attention
O	even
O	more
O	than
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	.
O	``
O	Upon
O	which
O	every
O	one
O	held
O	his
O	peace
O	,
O	and
O	Sindbad
O	proceeded
O	.
