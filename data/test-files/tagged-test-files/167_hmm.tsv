O	This
O	adventure
O	came
O	about
O	through
O	an
O	invitation
O	which
O	Ray
O	Churchill
O	received
O	from
O	his
O	friend
O	,
O	Jacques
O	Pourbiere
O	of
O	Two
O	Rivers
O	,
O	New
O	Brunswick
O	.
O	Ray
O	had
O	half
O	-
O	promised
O	to
O	visit
O	his
O	New
O	Brunswick
O	acquaintance
O	during
O	the
O	deer
O	-
O	hunting
O	season
O	,
O	and
O	late
O	in
O	August
O	was
O	reminded
O	of
O	the
O	fact
O	.
O	A
O	second
O	letter
O	came
O	in
O	September
O	,
O	the
O	carefully
O	worded
O	school
O	English
O	of
O	the
O	writer
O	not
O	being
O	able
O	to
O	conceal
O	the
O	warmth
O	and
O	urgency
O	of
O	the
O	invitation
O	.
O	So
O	Ray
O	telegraphed
O	his
O	acceptance
O	,
O	and
O	four
O	days
O	later
O	arrived
O	at
O	Fredericton
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	secured
O	a
O	hunting
O	license
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	he
O	reached
O	Two
O	Rivers
O	,
O	and
O	Jacques
O	met
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	span
O	of
O	ponies
O	,
O	attached
O	to
O	a
O	queer
O	spring
O	vehicle
O	,
O	mounted
O	on
O	wheels
O	that
O	seemed
O	out
O	of
O	all
O	proportion
O	to
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	carriage
O	.
O	Ray
O	wondered
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	relic
O	of
O	Acadia
O	,
O	but
O	did
O	not
O	like
O	to
O	ask
O	.
O	They
O	drove
O	for
O	a
O	dozen
O	miles
O	through
O	a
O	wooded
O	and
O	hilly
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	arrived
O	at
O	their
O	destination
O	shortly
O	before
O	nightfall
O	.
O	Jacques
O	was
O	quite
O	alone
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	,
O	as
O	his
O	parents
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	visit
O	their
O	older
O	children
O	along
O	the
O	St
O	.
O	John
O	River
O	.
O	He
O	promised
O	Ray
O	at
O	least
O	one
O	deer
O	within
O	a
O	couple
O	of
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	another
O	within
O	a
O	week
O	.
O	The
O	Pourbiere
O	home
O	resembled
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	better
O	class
O	of
O	_habitants_
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	a
O	difference
O	due
O	to
O	the
O	greater
O	prosperity
O	of
O	the
O	family
O	in
O	preceding
O	generations
O	.
O	The
O	main
O	room
O	had
O	a
O	huge
O	fireplace
O	,
O	used
O	only
O	occasionally
O	,
O	for
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	air
O	-
O	tight
O	stove
O	connected
O	with
O	the
O	chimney
O	just
O	above
O	it
O	,
O	to
O	afford
O	greater
O	warmth
O	in
O	winter
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	rooms
O	Were
O	chiefly
O	detached
O	,
O	although
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	entry
O	-
O	like
O	porch
O	on
O	the
O	south
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	living
O	-
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	huge
O	door
O	opening
O	at
O	the
O	east
O	end
O	,
O	both
O	connecting
O	with
O	the
O	yard
O	outside
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	wood
O	-
O	shed
O	,
O	milk
O	-
O	house
O	and
O	summer
O	kitchen
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	rear
O	,
O	each
O	being
O	a
O	rectangular
O	building
O	of
O	heavy
O	logs
O	,
O	with
O	low
O	lofts
O	above
O	.
O	The
O	homestead
O	was
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	a
O	cluster
O	of
O	houses
O	rather
O	than
O	a
O	single
O	dwelling
O	.
O	What
O	most
O	attracted
O	Ray
O	'
O	s
O	attention
O	were
O	the
O	huge
O	bedsteads
O	in
O	the
O	living
O	-
O	room
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	tall
O	four
O	-
O	posters
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	elsewhere
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	the
O	difference
O	that
O	a
O	canopy
O	covered
O	them
O	.
O	Each
O	had
O	a
O	carved
O	wooden
O	frame
O	,
O	surmounting
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	posts
O	like
O	a
O	roof
O	.
O	The
O	wood
O	was
O	black
O	with
O	age
O	,
O	its
O	surface
O	being
O	covered
O	with
O	elaborate
O	foliage
O	and
O	armorial
O	devices
O	,
O	representing
O	the
O	toil
O	of
O	some
O	old
O	French
O	artisan
O	of
O	the
O	seventeenth
O	century
O	.
O	They
O	probably
O	had
O	been
O	brought
O	across
O	the
O	Atlantic
O	by
O	the
O	original
O	emigrant
O	,
O	and
O	carefully
O	preserved
O	ever
O	since
O	.
O	They
O	stood
O	in
O	diagonally
O	opposite
O	corners
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	upheld
O	the
O	hugest
O	of
O	feather
O	beds
O	,
O	with
O	gay
O	,
O	home
O	-
O	made
O	worsted
O	coverlets
O	and
O	valances
O	that
O	shamed
O	the
O	hues
O	of
O	the
O	rainbow
O	.
O	They
O	certainly
O	tempted
O	to
O	rest
O	in
O	that
O	climate
O	and
O	at
O	that
O	season
O	,
O	but
O	would
O	have
O	seemed
O	suffocating
O	in
O	a
O	warmer
O	region
O	.
O	That
O	evening
O	Ray
O	said

O	The

O	,
O	although

O	,
O	was
O	still

O	a

O	to
O	Cedar

O	,
O	and
O	within
O	a

O	,
O	a
O	fine

O	They

O	game
O	during
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the

O	took
O	the

O	home
O	,
O	and
O	skinned

O	Most

O	hung
O	up
O	in
O	the

O	but
O	Jacques
O	carried
O	a

O	quarter
O	in

O	suspended
O	it
O	beside
O	the
O	closed

O	,
O	later
O	cutting
O	off
O	steaks
O	for
O	supper
O	and

O	They
O	passed
O	a
O	merry
O	evening
O	,
O	each
O	telling
O	stories
O	of
O	his
O	experiences
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	so
O	different
O	in
O	quality
O	that
O	they
O	possessed
O	all
O	the
O	charm
O	of
O	novelty
O	to
O	the

O	Again
O	Ray
O	set
O	the
O	door

O	after
O	they
O	had
O	undressed
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	both
O	were
O	asleep
O	.
O	Several
O	hours
O	passed
O	.
O	Had
O	either
O	young
O	man
O	been
O	awake
O	,
O	he
O	might
O	have
O	heard
O	soft
O	footfalls
O	about
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	A
O	squatty
O	,
O	heavily
O	built
O	animal
O	,
O	with
O	huge
O	feet
O	,
O	bob
O	tail
O	,
O	and
O	pointed
O	ears
O	adorned
O	with
O	tufts
O	of
O	hair
O	,
O	had
O	traced
O	the
O	slaughtered
O	deer
O	to
O	the
O	farmhouse
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	drops
O	of
O	blood
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	was
O	searching
O	eagerly
O	for
O	the
O	meat
O	.
O	He
O	sought
O	the
O	milk
O	-
O	room
O	again
O	and
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	sprang
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	-
O	ledge
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	inside
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	came
O	back
O	and
O	sniffed
O	at
O	the
O	partly
O	open
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	living
O	-
O	room
O	.
O	The
O	human
O	smell
O	was
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	hesitated
O	.
O	But
O	so
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	odor
O	of
O	fresh
O	venison
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	mouth
O	watered
O	.
O	A
O	round
O	head
O	was
O	thrust
O	inside
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	The
O	moon
O	,
O	peering
O	above
O	the
O	hemlocks
O	to
O	the
O	southeastward
O	,
O	cast
O	its
O	rays
O	through
O	a
O	window
O	directly
O	upon
O	the
O	fresh
O	meat
O	.
O	The
O	temptation
O	was
O	greater
O	than
O	the
O	intruder
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	withstand
O	.
O	Inch
O	by
O	inch
O	he
O	crowded
O	past
O	the
O	swaying
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	silently
O	crept
O	toward
O	the
O	venison
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	men
O	were
O	breathing
O	very
O	loudly
O	,
O	but
O	neither
O	stirred
O	;
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	gathered
O	supreme
O	courage
O	,
O	and
O	leaped
O	upon
O	the
O	meat
O	.
O	It
O	fell
O	with
O	a
O	crash
O	against
O	the
O	stove
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	were
O	awakened
O	simultaneously
O	.
O	As
O	Jacques
O	sprang
O	from
O	the
O	bed
O	,
O	the
O	animal

O	,
O	dragging
O	the
O	quarter
O	of
O	venison
O	toward
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	He
O	collided
O	with
O	it
O	,
O	knocking
O	the
O	billet
O	of
O	wood
O	outside
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	latch
O	fell
O	into

O	with
O	a
O	clash
O	.
O	Finding
O	himself
O	a

O	,
O	the

O	there
O	.
O	Seeing
O	that
O	the

O	was
O	about
O	to
O	leap
O	upon
O	the
O	bed
O	,
O	the

O	hastily
O	climbed
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	posts
O	,
O	not
O	a

O	too
O	soon

O	the

O	and
O	drive
O	the

O	out

O	He
