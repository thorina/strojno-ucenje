O	There
O	once

O	a
O	faggot

O	his

O	,

O	had
O	seven

O	,
O	all
O	boys
O	;
O	the
O	eldest
O	was
O	no

O	ten
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	youngest
O	was
O	only
O	seven
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	odd
O	enough
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	have
O	so
O	many
O	children
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	truth
O	is
O	,
O	the
O	wife
O	always
O	brought
O	him
O	two
O	and
O	once
O	three
O	at
O	a
O	time
O	.
O	This
O	made
O	him
O	very
O	poor
O	,
O	for
O	not
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	boys
O	was
O	old
O	enough
O	to
O	get
O	a
O	living
O	,
O	and
O	what
O	was
O	still
O	worse
O	,
O	the
O	youngest
O	was
O	a
O	puny
O	little
O	fellow
O	who
O	hardly
O	ever
O	spoke
O	a
O	word
O	.
O	Now
O	this
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	mark
O	of
O	his
O	good
O	sense
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	made
O	his
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	suppose
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	silly
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	thought

O	at

O	would
O	turn
O	out
O	quite
O	a
O	fool
O	.
O	This
O	boy
O	was
O	the

O	ever
O	seen
O	;
O	for
O	when
O	he
O	was

O	The
O	poor

O	was
O	the

O	It

O	some

O	the
O	quickest
O	accounts
O	of
O	the
O	battle
O	they
O	were
O	just
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	fighting
O	with
O	the
O	enemy
O	.
O	In
O	short
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	could
O	be
O	of
O	more
O	use
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	than
O	all
O	his
O	mail
O	coaches
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	should
O	make
O	his
O	fortune
O	in
O	this
O	manner
O	.
O	He
O	succeeded
O	so
O	well
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	he
O	made
O	money
O	enough
O	to
O	keep
O	himself
O	,
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	mother
O	,
O	and
O	six
O	brothers
O	,
O	without
O	the
O	trouble
O	of
O	working
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	their
O	lives
O	.
O	Having
O	done
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	cottage
O	,
O	where
O	all
O	the
O	family
O	were
O	delighted
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	again
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	great
O	fame
O	of
O	his
O	boots
O	had
O	been
O	talked
O	of
O	at
O	court
O	in
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	the
C	king
O	sent
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	indeed
O	employed
O	him
O	very
O	often
O	in
O	the
O	greatest
O	affairs
O	of
O	the
O	state
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	became
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	richest
O	men
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	let
O	us
O	see
O	what
O	became
O	of
O	the
O	wicked
O	Ogre
O	.
O	He
O	slept
O	so
O	soundly
O	that
O	he
O	never
O	discovered
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	boots
O	;
O	but
O	having
O	an
O	evil
O	conscience
O	and
O	bad
O	dreams
O	,
O	he
O	fell
O	in
O	his
O	sleep
O	from
O	the
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	rock
O	where
O	Hop
O	-
O	o
O	'
O	-
O	my
O	-
O	thumb
O	and
O	his
O	brothers
O	had
O	left
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	bruised
O	himself
O	so
O	much
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	stir
O	:
O	so
O	he
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	stretch
O	himself
O	out
O	at
O	full
O	length
O	,
O	and
O	wait
O	for
O	some
O	one
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	help
O	him
O	.
O	Now
O	a
O	good
O	many
O	faggot
O	-
O	makers
O	passed
O	near
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	Ogre
O	lay
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	heard
O	him
O	groan
O	,
O	they
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	ask
O	him
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	Ogre
O	had
O	eaten
O	such
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	children
O	in
O	his
O	lifetime
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	grown
O	so
O	very
O	big
O	and
O	fat
O	that
O	these
O	men
O	could
O	not
O	even
O	have
O	carried
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	legs
O	;
O	so
O	they
O	were
O	forced
O	to
O	leave
O	him
O	there
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	night
O	came
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	a
O	large
O	serpent
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	wood
O	just
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	stung
O	him
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	died
O	in
O	great
O	pain
O	.
O	By
O	and
O	by
O	,
O	Hop
O	-
O	o
O	'
O	-
O	my
O	-
O	thumb
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	become
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	first
O	favourite
O	,
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	Ogre
O	'
O	s
O	death
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	first
O	thing
O	he
O	did
O	was
O	to
O	tell
O	his
O	majesty
O	all
O	that
O	the
O	good
O	-
O	natured
O	Ogress
O	had
O	done
O	to
O	save
O	the
O	lives
O	of
O	himself
O	and
O	brothers
O	.
O	The
C	king
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	pleased
O	at
O	what
O	he
O	heard
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	asked
O	Hop
O	-
O	o
O	'
O	-
O	my
O	-
O	thumb
O	if
O	there
O	was
O	any
O	favour
O	he
O	could
O	bestow
O	upon
O	her
O	?
O	Hop
O	-
O	o
O	'
O	-
O	my
O	-
O	thumb
O	thanked
O	the
C	king
O	,
O	and
O	desired
O	that
O	the
O	Ogress
O	might
O	have
O	the
O	noble
O	title
O	of
O	Duchess
O	of
O	Draggletail
O	given
O	to
O	her
O	;
O	which
O	was
O	no
O	sooner
O	asked
O	than
O	granted
O	.
O	The
O	Ogress
O	then
O	came
O	to
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	very
O	happily
O	for
O	many
O	years
O	,
O	enjoying
O	the
O	vast
O	fortune
O	she
O	had
O	found
O	in
O	the
O	Ogre
O	'
O	s
O	chests
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	Hop
O	-
O	o
O	'
O	-
O	my
O	-
O	thumb
O	,
O	he
O	every
O	day
O	grew
O	more
O	witty
O	and
O	brave
O	;
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	the
C	king
O	made
O	him
O	the
O	greatest
O	lord
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	him
O	over
O	all
O	his
O	affairs
O	.
