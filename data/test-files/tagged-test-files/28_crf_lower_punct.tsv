O	and
O	wealthy
C	king
O	,
O	having
O	lost
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	was
O	so
O	inconsolable
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	shut
O	himself
O	up
O	for
O	eight
O	entire
O	days
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	cabinet
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	spent
O	his
O	time
O	in
O	knocking
O	his
O	head
O	against
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	until
O	the
O	courtiers
O	were
O	afraid
O	he
O	would
O	kill
O	himself
O	!
O	they
O	accordingly
O	placed
O	stuffed
O	mattresses
O	over
O	every
O	wall
O	,
O	and
O	allowed
O	all
O	his
O	subjects
O	,
O	who
O	desired
O	,
O	to
O	pay
O	him
O	a
O	visit
O	,
O	trusting
O	that
O	something
O	would
O	be
O	said
O	to
O	alleviate
O	his
O	grief
O	.
O	but
O	neither
O	grave
O	nor
O	lively
O	discourse
O	made
O	any
O	impression
O	upon
O	him
O	;
O	he
O	scarcely
O	heard
O	what
O	was
O	spoken
O	.
O	at
O	last
O	there
O	presented
O	herself
O	before
O	him
O	a
O	lady
O	,
O	covered
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
O	in
O	a
O	long
O	crape
O	veil
O	,
O	who
O	wept
O	and
O	sobbed
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	noticed
O	her
O	.
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	come
O	,
O	like
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	to
O	console
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	rather
O	to
O	encourage
O	his
O	grief
O	.
O	she
O	herself
O	had
O	lost
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	husbands
O	,
O	and
O	here
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	so
O	profusely
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	wonder
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	not
O	melted
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	head
O	.
O	the
C	king
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	in
O	company
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	talk
O	to
O	her
O	of
O	his
O	dear
O	wife
O	--
O	she
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	of
O	her
O	dear
O	husband
O	:
O	in
O	fact
O	they
O	talked
O	so
O	much
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	talked
O	their
O	sorrow
O	quite
O	away
O	.
O	then
O	,
O	lifting
O	up
O	her
O	veil
O	,
O	she
O	showed
O	lovely
O	blue
O	eyes
O	and
O	dark
O	eyelashes
O	.
O	the
C	king
O	noticed
O	her
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	--
O	he
O	spoke
O	less
O	and
O	less
O	of
O	the
O	departed
C	queen
O	;
O	by
O	and
O	by
O	he
O	ceased
O	to
O	speak
O	of
O	her
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	the
O	end
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	courted
O	the
O	inconsolable
O	lady
O	in
O	the
O	black
O	veil
O	,
O	and
O	married
O	her
O	.
O	by
O	his
O	first
O	marriage
O	he
O	had
O	one
O	daughter
O	,
O	called
O	florina
O	,
O	or
O	the
C	little
C	flora
O	,
O	because
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	fresh
O	and
O	lovely
O	;
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	his
O	second
O	marriage
O	she
O	was
O	quite
O	fifteen
O	years
O	old
O	.
O	the
O	new
C	queen
O	also
O	had
O	a
O	daughter
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	being
O	brought
O	up
O	by
O	her
O	godmother
O	,
O	the
C	fairy
C	soussio
O	--
O	her
O	name
O	was
O	troutina
O	,
O	because
O	her
O	complexion
O	was
O	all
O	spotted
O	like
O	a
O	trout
O	'
O	s
O	back
O	.
O	indeed
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	altogether
O	ugly
O	and
O	disagreeable
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	contrasted
O	with
O	florina
O	,
O	the
O	difference
O	between
O	the
O	two
O	made
O	the
O	mother
O	so
O	envious
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	and
O	troutina
O	spared
O	no
O	pains
O	to
O	make
O	the
C	princess
O	'
O	s
O	life
O	unhappy
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	speak
O	ill
O	of
O	her
O	to
O	her
O	father
O	.
O	one
O	day
O	the
C	king
O	observed
O	that
O	both
O	girls
O	were
O	now
O	old
O	enough
O	to
O	be
O	married
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	intended
O	to
O	choose
O	for
O	one
O	of

O	the

O	visited

O	succeeded
O	so
O	well
O	,
O	that

O	persuaded
O	to
O	promise
O	she
O	would
O	speak
O	to
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	next

O	a

O	at

O	but
O	the
O	faithless
O	lady-in-waiting
O	betrayed
O	her
O	to
O	the
C	queen
O	,
O	who
O	locked
O	her
O	up
O	in
O	her
O	chamber
O	,
O	and
O	determined
O	to
O	send
O	her
O	own
O	daughter
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	instead
O	.
O	the
O	night
O	was
O	so
O	dark
O	that
C	king
O	charming
O	never
O	found
O	out
O	the
O	difference
O	,
O	but
O	made
O	to
O	troutina
O	all
O	the
O	tender
O	speeches
O	that
O	he
O	meant
O	for

O	,
O	offering
O	her
O	his
O	crown
O	and
O	his
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	ending
O	by
O	placing
O	his
O	own
O	ring
O	on
O	her
O	finger
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	pledge
O	of
O	eternal
O	fidelity
O	.
O	he
O	also
O	made
O	her
O	agree
O	to
O	fly
O	with
O	him
O	next
O	night
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	chariot
O	drawn
O	by
O	winged
O	frogs
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	a
O	great
C	magician
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	friends
O	,
O	had
O	made
O	him
O	a
O	present
O	.
O	he
O	thought
O	she
O	talked
O	very
O	little
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	little
O	not
O	in
O	quite
O	so
O	pleasant
O	a
O	voice
O	as
O	formerly
O	;
O	still
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	too
O	much
O	in
O	love
O	to
O	notice
O	much
O	,
O	and
O	departed
O	very
O	joyful
O	in
O	having
O	obtained
O	her
O	promise
O	.
O	next
O	night
O	troutina
O	,
O	thickly
O	veiled
O	,
O	quitted
O	the
O	palace
O	by
O	a
O	secret
O	door
O	.
C	king
O	charming
O	met
O	her
O	,
O	received
O	her
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	vowed
O	to
O	love
O	her
O	for
O	ever
O	.
O	then
O	he
O	lifted
O	her
O	into
O	the
C	fairy
O	chariot
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	sailed
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	for
O	some
O	hours
O	.
O	but
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	likely
O	to
O	wish
O	to
O	sail
O	about
O	for
O	ever
O	,
O	he
O	at
O	last
O	proposed
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	descend
O	to
O	earth
O	,
O	and
O	be
O	married
O	.
O	troutina
O	agreed
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	heart
O	,
O	but
O	wished
O	that
O	the
O	ceremony
O	should
O	be
O	performed
O	at
O	her
O	godmother
O	'
O	s
O	,

C	fairy

O	.
O	so
O	they
O	entered
O	together
O	into
O	the
O	fairy-palace
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	told
O	her
O	godmother
O	privately
O	how
O	all
O	had
O	happened
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	she
O	had
C	won

O	charming
O	,
O	begging
O	the
C	fairy
O	to
O	pacify

O	still
O	,
O	the

O	so

O	cage
O	:
O	the
O	nail
O	it
O	was
O	hung
O	upon
O	had
O	broken
O	,
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	suffered
O	much
O	in
O	the
O	fall
O	;
O	minetta
O	,
O	the
C	cat
O	,
O	had
O	glowered
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	her
O	green
O	eyes
O	;
O	the
O	attendants
O	had
O	forgotten
O	his
O	hemp-seed
O	and
O	his
O	water-glass
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	half
O	dying
O	of
O	hunger
O	and
O	thirst
O	;
O	and
O	a
O	monkey
O	had
O	plucked
O	at
O	his
O	feathers
O	through
O	the
O	wires
O	as
O	disrespectfully
O	as
O	if
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	a
C	king
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	linnet
O	or
O	a
O	jay
O	.
O	worse
O	than
O	all
O	,
O	his
O	next
O	heir
O	spread
O	reports
O	of
O	his
O	death
O	,
O	and
O	threatened
O	to
O	seize
O	on
O	his
O	throne
O	.
O	under
O	these
O	circumstances
O	the
C	magician
O	thought
O	it
O	best
O	to
O	agree
O	with
O	soussio
O	that
C	king
O	charming
O	should
O	be
O	restored
O	to
O	his

O	his
O	natural
O	shape
O	for
O	six

O	remain

O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	try
O	to
O	like
O	her
O	and
O	marry
O	her
O	.
O	if
O	not
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	become
O	again
O	a
O	blue
O	bird
O	.
O	so
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	once
O	more
C	king
O	charming
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	charming
O	as
O	ever
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	would
O	rather
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	bird
O	and
O	near
O	his
O	beloved
O	,
O	than
O	a
C	king
O	in
O	the
O	society
O	of
O	troutina
O	.
O	the
O	enchanter
O	gave
O	him
O	the
O	best
O	reasons
O	for
O	what
O	had
O	been
O	done
O	,
O	and
O	advised
O	him
O	to
O	occupy
O	himself
O	with
O	the
O	affairs
O	of
O	his
O	kingdom
O	and
O	people
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	thought
O	less
O	of
O	these
O	things
O	than
O	how
O	to
O	escape
O	from
O	the
O	horror
O	of
O	marrying
O	troutina
O	.
