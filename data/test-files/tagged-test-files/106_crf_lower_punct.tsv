O	and
O	who
O	had
O	a
O	vague
O	idea
O	that
O	the
O	north
O	lay
O	just
O	above
O	the
O	chick-ahominy

O	and

O	thereto
O	by

O	.
O	her
O	authority
O	for

O	lay
O	in
O	a
O	charmig
O	old
O	woman
O	across

O	who
O	had
O	one
O	tooth
O	,

O	,
O	and
O	used
O	to
O	tell
O	her
O	ghost
O	stories
O	sometimes
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	.
O	somebody
O	asked

O	once
O	how

O	she
O	was
O	.

O	that

O	stories
O	from

O	,
O	of
O	old-time
O	african
O	princes
O	,
O	who
O	lived
O	in

O	on
O	sparkling
O	rivers
O	in

O	now
O	,
O	this

O	to

O	she
O	went
O	up
O	the
O	street
O	to

O	grand
O	,
O	immortal
O	words
O	of
O	his
O	which
O	had
O	made
O	every

O	plan
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	know
O	.
O	no

O	tell
O	,
O	reasoned
O	madame
O	,
O	what
O	notions
O	the
O	little
O	nigger
O	will
O	get
O	if

O	out

O	might
O	even
O	ask
O	for

O	or
O	take
O	a
O	notion
O	to
O	learn
O	to

O	,
O	or
O	run
O	away
O	,
O	or
O	something
O	.
O	june
O	saw
O	no
O	one
O	;
O	she
O	kept
O	her
O	prudently
O	in
O	the

O	?
O	_no

O	june
O	had
O	heard
O	the

O	this
O	morning
O	,
O	like

O	glad
O	,
O	though
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	the

O	idea
O	why
O	.
O	so
O	,
O	while
O	her
O	mistress
O	was
O	safely
O	asleep
O	upstairs
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	stolen
O	out
O	to
O	watch
O	for
O	the
O	wonderful
O	sight
O	,
O	--
O	the
O	mysterious
O	sight
O	that
O	every
O	one
O	was
O	waiting
O	to

O	up
O	a
O	cloud
O	of

O	up
O	the
