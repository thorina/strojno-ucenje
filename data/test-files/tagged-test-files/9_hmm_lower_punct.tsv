O	in
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	famagosta
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	cyprus
O	,
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	very
O	rich
O	gentleman
O	.
O	his
O	name
O	was
O	theodorus
O	:
O	he
O	married
O	a
O	lady
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	greatest
O	beauty
O	in
O	cyprus
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	as
O	rich
O	as
O	himself
O	;
O	she
O	was
O	called
O	graciana
O	.
O	they
O	both
O	had
O	every
O	pleasure
O	that
O	wealth
O	could
O	buy
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	style
O	.
O	besides
O	all
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	lady
O	graciana
O	brought
O	her
O	husband
O	a
O	fine
O	little
O	son
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	named
O	fortunatus
O	;
O	so
O	one
O	would
O	think
O	nothing
O	could
O	have
O	kept
O	theodorus
O	from
O	being
O	the
O	most
O	happy
O	person
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	but
O	this
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	the
O	case
O	;
O	for
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	enjoyed
O	all
O	these
O	pleasures
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	he
O	grew
O	tired
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	keep
O	company
O	with
O	young
O	noblemen
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	,
O	with
O	whom
O	he
O	sat
O	up
O	all
O	night
O	drinking
O	and
O	playing
O	cards
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	years
O	he
O	spent
O	all
O	his
O	fortune
O	.
O	he
O	was
O	now
O	very
O	sorry
O	for
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	too
O	late
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	work
O	at
O	some
O	trade
O	to
O	support
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	child
O	.
O	for
O	all
O	this
O	the
O	lady
O	graciana
O	never
O	found
O	fault
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	still
O	loved
O	her
O	husband
O	the
O	same
O	as
O	before
O	;
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	dear
O	theodorus
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	i
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	to
O	work
O	at
O	any
O	trade
O	;
O	but
O	if
O	i
O	can
O	not
O	help
O	you
O	in
O	earning
O	money
O	,
O	i
O	will
O	help
O	you
O	to
O	save
O	it
O	.
O	``
O	so
O	theodorus
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	;
O	and
O	though
O	the
O	lady
O	graciana
O	had
O	always
O	been
O	used
O	only
O	to
O	ring
O	her
O	bell
O	for
O	everything
O	that
O	she
O	wanted
O	,
O	she
O	now
O	scoured
O	the
O	kettles
O	and
O	washed
O	the
O	clothes
O	with
O	her
O	own
O	hands
O	.
O	they
O	went
O	on
O	in
O	this
O	manner
O	till
O	fortunatus
O	was
O	sixteen
O	years
O	of
O	age
O	.
O	when
O	that
O	time
O	came
O	,
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	sitting
O	at
O	dinner
O	,
O	theodorus
O	fixed
O	his
O	eyes
O	on
O	his
O	son
O	,
O	and
O	sighed
O	deeply
O	.
O	``
O	what
O	is
O	the
O	matter
O	with
O	you
O	,

O	said
O	fortunatus
O	.
O	``
O	ah

O	child
O	,

O	said
O	theodorus
O	,
O	``

O	took
O	his
O	hat
O	and
O	walked
O	to
O	the
O	sea-side
O	,
O	thinking
O	of

O	could

O	,
O	so
O	as

O	saw
O	that

O	was
O	a
O	smart-looking
O	lad
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	the
O	quick
O	replies
O	which
O	he
O	made
O	to
O	his
O	questions
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	his
O	service
O	;
O	so
O	at
O	once
O	they
O	all
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	.
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	the
O	ship
O	stopped
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	at
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	venice
O	,
O	where
O	fortunatus
O	saw
O	many
O	strange
O	things
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	wish
O	still
O	more
O	to
O	travel
O	,
O	and
O	taught
O	him
O	much
O	that

O	did
O	not

O	before
O	.
O	soon
O	after

O	to
O	flanders
O	;
O	and
O	they
O	had

O	on

O	,
O	among

O	the

O	a

O	;
O	who
O	afterwards
O	ran
O	another

O	so
O	that
O	the
O	winner
O	was
O	to
O	have
O	both
O	the
O	jewels
O	.
O	so
O	they
O	tilted
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	fourth
O	course
O	,
O	fortunatus
O	hoisted

O	a
O	full
O	spear

O	from

O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	won
O	both
O	the
O	jewels
O	,
O	which
O	pleased
O	the
O	earl
O	and
O	countess
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	they
O	praised
O	fortunatus
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	better
O	of

O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	also
O	,
O	fortunatus
O	had
O	many
O	rich
O	presents

O	him
O	by
O	the
O	lords
O	and

O	of
O	the
O	court
O	.
O	but
O	the
O	high
O	favour
O	shown
O	him
O	made
O	his
O	fellow-servants
O	jealous
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	,
O	named
O	robert
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	always
O	pretended
O	a
O	great
O	friendship
O	for
O	fortunatus

O	made
O	him

O	his
O	seeming
O	kindness
O	,
O	the
O	earl
O	,
O	in
O	secret
O	,
O	envied
O	him
O	his
O	great
O	skill
O	in
O	tilting
O	.
O	robert
O	said
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	the
O	earl
O	give
O	private
O	orders
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	servants
O	to
O	find
O	some
O	way
O	of

O	him
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	while
O	they
O	should
O	all
O	be
O	out
O	hunting
O	.
O	fortunatus
O	thanked
O	the
O	wicked
O	robert
O	for
O	what
O	he
O	thought
O	a
O	great
O	kindness
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	at
O	daybreak
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	swiftest
O	horse
O	in
O	the
O	earl
O	'
O	s
O	stables
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	when
O	the
O	earl
O	heard
O	that
O	fortunatus
O	had
O	gone
O	away
O	in
O	a
O	hurry
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	much
O	surprised
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	all
O	his
O	servants
O	what
O	they
O	knew
O	about
O	the
O	matter
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	all
O	denied
O	knowing
O	anything
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	or
O	why
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	them
O	.
O	the
O	earl
O	then
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	fortunatus

O	in

O	found
O	himself
O	out

O	stopped
O	at
O	an
O	inn
O	to
O	refresh
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	reckon
O	how
O	much
O	he
O	had
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	he
O	took
O	out
O	all

O	fine
O	clothes

O	jewels
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	putting
O	them
O	on
O	.
O	he
O	then
O	looked
O	at
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	glass
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	that
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	a
O	fine
O	smart
O	fellow
O	.
O	next
O	he
O	took
O	out
O	his
O	purse
O	,
O	and
O	counted
O	the
O	money
O	that
O	had
O	been

O	the
O	lords

O	he
O	had
O	five
O	hundred
O	crowns
O	;
O	so
O	he
O	bought
O	a
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	send
O	back

O	taken
O	from

O	he
O	then
O	set
O	off
O	for

O	,
O	crossed
O	the
O	channel
O	,
O	landed
O	safely
O	at
O	dover
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	to
O	london
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	soon
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	into
O	genteel
O	company
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	once
O	the
O	honour

O	,
O	soon
O	made
O	away
O	with

O	.
O	when

O	found
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	a

O	left
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to

O	soon

O	went
O	on

O	a
O	ship
O	bound
O	to
O	picardy
O	.
O	he
O	landed
O	in
O	that

O	,
O	but
O	finding
O	no
O	employment
O	he
O	set
O	off
O	for
O	brittany
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	lost
O	his
O	way
O	in
O	crossing
O	a
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	stay
O	in
O	it
O	all
O	night
O	.
O	the
O	next

O	he

O	off
O	,
O	for

O	could
O	find

O	he
O	walked

O	to
O	another
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	evening
O	of
O	the
O	second
O	day
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	spring
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	he
O	drank
O	very
O	heartily
O	;
O	but
O	still
O	he
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	die
O	with
O	hunger
O	.
O	when
O	night
O	came
O	on
O	,
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	growling
O	of
O	wild
O	beasts
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	climbed
O	up
O	a
O	high
O	tree
O	for
O	safety
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	hardly
O	seated
O	himself
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	before
O	a
O	lion
O	walked
O	fiercely
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	spring
O	to
O	drink
O	.
O	this
O	made
O	him
O	very
O	much
O	afraid
O	.
O	when
O	the
O	lion
O	had
O	gone
O	away
O	,
O	a
O	bear
O	came
O	to
O	drink
O	also
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	moon
O	shone
O	very
O	bright
O	,
O	the
O	beast
O	looked
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	fortunatus
O	,
O	and
O	straightway
O	began
O	to
O	climb
O	up
O	the
O	tree
O	to
O	get
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	fortunatus
O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	quiet
O	till
O	the
O	bear
O	was
O	come
O	within
O	arm
O	'
O	s
O	length
O	;
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	ran
O	him
O	through
O	the
O	body
O	.
O	this
O	drove
O	the
O	bear
O	so
O	very
O	savage
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	great
O	spring
O	to
O	get
O	at
O	him
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	bough
O	broke
O	,
O	and
O	down
O	he
O	fell
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	sprawling
O	and
O	howling
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	fortunatus
O	now
O	looked
O	around
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	no
O	more
O	wild
O	beasts
O	near
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	this
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	good
O	time
O	to
O	get
O	rid
O	of
O	the
O	bear
O	at
O	once
O	;
O	so
O	down
O	he
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	killed
O	him
O	at
O	a
O	single
O	blow
O	.
O	being
O	almost
O	starved
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	food
O	,
O	the
O	poor
O	youth
O	stooped
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	suck
O	the
O	blood
O	of
O	the
O	bear
O	;
O	but
O	looking
O	round
O	once
O	more
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	any
O	wild
O	beasts
O	were
O	coming
O	,
O	he
O	on
O	a
O	sudden
O	beheld
O	a
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	standing
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	bandage
O	over
O	her
O	eyes
O	,
O	leaning
O	upon
O	a
O	wheel
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	going
O	to
O	speak
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	soon
O	did
O	,
O	in
O	these
O	words
O	:
O	``

O	sure

O	be
O	dead
O	,
O	then

O	thank

O	very
O	much

O	told

O	better
O	think

O	out

O	last
O	very
O	long
O	;
O	the
O	wedding
O	took
O	place
O	almost
O	immediately
O	;
O	so
O	they
O	lived
O	all
O	together
O	in
O	famagosta
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	very
O	great
O	style
O	.

O	end
O	of
O	the
O	first

O	,
O	they
O	soon
O	married
O	very
O	well
O	.
O	but
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	long
O	to
O	travel
O	again
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	thought
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	now
O	so
O	much
O	older
O	and
O	wiser
O	than
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	at
O	paris
O	,
O	he
O	might
O	go
O	by
O	himself
O	,
O	for
O	lord
O	loch-fitty
O	was
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	too
O	old
O	to
O	bear
O	fatigue
O	.
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	,
O	with
O	great
O	trouble
O	,
O	got
O	the
O	consent
O	of
O	the
O	lady
O	cassandra
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	her
O	a
O	promise
O	to
O	stay
O	away
O	only
O	two
O	years
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	all
O	things
O	ready
O	for
O	his
O	journey
O	;
O	and
O	taking
O	his
O	lady
O	into
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	private
O	rooms
O	,
O	he
O	showed
O	her
O	three
O	chests
O	of
O	gold
O	.
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	to
O	keep
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	for
O	herself
O	,
O	and
O	take
O	charge
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	for
O	their
O	sons
O	,
O	in
O	case
O	any
O	evil
O	should
O	happen
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	he
O	then
O	led
O	her
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	room
O	where
O	the
O	whole
O	family
O	were
O	sitting
O	,
O	embraced
O	them
O	all
O	tenderly
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	sail
O	with
O	a
O	fair
O	wind
O	for
O	alexandria
O	.
O	when
O	fortunatus
O	came
O	to
O	this
O	place
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	told
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	custom
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	handsome
O	present
O	to
O	the
O	sultan
O	;
O	so
O	he
O	sent
O	him
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	plate
O	that
O	cost
O	five
O	thousand
O	pounds
O	.
O	the
O	sultan
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	pleased
O	with
O	this
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	ordered
O	a
O	hundred
O	casks
O	of
O	spices
O	to
O	be
O	given
O	to
O	fortunatus
O	in
O	return
O	.
O	fortunatus
O	sent
O	these
O	straight
O	to
O	the
O	lady
O	cassandra
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	most
O	tender
O	letters
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	same
O	ship
O	that
O	brought
O	him
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	then
O	going
O	back
O	to
O	famagosta
O	.
O	having
O	stated
O	that
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	travel
O	through
O	his
O	country
O	by
O	land
O	,
O	he
O	obtained
O	from
O	the
O	sultan
O	such
O	passports
O	and
O	letters
O	as
O	he
O	might
O	stand
O	in
O	need
O	of
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	princes
O	in
O	those
O	parts
O	.
O	he
O	then
O	bought
O	a
O	camel
O	,
O	hired
O	proper
O	servants
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	off
O	on
O	his
O	travels
O	.
O	he
O	went
O	through
O	turkey
O	,
O	persia
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	thence
O	to
O	carthage
O	;
O	he
O	next
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	country
O	of
O	prester
O	john
O	,
O	who
O	rides
O	upon
O	a
O	white
O	elephant
O	,
O	and
O	has
O	kings
O	to
O	wait
O	on
O	him
O	.
O	fortunatus
O	made
O	him
O	some
O	rich
O	presents
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	to
O	calcutta
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	coming
O	back
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	jerusalem
O	in
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	came
O	again
O	to
O	alexandria
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	fortune
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	same
O	ship
O	that
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	learn
O	from
O	the
O	captain
O	that
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	family
O	were
O	all
O	in
O	perfect
O	health
O	.
O	the
O	first
O	thing
O	he
O	did
O	was
O	to
O	pay
O	a
O	visit
O	to
O	his
O	old
O	friend
O	the
O	sultan
O	,
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	again
O	made
O	a
O	handsome
O	present
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	invited
O	to
O	dine
O	at
O	his
O	palace
O	.
O	after
O	dinner
O	,
O	the
O	sultan
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	vastly
O	amusing
O	,
O	fortunatus
O	,
O	to
O	hear
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	places
O	you
O	have
O	seen
O	;
O	pray
O	favour
O	me
O	with
O	a
O	history
O	of
O	your
O	travels
O	.
O	``
O	fortunatus
O	did
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	desired
O	,
O	and
O	pleased
O	the
O	sultan
O	very
O	much
O	by
O	telling
O	him
O	the
O	many
O	odd
O	adventures
O	he
O	had
O	met
O	with
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	above
O	all
O	,
O	the
O	manner
O	of
O	his
O	first
O	becoming
O	known
O	to
O	the
O	lord
O	loch-fitty
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	desire
O	of
O	that
O	lord
O	to
O	maintain
O	the
O	honours
O	of
O	his
O	family
O	.
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	ended
O	,
O	the
O	sultan
O	said
O	he
O	was
O	greatly
O	pleased
O	with
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	possessed
O	a
O	more
O	curious
O	thing
O	than
O	any
O	fortunatus
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	of
O	.
O	he
O	then
O	led
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	room
O	almost
O	filled
O	with
O	jewels
O	,
O	opened
O	a
O	large
O	closet
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	out
O	a
O	cap
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	said
O	was
O	of
O	greater
O	value
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	.
O	fortunatus
O	thought
O	the
O	sultan
O	was
O	joking
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	he

O	a
O	better

O	was
O	carried
O	on
O	board
O	of
O	her
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	sail
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	being
O	a
O	brisk
O	gale
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	in
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	,
O	before
O	the
O	sultan
O	had
O	even
O	time
O	to
O	repent
O	of
O	his
O	folly
O	for
O	letting
O	fortunatus
O	try
O	the
O	cap
O	on
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	the
O	ship
O	came
O	safe
O	to
O	famagosta
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	happy
O	passage
O	,
O	and
O	fortunatus
O	found
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	children
O	well
O	;
O	but
O	lord
O	loch-fitty
O	and
O	his
O	lady
O	had
O	died
O	of
O	old
O	age
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	buried
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	grave
O	.
O	fortunatus
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	take
O	great
O	pleasure
O	in
O	teaching
O	his
O	two
O	boys
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	useful
O	learning
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	such
O	manly
O	sports
O	as
O	wrestling
O	and
O	tilting
O	.
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	thought
O	about
O	the
O	curious
O	cap
O	which
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	would
O	wish
O	he
O	could
O	just
O	take
O	a
O	peep
O	at
O	what
O	was
O	passing
O	in
O	other
O	countries
O	;
O	which
O	wish
O	was
O	always
O	fulfilled
O	:
O	but
O	he
O	never
O	stayed
O	there
O	more
O	than
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	two
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	lady
O	cassandra
O	did
O	not
O	miss
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	made
O	uneasy
O	by
O	his
O	love
O	of
O	travelling
O	.
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	fortunatus
O	began
O	to
O	grow
O	old
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	lady
O	cassandra
O	fell
O	sick
O	and
O	died
O	.
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	her
O	caused
O	him
O	so
O	much
O	grief
O	,
O	that
O	soon
O	after
O	he
O	fell
O	sick
O	too
O	.
O	as
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	long
O	to
O	live
O	,
O	he
O	called
O	his
O	two
O	sons
O	to
O	his
O	bedside
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	the
O	secrets
O	of
O	the
O	purse
O	and
O	the
O	cap
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	begged
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	,
O	on
O	any
O	account
O	,
O	make
O	known
O	to
O	others
O	.
O	``
O	follow
O	my
O	example
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	:
O	``
O	i
O	have
O	had
O	the
O	purse
O	these
O	forty
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	living
O	person
O	knew
O	from
O	what
O	source
O	i
O	obtained
O	my
O	riches
O	.
O	``
O	he
O	then
O	told
O	them
O	to
O	make
O	use
O	of
O	the
O	purse
O	between
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	live
O	together
O	in
O	friendship
O	;
O	and
O	embracing
O	them
O	,
O	died
O	soon
O	after
O	.
O	fortunatus
O	was
O	buried
O	with
O	great
O	pomp
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	lady
O	cassandra
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	chapel
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	mourned
O	by
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	famagosta
O	.
