O	a

O	daughter
O	.
O	her
O	incomparable
O	beauty
O	,

O	,
O	and

O	all
O	her
O	mother

O	joy
O	.
O	every
O	day
O	she
O	had
O	given

O	a
O	different
O	dress
O	,
O	of
O	gold
O	brocade
O	,
O	velvet
O	,
O	or
O	satin
O	;
O	yet
O	she
O	was
O	neither
O	conceited
O	nor
O	boastful
O	.
O	she
O	used
O	to
O	pass
O	her
O	mornings
O	in
O	study
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	she
O	sat
O	sewing
O	by
O	the
O	queen
O	'
O	s
O	side
O	.
O	she
O	had
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	plenty
O	of
O	play-time
O	,
O	and
O	sweetmeats
O	without
O	end
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	altogether
O	the
O	happiest
O	princess
O	alive
O	.
O	at
O	the

O	court
O	was
O	an
O	elderly
O	young
O	lady
O	named
O	duchess
O	grognon
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	very
O	opposite
O	of
O	graciosa
O	.
O	her
O	hair
O	was
O	fiery
O	red
O	,
O	her
O	face
O	fat
O	and
O	spotty
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	had
O	but
O	one
O	eye
O	.
O	her
O	mouth
O	was
O	so
O	big
O	that
O	you
O	might
O	have
O	thought
O	she
O	could
O	eat
O	you
O	up
O	,
O	only
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	teeth
O	to
O	do
O	it
O	with
O	;
O	she
O	was
O	also
O	humpbacked
O	and
O	lame
O	.
O	of
O	course
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	her
O	ugliness
O	,
O	and
O	nobody
O	would
O	have
O	disliked
O	her
O	for
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	of
O	such
O	an
O	unpleasant
O	temper
O	that
O	she
O	hated
O	everything
O	sweet
O	and
O	beautiful
O	,
O	and
O	especially
O	graciosa
O	.
O	she
O	had
O	also
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	opinion
O	of
O	herself
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	any
O	one
O	praised
O	the
O	princess
O	,
O	would
O	say
O	angrily
O	,
O	``

O	in

O	her

O	almost
O	broken-hearted

O	so
O	was
O	her
O	husband
O	for
O	a
O	year
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	began
O	to

O	day

O	out
O	to

O	again
O	,
O	in
O	her
O	distress
O	,
O	she
O	called
O	upon
O	percinet
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	he
O	appeared
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	single
O	touch
O	of
O	his
O	wand
O	,
O	sent
O	all
O	the
O	little
O	people
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	box
O	.
O	then
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	chariot
O	,
O	drawn
O	by
O	stags
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	where
O	she
O	did
O	all
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	commanded
O	,
O	and
O	returned
O	in
O	safety
O	,
O	to
O	her
O	stepmother
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	more
O	furious
O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	if
O	a
O	fairy
O	could
O	be
O	strangled
O	,
O	grognon
O	certainly
O	would
O	have
O	done
O	it
O	in
O	her
O	rage
O	.
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	she
O	resolved
O	to
O	ask
O	help
O	no
O	more
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	work
O	her
O	own
O	wicked
O	will
O	upon
O	graciosa
O	.
O	she
O	caused
O	to
O	be
O	dug
O	a
O	large
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	garden
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	the
O	princess
O	there
O	,
O	showed
O	her
O	the
O	stone
O	which
O	covered
O	it
O	.
O	``
O	underneath
O	this
O	stone
O	lies
O	a
O	great
O	treasure
O	;
O	lift
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	you
O	will
O	see
O	.
O	``
O	graciosa
O	obeyed
O	;
O	and
O	while
O	she
O	was
O	standing
O	at
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	pit
O	,
O	grognon
O	pushed
O	her
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	the
O	stone
O	fall
O	down
O	again
O	upon
O	her
O	,
O	burying
O	her
O	alive
O	.
O	after
O	this
O	,
O	there
O	seemed
O	no
O	more
O	hope
O	for
O	the
O	poor
O	princess
O	.
O	``
O	o
O	percinet
O	,
O	``
O	cried
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	you
O	are
O	avenged
O	.
O	why
O	did
O	i
O	not
O	return
O	your
O	love
O	,
O	and
O	marry
O	you
O	!
O	still
O	,
O	death
O	will
O	be
O	less
O	bitter
O	,
O	if
O	only
O	you
O	regret
O	me
O	a
O	little
O	.
O	``
O	while
O	she
O	spoke
O	,
O	she
O	saw
O	through
O	the
O	blank
O	darkness
O	a
O	glimmer
O	of
O	light
O	;
O	it
O	came
O	through
O	a
O	little
O	door
O	.
O	she
O	remembered
O	what
O	percinet
O	had
O	said
O	:
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	never
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	fairy
O	palace
O	,
O	until
O	after
O	she
O	was
O	buried
O	.
O	perhaps
O	this
O	final
O	cruelty
O	of
O	grognon
O	would
O	be
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	her
O	sorrows
O	.
O	so
O	she
O	took
O	courage
O	,
O	crept
O	through
O	the
O	little
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	lo
O	!
O	she
O	came
O	out
O	into
O	a
O	beautiful
O	garden
O	,
O	with
O	long
O	alleys
O	,
O	fruit-trees
O	,
O	and
O	flower-beds
O	.
O	well
O	she
O	knew
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	well
O	she
O	knew
O	the
O	glitter
O	of
O	the
O	rock-crystal
O	walls
O	.
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	palace-gate
O	,
O	stood
O	percinet
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	princesses
O	,
O	his
O	sisters
O	.
O	``
O	welcome
O	,
O	graciosa
O	!
O	``
O	cried
O	they
O	all
O	;
O	and
O	graciosa
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	her
O	sufferings
O	,
O	wept
O	for
O	joy
O	.
O	the
O	marriage
O	was
O	celebrated
O	with
O	great
O	splendour
O	;
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	fairies
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	thousand
O	leagues
O	round
O	,
O	attended
O	it
O	.
O	some
O	came
O	in
O	chariots
O	drawn
O	by
O	dragons
O	,
O	or
O	swans
O	,
O	or
O	peacocks
O	;
O	some
O	were
O	mounted
O	upon
O	floating
O	clouds
O	,
O	or
O	globes
O	of
O	fire
O	.
O	among
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	appeared
O	the
O	very
O	fairy
O	who
O	had
O	assisted
O	grognon
O	to
O	torment
O	graciosa
O	.
O	when
O	she
O	discovered
O	that
O	grognon
O	'
O	s
O	poor
O	prisoner
O	was
O	now
O	prince
O	percinet
O	'
O	s
O	bride
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	overwhelmed
O	with
O	confusion
O	,
O	and
O	entreated
O	her
O	to
O	forget
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	passed
O	,
O	because
O	she
O	really
O	was
O	ignorant
O	who
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	cruelly
O	afflicting
O	.
O	``
O	but
O	i
O	will
O	make
O	amends
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	evil
O	that
O	i
O	have
O	done
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	fairy
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	refusing
O	to
O	stay
O	for
O	the
O	wedding-dinner
O	,
O	she
O	remounted
O	her
O	chariot
O	,
O	drawn
O	by
O	two
O	terrible
O	serpents
O	,
O	and
O	flew
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	graciosa
O	'
O	s
O	father
O	.
O	there
O	,
O	before
O	either
O	king
O	,
O	or
O	courtiers
O	,
O	or
O	ladies-in-waiting
O	could
O	stop
O	her
O	--
O	even
O	had
O	they
O	wished
O	to
O	do
O	it
O	,
O	which
O	remains
O	doubtful
O	--
O	she
O	came
O	behind
O	the
O	wicked
O	grognon
O	,
O	and
O	twisted
O	her
O	neck
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	a
O	cook
O	does
O	a
O	barn-door
O	fowl
O	.
O	so
O	grognon
O	died
O	and
O	was
O	buried
O	,
O	and
O	nobody
O	was
O	particularly
O	sorry
O	for
O	the
O	same
O	.
