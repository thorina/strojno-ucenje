C	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	stood
O	far
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	west
O	country
O	a
O	town
O	called
O	Stumpinghame
O	.
O	It
O	contained
O	seven
O	windmills
O	,
O	a
O	royal
O	palace
O	,
O	a
O	market
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	prison
O	,
O	with
O	every
O	other
O	convenience
O	befitting
O	the
O	capital
O	of
O	a
O	kingdom
O	.
O	A
O	capital
O	city
O	was
O	Stumpinghame
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	inhabitants
O	thought
O	it
O	the
O	only
O	one
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	It
O	stood
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	plain
O	,
O	which
O	for
O	three
O	leagues
O	round
O	its
O	walls
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	corn
O	,
O	flax
O	,
O	and
O	orchards
O	.
O	Beyond
O	that
O	lay
O	a
O	great
O	circle
O	of
O	pasture
O	land
O	,
O	seven
O	leagues
O	in
O	breadth
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	bounded
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	by
O	a
O	forest
O	so
O	thick
O	and
O	old
O	,
O	that
O	no
O	man
O	in
O	Stumpinghame
O	knew
O	its
O	extent
O	.
O	Whether
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	nature
O	of
O	the
O	place
O	or
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	I
O	cannot
O	tell
O	,
O	but
O	great
O	feet
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	fashion
O	there
O	time
O	immemorial
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	higher
O	the
O	family
O	the
O	larger
O	were
O	they
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	the
O	aim
O	of
O	everybody
O	above
O	the
O	degree
O	of
O	shepherds
O	,
O	and
O	such
O	-
O	like
O	rustics
O	,
O	to
O	swell
O	out
O	and
O	enlarge
O	their
O	feet
O	by
O	way
O	of
O	gentility
O	;
O	and
O	so
O	successful
O	were
O	they
O	in
O	these
O	undertakings
O	that
O	,
O	on
O	a
O	pinch
O	,
O	respectable
O	people
O	'
O	s
O	slippers
O	would
O	have
O	served
O	for
O	panniers
O	.
O	Stumpinghame
O	had
O	a
C	king
O	of
O	its
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	name
O	was
O	Stiffstep
O	;
O	his
O	family
O	was
O	very
O	ancient
O	and
O	large
O	-
O	footed
O	.
O	His
O	subjects
O	called
O	him
O	Lord
O	of
O	the
O	World
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	speech
O	to
O	them
O	every
O	year
O	concerning
O	the
O	grandeur
O	of
O	his
O	mighty
O	empire
O	.
O	His
C	queen
O	,
O	Hammerheel
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	greatest
O	beauty
O	in
O	Stumpinghame
O	.
O	Her
O	majesty
O	'
O	s
O	shoe
O	was
O	not
O	much
O	less
O	than
O	a
O	fishing
O	-
O	boat
O	;
O	their
O	six
O	children
O	promised
O	to
O	be
O	quite
O	as
O	handsome
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	went
O	well
O	till
O	the
O	birth
O	of
O	their
O	seventh
O	son
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	nobody
O	about
O	the
O	palace
O	could
O	understand
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter
O	--
O	the
O	ladies
O	-
O	in
O	-
O	waiting
O	looked
O	so
O	astonished
O	,
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	so
O	vexed
O	;
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	it
O	was
O	whispered
O	through
O	the
O	city
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	'
O	s
O	seventh
O	child
O	had
O	been
O	born
O	with
O	such
O	miserably
O	small
O	feet
O	that
O	they
O	resembled
O	nothing
O	ever
O	seen
O	or
O	heard
O	of
O	in
O	Stumpinghame
O	,
O	except
O	the
O	feet
O	of
O	the
O	fairies
O	.
O	The
O	chronicles
O	furnished
O	no
O	example
O	of
O	such
O	an
O	affliction
O	ever
O	before
O	happening
O	in
O	the
O	royal
O	family
O	.
O	The
O	common
O	people
O	thought
O	it
O	portended
O	some
O	great
O	calamity
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	;
O	the
O	learned
O	men
O	began
O	to
O	write
O	books
O	about
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	relations
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	assembled
O	at
O	the
O	palace
O	to
O	mourn
O	with
O	them
O	over
O	their
O	singular
O	misfortune
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	court
O	and
O	most
O	of
O	the
O	citizens
O	helped
O	in
O	this
O	mourning
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	it
O	had
O	lasted
O	seven
O	days
O	they
O	all
O	found
O	out
O	it
O	was
O	of
O	no
O	use
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	relations
O	went
O	to
O	their
O	homes
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	took
O	to
O	their
O	work
O	.
O	If
O	the
O	learned
O	men
O	'
O	s
O	books
O	were
O	written
O	,
O	nobody
O	ever
O	read
O	them
O	;
O	and
O	to
O	cheer
O	up
O	the
C	queen
O	'
O	s
O	spirits
O	,
O	the
O	young
C	prince
O	was
O	sent
O	privately
O	out
O	to
O	the
O	pasture
O	lands
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	nursed
O	among
O	the
O	shepherds
O	.
O	The
O	chief
O	man
O	there
O	was
O	called
O	Fleecefold
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	'
O	s
O	name
O	was
C	Rough
C	Ruddy
O	.
O	They
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	snug
O	cottage
O	with
O	their
C	son
C	Blackthorn
O	and
O	their
C	daughter
C	Brownberry
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	thought
O	great
O	people
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	kept
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	sheep
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	Fleecefold
O	'
O	s
O	family
O	were
O	known
O	to
O	be
O	ancient
O	;
O	and
C	Rough
C	Ruddy
O	boasted
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	the
O	largest
O	feet
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	pastures
O	.
O	The
O	shepherds
O	held
O	them
O	in
O	high
O	respect
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	grew
O	still
O	higher
O	when
O	the
O	news
O	spread
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	seventh
O	son
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	to
O	their
O	cottage
O	.
O	People
O	came
O	from
O	all
O	quarters
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	young
C	prince
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	were
O	the
O	lamentations
O	over
O	his
O	misfortune
O	in
O	having
O	such
O	small
O	feet
O	.
O	The
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	fourteen
O	names
O	,
O	beginning
O	with
C	Augustus
O	--
O	such
O	being
O	the
O	fashion
O	in
O	that
O	royal
O	family
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	honest
O	country
O	people
O	could
O	not
O	remember
O	so
O	many
O	;
O	besides
O	,
O	his
O	feet
O	were
O	the
O	most
O	remarkable
O	thing
O	about
O	the
O	child
O	,
O	so
O	with
O	one
O	accord
O	they
O	called
O	him
C	Fairyfoot
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	it
O	was
O	feared
O	this
O	might
O	be
O	high
O	treason
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	no
O	notice
O	was
O	taken
O	by
O	the
C	king
O	or
O	his
O	ministers
O	,
O	the
O	shepherds
O	concluded
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	harm
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boy
O	never
O	had
O	another
O	name
O	throughout
O	the
O	pastures
O	.
O	At
O	court
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	thought
O	polite
O	to
O	speak
O	of
O	him
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	They
O	did
O	not
O	keep
O	his
O	birthday
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	never
O	sent
O	for
O	at
O	Christmas
O	,
O	because
O	the
C	queen
O	and
O	her
O	ladies
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	the
O	sight
O	.
O	Once
O	a
O	year
O	the
O	undermost
O	scullion
O	was
O	sent
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	he
O	did
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	bundle
O	of
O	his
O	next
O	brother
O	'
O	s
O	cast
O	-
O	off
O	clothes
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	the
C	king
O	grew
O	old
O	and
O	cross
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	said
O	he
O	had
O	thoughts
O	of
O	disowning
O	him
O	.
O	So
C	Fairyfoot
O	grew
O	in
O	Fleecefold
O	'
O	s
O	cottage
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	the
O	country
O	air
O	made
O	him
O	fair
O	and
O	rosy
O	--
O	for
O	all
O	agreed
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	handsome
O	boy
O	but
O	for
O	his
O	small
O	feet
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	nevertheless
O	he
O	learned
O	to
O	walk
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	time
O	to
O	run
O	and
O	to
O	jump
O	,
O	thereby
O	amazing
O	everybody
O	,
O	for
O	such
O	doings
O	were
O	not
O	known
O	among
O	the
O	children
O	of
O	Stumpinghame
O	.
O	The
O	news
O	of
O	court
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	travelled
O	to
O	the
O	shepherds
O	,
O	and
C	Fairyfoot
O	was
O	despised
O	among
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	people
O	thought
O	him
O	unlucky
O	;
O	the
O	children
O	refused
O	to
O	play
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	Fleecefold
O	was
O	ashamed
O	to
O	have
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	cottage
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	durst
O	not
O	disobey
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	orders
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
C	Blackthorn
O	wore
O	most
O	of
O	the
O	clothes
O	brought
O	by
O	the
O	scullion
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
C	Rough
C	Ruddy
O	found
O	out
O	that
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	such
O	horrid
O	jumping
O	would
O	make
O	her
O	children
O	vulgar
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	old
O	enough
O	,
O	she
O	sent
C	Fairyfoot
O	every
O	day
O	to
O	watch
O	some
O	sickly

O	wild

O	pasture
O	,
O	hard
O	by
O	the

O	Poor
C	Fairyfoot
O	was
O	often
O	lonely
O	and
O	sorrowful
O	;
O	many
O	a
O	time
O	he
O	wished

O	and
O	all

O	was
O	running
O	and
O	jumping
O	by
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	wild
O	pasture
O	,
O	and
O	thinking
O	that
