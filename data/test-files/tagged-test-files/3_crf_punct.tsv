O	There
O	was
O	once
O	an
O	honest
O	gentle
O	man
O	who
O	took
O	for
O	his
O	second
O	wife
O	a
O	lady
O	,
O	the
O	proudest
O	and
O	most
O	disagreeable
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	country
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	two
O	daughters
O	exactly
O	like
O	herself
O	in
O	all
O	things
O	.
O	He
O	also
O	had
O	one
O	little
O	girl
O	,
O	who
O	resembled
O	her
O	dead
O	mother
O	,
O	the
O	best
O	woman
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	Scarcely
O	had
O	the
O	second
O	marriage
O	taken
O	place
O	,
O	than
O	the
O	stepmother
O	became
O	jealous
O	of
O	the
O	good
O	qualities
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	contrast
O	to
O	her
O	own
O	two
O	daughters
O	.
O	She
O	gave
O	her
O	all
O	the
O	menial
O	occupations
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	;
O	compelled
O	her
O	to
O	wash
O	the
O	floors
O	and
O	staircases
O	,
O	to
O	dust
O	the
O	bed-rooms
O	,
O	and
O	clean
O	the
O	grates
O	;
O	and
O	while
O	her
C	sisters
O	occupied
O	carpeted
O	chambers
O	hung
O	with
O	mirrors
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	could
O	see
O	themselves
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
O	,
O	this
O	poor
O	little
O	damsel
O	was
O	sent
O	to
O	sleep
O	in
O	an
O	attic
O	,
O	on
O	an
O	old
O	straw
O	mattress
O	,
O	with
O	only
O	one
O	chair
O	and
O	not
O	a
O	looking-glass
O	in
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	She
O	suffered
O	all
O	in
O	silence
O	,
O	not
O	daring
O	to
O	complain
O	to
O	her
O	father
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	entirely
O	ruled
O	by
O	his
O	new
O	wife
O	.
O	When
O	her
O	daily
O	work
O	was
O	done
O	she
O	used
O	to
O	sit
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	chimney-corner
O	among
O	the
O	ashes
O	;
O	from
O	which
O	the
O	two
C	sisters
O	gave
O	her
O	the
O	nick-name
O	of
O	_Cinderella_
O	.
O	But
C	Cinderella
O	,
O	however
O	shabbily
O	clad
O	,
O	was
O	handsomer
O	than
O	they
O	were
O	with
O	all
O	their
O	fine
O	clothes
O	.
O	It
O	happened
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	gave
O	a
O	series
O	of
O	balls
O	,
O	to

O	invited
O	all
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	and
O	among
O	the
O	rest
O	the
O	two
O	elder
C	sisters
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	very
O	proud
O	and
O	happy
O	,
O	and
O	occupied
O	their
O	whole
O	time
O	in
O	deciding
O	what
O	they
O	should
O	wear
O	;
O	a
O	source
O	of
O	new
O	trouble
O	to
C	Cinderella
O	,
O	whose
O	duty
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	get
O	up
O	their
O	fine
O	linen
O	and
O	laces
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	never
O	could
O	please
O	them
O	however
O	much
O	she
O	tried
O	.
O	They
O	talked
O	of
O	nothing
O	but
O	their
O	clothes
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	elder
O	,

O	Here
O	the

O	grew
O	angry
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dispute
O	began
O	to

C	Cinderella
O	,

O	called
O	upon
O	to

O	.
O	She
O	gave
O	them
O	the
O	best
O	advice
O	she
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	gently
O	and
O	submissively
O	offered
O	to

O	them

O	,
O	and
O	especially
O	to
O	arrange
O	their
O	hair
O	,
O	an
O	accomplishment
O	in
O	which
O	she
O	excelled
O	many
O	a
O	noted
O	coiffeur
O	.
O	The
O	important
O	evening
O	came
O	,

O	and
O	she
O	danced
O	so
O	gracefully
O	that
O	he
O	admired
O	her
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	at
O	supper
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	fortunately
O	early
O	,
O	his
O	admiration
O	quite
O	took
O	away
O	his
O	appetite
O	.
O	For
C	Cinderella
O	herself
O	,
O	with
O	an
O	involuntary
O	shyness
O	she
O	sought
O	out
O	her
C	sisters
O	;
O	placed
O	herself
O	beside
O	them
O	and
O	offered
O	them
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	civil
O	attentions
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	coming
O	as
O	they
O	supposed
O	from
O	a
O	stranger
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	magnificent
O	a
O	lady
O	,
O	almost
O	overwhelmed
O	them
O	with
O	delight
O	.
O	While
O	she
O	was
O	talking
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	she
O	heard
O	the
O	clock
O	strike
O	a
O	quarter
O	to
O	twelve
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	a
O	courteous
O	adieu
O	to
O	the
O	royal
O	family
O	,
O	she
O	re-entered
O	her
O	carriage
O	,
O	escorted
O	tenderly
O	by
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	and
O	arrived
O	in
O	safety
O	at
O	her
O	own
O	door
O	.
O	There
O	she
O	found
O	her
O	godmother
O	,
O	who
O	smiled
O	approval
O	;
O	and
O	of
O	whom
O	she
O	begged
O	permission
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	a
O	second
O	ball
O	,
O	the
O	following
O	night
O	,
O	to
O	which
O	the
C	queen
O	had
O	earnestly
O	invited
O	her
O	.
O	While
O	she
O	was
O	talking
O	,
O	the
O	two
C	sisters
O	were
O	heard
O	knocking
O	at
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	the
C	fairy
C	godmother
O	vanished
O	,
O	leaving
C	Cinderella
O	sitting
O	in
O	the
O	chimney-corner
O	,
O	rubbing
O	her
O	eyes

O	of

O	.
O	How
O	the

O	remained
O	inconsolable

O	he
O	carried

O	out
O	continually
O	,

C	Cinderella
O	listened
O	in
O	silence
O	,
O	turning
O	her
O	face
O	to
O	the
O	kitchen
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	which
O	made
O	her
O	look
O	so
O	rosy
O	,
O	but
O	nobody
O	ever
O	noticed
O	or
O	admired
O	her
O	at
O	home
O	,
O	so
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	signify
O	,
O	and
O	next
O	morning
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	her
O	weary
O	work
O	again
O	just
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	A
O	few
O	days
O	after
O	,
O	the
O	whole
O	city
O	was
O	attracted
O	by
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	a
O	herald
O	going
O	round
O	with
O	a
O	little
O	glass
O	slipper
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	publishing
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	flourish
O	of
O	trumpets
O	,
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	ordered
O	this
O	to
O	be
O	fitted
O	on
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	every
O	lady
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	marry
O	the
O	lady
O	whom
O	it
O	fitted
O	best
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	whom
O	it
O	and
O	the
O	fellow
O	slipper
O	belonged
O	.
O	Princesses
O	,
O	duchesses
O	,
O	countesses
O	,
O	and
O	simple
O	gentlewomen
O	all
O	tried
O	it
O	on
O	,
O	but
O	being
O	a
C	fairy
O	slipper
O	,
O	it
O	fitted
O	nobody
O	and
O	beside
O	,
O	nobody
O	could
O	produce
O	its
O	fellow
O	slipper
O	,
O	which
O	lay
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	safely
O	in
O	the
O	pocket
O	of
C	Cinderella
O	'
O	s
O	old
O	linsey
O	gown
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	herald
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	the
O	two
C	sisters
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	they
O	well
O	knew
O	neither
O	of
O	themselves
O	was
O	the
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	,
O	they
O	made
O	every
O	attempt
O	to
O	get
O	their
O	clumsy
O	feet
O	into
O	the
O	glass
O	slipper
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	``
O	Let
O	me
O	try
O	it
O	on
O	,
O	``
O	said
C	Cinderella
O	from
O	the
O	chimney
O	corner
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	,
O	you
O	?
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	others
O	,
O	bursting
O	into
O	shouts
O	of
O	laughter
O	;
O	but
C	Cinderella
O	only
O	smiled
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	out
O	her
O	hand
O	.
O	Her
C	sisters
O	could
O	not
O	prevent
O	her
O	,
O	since
O	the
O	command
O	was
O	that
O	every
O	young
O	maiden
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	should
O	try
O	on
O	the
O	slipper
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	no
O	chance
O	might
O	be
O	left
O	untried
O	,
O	for
O	the
C	prince
O	was
O	nearly
O	breaking
O	his
O	heart
O	;
O	and
O	his
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	were
O	afraid
O	that
O	though
O	a
C	prince
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	actually
O	die
O	for
O	love
O	of
O	the
O	beautiful
O	unknown
O	lady
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	herald
O	bade
C	Cinderella
O	sit
O	down
O	on
O	a
O	three-legged
O	stool
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen
O	,
O	and
O	himself
O	put
O	the
O	slipper
O	on
O	her
O	pretty
O	little
O	foot
O	,
O	which
O	it
O	fitted
O	exactly
O	;
O	she
O	then
O	drew
O	from
O	her
O	pocket
O	the
O	fellow
O	slipper
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	also
O	put
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	stood
O	up
O	--
O	for
O	with
O	the
O	touch
O	of
O	the
O	magic
O	shoes
O	all
O	her
O	dress
O	was
O	changed
O	likewise
O	--
O	no
O	longer
O	the
O	poor
O	despised
O	cinder-wench
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	whom
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	loved
O	.
O	Her
C	sisters
O	recognized
O	her
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	Filled
O	with
O	astonishment
O	,
O	mingled
O	with
O	no
O	little
O	alarm
O	,
O	they
O	threw
O	themselves
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	,
O	begging
O	her
O	pardon
O	for
O	all
O	their
O	former
O	unkindness
O	.
O	She
O	raised
O	and
O	embraced
O	them
O	:
O	told
O	them
O	she
O	forgave
O	them
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	only
O	hoped
O	they
O	would
O	love
O	her
O	always
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	departed
O	with
O	the
O	herald
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	whole
O	story
O	to
O	his
O	majesty
O	and
O	the
O	royal
O	family
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	not
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	surprised
O	,
O	for
O	everybody
O	believed
O	in
O	fairies
O	,
O	and
O	everybody
O	longed
O	to
O	have
O	a
C	fairy
C	godmother
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	young
C	prince
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	her
O	more
O	lovely
O	and
O	loveable
O	than
O	ever
O	,
O	and
O	insisted
O	upon
O	marrying
O	her
O	immediately
O	.
C	Cinderella
O	never
O	went
O	home
O	again
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	sent
O	for
O	her
O	two
C	sisters
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
