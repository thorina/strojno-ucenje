O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	a
O	king
O	and
O	a
O	queen
O	gave
O	a
O	magnificent
O	party
O	in
O	honor
O	of
O	the
O	christening
O	of
O	their
O	new-born
O	son
O	,
O	Prince
O	Rolandor
O	.
O	To
O	this
O	party
O	the
O	royal
O	parents
O	took
O	good
O	care
O	to
O	invite
O	every
O	single
O	fairy
O	in
O	Fairyland
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	knew
O	very
O	well
O	the
O	unhappy
O	consequences
O	of
O	forgetting
O	to
O	invite
O	fairies
O	to
O	christenings
O	.
O	When
O	all
O	the
O	invitations
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	out
O	,
O	the
O	Queen
O	went
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	kitchen
O	to
O	superintend
O	the
O	cooking
O	of
O	the
O	master-dainty
O	of
O	the
O	feast
O	,
O	a
O	huge
O	strawberry-tart
O	.
O	The
O	morning
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	grand
O	ceremony
O	was
O	to
O	take
O	place
O	arrived
O	.
O	At
O	half-past
O	ten
O	the
O	Court
O	Astrologer
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	master
O	of
O	ceremonies
O	,
O	gave
O	the
O	order
O	to
O	form
O	in
O	line
O	;
O	and
O	at
O	ten
O	minutes
O	to
O	eleven
O	the
O	splendid
O	procession
O	started
O	for
O	the
O	church
O	.
O	The
O	road
O	was
O	lined
O	with
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	vassals
O	shouting
O	,
O	``
O	Hurrah
O	,
O	hurrah
O	!
O	``
O	Countless
O	little
O	elves
O	with
O	gauzy
O	wings
O	watched
O	from
O	the
O	branches
O	of
O	the
O	trees
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	great
O	cathedral
O	bells
O	went
O	clang
O	,
O	bang
O	,
O	clang
O	,
O	as
O	merrily
O	as
O	could
O	be
O	.
O	Just
O	behind
O	the
O	royal
O	body-guard
O	came
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	gold-and-diamond
O	coach
O	shining
O	in
O	the
O	sunlight
O	of
O	June
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	the
O	Queen
O	in
O	it
O	on
O	one

O	the
O	Court

O	prospective
O	godparents
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	Prince
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	himself
O	,
O	swathed
O	in
O	a
O	wonderful
O	silk
O	mantle
O	edged
O	with
O	pearls
O	and
O	turquoises
O	,
O	slept
O	in
O	the
O	Astrologer
O	'
O	s
O	arms
O	.
O	The
O	procession
O	entered
O	the
O	church
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	venerable
O	Lord
O	Archbishop
O	,
O	surrounded
O	by
O	a
O	magnificent
O	choir
O	,
O	was
O	awaiting
O	its
O	coming
O	.
O	A
O	hush
O	went
O	over
O	the
O	great
O	assembly
O	as
O	the
O	parents
O	and
O	the
O	godparents
O	advanced
O	to
O	the
O	flower-decked
O	font
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	silence
O	lasted
O	until
O	His
O	Eminence
O	had
O	sprinkled
O	the
O	Prince
O	and
O	given
O	him
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Rolandor
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	bells
O	rang
O	again
O	,
O	the
O	organ
O	roared
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	windows
O	shook
O	in
O	their
O	casements
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	choristers
O	sang
O	like
O	birds
O	on
O	a
O	summer
O	afternoon
O	.
O	The
O	christening
O	over
O	,
O	the
O	procession
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	past
O	the
O	waiting
O	rows
O	of
O	bystanders
O	,
O	not
O	one
O	of
O	whom
O	had
O	changed
O	his

O	or
O	gone
O	away
O	,
O	so
O	superb
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	spectacle
O	.
O	The

O	banquet
O	was
O	laid
O	in

O	,
O	and
O	,
O	thanks
O	to
O	the
O	Court
O	Astrologer
O	,
O	things
O	went
O	off
O	beautifully
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	large
O	banquet
O	ever
O	known
O	in
O	the
O	history
O	of
O	the

O	where

O	all
O	at
O	one
O	time

O	an
O	ice

O	,

O	the
O	banquet
O	was
O	a
O	huge
O	success
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	alas
O	,
O	disaster
O	came
O	with
O	the
O	strawberry-tart
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	Queen
O	was
O	chatting
O	with
O	the
O	Lord
O	Chancellor

O	up
O	the

O	again
O	.
O	Ten
O	minutes
O	passed
O	,

O	she

O	clear
O	and
O	rasping
O	over

O	ought

O	But
O	of
O	real
O	life
O	he
O	knew
O	almost
O	nothing

O	His
O	most
O	faithful
O	friend
O	during
O	these

O	was
O	a
O	French
O	poodle
O	,
O	who
O	spoke
O	both
O	French
O	and
O	English
O	exceedingly
O	well
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	marked
O	canine
O	accent

O	s

O	s
O	,
O	but
O	his

O	were
O	well

O	extensive
O	.
O	Never
O	was
O	seen
O	a
O	more
O	friendly
O	,
O	wise
O	,
O	and

O	.
O	When

O	,
O	the
O	little
O	Prince
O	became
O	really
O	ill
O	from
O	grief
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	alter
O	his
O	decision
O	.
O	During
O	his
O	imprisonment
O	in
O	the
O	tower
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	all
O	precautions
O	,
O	the
O	Prince
O	sneezed
O	three
O	times
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	first
O	sneeze
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	dogs
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	except
O	Poldo
O	changed
O	into
O	cats
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	cats
O	into
O	dogs
O	.
O	Though
O	this
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	serious
O	trouble
O	,
O	the
O	change
O	was
O	certainly
O	inconvenient
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	dog-cats
O	came
O	out
O	meowing
O	at
O	people
O	as
O	the
O	dogs
O	used
O	to
O	bark
O	at

O	,
O	and
O	they
O	chased

O	down
O	the
O	street
O	;
O	the
O	cat-dogs
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	hand
O	,
O	stayed
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen
O	under
O	the
O	stove
O	,
O	and
O	watched
O	for
O	mice
O	in
O	the
O	pantry
O	.
O	Great
O	St
O	.
O	Bernards
O	might
O	be

O	licking
O	their
O	paws
O	and
O	rubbing
O	them
O	over
O	their
O	foreheads
O	,
O	and
O	fat
O	,
O	old
O	cat-lap-dogs
O	used
O	to
O	try
O	to
O	purr
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	second
O	sneeze
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	elderly
O	gentlemen
O	over
O	seventy
O	changed
O	into
O	elm
O	trees
O	,
O	a
O	proceeding
O	that
O	caused
O	a
O	terrible
O	lot
O	of
O	trouble
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	third
O	sneeze
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	in
O	the
O	pictures
O	at
O	the
O	Art
O	Museum
O	became
O	alive
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	a
O	week
O	the
O	soldiers
O	of
O	the
O	royal
O	guard
O	spent
O	most
O	of
O	their
O	time
O	rescuing
O	poor
O	,
O	bewildered
O	fauns
O	,
O	satyrs
O	,
O	nymphs
O	,
O	Roman
O	senators
O	,
O	and
O	long
O	dead
O	celebrities
O	and
O	historical
O	personages
O	from
O	the
O	worst
O	destitution
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	finally
O	had
O	to
O	build
O	a
O	special
O	castle
O	for
O	them
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	Prince
O	'
O	s
O	twenty-first
O	birthday
O	drew
O	near
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	feel
O	very
O	sad
O	at
O	the
O	idea
O	of
O	having
O	to
O	stay
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	tower
O	all
O	his
O	life
O	.
O	Though
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	brave
O	and
O	very
O	manly
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	he
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	his
O	couch
O	and
O	wept
O	in
O	sorrow
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	standing
O	with
O	his
O	forepaws
O	on
O	the
O	coverlet
O	,
O	``
O	Why
O	do
O	you
O	weep
O	,
O	dear
O	master
O	?

O	said
O	the
O	little
O	dog
O	.
O	``
O	At
O	my

O	replied
O	the
O	poor

O	all

O	.
O	``
O	The
O	poodle
O	was
O	silent
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	he
O	said
O	,

O	ask
O	him
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	Prince
O	gave
O	his
O	consent
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	the
O	royal
O	tailor
O	made
O	the
O	poodle
O	a
O	magnificent
O	sealskin
O	coat
O	and
O	four
O	splendid
O	fur-lined
O	boots
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	King
O	wished
O	him
O	good
O	speed
O	,
O	the
O	Queen
O	cried
O	over
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Prince
O	,
O	who
O	could
O	see
O	from
O	his
O	high
O	tower
O	every
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	,
O	watched
O	him
O	till
O	he
O	disappeared
O	over
O	the
O	hills
O	and
O	far
O	away
O	.
O	Straight
O	north
O	the
O	poodle
O	ran
O	.
O	Soon
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	the
O	fertile
O	plains
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	entered
O	great
O	,
O	black
O	pine
O	forests
O	where
O	never
O	a
O	road
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	The
O	cold
O	wind
O	howled
O	through
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	night
O	the
O	brilliant
O	stars
O	sparkled
O	over
O	the
O	dark
O	and
O	waving
O	branches
O	.
O	Hungry
O	wolves
O	and
O	savage
O	bears
O	often
O	pursued
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	somehow
O	he
O	always
O	managed
O	to
O	escape
O	them
O	all
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	frozen
O	ocean
O	lit
O	by
O	the
O	shuddering
O	light
O	of
O	the

O	in

O	to

O	.
O	Past
O	white-tusked

O	penguins
O	he
O	flew
O	,
O	till
O	on
O	the
O	eleventh
O	day

O	saw
O	the

O	,

O	of
O	the

O	'
O	s
O	palace
O	against

O	Polar
O	lights
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	evening
O	of
O	the
O	twelfth
O	day
O	he
O	entered
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	The
O	Giant
O	of
O	the
O	North
O	Pole
O	was
O	a

O	strange
O	,

O	The

O	then

O	Alicia
O	of

O	into
O	something
O	else
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	too
O	refused
O	the

O	.
O	So
O	did
O	the

O	severely
O	wounded
O	in

O	heavy

O	Presently
O	the

O	realized

O	lost
O	.
O	All
O	afternoon
O	,
O	however

O	she
O	trudged
O	bravely
O	on
O	through
O	the

O	the
O	cold
O	,
O	her
O	heart
O	sinking
O	as
O	mile

O	mile
O	revealed
O	no

O	or
O	a
O	shelter
O	.
O	But
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	red
O	shield
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	could
O	scarcely
O	be
O	seen
O	through
O	the
O	tangle
O	of
O	the
O	wild
O	wood-branches
O	,
O	she
O	perceived
O	a
O	light
O	coming
O	from
O	a
O	little
O	grove
O	of
O	cedars
O	by
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	a
O	frozen
O	lake
O	.
O	The
O	Queen
O	made
O	her
O	way
O	toward

O	light
O	,

O	discovered
O	a
O	little
O	thatched
O	hut
O	in
O	the
O	silent
O	wood
O	;
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	The
O	dwarf
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	efforts
O	were
O	vain
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	poor
O	woman
O	was
O	so
O	weak
O	and
O	exhausted
O	that
O	she
O	died
O	without

O	the
O	dwarf
O	anything
O	about
O	herself
O	or
O	the
O	child
O	she
O	carried
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	little
O	dwarf
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	,
O	kind
O	old
O	fellow
O	,
O	brought
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	up
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	his
O	own
O	child
O	.
O	His
O	brother
O	,
O	the
O	dwarf
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	,
O	made
O	her
O	the
O	prettiest
O	red-leather
O	shoes
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	cousins
O	,
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	of
O	the
O	pines
O	,
O	made
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	dresses
O	from
O	cloth
O	woven
O	on
O	fairy
O	looms
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	night
O	her
O	mother
O	brought
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	hut
O	,
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	was
O	wearing
O	a
O	golden
O	heart-shaped
O	locket
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	crown
O	and
O	the
O	letter
O	M
O	upon
O	it
O	in
O	diamonds
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	dwarf
O	called
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	Marianna
O	.
O	Seventeen
O	years
O	passed
O	,
O	and
O	Marianna
O	grew
O	to
O	be
O	quite
O	the
O	loveliest
O	lass
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	Her
O	hair
O	was

O	black
O	as
O	the
O	raven

O	wing
O	,
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	as
O	blue
O	as
O	the
O	midsummer
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	skin
O	was
O	fair
O	as
O	the
O	petal
O	of
O	a
O	rose
O	.
O	One
O	spring
O	morning
O	a
O	little
O	yellow
O	bird
O	flew
O	into
O	the
O	cedar

O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	the
O	dwarf
O	a
O	letter
O	which
O	it
O	held
O	in
O	its
O	beak
O	.
O	The
O	dwarf
O	read
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	said

O	So
O	the

O	over

O	,
O	over

O	to
O	the
O	Golden

O	Then
O	Marianna
O	took
O	the
O	crystal
O	flask
O	of
O	the
O	water

O	,

O	out
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	into
O	the
O	wide
O	,
O	wide
O	world
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	spring
O	,
O	the
O	ice
O	and
O	snow
O	had
O	all

O	the

O	,
O	and
O	there
O	were

O	In
O	the
O	swaying
O	,
O	rustling
O	heart
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	elm
O	tree
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	thrush
O	was
O	singing
O	.
O	Through
O	cities
O	and
O	towns
O	went
O	lovely
O	Marianna
O	,
O	bringing
O	good
O	cheer
O	to
O	the

O	poor
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	wonderful
O	water
O	of

O	.
O	But
O	never
O	did
O	she
O	find
O	anybody
O	who

O	tell
O	her
O	about
O	the
O	gold
O	heart
O	with
O	the
O	diamond
O	crown
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	,
O	as
O	Marianna
O	was
O	one
O	day
O	walking
O	through
O	a
O	village
O	in
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	Adamant
O	Mountains
O	,
O	a
O	ragged
O	old
O	woman
O	besought

O	with
O	tears
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	a
O	hamlet
O	which
O	stood
O	at
O	the

O	of
O	a
O	high
O	and
O	dangerous
O	path

O	Touched
O	by
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	'
O	s
O	supplication
O	,
O	Marianna
O	followed
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	hamlet
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	in
O	a
O	wretched
O	hut
O	,
O	lying
O	on
O	a
O	wretched
O	bed
O	,
O	a
O	beautiful
O	young
O	peasant
O	girl
O	dying
O	of
O	a
O	fever
O	.
O	So
O	Marianna
O	touched
O	the
O	girl
O	with
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	healing
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	an

O	she

O	well
O	and
O	strong
O	.
O	``
O	Dear

O	And
O	as
O	the

O	poured
O	out
O	her
O	thanks

O	Marianna
O	heard
O	a
O	faint
O	``
O	chirp
O	,
O	chirp
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	looking
O	down
O	,
O	beheld
O	a
O	little
O	yellow
O	bird
O	crouching
O	on
O	the
O	hearthstone
O	.
O	Every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	hid
O	his
O	head
O	under
O	his
O	wings
O	and
O	cried
O	unhappily
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	which
O	had
O	brought
O	the
O	message
O	from
O	the
O	Emperor
O	of
O	the
O	Elves
O	.
O	``
O	Poor
O	little

O	said
O	Marianna
O	,
O	bending
O	down

O	up

O	``
O	But
O	the
O	bird
O	uttered
O	only
O	a
O	forlorn
O	little
O	cry
O	,
O	and
O	hid
O	his

O	again
O	under
O	his
O	wings
O	.
O	``
O	I

O	And
O	she
O	put
O	the

O	of
O	the

O	watch

O	fluttered
O	trailing
O	a

O	in
O	the

O	.
O	Again
O	Marianna
O	stooped
O	,
O	and
O	picking
O	up
O	the
O	bird
O	,
O	touched
O	the
O	wounded
O	wing
O	with
O	the

O	.
O	Scarcely
O	had

O	done
O	so
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	burst
O	into
O	a
O	joyous

O	golden
O	song
O	,
O	and
O	flying
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	,
O	beat
O	madly
O	against
O	the
O	panes
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	peasant
O	girl
O	threw
O	open
O	the
O	casement
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	yellow

O	.
O	``
O	He

O	``
O	Nay

O	said
O	Marianna
O	,
O	gently
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	flew
O	back
O	and
O	perched
O	in
O	the
O	sheltering
O	bower
O	of
O	Marianna
O	'

O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	accompanied
O	by
O	the

O	and
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	,
O	who
O	flew
O	singing
O	before
O	her
O	,
O	Marianna
O	went
O	down
O	the
O	dangerous
O	path
O	to
O	the
O	high

O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	.
O	When

O	reached
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	path
O	,
O	the
O	peasant
O	girl
O	cried
O	:
O	--
O	``
O	Farewell
O	,
O	dear
O	Marianna
O	;

O	it
O	some
O	day

O	to
O	repay
O	thee
O	!
O	``
O	Into
O	the
O	world
O	again
O	went
O	Marianna
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	her
O	went
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	.
O	Presently
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	fairest
O	land
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	ever
O	seen
O	,
O	a
O	land
O	of
O	rolling
O	fields
O	,
O	little
O	hills
O	,
O	and
O	rivers
O	bordered
O	with
O	pale
O	willow
O	trees
O	.
O	This
O	pleasant
O	land
O	,
O	unknown
O	to
O	Marianna
O	,
O	was
O	part
O	of
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	kingdom
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	really
O	its
O	queen
O	because
O	her
O	father
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	last
O	rightful
O	king
O	.
O	Now
O	while
O	Marianna
O	had
O	been
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	the
O	wicked
O	nobleman
O	who
O	had
O	stolen
O	the
O	kingdom
O	from
O	Marianna
O	'
O	s
O	father
O	had
O	died
O	,
O	leaving
O	his
O	brother
O	Garabin
O	in
O	charge
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	interests
O	of
O	his
O	little
O	son
O	,
O	Prince
O	Desire
O	.
O	This
O	Garabin
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	taking
O	advantage
O	of
O	the
O	youth
O	and
O	helplessness
O	of
O	his
O	nephew
O	,
O	had
O	himself
O	assumed
O	the
O	state
O	and
O	airs
O	of
O	king
O	.
O	For
O	some
O	time
O	he
O	had
O	enjoyed
O	undisturbed
O	the
O	possession
O	of
O	his
O	stolen
O	throne
O	;
O	but
O	as
O	Desire
O	grew
O	taller
O	and
O	stronger
O	every
O	year
O	,
O	Garabin
O	began
O	to
O	fear
O	the
O	day
O	when
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	compelled
O	to
O	resign
O	in
O	favor
O	of
O	his
O	nephew
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	Prince
O	reached
O	his
O	twentieth
O	year
O	,
O	Garabin
O	would
O	certainly
O	have
O	killed
O	him
O	openly
O	had
O	he
O	dared
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	fearing
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	use
O	secret
O	methods
O	,
O	and
O	bribed
O	a
O	cruel
O	magician
O	to
O	afflict
O	poor
O	Desire
O	with
O	a
O	deadly
O	and
O	mysterious
O	malady
O	.
O	Of
O	this
O	malady
O	,
O	Desire
O	was
O	slowly
O	dying
O	,
O	for
O	no
O	medicine
O	could
O	cure
O	him
O	or
O	even
O	give
O	him
O	any
O	relief
O	from
O	his
O	constant
O	pain
O	.
O	Every
O	morning
O	the
O	cruel
O	Garabin
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	finding
O	his
O	nephew
O	dead
O	,
O	would
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	sick
O	room
O	;
O	and
O	you
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	that
O	his
O	wicked
O	heart
O	rejoiced
O	when
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	Prince
O	weaker
O	and
O	more
O	feverish
O	.
O	Garabin
O	had
O	just
O	returned
O	from
O	a
O	visit
O	to
O	the
O	Prince
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	rapidly
O	failing
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	Captain
O	of
O	the
O	Castle
O	Guard
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	news
O	that
O	the
O	wonderful
O	Marianna
O	had
O	arrived
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	gave
O	orders
O	that
O	she
O	be
O	brought
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	Marianna
O	,
O	walking
O	between
O	two
O	halberdiers
O	and
O	followed
O	across
O	the
O	courtyard
O	by
O	crowds
O	of
O	curious
O	people
O	,
O	was
O	led
O	before
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	yellow
O	bird
O	sat
O	on
O	Marianna
O	'
O	s
O	shoulder
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	did
O	maiden
O	appear
O	lovelier
O	or
O	more
O	gentle
O	.
O	Scarcely
O	had
O	Garabin
O	set
O	eyes
O	on
O	Marianna
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	caught
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	golden
O	locket
O	which
O	she
O	wore
O	about
O	her
O	neck
O	.
O	Had
O	he
O	not
O	been
O	very
O	old
O	and
O	crafty
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	started
O	from
O	his
O	golden
O	throne
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	golden
O	heart
O	set
O	with
O	diamonds
O	had
O	been
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	crown
O	jewels
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	therefore
O	Marianna
O	must
O	be
O	the
O	missing
O	Princess
O	,
O	and
O	rightful
O	queen
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	.
O	What
O	was
O	he
O	to
O	do
O	?
O	If
O	he
O	refused
O	to
O	let
O	Marianna
O	help
O	the
O	Prince
O	,
O	the
O	people
O	might
O	begin
O	to
O	suspect
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	start
O	a
O	revolution
O	which
O	would
O	thrust
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	throne
O	;
O	if
O	he
O	allowed
O	Marianna
O	to
O	cure
O	the
O	Prince
O	,
O	the
O	Prince
O	would
O	certainly
O	demand
O	the
O	kingdom
O	on
O	his
O	twenty-first
O	birthday
O	.
O	What
O	was
O	he
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	Marianna
O	,
O	whose
O	right
O	to
O	the
O	throne
O	was
O	superior
O	even
O	to
O	his
O	nephew
O	'
O	s
O	?
O	Perplexed
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	fear
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	sought
O	the
O	cruel
O	magician
O	who
O	had
O	cast
O	the
O	spell
O	on
O	Desire
O	.
O	The
O	magician
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	gloomy
O	tower
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	an
O	enchanted
O	black
O	dog
O	that
O	he
O	fed
O	with
O	flaming
O	coals
O	.
O	He
O	listened
O	to
O	Garabin
O	'
O	s
O	story
O	,
O	stirring
O	a
O	great
O	cauldron
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Do
O	not
O	fear
O	.
O	I

O	throne
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	``
O	Garabin
O	rubbed
O	his

O	glee
O	.
O	``
O	To-night

O	``
O	So
O	pleased
O	was
O	Garabin
O	with
O	this
O	horrid
O	plot
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	have
O	danced
O	for
O	joy
O	.
O	That
O	very
O	night
O	,
O	the
O	magician
O	filled
O	Marianna
O	'
O	s
O	flask
O	with
O	the
O	poisonous
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	departed
O	,
O	thinking
O	that
O	nobody
O	had
O	noticed
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	yellow
O	bird
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	had
O	seen
O	everything
O	,
O	and
O	followed
O	the
O	magician
O	to
O	note
O	where
O	he
O	hid
O	the
O	real
O	water
O	of
O	healing
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	Marianna
O	was
O	once
O	more
O	led
O	before
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	``
O	Welcome

O	said

O	with
O	the
O	most
O	dreadful
O	hypocrisy
O	.
O	``
O	I

O	``
O	Marianna
O	replied
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	do
O	her
O	best
O	to
O	help
O	the
O	Prince
O	;
O	so
O	the
O	Court
O	Chamberlain
O	gave
O	her
O	his
O	arm

O	and
O	escorted

O	to
O	the
O	Prince
O	'
O	s
O	sick
O	room
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	and
O	many
O	courtiers
O	followed
O	after
O	him
O	.
O	Desire
O	lay
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	old-fashioned
O	bed
O	,
O	his
O	face
O	flushed
O	with
O	fever
O	.
O	So
O	weak
O	was
O	the
O	poor
O	Prince
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	scarcely
O	lift
O	his
O	head
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	his
O	visitors
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	pity
O	swept
O	over
O	Marianna
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	the
O	instant
O	she
O	saw
O	him
O	;
O	as
O	for
O	Desire
O	,
O	he
O	fell
O	madly
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	Marianna
O	at
O	first
O	sight
O	.
O	Now
O	just
O	as
O	Marianna
O	bent
O	over
O	the
O	Prince
O	to
O	touch
O	his
O	forehead
O	with
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	healing
O	,
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	screamed
O	and
O	cried
O	as
O	madly
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	caught
O	in
O	a
O	net
O	.
O	Marianna
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	crystal
O	flask
O	.
O	Nothing
O	seemed
O	changed
O	;
O	the
O	water
O	within
O	seemed
O	as
O	pure
O	and
O	diamond-like
O	as
O	ever
O	.
O	She
O	touched
O	the
O	Prince
O	with
O	the
O	liquid
O	.
O	Alas
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	,
O	so
O	terrible
O	was
O	the
O	magician
O	'
O	s
O	poison
O	that
O	the
O	Prince
O	turned
O	white
O	as
O	the
O	driven
O	snow
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	back
O	on
O	the
O	pillows
O	insensible
O	.
O	The
O	lookers-on
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	expected
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	spring
O	up
O	entirely
O	cured
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	murmur
O	,
O	and
O	Marianna
O	herself
O	,
O	terrified
O	at
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	,
O	let
O	fall
O	the
O	flask
O	,
O	which
O	broke
O	into
O	a
O	thousand
O	sparkling
O	pieces
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	Garabin
O	cried
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	his
O	voice
O	,
O	``
O	Seize
O	the
O	witch
O	;
O	she
O	has
O	killed
O	the
O	Prince
O	!
O	``
O	Presently
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	confusion
O	,
O	rough
O	hands
O	seized
O	Marianna
O	,
O	and
O	somebody
O	caught
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	remained
O	insensible
O	on
O	the
O	bed
O	.
O	At
O	high
O	noon
O	,
O	a
O	trial
O	was
O	held
O	,
O	and
O	since
O	the
O	doctors
O	declared
O	that
O	the
O	Prince
O	was
O	dying
O	,
O	Marianna
O	was
O	condemned
O	to
O	be
O	thrown
O	from
O	the
O	precipice
O	.
O	When
O	somebody
O	asked
O	about
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	,
O	Garabin
O	laughed
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	orders
O	that
O	the
O	cook
O	should
O	wring
O	its
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	toss
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	cat
O	.
O	So
O	Marianna
O	was
O	hurried
O	to
O	a
O	dark
O	prison-room
O	and
O	loaded
O	with
O	chains
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	was
O	taken
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	kitchen
O	,
O	and
O	given
O	to
O	the
O	cook
O	.
O	``
O	Here
O	,
O	you
O	wring
O	its
O	neck
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	cook
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	helpers
O	,
O	``
O	while
O	I
O	go
O	call
O	the

O	.
O	``
O	By
O	great
O	good
O	fortune
O	,
O	the
O	cook
O	'
O	s
O	helper
O	was
O	no
O	other
O	than
O	the
O	peasant
O	girl
O	whom
O	Marianna
O	had
O	saved
O	.
O	This
O	girl
O	recognized
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	,
O	and
O	instead
O	of
O	wringing
O	its
O	neck
O	,
O	let
O	it
O	fly
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	.
O	The
O	yellow
O	bird
O	flew
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	of
O	the
O	magician
O	'
O	s
O	room
O	.
O	The
O	magician
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	chamber
O	,
O	stirring
O	the
O	giant
O	cauldron
O	.
O	The
O	bird
O	flew
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	of
O	Prince
O	Desire
O	'
O	s
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	still
O	insensible
O	.
O	An
O	hour
O	later
O	the
O	castle-bell
O	began
O	to
O	toll
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	dismal
O	procession
O	was
O	seen
O	walking
O	from
O	the
O	castle
O	toward
O	the
O	frightful
O	cliff
O	from
O	which
O	condemned
O	witches
O	and
O	sorcerers
O	were
O	thrown
O	.
O	First
O	came
O	a
O	troop
O	of
O	soldiers
O	,
O	then
O	Marianna
O	,
O	weighted
O	down
O	with
O	chains
O	,
O	and
O	last
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	group
O	in
O	which
O	were
O	Garabin
O	,
O	the
O	magician
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	Garabin
O	'
O	s
O	favorites
O	.
O	The
O	bell
O	kept
O	on
O	sadly
O	tolling
O	and
O	tolling
O	.
O	It
O	roused
O	the
O	Prince
O	from
O	his
O	swoon
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	his
O	last
O	measure
O	of
O	strength
O	,
O	poor
O	Desire
O	dragged
O	himself
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	.
O	The
O	procession
O	was
O	then
O	passing
O	directly
O	underneath
O	the
O	window
O	,
O	and
O	Desire
O	'
O	s
O	eyes
O	met
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	Marianna
O	.
O	``
O	Stop
O	!
O	Stop

O	,
O	wildly
O	;

O	to
O	the

O	.
O	The
O	procession
O	went
O	on
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	had
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	magician
O	'
O	s
O	chamber
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	empty
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	joyous
O	cry
O	,
O	the
O	bird
O	fluttered
O	through
O	the
O	window-bars
O	,
O	and
O	discovered
O	the
O	phial
O	into
O	which
O	the
O	magician
O	had
O	poured
O	the

O	Clutching

O	flew
O	once
O	more
O	to

O	Desire
O	still

O	over

O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	poured
O	the
O	contents
O	of
O	the
O	phial
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	sprang
O	up
O	,
O	strong
O	as
O	a
O	lion
O	,
O	seized
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	rushed
O	down
O	to
O	save
O	Marianna
O	.
O	He
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	cliff
O	just
O	as
O	the

O	,
O	seeing

O	bit
O	forward
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	but
O	nobody
O	minded
O	that
O	very
O	much
O	in
O	those
O	fairy
O	times
O	.
O	So
O	Desire
O	and
O	Marianna
O	were
O	married
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	happily
O	ever
O	after
O	.
O	The
O	yellow
O	bird
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	wedding
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	ceremony
O	was
O	over
O	rose
O	singing
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	flew
O	joyously
O	home
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	Elves
O	.
O	THE
O	LOST
O	HALF-HOUR
O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	old
O	widow
O	woman
O	who
O	had
O	three
O	sons
O	:
O	the
O	first
O	two
O	were
O	clever
O	enough
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	third
O	,
O	Bobo
O	by
O	name
O	,
O	was
O	little
O	better
O	than
O	a
O	silly
O	simpleton
O	.
O	All
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	scoldings
O	and
O	beatings
O	--
O	and
O	she
O	smacked
O	the
O	poor
O	lad
O	soundly
O	a
O	dozen
O	times
O	a
O	day
O	--
O	did
O	him
O	no
O	good
O	whatever
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	one
O	morning
O	Princess
O	Zenza
O	,
O	the
O	ruler
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	happened
O	to
O	pass
O	by
O	the
O	cottage
O	and
O	heard
O	Bobo
O	being
O	given
O	a
O	terrible
O	tongue-lashing
O	.
O	Curious
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	noise
O	,
O	the
O	Princess
O	drew
O	rein
O	,
O	and
O	summoned
O	Bobo
O	'
O	s
O	mother
O	to
O	come
O	near
O	.
O	On
O	hearing
O	her
O	story
O	,
O	it
O	occurred
O	to
O	the
O	Princess
O	that
O	so
O	silly
O	a
O	lad
O	might
O	amuse
O	her
O	;
O	so
O	she
O	gave
O	the
O	mother
O	a
O	golden
O	florin
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	poor
O	silly
O	Bobo
O	with
O	her
O	to
O	be
O	her
O	page
O	.

O	castle
O	long
O	to
O	discover
O	how
O	great
O	a
O	simpleton
O	had

O	.
O	Courtiers
O	,
O	footmen

O	,

O	forever
O	sending

O	off
O	on
O	ridiculous

O	Now
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	sent
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	white
O	craw
O	'

O	feather
O	or
O	a
O	spray
O	of
O	yellow

O	now
O	he
O	was
O	ordered
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	a
O	square
O	wheel
O	or
O	a
O	glass
O	of
O	dry
O	water
O	.
O	Everybody
O	laughed
O	at
O	him
O	and
O	made
O	fun
O	of
O	him
O	--
O	that
O	is
O	,
O	everybody
O	except
O	little
O	Tilda
O	,
O	the
O	kitchen-maid
O	.
O	When
O	poor
O	Bobo
O	used
O	to
O	return
O	from
O	some
O	wild-goose
O	chase
O	,
O	tired
O	out
O	,
O	mud-stained
O	,
O	and
O	often
O	enough
O	wet
O	to
O	the
O	skin
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	laughing
O	,
O	little
O	Tilda
O	would
O	find
O	him
O	a
O	glass
O	of
O	warm
O	milk
O	,
O	hang
O	his
O	coat
O	by
O	the
O	fire
O	to
O	dry
O	,
O	and
O	tell
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	such
O	a
O	simpleton
O	again
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	Bobo
O	learned
O	to
O	ask
O	Tilda
O	'
O	s
O	advice
O	before
O	going
O	away
O	on
O	a
O	wild-goose

O	from

O	a

O	.
O	Tilda
O	,
O	the
O	kitchen-maid
O	,
O	was
O	as
O	sweet
O	and
O	pretty
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	kind
O	and
O	good
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	said
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	crane
O	who
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	asking
O	for
O	help
O	.
O	One
O	pleasant
O	mid-summer
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	Bobo
O	had
O	been
O	nearly
O	a
O	year
O	at
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	Princess
O	Zenza

O	half
O	an
O	hour

O	did
O	not
O	come
O	down
O	to
O	breakfast
O	at
O	the
O	usual
O	time
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	did
O	get
O	up
O	,
O	she
O	found
O	her
O	court
O	waiting
O	for
O	her
O	in
O	the

O	.
O	As
O	she
O	came
O	down
O	the
O	steps
O	of
O	the
O	garden
O	terrace
O	,
O	the
O	Princess
O	looked
O	up
O	at
O	the
O	castle
O	clock
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	late
O	she
O	was
O	,

O	lady
O	in
O	waiting
O	,
O	--
O	``
O	Dear
O	me
O	--

O	At
O	these
O	words
O	,
O	Bobo
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	in
O	attendance
O	,
O	pricked
O	up
O	his
O	ears
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	--
O	``

O	this
O	idea
O	of
O	finding
O	a

O	laughed

O	.
O	``
O	Shall

O	said

O	to
O	the
O	courtiers
O	.
O	``

O	said
O	still
O	another
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	,
O	in
O	less
O	time
O	than
O	it
O	takes
O	to
O	tell
O	about
O	it

O	journey
O	.
O	Before

O	left
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	Bobo
O	went
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	kitchen

O	to
O	Tilda
O	.
O	``
O	What

O	of
O	it
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Bobo
O	,
O	proudly
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	told
O	how
O	the
O	Princess
O	herself
O	had
O	commanded
O	him
O	to
O	seek
O	the
O	half-hour
O	through
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	promised
O	to
O	bring
O	Tilda
O	a
O	splendid
O	present
O	when
O	he
O	returned
O	.
O	The
O	good
O	kitchen-maid
O	said
O	little
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	feared
O	lest
O	some
O	misadventure
O	overtake
O	the
O	poor
O	simpleton
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	chief
O	cook
O	was
O	not
O	looking
O	,
O	she
O	tucked
O	a
O	fresh
O	currant-bun
O	into
O	Bobo
O	'
O	s
O	pocket
O	,
O	and
O	wished
O	him
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	good
O	fortune
O	.
O	So
O	Bobo
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	which
O	stumbled
O	and
O	was

O	in
O	one

O	.
O	``

O	my
O	little
O	daughter
O	?
O	``
O	(
O	Here
O	the
O	poor
O	old
O	King
O	took
O	out
O	a
O	great

O	``

O	on

O	fifteen
O	years
O	ago
O	.
O	Find
O	her
O	,
O	worthy
O	Bobo
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	immense
O	reward
O	will
O	be
O	yours
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	Bobo
O	left
O	the
O	proud
O	city
O	of
O	Zizz
O	,
O	and
O	once
O	again
O	rode
O	over
O	the
O	hills
O	and
O	far
O	away
O	.
O	But
O	never
O	a
O	sign
O	of
O	the
O	lost
O	half-hour
O	did
O	he
O	find
O	,
O	although
O	he
O	asked
O	thousands
O	of
O	people
O	.
O	His
O	faithful
O	white
O	horse
O	died
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	continued
O	his
O	way
O	on
O	foot
O	.
O	Three
O	long
O	years
O	passed
O	,
O	and
O	Bobo
O	grew
O	into
O	a
O	handsome
O	lad
O	,
O	but
O	remained
O	a
O	simpleton
O	still
O	.
O	Finally
O	,
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	wandered
O	all
O	about
O	Fairyland
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Finding
O	a
O	ship
O	moored
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	harbor
O	,
O	Bobo
O	asked
O	the
O	sailors
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	seen
O	a
O	lost
O	half-hour
O	.
O	``
O	No
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	sailors
O	,
O	``
O	but
O	we
O	are
O	going
O	to
O	the
O	Isles
O	of
O	Iron
O	;
O	suppose
O	you
O	go
O	with
O	us
O	.
O	The
O	lost
O	half-hour
O	may
O	be
O	there
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	Bobo
O	went
O	aboard
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	sailed
O	out
O	upon
O	the
O	dark
O	sea
O	.
O	For
O	two
O	days
O	the
O	weather
O	was
O	warm
O	and
O	clear
O	,
O	but
O	on
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	dreadful
O	storm
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	third
O	night
O	the
O	vessel
O	was
O	driven
O	far
O	off
O	her
O	course
O	into
O	the
O	unknown
O	ocean
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	wrecked
O	upon
O	a
O	mysterious
O	island
O	of
O	rocks
O	that
O	shone
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	like
O	wet
O	matches
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	wave
O	swept
O	the
O	decks
O	,
O	and
O	Bobo
O	was
O	borne
O	away
O	from
O	his
O	companions
O	and
O	carried
O	toward
O	the
O	shining
O	land
O	.
O	Though
O	pounded
O	and
O	battered
O	by
O	the
O	foaming
O	waves
O	,
O	the
O	simpleton
O	at
O	length
O	managed
O	to
O	reach
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	refuge
O	in
O	a
O	crevice
O	of
O	the
O	cliff
O	during
O	the
O	stormy
O	night
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	dawn
O	broke
O	,
O	all
O	sign
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	had
O	disappeared
O	.
O	Looking
O	about
O	,
O	Bobo
O	found
O	himself
O	on
O	a
O	lovely
O	island
O	whose
O	heart
O	was
O	a
O	high
O	mountain
O	mass
O	hidden
O	in
O	the
O	fog
O	still
O	sweeping
O	in
O	from
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	house
O	,
O	a
O	road
O	,
O	or
O	a
O	path
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	Bobo
O	noticed
O	a
O	strange
O	little
O	door
O	in
O	the
O	bark
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	lonely
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	opening
O	this
O	door
O	,
O	he
O	discovered
O	a
O	little
O	cupboard
O	in
O	which
O	were
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	wooden
O	shoes
O	.
O	Above
O	the
O	shoes
O	was
O	a
O	card
O	,
O	saying
O	simply
O	,
O	--
O	PUT
O	US
O	ON
O	.
O	So
O	Bobo
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	a
O	stone
O	by
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	on
O	the
O	wooden
O	shoes
O	,
O	which
O	fitted
O	him
O	very
O	nicely
O	.
O	Now
O	these
O	shoes
O	were
O	magic
O	shoes
O	,
O	and
O	Bobo
O	had
O	hardly
O	stepped
O	into
O	them
O	before
O	they
O	turned
O	his
O	feet
O	inland
O	.
O	So
O	Bobo
O	obediently
O	let
O	the
O	shoes
O	guide
O	him
O	.
O	At
O	corners
O	the
O	shoes
O	always
O	turned
O	in
O	the
O	right
O	direction
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	Bobo
O	forgot
O	and
O	blundered
O	on
O	the
O	wrong
O	way
O	,
O	the
O	shoes
O	swiftly
O	began
O	to
O	pinch
O	his
O	toes
O	.
O	For
O	two
O	days
O	Bobo
O	walked
O	inland
O	toward
O	the
O	great
O	mountain
O	.
O	A
O	warm
O	wind
O	blew
O	the
O	clouds
O	and
O	rain
O	away
O	,
O	the
O	sun
O	shone
O	sweet
O	and
O	clear
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morning
O	of
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	simpleton
O	entered
O	a
O	wood
O	of
O	tall
O	silent
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	that
O	day
O	was
O	drawing
O	to
O	a
O	close
O	,
O	turrets
O	of
O	a
O	magnificent
O	castle
O	rose
O	far
O	away
O	over
O	the
O	leaves
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	Bobo
O	arrived
O	at
O	twilight
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	beautiful
O	garden
O	,
O	lying
O	between
O	the
O	castle
O	walls
O	and
O	the
O	rising
O	slopes
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	mountain
O	.
O	Strange
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	not
O	a
O	living
O	creature
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	there
O	were
O	lights
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	even
O	a
O	warder
O	at
O	the
O	gate
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	a
O	great
O	booming
O	bell
O	struck
O	seven
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	;
O	Bobo
O	began
O	to
O	hear
O	voices
O	and
O	sounds
O	;
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	before
O	the
O	humming
O	of
O	the
O	bell
O	had
O	died
O	away
O	,
O	a
O	youth
O	mounted
O	on
O	a
O	splendid
O	black
O	horse
O	dashed
O	at
O	lightning
O	speed
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	and
O	disappeared
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	An
O	old
O	man
O	with
O	a
O	white
O	beard
O	,
O	accompanied
O	by
O	eleven
O	young
O	men
O	,
O	whom
O	Bobo
O	judged
O	,
O	from
O	their
O	expressions
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	brothers
O	,
O	--
O	stood
O	by
O	the
O	gate
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	horseman
O	ride
O	away
O	.
O	Plucking
O	up
O	courage
O	,
O	Bobo
O	came
O	forward
O	,
O	fell
O	on
O	his
O	knee
O	before
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	his
O	story
O	.
O	``
O	Truly
O	,
O	you
O	should
O	thank
O	the
O	storm

O	the
O	old
O	man
O	;

O	a
O	whole

O	``
O	To
O	this
O	Bobo
O	willingly
O	agreed
O	.
O	So
O	Twelve
O	O
O	'
O	Clock
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	youngest
O	of
O	the
O	Hours
O	,
O	took
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	stables
O	and
O	showed
O	him
O	the
O	little
O	room
O	in

O	was
O	to

O	thus
O	for
O	a

O	Bobo
O	served
O	Father

O	his

O	He
O	took
O	such
O	good
O	care

O	great
O	black
O	horses
O	of
O	the
O	Hours

O	holding
O	the
O	ebony
O	casket
O	close
O	against
O	his
O	heart
O	,
O	was
O	in
O	great
O	danger
O	of
O	falling
O	off
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	got
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	the
O	white
O	horse
O	hesitated
O	not
O	an
O	instant
O	,
O	but
O	set
O	foot
O	upon
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	which
O	bore
O	him
O	up
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	,
O	not
O	water
O	,
O	but
O	earth
O	itself
O	.
O	Once
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	Fairyland
O	,
O	Twelve
O	O
O	'
O	Clock
O	stopped
O	,
O	wished
O	Bobo
O	good-speed
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	rising
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	disappeared
O	into
O	the
O	glare
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	Bobo
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	precious
O	ebony
O	casket
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	continued
O	on
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	of
O	Princess
O	Zenza
O	'
O	s
O	palace
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	second
O	morning
O	of
O	his
O	journey
O	,
O	he
O	happened
O	to
O	see
O	far
O	ahead
O	of
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	highway
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	aged
O	man
O	who
O	had
O	lost
O	his
O	reputation
O	.
O	To
O	him
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	Bobo
O	repeated
O	the
O	counsel
O	of
O	Father
O	Time
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	him
O	hurrying
O	home
O	to
O	his
O	neighbors
O	'
O	houses
O	.
O	Of
O	the
O	man
O	who
O	had
O	lost
O	his
O	temper
O	,
O	Bobo
O	found
O	no
O	sign
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	grass
O	by
O	the
O	roadside
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	find
O	the
O	lost
O	temper
O	--
O	a
O	queer
O	sort
O	of
O	affair
O	like
O	a
O	melon
O	of
O	fiery
O	red
O	glass
O	all
O	stuck
O	over
O	with
O	uneven
O	spines
O	and
O	brittle
O	thorns
O	.
O	Bobo
O	,
O	with
O	great
O	goodness
O	of
O	heart
O	,
O	took
O	along
O	this
O	extraordinary
O	object
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	finding
O	its
O	angry
O	possessor
O	.
O	Farther
O	on
O	,
O	the
O	lad
O	encountered
O	Tilda
O	'
O	s
O	father
O	,
O	the
O	unhappy
O	King
O	,
O	and
O	delivered
O	his
O	message
O	.
O	The
O	joy
O	of
O	the
O	monarch
O	knew
O	no
O	bounds
O	,
O	and
O	Bobo
O	,
O	the
O	one-time
O	simpleton
O	,
O	became
O	on
O	the
O	spot
O	Lord
O	Bobo
O	of
O	the
O	Sapphire
O	Hills
O	,
O	Marquis
O	of
O	the
O	Mountains
O	of
O	the
O	Moon
O	,
O	Prince
O	of
O	the
O	Valley
O	of
O	Golden
O	Apples
O	,
O	and
O	Lord
O	Seneschal
O	of
O	the
O	proud
O	City
O	of
O	Zizz
O	--
O	in
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	the
O	greatest
O	nobleman
O	in
O	all
O	Fairyland
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	having
O	got
O	together
O	a
O	magnificent
O	cohort
O	of
O	dukes
O	,
O	earls
O	,
O	and
O	counts
O	,
O	all
O	in
O	splendid
O	silks
O	,
O	and
O	soldiers
O	in
O	shining
O	armor
O	,
O	the
O	delighted
O	King
O	rode
O	off
O	to
O	claim
O	his
O	missing
O	daughter
O	from
O	Princess
O	Zenza
O	.
O	So
O	on
O	they
O	rode
O	,
O	the
O	harnesses
O	jingling
O	,
O	the
O	bridle-bells
O	ringing
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	breastplates
O	of
O	the
O	armed
O	men
O	shining
O	in
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	week
O	of
O	almost
O	constant
O	progress
O	(
O	for
O	the
O	King

O	so
O	anxious
O	to
O	see
O	his
O	beloved
O	daughter
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	hardly
O	give
O	the
O	cavalcade
O	time
O	to
O	rest
O	)
O	,
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	frontiers
O	of
O	Princess
O	Zenza
O	'
O	s
O	kingdom
O	.
O	Strange
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	black
O	mourning
O	banners
O	hung
O	from
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	door
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	village
O	which
O	the
O	travelers
O	saw
O	was
O	likewise
O	hung
O	with
O	black
O	streamers
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	steps
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	cottages
O	sat
O	an
O	old
O	woman
O	,
O	all
O	alone
O	and
O	weeping
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	might
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	is
O	the
O	matter
O	,

O	the

O	``

O	Three

O	ago
O	a
O	terrible
O	dragon
O	alighted
O	in
O	the
O	gardens
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	and
O	sent

O	Yet
O	who

O	would
O	be

O	.
O	It

O	``
O	Hardly

O	But
O	they
O	knew
O	in
O	their

O	that
O	they
O	were
O	too
O	late
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	poor
O	Tilda
O	had
O	given
O	herself
O	to
O	the
O	dragon
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	it
O	proved
O	.
O	In
O	spite
O	of
O	his
O	mad
O	dash
O	,
O	Bobo
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	spurred
O	on
O	ahead
O	,
O	arrived
O	exactly
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	late
O	.
O	The
O	monstrous
O	dragon
O	with
O	Tilda
O	in
O	his
O	claws
O	was
O	just
O	a
O	little
O	smoky
O	speck
O	far
O	down
O	the
O	southern
O	sky
O	.
O	Princess
O	Zenza
O	and
O	her
O	court
O	stood
O	by
O	wringing
O	their
O	jeweled
O	hands
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	Bobo
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	half-hour
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	arrived
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	late
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	have
O	that
O	half-hour
O	back
O	again
O	!
O	Things
O	should
O	be
O	exactly
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	before
O	.
O	He
O	opened
O	the
O	cover
O	of
O	the
O	ebony
O	box
O	.
O	Something
O	like
O	a
O	winged
O	white
O	flame
O	escaped
O	from
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	flew
O	hissing
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	to
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	sun
O	itself
O	,
O	turning
O	round
O	like
O	a
O	cartwheel
O	and
O	hissing
O	like
O	ten
O	thousand
O	rockets
O	,
O	it
O	rolled
O	back
O	along
O	the
O	sky
O	to
O	the
O	east
O	.
O	The
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	clocks
O	,
O	which
O	marked
O	half-past
O	two
O	,
O	whirred
O	back
O	to
O	two
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	in
O	a
O	twinkling
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	sure
O	enough
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	brave
O	little
O	Tilda
O	standing
O	alone
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	field
O	waiting
O	for
O	the
O	dragon
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	take
O	her
O	away
O	.
O	Lumbering
O	heavily
O	along
O	like
O	a
O	monstrous
O	turtle
O	,
O	and
O	snorting
O	blue
O	smoke
O	,
O	the
O	dragon
O	was
O	advancing
O	toward
O	her
O	.
O	Bobo
O	ran
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	field
O	and
O	stood
O	beside
O	Tilda
O	,
O	ready
O	to
O	defend
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	end
O	.
O	The
O	dragon
O	came
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	angered
O	by
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	Bobo
O	and
O	his
O	drawn
O	sword
O	,
O	he
O	roared
O	angrily
O	,
O	but
O	continued
O	to
O	approach
O	.
O	Bobo
O	struck
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	.
O	The
O	blade
O	broke
O	upon
O	his
O	steely
O	scales
O	.
O	The
O	dragon
O	roared
O	again
O	.
O	Now
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	dragon
O	'
O	s
O	mouth
O	was
O	its
O	widest
O	,
O	Bobo
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	searching
O	his
O	pockets
O	desperately
O	,
O	hurled
O	into
O	it
O	the
O	lost
O	temper
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	perfectly
O	terrific
O	bang
O	!
O	as
O	if
O	a
O	million
O	balloons
O	had
O	blown
O	up
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	dragon
O	had
O	blown
O	up
O	.
O	The
O	lost
O	temper
O	had
O	finished
O	him
O	.
O	Only
O	one
O	fragment
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	a
O	tiny
O	bit
O	of
O	a
O	claw
O	,
O	was
O	ever
O	found
O	.
O	Everybody
O	,
O	you
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	cry
O	``
O	Hurrah
O	``
O	and
O	``
O	Hooray
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	soon
O	they
O	were
O	firing
O	off
O	cannon
O	and
O	ringing
O	all
O	the
O	bells
O	.
O	Then
O	Tilda
O	'
O	s
O	father
O	took
O	her
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	real
O	princess
O	.
O	The
O	Grand
O	Cross
O	of
O	the
O	Order
O	of
O	the
O	Black
O	Cat
O	was
O	conferred
O	upon
O	Bobo
O	by
O	Princess
O	Zenza
O	,
O	who
O	also
O	asked
O	his
O	pardon
O	for
O	having
O	treated
O	him
O	so
O	shabbily
O	.
O	This
O	Bobo
O	gave
O	readily
O	.
O	A
O	wonderful
O	fete
O	was
O	held
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	rejoicings
O	were
O	over
O	,
O	Bobo
O	and
O	Tilda
O	were
O	married
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	happily
O	together
O	all
O	their
O	days
O	.
