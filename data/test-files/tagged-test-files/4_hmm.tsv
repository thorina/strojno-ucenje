O	There
O	once
O	lived
O	in
O	Rambin
O	,
O	a
O	town
O	near
O	the
O	Baltic
O	Sea
O	,
O	an
O	honest
O	,
O	industrious
O	man
O	named
O	James
O	Dietrich
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	several
O	children
O	,
O	all
O	of
O	a
O	good
O	disposition
O	,
O	especially
O	the
O	youngest
O	,
O	whose
O	name
O	was
O	John
O	.
O	John
O	Dietrich
O	was
O	a
O	handsome
O	,
O	smart
O	boy
O	,
O	diligent
O	at
O	school
O	,
O	and
O	obedient
O	at
O	home
O	.
O	His
O	great
O	passion
O	was
O	for
O	hearing
O	stories
O	,
O	and
O	whenever
O	he
O	met
O	any
O	one
O	who
O	was
O	well
O	stored
O	with
O	such
O	,
O	he
O	never
O	let
O	him
O	go
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	them
O	all
O	.
O	When
O	John
O	was
O	about
O	eight
O	years
O	old
O	he
O	was
O	sent
O	to
O	spend
O	a
O	summer
O	with
O	his
O	uncle
O	,
O	a
O	farmer
O	in
O	Rodenkirchen
O	.
O	Here
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	keep
O	cows
O	with
O	other
O	boys
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	used
O	to
O	drive
O	them
O	to
O	graze
O	about
O	the
O	Nine
O	-
O	hills
O	,
O	where
O	an
O	old
O	cowherd
O	,
O	one
O	Klas
O	Starkwolt
O	,
O	frequently
O	came
O	to
O	join
O	the
O	lads
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	they
O	would
O	sit
O	down
O	all
O	together
O	and
O	tell
O	stories
O	.
O	Consequently
O	Klas
O	became
O	John
O	'
O	s
O	best
O	friend
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	stories
O	without
O	end
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	tell
O	all
O	about
O	the
O	Nine
O	-
O	hills
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	underground
O	folk
O	who
O	inhabited
O	them
O	;
O	how
O	the
O	giants
O	disappeared
O	from
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	or
O	little
O	people
O	came
O	in
O	their
O	stead
O	.
O	These
O	tales
O	John
O	swallowed
O	so
O	eagerly
O	that
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	nothing
O	else
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	for
O	ever
O	talking
O	of
O	golden
O	cups

O	and
O	crowns
O	,

O	-
O	white
O	brides
O	,

O	the

O	Old
O	Klas
O	used

O	Still

O	!
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	hill
O	where
O	they
O	had
O	just
O	been
O	dancing
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	was
O	now
O	full
O	of
O	grass
O	and
O	flowers
O	,
O	as
O	people
O	see
O	it
O	by
O	day
O	,
O	there
O	rose
O	,
O	of
O	a
O	sudden
O	,
O	a
O	small
O	glass
O	door
O	.
O	Whosoever
O	wanted
O	to
O	go
O	in
O	stepped
O	upon
O	this
O	;
O	it
O	opened
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	glided
O	gently
O	in
O	,
O	the
O	glass
O	closing
O	again
O	after
O	him
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	all
O	entered
O	it
O	vanished
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	farther
O	trace
O	of
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	Those
O	who
O	descended
O	through
O	the
O	glass
O	door
O	sank
O	quite
O	gently
O	into
O	a
O	wide
O	silver
O	tun
O	or
O	barrel
O	,
O	which
O	held
O	them
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	easily
O	have
O	harboured
O	a
O	thousand
O	such
O	little
O	people
O	.
O	John
O	and
O	his
O	man
O	went
O	down
O	also
O	,
O	along
O	with
O	several
O	others
O	,
O	all
O	of
O	whom
O	screamed
O	out
O	and
O	prayed
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	tread
O	on
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	if
O	his
O	weight
O	came
O	on
O	them
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	dead
O	men
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	careful
O	,
O	and
O	acted
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	friendly
O	way
O	towards
O	them
O	.
O	Several
O	barrels
O	of
O	this
O	kind
O	went
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	after
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	until
O	all
O	were
O	in
O	.
O	They
O	hung
O	by
O	long
O	silver
O	chains
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	drawn
O	and
O	guided
O	from
O	below
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	descent
O	John
O	was
O	amazed
O	at
O	the
O	wonderful
O	brilliancy
O	of
O	the
O	walls
O	between
O	which
O	the
O	tun
O	glided
O	down
O	.
O	They
O	seemed
O	all
O	studded
O	with
O	pearls
O	and
O	diamonds
O	,
O	glittering
O	and
O	sparkling
O	brightly
O	,
O	while
O	below
O	him
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	music
O	tinkling
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	what
O	he
O	was
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	excess
O	of
O	pleasure
O	he
O	fell
O	fast
O	asleep
O	.
O	He
O	slept
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	awoke
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	bed
O	that
O	could
O	be
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	in
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	or
O	any
O	other
O	house
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	also
O	the
O	prettiest
O	little
O	chamber
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	servant
O	was
O	beside
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	fan
O	to
O	keep
O	away
O	the
O	flies
O	and
O	gnats
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	hardly
O	opened
O	his
O	eyes
O	when
O	his
O	little
O	servant
O	brought
O	him
O	a
O	basin
O	and
O	towel
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	ready
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	put
O	on
O	the
O	nicest
O	new
O	clothes
O	of
O	brown
O	silk
O	,
O	most
O	beautifully
O	made
O	;
O	with
O	these
O	was
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	new
O	black
O	shoes
O	with
O	red
O	ribbons
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	John
O	had
O	never
O	beheld
O	in
O	Rambin
O	or
O	in
O	Rodenkirchen
O	either
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	also
O	there
O	several
O	pairs
O	of
O	glittering
O	glass
O	shoes
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	are
O	only
O	used
O	on
O	great
O	occasions
O	.
O	John
O	was
O	,
O	we
O	may
O	well
O	suppose
O	,
O	delighted
O	to
O	have
O	such
O	clothes
O	to
O	wear
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	put
O	them
O	on
O	joyfully
O	.
O	His
O	servant
O	then
O	flew
O	like
O	lightning
O	and
O	returned
O	with
O	a
O	fine
O	breakfast
O	of
O	wine
O	and
O	milk
O	,
O	and
O	delicate
O	white
O	bread
O	and
O	fruits
O	,
O	and
O	such
O	other
O	things
O	as
O	little
O	boys
O	are
O	fond
O	of
O	.
O	He
O	now
O	perceived
O	,
O	every
O	moment
O	,
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	,
O	that
O	Klas
O	Starkwolt
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	cowherd
O	,
O	knew
O	what
O	he
O	was
O	talking
O	about
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	splendour
O	and
O	magnificence
O	here
O	surpassed
O	anything
O	John
O	had
O	ever
O	dreamt
O	of
O	.
O	His
O	servant
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	obedient
O	one
O	possible
O	;
O	a
O	nod
O	or
O	a
O	sign
O	was
O	enough
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	wise
O	as
O	a
O	bee
O	,
O	as
O	all
O	these
O	little
O	people
O	are
O	by
O	nature
O	.
O	John
O	'
O	s
O	bedroom
O	was
O	all
O	covered
O	with
O	emeralds
O	and
O	other
O	precious
O	stones
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	ceiling
O	was
O	a
O	diamond
O	as
O	big
O	as
O	a
O	nine
O	-
O	pin
O	bowl
O	,
O	that
O	gave
O	light
O	to
O	the
O	whole
O	chamber
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	place
O	they
O	have
O	neither
O	sun
O	,
O	nor
O	moon
O	,
O	nor
O	stars
O	to
O	give
O	them
O	light
O	;
O	neither
O	do
O	they
O	use
O	lamps
O	or
O	candles
O	of
O	any
O	kind
O	;
O	but
O	they
O	live
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	precious
O	stones
O	,
O	and
O	have
O	the
O	purest
O	of
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	in
O	abundance
O	,
O	from
O	which
O	they
O	manage
O	to
O	obtain
O	light
O	both
O	by
O	day
O	and
O	by
O	night
O	,
O	though
O	indeed
O	,
O	properly
O	speaking
O	,
O	as
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	sun
O	here
O	,
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	distinction
O	of
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	reckon
O	only
O	by
O	weeks
O	.
O	They
O	set
O	the
O	brightest
O	and
O	clearest
O	precious
O	stones
O	in
O	their
O	dwellings
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	ways
O	and
O	passages
O	leading
O	under
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	places
O	where
O	they
O	have
O	their
O	large
O	halls
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	dances
O	and
O	feasts
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	sparkle
O	of
O	these
O	jewels
O	makes
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	silvery
O	twilight
O	which
O	is
O	far
O	more
O	beautiful
O	than
O	common
O	day
O	.
O	When
O	John
O	had
O	finished
O	his
O	breakfast
O	,
O	his
O	servant
O	opened
O	a
O	little
O	door
O	in
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	where
O	was
O	a
O	closet
O	with
O	silver
O	and
O	gold
O	cups
O	and
O	dishes
O	and
O	other
O	vessels

O	filled
O	with
O	ducats
O	,
O	and
O	boxes
O	of
O	jewels
O	and
O	precious
O	stones
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	also
O	charming
O	pictures
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	most
O	delightful
O	story

O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	in
O	the
O	whole

O	John
O	spent
O	the

O	;
O	and
O	,
O	when
O	it

O	a

O	John
O	,
O	however

O	With
O	these
O	thoughts
O	he
O	consoled
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	sported
O	and
O	played
O	away
O	with
O	his
O	little
O	playfellows
O	,
O	and
O	ate
O	,
O	and
O	drank
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	his
O	servant
O	and
O	the
O	others
O	tell
O	him
O	stories
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	always
O	liked
O	to

O	strange
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	get
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	everything
O	.
O	They
O	sat
O	at
O	table
O	about
O	two
O	hours
O	:
O	the
O	principal
O	person
O	then
O	rang
O	a
O	little
O	bell
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	tables
O	and
O	chairs
O	all
O	vanished
O	in
O	a
O	whiff
O	,
O	leaving
O	the
O	company
O	standing
O	on
O	their
O	feet
O	.
O	The
O	birds
O	now
O	struck
O	up
O	a
O	most
O	lively
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	people
O	began
O	to
O	dance
O	,
O	jumping
O	and
O	leaping
O	and
O	whirling
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	world
O	were
O	grown
O	dizzy
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	pretty
O	little
O	girls
O	that
O	sat
O	next
O	John
O	caught
O	hold
O	of
O	him
O	and
O	whirled
O	him
O	about
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	without
O	making
O	any
O	resistance
O	,
O	he
O	danced
O	with
O	them
O	for
O	two
O	good
O	hours
O	.
O	Every
O	afternoon
O	while
O	he
O	remained
O	there
O	he
O	used
O	to
O	do
O	the
O	same
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	last
O	hour
O	of
O	his
O	life
O	,
O	he
O	always
O	spoke
O	of
O	it
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	glee
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	music
O	and
O	dancing
O	were
O	over
O	,
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	about
O	four
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	people
O	then
O	disappeared
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	each
O	about
O	their
O	work
O	or
O	their
O	pleasure
O	.
O	After
O	supper
O	they
O	sported
O	and
O	danced
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	way
O	;
O	and
O	at
O	midnight
O	,
O	especially
O	on
O	starlight
O	nights
O	,
O	they
O	slipped
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	hills
O	to
O	dance
O	in
O	the
O	open
O	air
O	.
O	John
O	used
O	then
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	good
O	boy
O	,
O	to
O	say
O	his
O	prayers
O	and
O	go
O	to
O	sleep
O	,
O	a
O	duty
O	he
O	never
O	neglected
O	either
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	or
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	first
O	week
O	that
O	John
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	glass
O	-
O	hill
O	he
O	only
O	went
O	from
O	his
O	chamber
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	hall
O	and
O	back
O	again
O	.
O	After
O	then
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	walk
O	about
O	,
O	making
O	his
O	servant
O	show
O	and
O	explain
O	everything
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	here
O	most
O	beautiful
O	walks
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	might
O	ramble
O	along
O	for
O	miles
O	,
O	in
O	all
O	directions
O	,
O	without
O	ever
O	finding
O	an
O	end
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	so
O	immensely
O	large
O	was
O	the
O	hill
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	people
O	lived
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	outwardly
O	it
O	seemed
O	but
O	a
O	little
O	hill
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	few
O	bushes
O	and
O	trees
O	growing
O	on
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	also
O	meadows
O	and
O	lanes
O	,
O	islands
O	and
O	lakes
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	birds
O	sang
O	sweeter
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	flowers
O	were
O	more
O	brilliant
O	and
O	fragrant
O	than
O	anything
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	seen
O	on
O	earth
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	breeze
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	one
O	did
O	not
O	feel
O	the
O	wind
O	;
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	clear
O	and
O	bright
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	heat
O	;
O	the
O	waves
O	were
O	dashing
O	,
O	still
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	danger
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	little
O	barks
O	and
O	canoes
O	came
O	,
O	like
O	white
O	swans
O	,
O	when
O	one
O	wanted
O	to
O	cross
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	backwards
O	and
O	forwards
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	accord
O	.
O	Whence
O	all
O	this
O	came
O	nobody
O	knew
O	,
O	nor
O	could
O	his
O	servant
O	tell
O	anything
O	about
O	it
O	.
O	These
O	lovely
O	meads
O	and
O	plains
O	were
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	most
O	part
O	,
O	all
O	solitary
O	.
O	Few
O	of
O	the
O	underground
O	people
O	were
O	to

O	seen
O	upon
O	them
O	,

O	across
O	them
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	in
O	the
O	greatest
O	hurry
O	.
O	It
O	very
O	rarely
O	happened
O	that
O	any
O	of
O	them
O	danced
O	out
O	here
O	in
O	the
O	open
O	air
O	;
O	sometimes
O	about
O	three
O	of
O	them
O	did
O	so
O	;
O	at
O	the
O	most
O	half
O	a
O	dozen
O	:
O	John
O	never
O	saw
O	a
O	greater
O	number
O	together
O	.
O	The
O	meadows
O	never
O	seemed
O	cheerful
O	,
O	except
O	when
O	the
O	earth
O	-

O	a
O	week

O	might
O	get

O	to
O	renounce

O	and
O	Elizabeth
O	to
O	hers

O	and
O	the

O	was
O	soon

O	that

O	or
O	to

O	the
O	fish

O	,
O	and
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	display

O	wealth
O	.
O	John
O	did
O	not
O	neglect
O	his
O	old
O	friend
O	Klas
O	Starkwolt
O	,
O	the
O	cowherd
O	.
O	He
O	gave
O	him
O	enough
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	comfortable
O	for
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	his
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	insisted
O	on
O	his
O	coming
O	and
O	staying
O	with
O	him
O	as
O	often
O	and
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	he
O	wished
O	.
O	After
O	his
O	marriage
O	,
O	John
O	made
O	a
O	progress
O	through
O	the
O	country
O	with
O	his
O	beautiful
O	Elizabeth
O	and
O	they
O	purchased
O	towns
O	,
O	and
O	villages
O	,
O	and
O	lands
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	became

O	gentlemen
O	and

O	for
O	what
O	cannot

O	John
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	spent
O	their
O	days
O	in
O	acts
O	of
O	piety
O	and
O	charity
O	.
O	They
O	built
O	several
O	churches
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	the
O	blessings
O	of
O	every
O	one
O	that
O	knew
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	died
O	universally
O	lamented
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	Count
O	John
O	Dietrich
O	who
O	built
O	and
O	richly
O	endowed
O	the
O	present
O	church
O	of
O	Rambin
O	.
O	He
O	built
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	site
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	presented
O	to
O	it
O	several
O	of
O	the
O	cups
O	and
O	plates
O	made
O	by
O	the
O	underground
O	people
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	own
O	and
O	Elizabeth
O	'
O	s
O	glass
O	shoes
O	,
O	in
O	memory
O	of
O	what
O	had
O	befallen
O	them
O	in
O	their
O	youth
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	taken
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	Charles
O	the
O	Twelfth
O	of
O	Sweden
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	Russians
O	came
O	on
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Cossacks
O	plundered
O	even
O	the
O	churches
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	away
O	everything
O	.
