O	once
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	village
O	maiden
O	,
O	the
O	prettiest
O	ever
O	seen
O	.
O	her
O	mother
O	was
O	foolishly
O	fond
O	of
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	grandmother
O	likewise
O	.
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	made
O	for
O	her
O	a
O	little
O	hood
O	,
O	which
O	became
O	the
O	damsel
O	so
O	well
O	,
O	that
O	ever
O	after
O	she
O	went
O	by
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	little
O	red-riding-hood
O	.
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	when
O	her
O	mother
O	was
O	making
O	cakes
O	,
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	my
O	child
O	,
O	you
O	shall
O	go
O	and
O	see
O	your
O	grandmother
O	,
O	for
O	i
O	hear
O	she
O	is
O	not
O	well
O	;
O	and
O	you
O	shall
O	take
O	her
O	some
O	of
O	these
O	cakes
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	pot
O	of
O	butter
O	.
O	``
O	little
O	red-riding-hood
O	was
O	delighted
O	to
O	go
O	,
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	walk
O	;
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	child
O	,
O	and
O	fond
O	of
O	her
O	kind
O	grandmother
O	.
O	passing
O	through
O	a
O	wood
O	,
O	she
O	met
O	a
O	great
C	wolf
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	most
O	eager
O	to
O	eat
O	her
O	up
O	,
O	but
O	dared
O	not
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	a
O	woodcutter
O	who
O	was
O	busy
O	hard
O	by
O	.
O	so
O	he
O	only
O	came
O	and
O	asked
O	her
O	politely
O	where
O	she
O	was
O	going
O	.
O	the
O	poor
O	child
O	,
O	who
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	dangerous
O	it
O	is
O	to
O	stop
O	and
O	speak
O	to
O	wolves
O	,
O	replied
O	,
O	``
O	i
O	am
O	going
O	to
O	see

O	.

O	.
O	``
O	``
O	well

O	said
O	the
C	wolf
O	,
O	``

O	the
O	little
O	maiden
O	took
O	the
O	longest
O	;
O	for
O	she
O	stopped
O	to
O	pluck
O	roses
O	in
O	the
O	wood

O	such

O	little
O	soul
O	.
O	the
C	wolf
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	in
