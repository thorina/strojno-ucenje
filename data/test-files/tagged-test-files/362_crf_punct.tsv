O	After
O	he
O	had
O	rescued
C	Sir
C	Percivale
O	from
O	the
O	twenty
O	knights
O	who
O	beset
O	him
O	,
C	Sir
C	Galahad
O	rode
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	till
O	nightfall
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	sought
O	shelter
O	at
O	a
O	little
O	hermitage
O	.
C	Thither
O	there
O	came
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	a
O	damsel
O	who
O	desired
O	to
O	speak
O	with
C	Sir
C	Galahad
O	;
O	so
O	he
O	arose
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	her
O	.
O	``
O	Galahad
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	arm
O	you
O	and
O	mount
O	your
O	horse
O	and
O	follow
O	me
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	am
O	come
O	to
O	guide
O	you
O	in
O	your
O	quest
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	they
O	rode
O	together
O	until
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	the
O	damsel
O	showed
O	Galahad
O	a
O	great
O	ship
O	into
O	which
O	he
O	must
O	enter
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	bade
O	him
O	farewell
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	,
O	going
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	found
O	there
O	already
O	the
O	good
O	knights
C	Sir
C	Bors
O	and
C	Sir
C	Percivale
O	,
O	who
O	made
O	much
O	joy
O	of
O	the
O	meeting
O	.
O	They
O	abode
O	in
O	that
O	ship
O	until
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	of
C	King
C	Pelles
O	,
O	who
O	welcomed
O	them
O	right
O	gladly
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	all
O	sat
O	at
O	supper
O	that
O	night
O	,
O	suddenly
O	the
O	hall
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	light
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	holy
O	vessel
O	appeared
O	in
O	their
O	midst
O	,
O	covered
O	all
O	in
O	white
O	samite
O	.
O	While
O	they
O	all
O	rejoiced
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	voice
O	,
O	saying
O	:
O	``
O	My
O	knights
O	whom
O	I
O	have
O	chosen
O	,
O	ye
O	have
O	seen
O	the
O	holy
O	vessel
O	dimly
O	.
O	Continue
O	your
O	journey
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Sarras
O	and
O	there
O	the
O	perfect
O	Vision
O	shall
O	be
O	yours
O	.
O	``
O	Now
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Sarras
O	had
O	dwelt
O	long
O	time
O	Joseph
O	of
O	Arimathea
O	,
O	teaching
O	its
O	people
O	the
O	true
O	faith
O	,
O	before
O	ever
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	Britain
O	;
O	but
O	when
C	Sir
C	Galahad
O	and
O	his
O	fellows
O	came
O	there
O	after
O	long
O	voyage
O	,
O	they
O	found
O	it
O	ruled
O	by
O	a
O	heathen
C	king
O	named
O	Estorause
O	,
O	who
O	cast
O	them
O	into
O	a
O	deep
O	dungeon
O	.
O	There
O	they
O	were
O	kept
O	a
O	year
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	the
O	tyrant
O	died
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	great
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	gathered
O	together
O	to
O	consider
O	who
O	should
O	be
O	their
C	king
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	while
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	council
O	,
O	came
O	a
O	voice
O	bidding
O	them
O	take
O	as
O	their
C	king
O	the
O	youngest
O	of
O	the
O	three
O	knights
O	whom
O	Estorause
O	had
O	thrown
O	into
O	prison
O	.
O	So
O	in
O	fear
O	and
O	wonder
O	they
O	hastened
O	to
O	the
O	prison
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	releasing
O	the
O	three
O	knights
O	,
O	made
C	Galahad
C	king
O	as
O	the
O	voice
O	had
O	bidden
O	them
O	.
O	Thus
C	Sir
C	Galahad
C	became
C	king
O	of
O	the
O	famous
O	city
O	of
O	Sarras
O	,
O	in
O	far
O	Babylon
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	reigned
O	a
O	year
O	when
O	,
O	one
O	morning
O	early
O	,
O	he
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	knights
O	,
O	his
O	fellows
O	,
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	chapel
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	they
O	saw
O	,
O	kneeling
O	in
O	prayer
O	,
O	an
O	aged
O	man
O	,
O	robed
O	as
O	a
O	bishop
O	and
O	round
O	him
O	hovered
O	many
O	angels
O	.
O	The
O	knights
O	fell
O	on
O	their
O	knees
O	in
O	awe
O	and
O	reverence
O	,
O	whereupon
O	he
O	that
O	seemed
O	a
O	bishop
O	turned
O	to
O	them
O	and
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	Joseph
O	of
O	Arimathea
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	am
O	come
O	to
O	show
O	you
O	the
O	perfect
O	Vision
O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	.
O	``
O	On
O	the
O	instant
O	there
O	appeared
O	before
O	them
O	,
O	without
O	veil
O	or
O	cover
O	,
O	the
O	holy
O	vessel
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	radiance
O	of
O	light
O	such
O	as
O	almost
O	blinded
O	them
O	.
C	Sir
C	Bors
O	and
C	Sir
C	Percivale
O	,
O	when
O	at
O	length
O	they
O	were
O	recovered
O	from
O	the
O	brightness
O	of
O	that
O	glory
O	,
O	looked
O	up
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	the
O	holy
O	Joseph
O	and
O	the
O	wondrous
O	vessel
O	had
O	passed
O	from
O	their
O	sight
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	Went
O	to
C	Sir
C	Galahad
O	where
O	he
O	still
O	knelt
O	as
O	in
O	prayer
O	,
O	and
O	behold
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	dead
O	;
O	for
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	with
O	him
O	even
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	prayed
O	;
O	in
O	the
O	moment
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	vision
O	,
O	his
O	soul
O	had
O	gone
O	back
O	to
O	God
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	buried
O	him
O	in
O	that
O	far
O	city
O	,
O	themselves
O	mourning
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	immediately
O	after
O	,
C	Sir
C	Percivale
O	put
O	off
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	a
O	monk
O	,
O	living
O	a
O	devout
O	and
O	holy
O	life
O	until
O	,
O	a
O	year
O	and
O	two
O	months
O	later
O	,
O	he
O	also
O	died
O	and
O	was
O	buried
O	near
C	Sir
C	Galahad
O	.
O	Then
C	Sir
C	Bors
O	armed
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	bidding
O	farewell
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	sailed
O	away
O	until
O	,
O	after
O	many
O	weeks
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	Britain
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	took
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	stayed
O	not
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	Camelot
O	.
O	Great
O	was
O	the
O	rejoicing
O	of
C	Arthur
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	knights
O	when
C	Sir
C	Bors
O	was
O	once
O	more
O	among
O	them
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	told
O	all
O	the
O	adventures
O	which
O	had
O	befallen
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	good
O	knights
O	,
O	his
O	companions
O	,
O	all
O	who
O	heard
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	amaze
O	.
O	But
O	the
C	king
O	,
O	he
O	caused
O	the
O	wisest
O	clerks
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	to
O	write
O	in
O	great
O	books
O	this
O	Quest
O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	fame
O	of
O	it
O	should
O	endure
O	unto
O	all
O	time
O	.
