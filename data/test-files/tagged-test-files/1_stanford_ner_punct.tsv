O	Once
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	royal
O	couple
O	who
O	grieved
O	excessively
O	because
O	they
O	had
O	no
O	children
O	.
O	When
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	after
O	long
O	waiting
O	,
O	the
C	queen
O	presented
O	her
O	husband
O	with
O	a
O	little
C	daughter
O	,
O	his
O	majesty
O	showed
O	his
O	joy
O	by
O	giving
O	a
O	christening
O	feast
O	,
O	so
O	grand
O	that
O	the
O	like
O	of
O	it
O	was
O	never
O	known
O	.
O	He
O	invited
O	all
O	the
O	fairies
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	--
O	there
O	were
O	seven
O	altogether
O	--
O	to
O	stand
C	godmothers
O	to
O	the
O	little
C	princess
O	;
O	hoping
O	that
O	each
O	might
O	bestow
O	on
O	her
O	some
O	good
O	gift
O	,
O	as
O	was
O	the
O	custom
O	of
O	good
O	fairies
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	ceremony
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	guests
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	set
O	before
O	each
O	fairy-godmother
O	a
O	magnificent
O	covered
O	dish
O	,
O	with
O	an
O	embroidered
O	table-napkin
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	knife
O	and
O	fork
O	of
O	pure
O	gold
O	,
O	studded
O	with
O	diamonds
O	and
O	rubies
O	.
O	But
O	alas
O	!
O	as
O	they
O	placed
O	themselves
O	at
O	table
O	,
O	there
O	entered
O	an
O	old
C	fairy
O	who
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	invited
O	,
O	because
O	more
O	than
O	fifty
O	years
O	since
O	she
O	had
O	left
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	dominion
O	on
O	a
O	tour
O	of
O	pleasure
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	heard
O	of
O	until
O	this
O	day
O	.
O	His
O	majesty
O	,
O	much
O	troubled
O	,
O	desired
O	a
O	cover
O	to
O	be
O	placed
O	for
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	of
O	common
O	delf
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	ordered
O	from
O	his
O	jeweller
O	only
O	seven
O	gold
O	dishes
O	for
O	the
O	seven
O	fairies
O	aforesaid
O	.
O	The
O	elderly
C	fairy
O	thought
O	herself
O	neglected
O	,
O	and
O	muttered
O	angry
O	menaces
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	overheard
O	by
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	younger
O	fairies
O	,
O	who
O	chanced
O	to
O	sit
O	beside
O	her
O	.
O	This
O	good
C	godmother
O	,
O	afraid
O	of
O	harm
O	to
O	the
O	pretty
O	baby
O	,
O	hastened
O	to
O	hide
O	herself
O	behind
O	the
O	tapestry
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	.
O	She
O	did
O	this
O	,
O	because
O	she
O	wished
O	all
O	the
O	others
O	to
O	speak
O	first
O	--
O	so
O	that
O	if
O	any
O	ill
O	gift
O	were
O	bestowed
O	on
O	the
O	child
O	,
O	she
O	might
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	counteract
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	six
O	now
O	offered
O	their
O	good
O	wishes
O	--
O	which
O	,
O	unlike
O	most
O	wishes
O	,
O	were
O	sure
O	to
O	come
O	true
O	.
O	The
O	fortunate
O	little
C	princess
O	was
O	to
O	grow
O	up
O	the
O	fairest
O	woman
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	;
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	temper
O	sweet
O	as
O	an
O	angel
O	;
O	to
O	be
O	perfectly
O	graceful
O	and
O	gracious
O	;
O	to
O	sing
O	like
O	a
O	nightingale
O	;
O	to
O	dance
O	like
O	a
O	leaf
O	on
O	a
O	tree
O	;
O	and
O	to
O	possess
O	every
O	accomplishment
O	under
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	old
C	fairy
O	'
O	s
O	turn
O	came
O	.
O	Shaking
O	her
O	head
O	spitefully
O	,
O	she
O	uttered
O	the
O	wish
O	that
O	when
O	the
O	baby
O	grew
O	up
O	into
O	a
O	young
O	lady
O	,
O	and
O	learned
O	to
O	spin
O	,
O	she
O	might
O	prick
O	her
O	finger
O	with
O	the
O	spindle
O	and
O	die
O	of
O	the
O	wound
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	terrible
O	prophecy
O	all
O	the
O	guests
O	shuddered
O	;
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	more
O	tender-hearted
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	.
O	The
O	lately
O	happy
O	parents
O	were
O	almost
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	wits
O	with
O	grief
O	.
O	Upon
O	which
O	the
O	wise
O	young
C	fairy
O	appeared
O	from
O	behind
O	the
O	tapestry
O	,
O	saying
O	cheerfully
O	``
O	Your
O	majesties
O	may
O	comfort
O	yourselves
O	;
O	the
C	princess
O	shall
O	not
O	die
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	no
O	power
O	to
O	alter
O	the
O	ill-fortune
O	just
O	wished
O	her
O	by
O	my
O	ancient
O	sister
O	--
O	her
O	finger
O	must
O	be
O	pierced
O	;
O	and
O	she
O	shall
O	then
O	sink
O	,
O	not
O	into
O	the
O	sleep
O	of
O	death
O	,
O	but
O	into
O	a
O	sleep
O	that
O	will
O	last
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	.
O	After
O	that
O	time
O	is
O	ended
O	,
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	a
C	king
O	will
O	find
O	her
O	,
O	awaken
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	marry
O	her
O	.
O	``
O	Immediately
O	all
O	the
O	fairies
O	vanished
O	.
O	The
C	king
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	avoiding
O	his
O	daughter
O	'
O	s
O	doom
O	,
O	issued
O	an
O	edict
O	,
O	forbidding
O	all
O	persons
O	to
O	spin
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	to
O	have
O	spinning-wheels
O	in
O	their
O	houses
O	,
O	on
O	pain
O	of
O	instant
O	death
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	just
O	fifteen
O	years
O	of
O	age
O	,
O	the
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	left
O	their
O	daughter
O	alone
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	their
O	castles
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	wandering
O	about
O	at
O	her
O	will
O	,
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	an
O	ancient
O	donjon
O	tower
O	,
O	climbed
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	found
O	a
O	very
C	old
C	woman
O	--
O	so
O	old
O	and
O	deaf
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	never
O	heard
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	edict
O	--
O	busy
O	with
O	her
O	wheel
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	are
O	you
O	doing
O	,
O	good
C	old

O	said
O	the
C	princess
O	.
O	``

O	``
O	``
O	Ah

O	.
O	``
O	She
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	taken
O	up
O	the
O	spindle
O	than
O	,
O	being
O	lively
O	and
O	obstinate
O	,
O	she
O	handled
O	it
O	so
O	awkwardly
O	and
O	carelessly
O	that
O	the
O	point
O	pierced
O	her
O	finger
O	.
O	Though
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	small
O	a
O	wound
O	,
O	she
O	fainted
O	away
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	dropped
O	silently
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	frightened
C	old
C	woman
O	called
O	for
O	help
O	;
O	shortly
O	came
O	the
O	ladies
O	in
O	waiting
O	,
O	who
O	tried
O	every
O	means
O	to
O	restore
O	their
O	young
O	mistress
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	their
O	care
O	was
O	useless
O	.
O	She
O	lay
O	,
O	beautiful
O	as
O	an
O	angel
O	,
O	the
O	colour
O	still
O	lingering
O	in
O	her
O	lips
O	and
O	cheeks
O	;
O	her
O	fair
O	bosom
O	softly
O	stirred
O	with
O	her
O	breath
O	:
O	only
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	fast
O	closed
O	.
O	When
O	the
C	king
O	her
O	father
O	and
O	the
C	queen
O	her
O	mother
O	beheld
O	her
O	thus
O	,
O	they
O	knew
O	regret
O	was
O	idle
O	--
O	all
O	had
O	happened
O	as
O	the
O	cruel
C	fairy
O	meant
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	also
O	knew
O	that
O	their
O	daughter
O	would
O	not
O	sleep
O	for
O	ever
O	,
O	though
O	after
O	one
O	hundred
O	years
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	likely
O	they
O	would
O	either
O	of
O	them
O	behold
O	her
O	awakening
O	.
O	Until
O	that
O	happy
O	hour
O	should
O	arrive
O	,
O	they
O	determined
O	to
O	leave
O	her
O	in
O	repose
O	.
O	They
O	sent
O	away
O	all
O	the
O	physicians
O	and
O	attendants
O	,
O	and
O	themselves
O	sorrowfully
O	laid
O	her
O	upon
O	a
O	bed
O	of
O	embroidery
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	elegant
O	apartment
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	There
O	she
O	slept
O	and
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	sleeping
O	angel
O	still
O	.
O	When
O	this
O	misfortune
O	happened
O	,
O	the
O	kindly
O	young
C	fairy
O	who
O	had
O	saved
O	the
C	princess
O	by
O	changing
O	her
O	sleep
O	of
O	death
O	into
O	this
O	sleep
O	of
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	,
O	was
O	twelve
O	thousand
O	leagues
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Mataquin
O	.
O	But
O	being
O	informed
O	of
O	everything
O	,
O	she
O	arrived
O	speedily
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	chariot
O	of
O	fire
O	drawn
O	by
O	dragons
O	.
O	The
C	king
O	was
O	somewhat
O	startled
O	by
O	the
O	sight
O	,
O	but
O	nevertheless
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	his
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	mournful
O	countenance
O	,
O	presented
O	her
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	descend
O	.
O	The
C	fairy
O	condoled
O	with
O	his
O	majesty
O	,
O	and
O	approved
O	of
O	all
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	being
O	a
C	fairy
O	of
O	great
O	common
O	sense
O	and
O	foresight
O	,
O	she
O	suggested
O	that
O	the
C	princess
O	,
O	awakening
O	after
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	in
O	this
O	ancient
O	castle
O	,
O	might
O	be
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	embarrassed
O	,
O	especially
O	with
O	a
O	young
C	prince
O	by
O	her
O	side
O	,
O	to
O	find
O	herself
O	alone
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	without
O	asking
O	any
O	one
O	'
O	s
O	leave
O	,
O	she
O	touched
O	with
O	her
O	magic
O	wand
O	the
O	entire
O	population
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	--
O	except
O	the
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	;
O	governesses
O	,
O	ladies
O	of
O	honour
O	,
O	waiting-maids
O	,
O	gentlemen
O	ushers
O	,
O	cooks
O	,
O	kitchen-girls
O	,
O	pages
O	,
O	footmen
O	--
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	horses
O	that
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	stables
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	grooms
O	that
O	attended
O	them
O	,
O	she
O	touched
O	each
O	and
O	all
O	.
O	Nay
O	,
O	with
O	kind
O	consideration
O	for
O	the
O	feelings
O	of
O	the
C	princess
O	,
O	she
O	even
O	touched
O	the
O	little
O	fat
O	lap-dog
O	,
C	Puffy
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	beside
O	his
O	mistress
O	on
O	her
O	splendid
O	bed
O	.
O	He
O	,
O	like
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	fell
O	fast
O	asleep
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	.
O	The
O	very
O	spits
O	that
O	were
O	before
O	the
O	kitchen-fire
O	ceased
O	turning
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fire
O	itself
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	everything
O	became
O	as
O	silent
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	or
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	palace
O	were
O	a
O	palace
O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	.
O	The
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	--
O	having
O	kissed
O	their
O	daughter
O	and
O	wept
O	over
O	her
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	much
O	,
O	she
O	looked
O	so
O	sweet
O	and
O	content
O	--
O	departed
O	from
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	giving
O	orders
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	approached
O	no
O	more
O	.
O	The
O	command
O	was
O	unnecessary
O	;
O	for
O	in
O	one
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	there
O	sprung
O	up
O	around
O	it
O	a
O	wood
O	so
O	thick
O	and
O	thorny
O	that
O	neither
O	beasts
O	nor
O	men
O	could
O	attempt
O	to
O	penetrate
O	there
O	.
O	Above
O	this
O	dense
O	mass
O	of
O	forest
O	could
O	only
O	be
O	perceived
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	high
O	tower
O	where
O	the
O	lovely
C	princess
O	slept
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	many
O	changes
O	happen
O	in
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	.
O	The
C	king
O	,
O	who
O	never
O	had
O	a
O	second
O	child
O	,
O	died
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	throne
O	passed
O	into
O	another
O	royal
O	family
O	.
O	So
O	entirely
O	was
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	the
O	poor
C	princess
O	forgotten
O	,
O	that
O	when
O	the
O	reigning
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	being
O	one
O	day
O	out
O	hunting
O	and
O	stopped
O	in
O	the
O	chase
O	by
O	this
O	formidable
O	wood
O	,
O	inquired
O	what
O	wood
O	it
O	was
O	and
O	what
O	were
O	those
O	towers
O	which
O	he
O	saw
O	appearing
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	could
O	answer
O	him
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	an
O	old
O	peasant
O	was
O	found
O	who
O	remembered
O	having
O	heard
O	his
O	grandfather
O	say
O	to
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	this
O	tower
O	was
O	a
C	princess
O	,
O	beautiful
O	as
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	doomed
O	to
O	sleep
O	there
O	for
O	one
O	hundred
O	years
O	,
O	until
O	awakened
O	by
O	a
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	her
O	destined
O	bridegroom
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	young
C	prince
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	the
O	spirit
O	of
O	a
O	hero
O	,
O	determined
O	to
O	find
O	out
O	the
O	truth
O	for
O	himself
O	.
O	Spurred
O	on
O	by
O	both
O	generosity
O	and
O	curiosity
O	,
O	he
O	leaped
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	force
O	his
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	thick
O	wood
O	.
O	To
O	his
O	amazement
O	the
O	stiff
O	branches
O	all
O	gave
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	ugly
O	thorns
O	sheathed
O	themselves
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	accord
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	brambles
O	buried
O	themselves
O	in
O	the
O	earth
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	pass
O	.
O	This
O	done
O	,
O	they
O	closed
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	allowing
O	none
O	of
O	his
O	suite
O	to
O	follow
O	:
O	but
O	,
O	ardent
O	and
O	young
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	boldly
O	on
O	alone
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	thing
O	he
O	saw
O	was
O	enough
O	to
O	smite
O	him
O	with
O	fear
O	.
O	Bodies
O	of
O	men
O	and
O	horses
O	lay
O	extended
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	men
O	had
O	faces
O	,
O	not
O	death-white
O	,
O	but
O	red
O	as
O	peonies
O	,
O	and
O	beside
O	them
O	were
O	glasses
O	half
O	filled
O	with
O	wine
O	,
O	showing
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	sleep
O	drinking
O	.
O	Next
O	he
O	entered
O	a
O	large
O	court
O	,
O	paved
O	with
O	marble
O	,
O	where
O	stood
O	rows
O	of
O	guards
O	presenting
O	arms
O	,
O	but
O	motionless
O	as
O	if
O	cut
O	out
O	of
O	stone
O	;
O	then
O	he
O	passed
O	through
O	many
O	chambers
O	where
O	gentlemen
O	and
O	ladies
O	,
O	all
O	in
O	the
O	costume
O	of
O	the
O	past
O	century
O	,
O	slept
O	at
O	their
O	ease
O	,
O	some
O	standing
O	,
O	some
O	sitting
O	.
O	The
O	pages
O	were
O	lurking
O	in
O	corners
O	,
O	the
O	ladies
O	of
O	honour
O	were
O	stooping
O	over
O	their
O	embroidery
O	frames
O	,
O	or
O	listening
O	apparently
O	with
O	polite
O	attention
O	to
O	the
O	gentlemen
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	were
O	as
O	silent
O	as
O	statues
O	and
O	as
O	immoveable
O	.
O	Their
O	clothes
O	,
O	strange
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	were
O	fresh
O	and
O	new
O	as
O	ever
O	:
O	and
O	not
O	a
O	particle
O	of
O	dust
O	or
O	spider-web
O	had
O	gathered
O	over
O	the
O	furniture
O	,
O	though
O	it
O	had
O	not
O	known
O	a
O	broom
O	for
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	.
O	Finally
O	the
O	astonished
C	prince
O	came
O	to
O	an
O	inner
O	chamber
O	,
O	where
O	was
O	the
O	fairest
O	sight
O	his
O	eyes
O	had
O	ever
O	beheld
O	.
O	A
O	young
O	girl
O	of
O	wonderful
O	beauty
O	lay
O	asleep
O	on
O	an
O	embroidered
O	bed
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	looked
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	only
O	just
O	closed
O	her
O	eyes
O	.
O	Trembling
O	,
O	the
C	prince
O	approached
O	and
O	knelt
O	beside
O	her
O	.
O	Some
O	say
O	he
O	kissed
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	nobody
O	saw
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	never
O	told
O	,
O	we
O	can
O	not
O	be
O	quite
O	sure
O	of
O	the
O	fact
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	enchantment
O	had
O	come
O	,
O	the
C	princess
O	awakened
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	eyes
O	of
O	the
O	tenderest
O	regard
O	,
O	said
O	drowsily
O	,
O	``
O	Is
O	it
O	you
O	,
O	my
C	prince
O	?
O	I
O	have
O	waited
O	for
O	you
O	very
O	long
O	.
O	``
O	Charmed
O	with
O	these
O	words
O	,
O	and
O	still
O	more
O	with
O	the
O	tone
O	in
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	uttered
O	,
O	the
C	prince
O	assured
O	her
O	that
O	he
O	loved
O	her
O	more
O	than
O	his
O	life
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	embarrassed
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	;
O	for
O	,
O	thanks
O	to
O	the
O	kind
C	fairy
O	,
O	the
C	princess
O	had
O	plenty
O	of
O	time
O	to
O	dream
O	of
O	him
O	during
O	her
O	century
O	of
O	slumber
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	even
O	heard
O	of
O	her
O	till
O	an
O	hour
O	before
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	did
O	they
O	sit
O	conversing
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	had
O	not
O	said
O	half
O	enough
O	.
O	Their
O	only
O	interruption
O	was
O	the
O	little
O	dog
C	Puffy
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	awakened
O	with
O	his
O	mistress
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	exceedingly
O	jealous
O	that
O	the
C	princess
O	did
O	not
O	notice
O	him
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	wont
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	Meantime
O	all
O	the
O	attendants
O	,
O	whose
O	enchantment
O	was
O	also
O	broken
O	,
O	not
O	being
O	in
O	love
O	,
O	were
O	ready
O	to
O	die
O	of
O	hunger
O	after
O	their
O	fast
O	of
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	.
O	A
O	lady
O	of
O	honour
O	ventured
O	to
O	intimate
O	that
O	dinner
O	was
O	served
O	;
O	whereupon
O	the
C	prince
O	handed
O	his
O	beloved
C	princess
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	hall
O	.
O	She
O	did
O	not
O	wait
O	to
O	dress
O	for
O	dinner
O	,
O	being
O	already
O	perfectly
O	and
O	magnificently
O	attired
O	,
O	though
O	in
O	a
O	fashion
O	somewhat
O	out
O	of
O	date
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	her
O	lover
O	had
O	the
O	politeness
O	not
O	to
O	notice
O	this
O	,
O	nor
O	to
O	remind
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	dressed
O	exactly
O	like
O	her
O	royal
C	grandmother
O	,
O	whose
O	portrait
O	still
O	hung
O	on
O	the
O	palace
O	walls
O	.
O	During
O	the
O	banquet
O	a
O	concert
O	took
O	place
O	by
O	the
O	attendant
O	musicians
O	,
O	and
O	considering
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	touched
O	their
O	instruments
O	for
O	a
O	century
O	they
O	played
O	extremely
O	well
O	.
O	They
O	ended
O	with
O	a
O	wedding
O	march
O	:
O	for
O	that
O	very
O	evening
O	the
O	marriage
O	of
O	the
C	prince
O	and
C	princess
O	was
O	celebrated
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	the
O	bride
O	was
O	nearly
O	one
O	hundred
O	years
O	older
O	than
O	the
O	bridegroom
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	remarkable
O	that
O	the
O	fact
O	would
O	never
O	have
O	been
O	discovered
O	by
O	any
O	one
O	unacquainted
O	therewith
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	they
O	went
O	together
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	and
O	enchanted
O	wood
O	,
O	both
O	of
O	which
O	immediately
O	vanished
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	never
O	more
O	beheld
O	by
O	mortal
O	eyes
O	.
O	The
C	princess
O	was
O	restored
O	to
O	her
O	ancestral
O	kingdom
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	generally
O	declared
O	who
O	she
O	was
O	,
O	as
O	during
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	people
O	had
O	grown
O	so
O	very
O	much
O	cleverer
O	that
O	nobody
O	then
O	living
O	would
O	ever
O	have
O	believed
O	the
O	story
O	.
O	So
O	nothing
O	was
O	explained
O	,
O	and
O	nobody
O	presumed
O	to
O	ask
O	any
O	questions
O	about
O	her
O	,
O	for
O	ought
O	not
O	a
C	prince
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	marry
O	whomsoever
O	he
O	pleases
O	?
O	Nor
O	--
O	whether
O	or
O	not
O	the
O	day
O	of
O	fairies
O	was
O	over
O	--
O	did
O	the
C	princess
O	ever
O	see
O	anything
O	further
O	of
O	her
O	seven
O	godmothers
O	.
O	She
O	lived
O	a
O	long
O	and
O	happy
O	life
O	,
O	like
O	any
O	other
O	ordinary
O	woman
O	,
O	and
O	died
O	at
O	length
O	,
O	beloved
O	,
O	regretted
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	the
C	prince
O	being
O	already
O	no
O	more
O	,
O	perfectly
O	contented
O	.
