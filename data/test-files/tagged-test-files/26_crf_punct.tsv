O	Long
O	ago
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	monarch
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	very
O	honest
O	man
O	that
O	his
O	subjects
O	entitled
O	him
O	the
O	Good
C	King
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	out
O	hunting
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	white
O	rabbit
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	half
O	killed
O	by
O	his
O	hounds
O	,
O	leaped
O	right
O	into
O	his
O	majesty
O	'
O	s
O	arms
O	.
O	Said
O	he
O	,
O	caressing
O	it
O	:
O	``
O	This
O	poor
O	creature
O	has
O	put
O	itself
O	under
O	my
O	protection
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	allow
O	no
O	one
O	to
O	injure
O	it
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	he
O	carried
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	palace
O	,
O	had
O	prepared
O	for
O	it
O	a
O	neat
O	little
O	rabbit-hutch
O	,
O	with
O	abundance
O	of
O	the
O	daintiest
O	food
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	rabbits
O	love
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	left
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	same
O	night
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	alone
O	in
O	his
O	chamber
O	,
O	there
O	appeared
O	to
O	him
O	a
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	dressed
O	neither
O	in
O	gold
O	,
O	nor
O	silver
O	,
O	nor
O	brocade
O	;
O	but
O	her
O	flowing
O	robes
O	were
O	white
O	as
O	snow
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	wore
O	a
O	garland
O	of
O	white
O	roses
O	on
O	her
O	head
O	.
O	The
O	Good
C	King
O	was
O	greatly
O	astonished
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	;
O	for
O	his
O	door
O	was
O	locked
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	wondered
O	how
O	so
O	dazzling
O	a
O	lady
O	could
O	possibly
O	enter
O	;
O	but
O	she
O	soon
O	removed
O	his
O	doubts
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Candide
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	she
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	smiling
O	and
O	gracious
O	air
O	.
O	``
O	Passing
O	through

O	took

O	up
O	by
O	a
O	foolish

O	who
O	indulged

O	the
O	bear-hunters
O	,
O	asking
O	what

O	a

O	just
O	punishment

O	Four
O	courtiers
O	,
O	his

O	wished
O	to
O	divide

O	the

O	``
O	These
O	words
O	touched
O	the
O	poor

O	so
O	deeply
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	ceased
O	to
O	beat
O	himself
O	against
O	the
O	iron
O	bars
O	of
O	the
O	cage
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	hunters
O	carried
O	him
O	about
O	,
O	became
O	gentle
O	as
O	a
O	lamb
O	,
O	and
O	suffered
O	himself
O	to
O	be
O	taken
O	quietly
O	to
O	a
O	menagerie
O	,
O	where
O	were
O	kept
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	strange

O	ferocious
O	animals
O	--
O	a
O	place
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	himself
O	often
O	visited
O	as
O	a
O	boy
O	,
O	but
O	never
O	thought

O	However
O	,
O	he
O	owned

O	had
O	deserved
O	it
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	make
O	amends
O	by
O	showing
O	himself
O	very
O	obedient
O	to
O	his
O	keeper
O	.
O	This
O	man
O	was
O	almost
O	as
O	great
O	a
O	brute
O	as
O	the

O	had
O	charge
O	of
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	in

O	humour
O	he
O	used
O	to
O	beat
O	them
O	without

O	or

O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	sleeping
O	,
O	a
O	tiger
O	broke
O	loose
O	,
O	and
O	leaped
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	eager
O	to
O	devour
O	him
O	.
O	Cherry
O	at
O	first
O	felt
O	a
O	thrill
O	of
O	pleasure
O	at
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	being
O	revenged
O	;
O	then
O	,
O	seeing
O	how
O	helpless
O	the
O	man
O	was
O	,
O	he
O	wished
O	himself
O	free
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	defend
O	him
O	.
O	Immediately
O	the
O	doors
O	of
O	his
O	cage
O	opened
O	.
O	The
O	keeper
O	,
O	waking
O	up
O	,
O	saw
O	the
O	strange
C	beast
O	leap
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	imagined
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	be
O	slain
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	Instead
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	tiger
O	lying
O	dead
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	strange
C	beast
O	creeping
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	laying
O	itself
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	to
O	be
O	caressed
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	he
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	stroke
O	it
O	,
O	a
O	voice
O	was
O	heard
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	Good
O	actions
O	never
O	go
O	unrewarded
O	;
O	``
O	and
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	the
O	frightful
O	monster
O	,
O	there
O	crouched
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	nothing
O	but
O	a
O	pretty
O	little
C	dog
O	.
O	Cherry
O	,
O	delighted
O	to
O	find
O	himself
O	thus
O	metamorphosed
O	,
O	caressed
O	the
O	keeper
O	in
O	every
O	possible
O	way
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	man
O	took
O	him
O	up
O	into
O	his

O	this
O	wonderful
O	story
O	,
O	from
O	beginning
O	to
O	end
O	.
O	The
C	queen
O	wished
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	charming
O	little
C	dog
O	;
O	and
O	Cherry
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	exceedingly
O	happy
O	,
O	could
O	he
O	have
O	forgotten
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	originally
O	a
O	man
O	and
O	a
C	king
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	lodged
O	most
O	elegantly
O	,
O	had
O	the
O	richest
O	of
O	collars
O	to
O	adorn
O	his
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	himself
O	praised
O	continually
O	.
O	But
O	his
O	beauty
O	rather
O	brought
O	him
O	into
O	trouble
O	,
O	for
O	the
C	queen
O	,
O	afraid
O	lest
O	he
O	might
O	grow
O	too
O	large
O	for
O	a
O	pet
O	,
O	took
O	advice
O	of
O	dog-doctors
O	,
O	who
O	ordered
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	fed
O	entirely
O	upon
O	bread
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	very
O	sparingly
O	;
O	so
O	poor
O	Cherry
O	was
O	sometimes
O	nearly
O	starved
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	gave
O	him
O	his
O	crust
O	for
O	breakfast
O	,
O	a
O	fancy
O	seized
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	eat
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	palace-garden
O	;
O	so
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	bread
O	in
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	trotted
O	away
O	towards
O	a
O	stream
O	which
O	he
O	knew
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	he
O	sometimes
O	stopped
O	to
O	drink
O	.
O	But
O	instead
O	of
O	the
O	stream
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	splendid
O	palace
O	,
O	glittering
O	with
O	gold
O	and
O	precious
O	stones
O	.
O	Entering
O	the
O	doors
O	was
O	a
O	crowd
O	of
O	men
O	and
O	women
O	,
O	magnificently
O	dressed
O	;
O	and
O	within
O	there
O	was
O	singing
O	and
O	dancing
O	,
O	and
O	good
O	cheer
O	of
O	all
O	sorts
O	.
O	Yet
O	,
O	however
O	grandly
O	and
O	gaily
O	the
O	people
O	went
O	in
O	,
O	Cherry
O	noticed
O	that
O	those
O	who
O	came
O	out
O	were
O	pale
O	,
O	thin
O	,
O	ragged
O	,
O	half-naked
O	,
O	covered
O	with
O	wounds
O	and
O	sores
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	them
O	dropped
O	dead
O	at
O	once
O	;
O	others
O	dragged
O	themselves
O	on
O	a
O	little
O	way
O	and
O	then
O	lay
O	down
O	,
O	dying
O	of
O	hunger
O	,
O	and
O	vainly
O	begged
O	a
O	morsel
O	of
O	bread
O	from
O	others
O	who
O	were
O	entering
O	in
O	--
O	who
O	never
O	took
O	the
O	least
O	notice
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	Cherry
O	perceived
O	one
O	woman
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	trying
O	feebly
O	to
O	gather
O	and
O	eat
O	some
O	green
O	herbs
O	.
O	``
O	Poor
O	thing
O	!
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	himself
O	;
O	``
O	I
O	know
O	what
O	it
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	hungry
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	want
O	my
O	breakfast
O	badly
O	enough
O	;
O	but
O	still
O	it
O	will
O	not
O	kill
O	me
O	to
O	wait
O	till
O	dinner-time
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	crust
O	may
O	save
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	this
O	poor
O	woman
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	little
C	dog
O	ran
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	dropped
O	his
O	bread
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	;
O	she
O	picked
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	ate
O	it
O	with
O	avidity
O	.
O	Soon
O	she
O	looked
O	quite
O	recovered
O	,
O	and
O	Cherry
O	,
O	delighted
O	,
O	was
O	trotting
O	back
O	again
O	to
O	his
O	kennel
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	loud
O	cries
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	young
O	girl
O	dragged
O	by
O	four
O	men
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	trying
O	to
O	compel
O	her
O	to
O	enter
O	.
O	Oh
O	,
O	how
O	he
O	wished
O	himself
O	a
O	monster
O	again
O	,
O	as
O	when
O	he
O	slew
O	the
O	tiger
O	!
O	--
O	for
O	the
O	young
O	girl
O	was
O	no
O	other
O	than
O	his
O	beloved
C	Zelia
O	.
O	Alas
O	!
O	what
O	could
O	a
O	poor
O	little
C	dog
O	do
O	to
O	defend
O	her
O	?
O	But
O	he
O	ran
O	forward
O	and
O	barked
O	at
O	the
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	bit
O	their
O	heels
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	chased
O	him
O	away
O	with
O	heavy
O	blows
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	he
O	lay
O	down
O	outside
O	the
O	palace-door
O	,
O	determined
O	to
O	watch
O	and
O	see
O	what
O	had
O	become
O	of
C	Zelia
O	.
O	Conscience
O	pricked
O	him
O	now
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	!
O	``
O	thought
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	furious

O	away

O	``
O	While
O	he
O	lay
O	thinking
O	and
O	repenting
O	,
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	window
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	saw
C	Zelia
O	throw
O	out
O	of
O	it
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	dainty
O	meat
O	.
O	Cherry
O	,
O	who
O	felt
O	hungry
O	enough
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	was
O	just
O	about
O	to
O	eat
O	it
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	woman
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	his
O	crust
O	snatched

O	up
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	.
O	``
O	Poor
O	little

O	,
O	patting
O	him
O	,
O	``
O	every

O	the
O	voice
O	in
O	the

O	repeated
O	again
O	,
O	``
O	Good

O	``
O	and
O	Cherry
O	found
O	himself
O	changed
O	into
O	a
O	beautiful
O	little
O	white
O	pigeon
O	.
O	He
O	remembered
O	with
O	joy
O	that
O	white
O	was
O	the
O	colour
O	of
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Candide
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	hope
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	taking
O	him
O	into
O	favour
O	again
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	stretched
O	his
O	wings
O	,
O	delighted
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	now
O	have
O	a
O	chance
O	of
O	approaching
O	his
O	fair
C	Zelia
O	.
O	He
O	flew
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	palace-windows
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	finding
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	open
O	,
O	entered
O	and
O	sought
O	everywhere
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	find
C	Zelia
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	in
O	despair
O	,
O	he
O	flew
O	out
O	again
O	,
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	over
O	the
O	world
O	until
O	he
O	beheld
O	her
O	once
O	more
O	.
O	He
O	took
O	flight
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	traversed
O	many
O	countries
O	,
O	swiftly
O	as
O	a
O	bird
O	can
O	,
O	but
O	found
O	no
O	trace
O	of
O	his
O	beloved
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	in
O	a
O	desert
O	,
O	sitting
O	beside
O	an
O	old

O	,
O	and
O	partaking
O	with

O	his
O	frugal
O	repast
O	,
O	Cherry
O	saw
O	a
O	poor
O	peasant-girl
O	,
O	and
O	recognised
C	Zelia
O	.
O	Transported
O	with
O	joy
O	,
O	he
O	flew
O	in
O	,
O	perched
O	on

O	and
O	expressed
O	his

O	by
O	a

O	.
O	She
O	,
