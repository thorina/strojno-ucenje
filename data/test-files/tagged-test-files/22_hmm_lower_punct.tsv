O	there
O	was
O	once
O	a
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	so
O	beautiful
O	that
O	they
O	named
O	her
O	the
O	fair
O	one
O	with
O	golden
O	locks
O	.
O	these
O	golden
O	locks
O	were
O	the
O	most
O	remarkable
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	soft
O	and
O	fine
O	,
O	and
O	falling
O	in
O	long
O	waves
O	down
O	to
O	her
O	very
O	feet
O	.
O	she
O	wore
O	them
O	always
O	thus
O	,
O	loose
O	and
O	flowing
O	,
O	surmounted
O	with
O	a
O	wreath
O	of
O	flowers
O	;
O	and
O	though
O	such
O	long
O	hair
O	was
O	sometimes
O	rather
O	inconvenient
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	exceedingly
O	beautiful
O	,
O	shining
O	in
O	the
O	sun
O	like
O	ripples
O	of
O	molten
O	gold
O	,
O	that
O	everybody
O	agreed
O	she
O	fully
O	deserved
O	her
O	name
O	.
O	now
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	young
O	king
O	of
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	country
O	,
O	very
O	handsome
O	,
O	very
O	rich
O	,
O	and
O	wanting
O	nothing
O	but
O	a
O	wife
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	happy
O	.
O	he
O	heard
O	so
O	much
O	of
O	the
O	various
O	perfections
O	of
O	the
O	fair
O	one
O	with
O	golden
O	locks
O	,
O	that
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	without
O	even
O	seeing
O	her
O	,
O	he
O	fell
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	her
O	so
O	desperately
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	neither
O	eat
O	nor
O	drink
O	,
O	and
O	resolved
O	to
O	send
O	an
O	ambassador
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	demand
O	her
O	in
O	marriage
O	.
O	so
O	he
O	ordered
O	a
O	magnificent
O	equipage
O	--
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	hundred
O	horses
O	and
O	a
O	hundred
O	footmen
O	--
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	bring
O	back
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	fair
O	one
O	with
O	golden
O	locks
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	he
O	never
O	doubted
O	,
O	would
O	be
O	only
O	too
O	happy
O	to
O	become
O	his
O	queen
O	.
O	indeed
O	,
O	he
O	felt
O	so
O	sure
O	of
O	her
O	that
O	he
O	refurnished
O	the
O	whole
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	made
O	,
O	by
O	all
O	the
O	dressmakers
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	dresses
O	enough
O	to
O	last
O	a
O	lady
O	for
O	a
O	lifetime
O	.
O	but
O	,
O	alas
O	!
O	when
O	the
O	ambassador
O	arrived
O	and
O	delivered
O	his
O	message
O	,
O	either
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	bad
O	humor
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	offer
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	to
O	be
O	to
O	her
O	taste
O	;
O	for
O	she
O	returned
O	her
O	best
O	thanks
O	to
O	his
O	majesty
O	,
O	but
O	said
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	the
O	slightest
O	wish
O	or
O	intention
O	to
O	be
O	married
O	.
O	she
O	also
O	,
O	being
O	a
O	prudent
O	damsel
O	,
O	declined
O	receiving
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	presents
O	which
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	sent
O	her
O	;
O	except
O	that
O	,
O	not
O	quite
O	to
O	offend
O	his
O	majesty
O	,
O	she
O	retained
O	a
O	box
O	of
O	english
O	pins
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	of
O	considerable
O	value
O	.
O	when
O	the
O	ambassador
O	returned
O	,
O	alone
O	and
O	unsuccessful
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	court
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	affected
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	himself
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	might
O	.
O	now
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	household
O	a
O	young
O	gentleman
O	named
O	avenant
O	,
O	beautiful
O	as
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	besides
O	being
O	at
O	once
O	so
O	amiable
O	and
O	so
O	wise
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	confided
O	to
O	him
O	all
O	his
O	affairs
O	;
O	and
O	every
O	one
O	loved
O	him
O	,
O	except
O	those
O	people
O	--
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	in
O	all
O	courts
O	--
O	who
O	were
O	envious
O	of
O	his
O	good
O	fortune
O	.
O	these
O	malicious
O	folk
O	hearing
O	him
O	say
O	gaily
O	,
O	``
O	if
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	sent
O	me
O	to
O	fetch
O	the
O	fair
O	one
O	with
O	golden
O	locks
O	,
O	i
O	know
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	come
O	back
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	``
O	repeated
O	the
O	saying
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	manner
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	appeared
O	as
O	if
O	avenant
O	thought
O	so
O	much
O	of
O	himself
O	and
O	his
O	beauty
O	,
O	and
O	felt
O	sure
O	the
O	princess
O	would
O	have
O	followed
O	him
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	world
O	;
O	which
O	when
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	ears
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	meant
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	irritated
O	him
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	commanded
O	avenant
O	to
O	be
O	imprisoned
O	in
O	a
O	high
O	tower
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	to
O	die
O	there
O	of
O	hunger
O	.
O	the
O	guards
O	accordingly
O	carried
O	off
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	quite
O	forgotten
O	his
O	idle
O	speech
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	not
O	the
O	least
O	idea
O	what
O	fault
O	he
O	had
O	committed
O	.
O	they
O	ill-treated
O	him
O	very
O	much
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	left
O	him
O	,
O	with
O	nothing
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	only
O	water
O	to
O	drink
O	.
O	this
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	kept
O	him
O	alive
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	,
O	during
O	which
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	cease
O	to
O	complain
O	aloud
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	call
O	upon
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	o
O	king

O	sort
O	of
O	remorse
O	,
O	past
O	the

O	by
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	the
O	young

O	,
O	and
O	overheard
O	these
O	words
O	.
O	the
O	tears
O	rushed
O	into
O	his
O	eyes
O	;
O	he
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	tower
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	,
O	``

O	avenant
O	came
O	,
O	creeping
O	feebly
O	along

O	gasping
O	on
O	the
O	grass
O	,
O	a

O	carp
O	,

O	,
O	in

O	heads
O	off
O	,
O	like
O	common
O	people
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	compelled
O	to
O	wash
O	their
O	faces
O	with
O	this
O	water
O	;
O	upon
O	which
O	they
O	fell
O	asleep
O	,
O	and

O	.
O	so
O	it

O	phial
O	,
O	believing
O	it

O	the
O	news
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	gliding
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	among
O	the
O	crowd
O	which
O	clustered
O	round
O	the
O	young
O	and
O	lovely
O	widow
O	,
O	whispered
O	softly
O	to
O	her
O	--
O	``
O	madam
O	,
O	do
O	not
O	forget
O	poor

O	if
O	she

O	been
O	disposed
O	to
O	do
O	so
O	,
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	his
O	little
O	dog
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	enough
O	to
O	remind
O	her
O	of
O	him
O	--
O	his
O	many
O	sufferings
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	great
O	fidelity

O	she
O	rose
O	up
O	,
O	without
O	speaking
O	to
O	anybody
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	straight
O	to
O	the
O	tower

O	and
O	putting
O	a
O	crown
O	of
O	gold
O	on
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	purple
O	mantle
O	on
O	his
O	shoulders
O	,
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	``
O	be
O	king
O	--
O	and
O	my
O	husband
O	.
O	``
O	avenant
O	could
O	not

O	he
O	threw
O	himself
O	at

O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	took
O	the
O	crown
O	and
O	sceptre
O	,
O	and
O	ruled
O	her
O	kingdom
O	like

O	pomp
O	,
O	and
O	avenant
