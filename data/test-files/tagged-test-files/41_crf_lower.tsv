O	stock

O	goods
O	fit
O	for

O	i
O	designed
O	to

O	.

O	took
O	the
O	route
O	of
O	persia
O	,
O	travelled
O	over
O	several
O	provinces
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	arrived
O	at
O	a
O	port
O	,
O	where
O	i
O	embarked
O	.
O	on
O	putting
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	,
O	we
O	were
O	overtaken
O	by
O	such
O	a
O	sudden
O	gust
O	of
O	wind
O	as
O	obliged
O	the
C	captain
O	to
O	lower
O	his
O	yards
O	and
O	take
O	all
O	other
O	necessary
O	precautions
O	to
O	prevent
O	the
O	danger
O	that
O	threatened
O	us
O	.
O	but
O	all
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	;
O	our
O	endeavors

O	no
O	effect
O	;
O	the
O	sails
O	were
O	split
O	into
O	a
O	thousand
O	pieces
O	,
O	and

O	ship
O	was
O	stranded
O	;
O	several
O	of

O	merchants
O	and
O	seamen
O	were
O	drowned
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	cargo
O	was
O	lost
O	.
O	i
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	fortune
O	,
O	with
O	several
O	of

O	merchants

O	,
O	to
O	get
O	upon
O	some
O	planks
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	were
O	carried
O	by
O	the
O	current
O	to
O	an
O	island
O	which
O	lay
O	before
O	us
O	.
O	there
O	we
O	found
O	fruit
O	and
O	spring
O	water
O	,
O	which
O	preserved
O	our
O	lives
O	.
O	we

O	near

O	morning
O	,
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	up
O	,
O	we
O	explored
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	some
O	houses
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	approached
O	.
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	we
O	drew
O	near
O	,
O	we
O	were
O	encompassed
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	negroes
O	,
O	who
O	seized
O	us
O	,
O	shared
O	us
O	among
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	us
O	to
O	their
O	respective
O	habitations
O	.
O	i
O	and
O	five
O	of
O	my
O	comrades
O	were
O	carried
O	to
O	one
O	place
O	;
O	here
O	they
O	made
O	us
O	sit
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	us
O	a
O	certain
O	herb
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	made
O	signs
O	to
O	us
O	to
O	eat
O	.
O	my
O	comrades
O	not
O	taking
O	notice
O	that
O	the
O	blacks
O	ate
O	none
O	of
O	it
O	themselves
O	,
O	thought
O	only
O	of
O	satisfying
O	their
O	hunger
O	,
O	and
O	ate
O	with
O	greediness
O	.
O	but
O	i
O	,
O	suspecting
O	some
O	trick
O	,
O	would
O	not
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	taste
O	it
O	,
O	which
O	happened
O	well
O	for
O	me
O	;
O	for
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	after
O	i
O	perceived
O	my
O	companions
O	had
O	lost
O	their
O	senses
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	when
O	they
O	spoke
O	to
O	me
O	they
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	they
O	said
O	.
O	the
O	negroes
O	fed
O	us
O	afterward
O	with
O	rice
O	,
O	prepared
O	with
O	oil
O	of
O	cocoanuts
O	;

O	greedily
O	.
O	i
O	also
O	partook
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	very
O	sparingly
O	.
O	they
O	gave
O	us
O	that
O	herb
O	at
O	first
O	on
O	purpose
O	to
O	deprive
O	us
O	of
O	our
O	senses
O	,
O	that
O	we
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	aware
O	of
O	the
O	sad
O	destiny
O	prepared
O	for
O	us
O	;
O	and
O	they
O	supplied
O	us
O	with
O	rice
O	to
O	fatten
O	us
O	;
O	for
O	,
O	being
O	cannibals
O	,
O	their
O	design
O	was
O	to
O	eat
O	us
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	we
O	grew
O	fat
O	.
O	this
O	accordingly
O	happened
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	devoured
O	my
O	comrades
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	not
O	sensible
O	of
O	their
O	condition
O	;
O	but
O	my
O	senses
O	being
O	entire
O	,
O	you
O	may
O	easily
O	guess
O	that
O	instead
O	of
O	growing
O	fat
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	rest
O	did
O	,
O	i
O	grew
O	leaner
O	every
O	day
O	.
O	the
O	fear
O	of
O	death
O	under
O	which
O	i
O	labored
O	turned
O	all
O	my
O	food
O	into
O	poison
O	.
O	i
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	languishing
O	distemper
O	,
O	which
O	proved
O	my
O	safety
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	negroes
O	,
O	having
O	killed
O	and

O	my

O	,
O	seeing
O	me
O	to
O	be
O	withered
O	,
O	lean

O	sick
O	,
O	deferred
O	my
O	death
O	.
O	meanwhile
O	i
O	had
O	much
O	liberty
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	scarcely
O	any
O	notice
O	was
O	taken
O	of
O	what
O	i
O	did
O	,
O	and
O	this

O	an
O	opportunity
O	one
O	day
O	to
O	get
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	from
O	the
O	houses
O	and
O	to
O	make
O	my
O	escape
O	.
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	who
O	saw
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	suspected
O	my
O	design
O	,
O	called
O	to
O	me
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	to
O	return
O	;
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	obeying
O	him
O	i
O	redoubled
O	my
O	speed
O	,
O	and
O	quickly
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	.
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	there

O	till

O	therefore

O	could
O	not
O	arrive
O	in

O	those

O	lived
O	for
O	the

O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	which
O	i
O	got
O	through
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	myself
O	upon
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	i
O	felt
O	exceeding
O	joy
O	.
O	i
O	prostrated
O	myself
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	to
O	thank
O	god
O	for
O	this
O	mercy
O	,
O	and
O	shortly

O	for

O	where
O	i
O	was
O	.
O	i
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	with
O	the
O	linen
O	of
O	my
O	turban
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	to
O	the
O	crew
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	i
O	could
O	.
O	they
O	heard
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	a
O	boat
O	to
O	bring
O	me
O	on
O	board
O	.
O	it
O	was
O	fortunate
O	for
O	me
O	that
O	these
O	people
O	did
O	not
O	inspect
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	they
O	found
O	me
O	,
O	but
O	without
O	hesitation
O	took
O	me
O	on
O	board
O	.
O	we
O	passed
O	by
O	several
O	islands
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	among
O	others
O	,

O	wind

O	six
O	from
O	that
O	of
O	kela
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	landed
O	.
O	lead
O	mines
O	are

O	in

O	;

O	.

O	rich
O	and
O	powerful
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	isle
O	of
O	bells
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	about
O	two
O	days
O	'
O	journey
O	in
O	extent
O	,
O	is
O	also
O	subject
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	are
O	so
O	barbarous
O	that

O	still
O	eat
O	human
O	flesh
O	.

O	we
O	had
O	finished
O	our
O	traffic
O	in
O	that
O	island
O	we
O	put
O	to
O	sea
O	again

O	and
O	touched
O	at
O	several

O	ports
O	;

O	out
O	of
O	gratitude
O	to
O	god
O	for
O	his
O	mercies

O	contributed

O	and

O	subsistence
