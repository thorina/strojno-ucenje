O	one
O	of

O	youths
O	in
O	the
O	world

O	and
O	desired

O	the
O	only
O	way
O	for
O	a

O	to
O	distinguish

O	was
O	by

O	battles
O	,
O	either
O	with
O	the

O	or
O	with

O	,
O	or
O	with
O	troublesome

O	,
O	or
O	with
O	wild
O	beasts
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	nothing
O	more
O	dangerous

O	encounter
O	.
O	king
O	iobates
O	,
O	perceiving
O	the
O	courage
O	of
O	his
O	youthful
O	visitor
O	,
O	proposed
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	fight
O	the
O	chimæra
O	,
O	which
O	everybody
O	else
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	,
O	unless
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	soon
O	killed
O	,
O	was
O	likely
O	to
O	convert
O	lycia
O	into
O	a
O	desert
O	.
O	bellerophon
O	hesitated
O	not
O	a
O	moment
O	,
O	but
O	assured
O	the
O	king
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	either
O	slay
O	this
O	dreaded
O	chimæra
O	,
O	or
O	perish
O	in
O	the
O	attempt
O	.
O	but
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	place
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	monster
O	was
O	so
O	prodigiously
O	swift
O	,
O	he
O	bethought
O	himself
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	never
O	win
O	the
O	victory
O	by
O	fighting
O	on
O	foot
O	.
O	the
O	wisest
O	thing
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	was
O	to
O	get
O	the
O	very
O	best
O	and
O	fleetest
O	horse
O	that
O	could
O	anywhere
O	be
O	found
O	.
O	and
O	what
O	other
O	horse
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	was
O	half
O	so
O	fleet
O	as
O	the
O	marvellous
O	horse
O	pegasus
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	wings
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	legs
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	even
O	more
O	active
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	than
O	on
O	the
O	earth
O	?
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	people
O	denied
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	any
O	such
O	horse
O	with
O	wings
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	the
O	stories
O	about
O	him
O	were
O	all
O	poetry
O	and
O	nonsense
O	.
O	but
O	,
O	wonderful
O	as
O	it
O	appeared
O	,
O	bellerophon
O	believed
O	that
O	pegasus
O	was
O	a
O	real
O	steed
O	,
O	and
O	hoped
O	that
O	he
O	himself
O	might
O	be
O	fortunate
O	enough
O	to
O	find
O	him
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	once
O	fairly
O	mounted
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	fight
O	the
O	chimæra
O	at
O	better
O	advantage
O	.
O	and
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	purpose
O	with
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	travelled
O	from
O	lycia
O	to
O	greece
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	brought
O	the
O	beautifully
O	ornamented
O	bridle
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	it
O	was
O	an
O	enchanted
O	bridle
O	.
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	only
O	succeed
O	in
O	putting
O	the
O	golden
O	bit
O	into
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	pegasus
O	,
O	the
O	winged
O	horse
O	would
O	be
O	submissive
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	own
O	bellerophon
O	for

O	master
O	,
O	and
O	fly
O	whithersoever
O	he
O	might
O	choose
O	to
O	turn
O	the
O	rein
O	.
O	but
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	weary
O	and

O	he
O	would
O	come
O	and
O	drink
O	at
O	the

O	,
O	although
O	still
O	at
O	a
O	vast
O	distance
O	from
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	bellerophon
O	caught
O	the
O	child
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	shrank
O	back
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	both
O	hidden
O	among
O	the
O	thick
O	shrubbery
O	which
O	grew
O	all
O	around
O	the
O	fountain
O	.
O	not
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	any
O	harm
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	dreaded
O	lest
O	,
O	if
O	pegasus
O	caught
O	a
O	glimpse
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	fly
O	far
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	alight
O	in
O	some
O	inaccessible
O	mountain
O	-
O	top
O	.
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	really
O	the
O	winged
O	horse
O	.
O	after
O	they
O	had
O	expected
O	him
O	so
O	long
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	coming
O	to
O	quench
O	his
O	thirst
O	with
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	pirene
O	.
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	came
O	the
O	aërial
O	wonder
O	,
O	flying
O	in
O	great
O	circles
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	may
O	have
O	seen
O	a
O	dove
O	when
O	about
O	to
O	alight
O	.
O	downward
O	came
O	pegasus
O	,
O	in
O	those
O	wide
O	,
O	sweeping
O	circles
O	,
O	which
O	grew
O	narrower
O	,
O	and
O	narrower
O	still
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	gradually
O	approached
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	the
O	nigher
O	the
O	view
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	the
O	more
O	beautiful
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	more
O	marvellous
O	the
O	sweep
O	of
O	his
O	silvery
O	wings
O	.
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	with
O	so
O	light
O	a
O	pressure
O	as
O	hardly
O	to
O	bend
O	the
O	grass
O	about
O	the
O	fountain
O	,
O	or
O	imprint
O	a
O	hoof
O	tramp
O	in
O	the
O	sand
O	of
O	its
O	margin
O	,
O	he
O	alighted
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	stooping
O	his
O	wild
O	head
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	drink
O	.
O	he
O	drew
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	with
O	long
O	and
O	pleasant
O	sighs
O	,
O	and
O	tranquil
O	pauses
O	of
O	enjoyment
O	;
O	and
O	then
O	another
O	draught
O	,
O	and
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	another
O	.
O	for
O	,
O	nowhere
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	or
O	up
O	among
O	the
O	clouds
O	,
O	did
O	pegasus
O	love
O	any
O	water
O	as
O	he
O	loved
O	this
O	of
O	pirene
O	.
O	and
O	when
O	his
O	thirst
O	was
O	slaked
O	,
O	he
O	cropped
O	a
O	few
O	of
O	the
O	honey
O	blossoms
O	of
O	the
O	clover
O	,
O	delicately
O	tasting
O	them
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	caring
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	hearty
O	meal
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	herbage
O	just
O	beneath
O	the
O	clouds
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	lofty
O	sides
O	of
O	mount
O	helicon
O	,
O	suited
O	his
O	palate
O	better
O	than
O	this
O	ordinary
O	grass
O	.
O	after
O	thus
O	drinking
O	to
O	his
O	heart
O	'
O	s
O	content
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	dainty
O	fashion
O	condescending
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	little
O	food
O	,
O	the
O	winged
O	horse
O	began
O	to
O	caper
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	,
O	and
O	dance
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	mere
O	idleness
O	and
O	sport
O	.
O	there
O	never
O	was
O	a
O	more
O	playful
O	creature
O	made
O	than
O	this
O	very
O	pegasus
O	.
O	so
O	there
O	he
O	frisked
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	way
O	that
O	it
O	delights
O	me
O	to
O	think
O	about
O	,
O	fluttering
O	his
O	great
O	wings
O	as
O	lightly
O	as
O	ever
O	did
O	a
O	linnet
O	,
O	and
O	running
O	little
O	races
O	,
O	half
O	on
O	earth
O	and
O	half
O	in
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	i
O	know
O	not
O	whether
O	to
O	call
O	a
O	flight
O	or
O	a
O	gallop
O	.
O	when
O	a
O	creature
O	is
O	perfectly
O	able
O	to
O	fly
O	,
O	he
O	sometimes
O	chooses
O	to
O	run
O	,
O	just
O	for
O	the
O	pastime
O	of
O	the
O	thing
O	;
O	and
O	so
O	did
O	pegasus
O	,
O	although
O	it
O	cost
O	him
O	some
O	little
O	trouble
O	to
O	keep
O	his
O	hoofs
O	so
O	near
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	bellerophon
O	,
O	meanwhile
O	,
O	holding
O	the
O	child
O	'
O	s
O	hand
O	,
O	peeped
O	forth
O	from
O	the
O	shrubbery
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	that
O	never
O	was
O	any
O	sight
O	so
O	beautiful
O	as
O	this
O	,
O	nor
O	ever
O	a
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	eyes
O	so
O	wild
O	and
O	spirited
O	as
O	those
O	of
O	pegasus
O	.
O	it
O	seemed
O	a
O	sin
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	bridling
O	him
O	and
O	riding
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	.
O	once
O	or
O	twice
O	,
O	pegasus
O	stopped
O	,
O	and
O	snuffed
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	pricking
O	up
O	his
O	ears
O	,
O	tossing
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	turning
O	it
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	partly
O	suspected
O	some
O	mischief
O	or
O	other
O	.
O	seeing
O	nothing
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	and
O	hearing
O	no
O	sound
O	,
O	he
O	soon
O	began
O	his
O	antics
O	again
O	.
O	at
O	length
O	--
O	not
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	weary
O	,
O	but
O	only
O	idle
O	and
O	luxurious
O	--
O	pegasus
O	folded
O	his
O	wings
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	soft
O	green
O	turf
O	.
O	but
O	,
O	being
O	too
O	full
O	of
O	aërial
O	life
O	to
O	remain
O	quiet
O	for
O	many
O	moments
O	together
O	,
O	he
O	soon
O	rolled
O	over
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	four
O	slender
O	legs
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	.
O	it
O	was
O	beautiful
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	,
O	this
O	one
O	solitary
O	creature
O	,
O	whose
O	mate
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	created
O	,
O	but
O	who
O	needed
O	no
O	companion
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	living
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	hundred
O	years
O	,
O	was
O	as
O	happy
O	as
O	the
O	centuries
O	were
O	long
O	.
O	the
O	more
O	he
O	did
O	such
O	things
O	as
O	mortal
O	horses
O	are
O	accustomed
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	the
O	less
O	earthly
O	and
O	the
O	more
O	wonderful
O	he
O	seemed
O	.
O	bellerophon
O	and
O	the
O	child
O	almost
O	held
O	their
O	breaths
O	,
O	partly
O	from
O	a
O	delightful
O	awe
O	,
O	but
O	still
O	more
O	because
O	they
O	dreaded
O	lest
O	the
O	slightest
O	stir
O	or
O	murmur
O	should
O	send
O	him
O	up
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	speed
O	of
O	an
O	arrow
O	flight
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	farthest
O	blue
O	of
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	finally
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	had
O	enough
O	of
O	rolling
O	over
O	and
O	over
O	,
O	pegasus
O	turned
O	himself
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	indolently
O	,
O	like
O	any
O	other
O	horse
O	,
O	put
O	out
O	his
O	fore
O	legs
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	rise
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	;
O	and
O	bellerophon
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	guessed
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	do
O	so
O	,
O	darted
O	suddenly
O	from
O	the
O	thicket
O	,
O	and
O	leaped
O	astride
O	of
O	his
O	back
O	.
O	yes
O	,
O	there
O	he
O	sat
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	back
O	of
O	the
O	winged
O	horse
O	!
O	but
O	what
O	a
O	bound
O	did
O	pegasus
O	make
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	,
O	he
O	felt
O	the
O	weight
O	of
O	a
O	mortal
O	man
O	upon
O	his
O	loins
O	!
O	a
O	bound
O	,
O	indeed
O	!
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	time
O	to
O	draw
O	a
O	breath
O	bellerophon
O	found
O	himself
O	five
O	hundred
O	feet
O	aloft
O	,
O	and
O	still
O	shooting
O	upward
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	winged
O	horse
O	snorted
O	and
O	trembled
O	with
O	terror
O	and
O	anger
O	.
O	upward
O	he
O	went
O	,
O	up
O	,
O	up
O	,
O	up
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	plunged
O	into
O	the
O	cold
O	misty
O	bosom
O	of
O	a
O	cloud
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	,
O	only
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	before
O	,
O	bellerophon
O	had
O	been
O	gazing
O	,
O	and
O	fancying
O	it
O	a
O	very
O	pleasant
O	spot
O	.
O	then
O	again
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	cloud
O	,
O	pegasus
O	shot
O	down
O	like
O	a
O	thunderbolt
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	meant
O	to
O	dash
O	both
O	himself
O	and
O	his
O	rider
O	headlong
O	against
O	a
O	rock
O	.
O	then
O	he
O	went
O	through
O	about
O	a
O	thousand
O	of
O	the
O	wildest
O	caprioles
O	that
O	had
O	ever
O	been
O	performed
O	either
O	by
O	a
O	bird
O	or
O	a
O	horse
O	.
O	i
O	cannot
O	tell
O	you
O	half
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	.
O	he
O	skimmed
O	straight
O	forward
O	,
O	and
O	sideways
O	,
O	and
O	backward
O	.
O	he
O	reared
O	himself
O	erect
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	fore
O	legs
O	on
O	a
O	wreath
O	of
O	mist
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	hind
O	legs
O	on
O	nothing
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	he
O	flung
O	out
O	his
O	heels
O	behind
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	down
O	his
O	head
O	between
O	his
O	legs
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	wings
O	pointing
O	right
O	upward
O	.
O	at
O	about
O	two
O	miles
O	'
O	height
O	above
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	he
O	turned
O	a
O	somerset
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	bellerophon
O	'
O	s
O	heels
O	were
O	where
O	his
O	head
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	seemed
O	to
O	look
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	up
O	.
O	he
O	twisted
O	his
O	head
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	looking
O	bellerophon
O	in
O	the
O	face
O	,
O	with
O	fire
O	flashing
O	from
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	made
O	a
O	terrible
O	attempt
O	to
O	bite
O	him
O	.
O	he
O	fluttered
O	his
O	pinions
O	so
O	wildly
O	that
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	silver
O	feathers
O	was
O	shaken
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	floating
O	earthward
O	,
O	was
O	picked
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	child
O	,
O	who
O	kept
O	it
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	he
O	lived
O	,
O	in
O	memory
O	of
O	pegasus
O	and
O	bellerophon
O	.
O	but
O	the
O	latter
O	(
O	who
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	may
O	judge
O	,
O	was
O	as
O	good
O	a
O	horseman
O	as
O	ever
O	galloped
O	)
O	had
O	been
O	watching
O	his
O	opportunity
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	clapped
O	the
O	golden
O	bit
O	of
O	the
O	enchanted
O	bridle
O	between
O	the
O	winged
O	steed
O	'
O	s
O	jaws
O	.
O	no
O	sooner
O	was
O	this
O	done
O	,
O	than
O	pegasus
O	became
O	as
O	manageable
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	food
O	all
O	his
O	life
O	out
O	of
O	bellerophon
O	'
O	s
O	hand
O	.
O	to
O	speak
O	what
O	i
O	really
O	feel
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	almost
O	a
O	sadness
O	to
O	see
O	so
O	wild
O	a
O	creature
O	grow
O	suddenly
O	so
O	tame
O	.
O	and
O	pegasus
O	seemed
O	to
O	feel
O	it
O	so
O	,
O	likewise
O	.
O	he
O	looked
O	round
O	to
O	bellerophon
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	tears
O	in
O	his
O	beautiful
O	eyes
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	the
O	fire
O	that
O	so
O	recently
O	flashed
O	from
O	them
O	.
O	but
O	when
O	bellerophon
O	patted
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	spoke
O	a
O	few
O	authoritative
O	yet
O	kind

O	an
O	ugly
O	,

O	,

O	which

O	but
O	,

O	saw
O	something
O	that
O	induced
O	him
O	first
O	to
O	draw
O	the
O	bridle
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	turn
O	pegasus

O	.
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	winged
O	horse
O	understood
O	,
O	and
O	sunk
O	slowly
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	until
O	his
O	hoofs
O	were
O	scarcely
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	height
O	above
O	the
O	rocky

O	of

O	not

O	,
O	judging
O	by
O	their

O	,
O	one
O	of

O	was
O	a

O	snake
O	,
O	the

O	a

O	lion
O	,
O	and

O	the
