O	there
O	was
O	once
O	a
O	king
O	who
O	was
O	passionately
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	a
O	beautiful
O	princess
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	married
O	because
O	a
O	magician
O	had
O	enchanted
O	her
O	.
O	the
O	king
O	went
O	to
O	a
O	good
O	fairy
O	to
O	inquire
O	what
O	he
O	should
O	do
O	.
O	said
O	the
O	fairy
O	,
O	after
O	receiving
O	him
O	graciously
O	;
O	``
O	sir
O	,
O	i
O	will
O	tell
O	you
O	a
O	secret
O	.
O	the
O	princess
O	has
O	a
O	great
O	cat
O	whom
O	she
O	loves
O	so
O	well
O	that
O	she
O	cares
O	for
O	nothing
O	and
O	nobody
O	else
O	;
O	but
O	she
O	will
O	be
O	obliged
O	to
O	marry
O	any
O	person
O	who
O	is
O	adroit
O	enough
O	to
O	walk
O	upon
O	the
O	cat
O	'
O	s
O	tail
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	that
O	will
O	not
O	be
O	very
O	difficult
O	,
O	``
O	thought
O	the
O	king
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	departed
O	,
O	resolving
O	to
O	trample
O	the
O	cat
O	'
O	s
O	tail
O	to
O	pieces
O	rather
O	than
O	not
O	succeed
O	in
O	walking
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	he
O	went
O	immediately
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	his
O	fair
O	mistress
O	and
O	the
O	cat
O	;
O	the
O	animal
O	came
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	arching
O	its
O	back
O	in
O	anger
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	wont
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	the
O	king
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	foot
O	,
O	thinking
O	nothing
O	would
O	be
O	so
O	easy
O	as
O	to
O	tread
O	on
O	the
O	tail
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	mistaken
O	.
O	minon
O	--
O	that
O	was
O	the
O	creature
O	'
O	s
O	name
O	--
O	twisted
O	itself
O	round
O	so
O	sharply
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	only
O	hurt
O	his
O	own
O	foot
O	by
O	stamping
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	.
O	for
O	eight
O	days
O	did
O	he
O	pursue
O	the
O	cat
O	everywhere
O	:
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	palace
O	he
O	was
O	after
O	it
O	from
O	morning
O	till
O	night
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	no
O	better
O	success
O	;
O	the
O	tail
O	seemed
O	made
O	of
O	quicksilver
O	,
O	so
O	very
O	lively
O	was
O	it
O	.
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	fortune
O	to
O	catch
O	minon
O	sleeping
O	,
O	when
O	tramp
O	,

O	!
O	he
O	trod
O	on

O	minon
O	woke
O	up
O	,

O	horribly
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	changed
O	from

O	into
O	a
O	large
O	,

O	only
O	lived
O	a
O	few

O	after

O	all

O	,
O	that

O	when
O	he
O	was
O	old
O	enough
O	his
O	tutor
O	taught

O	history
O	;
O	and
O	whenever
O	any
O	great
O	king

O	was
O	referred
O	to
O	,
O	the

O	always
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	mention
O	that

O	or
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	long
O	nose
O	.
O	all
O	the
O	royal
O	apartments
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	pictures
O	and
O	portraits
O	having
O	this
O	peculiarity
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	at
O	last
O	prince
O	wish
O	began
O	to
O	regard
O	the
O	length
O	of

O	greatest
O	perfection

O	the
O	likenesses
O	of
O	many
O	princesses
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	one
O	he
O	preferred

O	princess
O	darling
O	,
O	daughter
O	of
O	a
O	powerful
O	monarch
O	and
O	heiress

O	,
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	prince
O	wish
O	,
O	the
O	courtiers
O	were
O	thrown
O	by
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	utmost
O	perplexity
O	.
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	laughing
O	at
O	all
O	small
O	noses
O	;
O	but

O	dared
O	they
O	make
O	fun
O	of
O	the
O	nose

O	darling
O	?
O	two
O	unfortunate
O	gentlemen
O	,
O	whom
O	prince

O	overheard
O	doing
O	so

O	were
O	ignominiously
O	banished

O	the
O	court
O	and

O	.
O	after
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	courtiers
O	became
O	alarmed
O	,
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	correct
O	their
O	habit
O	of
O	speech
O	;
O	but
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	found
O	themselves
O	in
O	constant
O	difficulties
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	one
O	clever
O	person
O	struck
O	out
O	a
O	bright
O	idea
O	.
O	he
O	said

O	indispensably
O	necessary
O	for
O	a
O	man
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	great
O	nose
O	,
O	women
O	were
O	different
O	;
O	and
O	that
O	a
O	learned
O	man
O	had
O	discovered
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	old
O	manuscript
O	that
O	the
O	celebrated
O	cleopatra
O	,
O	queen
O	of
O	egypt
O	,
O	the
O	beauty
O	of
O	the
O	ancient
O	world

O	a
O	turned-up
O	nose
O	.
O	at
O	this
O	information
O	prince
O	wish

O	so
O	delighted
O	that
O	he
O	made
O	the
O	courtier
O	a
O	very
O	handsome
O	present
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	sent
O	off
O	ambassadors
O	to
O	demand
O	princess
O	darling
O	in
O	marriage
O	.
O	she
O	accepted
O	his
O	offer
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	returned
O	with
O	the
O	ambassadors
O	.
O	he
O	made
O	all
O	haste
O	to
O	meet
O	and
O	welcome
O	her
O	;
O	but
O	when

O	was
O	only
O	three
O	leagues
O	distant
O	from

O	capital
O	,
O	before

O	had
O	time
O	even
O	to
O	kiss
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	the
O	magician
O	who
O	had
O	once
O	assumed
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	cat
O	,
O	minon
O	,
O	appeared
O	in
O	the

O	carried
O	her
O	off
O	before

O	very

O	.
O	prince
O	wish
O	,
O	almost
O	beside
O	himself
O	with
O	grief
O	,
O	declared
O	that

O	induce
O	him
O	to

O	throne

O	follow
O	him
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	bidding
O	them
O	all
O	adieu
O	,
O	mounted
O	a

O	laid
O	the
