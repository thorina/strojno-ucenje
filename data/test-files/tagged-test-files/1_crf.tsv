C	Once
C	there
C	was
C	a
C	royal
C	couple
C	who
C	grieved
C	excessively
C	because
C	they
C	had
C	no
C	children
C	.
C	When
C	at
C	last
C	,
C	after
C	long
C	waiting
C	,
C	the
C	queen
C	presented
C	her
C	husband
C	with
C	a
C	little
C	daughter
C	,
C	his
C	majesty
C	showed
C	his
C	joy
C	by
C	giving
C	a
C	christening
C	feast
C	,
C	so
C	grand
C	that
C	the
C	like
C	of
C	it
C	was
C	never
C	known
C	.
C	He
C	invited
C	all
C	the
C	fairies
C	in
C	the
C	land
C	--
C	there
C	were
C	seven
C	altogether
C	--
C	to
C	stand
C	godmothers
C	to
C	the
C	little
C	princess
C	;
C	hoping
C	that
C	each
C	might
C	bestow
C	on
C	her
C	some
C	good
C	gift
C	,
C	as
C	was
C	the
C	custom
C	of
C	good
C	fairies
C	in
C	those
C	days
C	.
C	After
C	the
C	ceremony
C	,
C	all
C	the
C	guests
C	returned
C	to
C	the
C	palace
C	,
C	where
C	there
C	was
C	set
C	before
C	each
C	fairy
C	-
C	godmother
C	a
C	magnificent
C	covered
C	dish
C	,
C	with
C	an
C	embroidered
C	table
C	-
C	napkin
C	,
C	and
C	a
C	knife
C	and
C	fork
C	of
C	pure
C	gold
C	,
C	studded
C	with
C	diamonds
C	and
C	rubies
C	.
C	But
C	alas
C	!
C	as
C	they
C	placed
C	themselves
C	at
C	table
C	,
C	there
C	entered
C	an
C	old
C	fairy
C	who
C	had
C	never
C	been
C	invited
C	,
C	because
C	more
C	than
C	fifty
C	years
C	since
C	she
C	had
C	left
C	the
C	king
C	'
C	s
C	dominion
C	on
C	a
C	tour
C	of
C	pleasure
C	,
C	and
C	had
C	not
C	been
C	heard
C	of
C	until
C	this
C	day
C	.
C	His
C	majesty
C	,
C	much
C	troubled
C	,
C	desired
C	a
C	cover
C	to
C	be
C	placed
C	for
C	her
C	,
C	but
C	it
C	was
C	of
C	common
C	delf
C	,
C	for
C	he
C	had
C	ordered
C	from
C	his
C	jeweller
C	only
C	seven
C	gold
C	dishes
C	for
C	the
C	seven
C	fairies
C	aforesaid
C	.
C	The
C	elderly
C	fairy
C	thought
C	herself
C	neglected
C	,
C	and
C	muttered
C	angry
C	menaces
C	,
C	which
C	were
C	overheard
C	by
C	one
C	of
C	the
C	younger
C	fairies
C	,
C	who
C	chanced
C	to
C	sit
C	beside
C	her
C	.
C	This
C	good
C	godmother
C	,
C	afraid
C	of
C	harm
C	to
C	the
C	pretty
C	baby
C	,
C	hastened
C	to
C	hide
C	herself
C	behind
C	the
C	tapestry
C	in
C	the
C	hall
C	.
C	She
C	did
C	this
C	,
C	because
C	she
C	wished
C	all
C	the
C	others
C	to
C	speak
C	first
C	--
C	so
C	that
C	if
C	any
C	ill
C	gift
C	were
C	bestowed
C	on
C	the
C	child
C	,
C	she
C	might
C	be
C	able
C	to
C	counteract
C	it
C	.
C	The
C	six
C	now
C	offered
C	their
C	good
C	wishes
C	--
C	which
C	,
C	unlike
C	most
C	wishes
C	,
C	were
C	sure
C	to
C	come
C	true
C	.
C	The
C	fortunate
C	little
C	princess
C	was
C	to
C	grow
C	up
C	the
C	fairest
C	woman
C	in
C	the
C	world
C	;
C	to
C	have
C	a
C	temper
C	sweet
C	as
C	an
C	angel
C	;
C	to
C	be
C	perfectly
C	graceful
C	and
C	gracious
C	;
C	to
C	sing
C	like
C	a
C	nightingale
C	;
C	to
C	dance
C	like
C	a
C	leaf
C	on
C	a
C	tree
C	;
C	and
C	to
C	possess
C	every
C	accomplishment
C	under
C	the
C	sun
C	.
C	Then
C	the
C	old
C	fairy
C	'
C	s
C	turn
C	came
C	.
C	Shaking
C	her
C	head
C	spitefully
C	,
C	she
C	uttered
C	the
C	wish
C	that
C	when
C	the
C	baby
C	grew
C	up
C	into
C	a
C	young
C	lady
C	,
C	and
C	learned
C	to
C	spin
C	,
C	she
C	might
C	prick
C	her
C	finger
C	with
C	the
C	spindle
C	and
C	die
C	of
C	the
C	wound
C	.
C	At
C	this
C	terrible
C	prophecy
C	all
C	the
C	guests
C	shuddered
C	;
C	and
C	some
C	of
C	the
C	more
C	tender
C	-
C	hearted
C	began
C	to
C	weep
C	.
C	The
C	lately
C	happy
C	parents
C	were
C	almost
C	out
C	of
C	their
C	wits
C	with
C	grief
C	.
C	Upon
C	which
C	the
C	wise
C	young

C	appeared
C	from
C	behind

C	a
C	wood
C	so
C	thick
C	and
C	thorny
C	that
C	neither
C	beasts
C	nor
C	men
C	could
C	attempt
C	to
C	penetrate
C	there
C	.
C	Above
C	this
C	dense
C	mass
C	of
C	forest
C	could
C	only
C	be
C	perceived
C	the
C	top
C	of
C	the
C	high
C	tower
C	where
C	the
C	lovely
C	princess
C	slept
C	.
C	A
C	great
C	many
C	changes
C	happen
C	in
C	a
C	hundred
C	years
C	.
C	The
C	king
C	,
C	who
C	never
C	had
C	a
C	second
C	child
C	,
C	died
C	,
C	and
C	his
C	throne
C	passed
C	into
C	another
C	royal
C	family
C	.
C	So
C	entirely
C	was
C	the
C	story
C	of
C	the
C	poor
C	princess
C	forgotten
C	,
C	that
C	when
C	the
C	reigning
C	king
C	'
C	s
C	son
C	,
C	being
C	one
C	day
C	out
C	hunting
C	and
C	stopped
C	in
C	the
C	chase
C	by
C	this
C	formidable
C	wood
C	,
C	inquired
C	what
C	wood
C	it
C	was
C	and
C	what
C	were
C	those
C	towers
C	which
C	he
C	saw
C	appearing
C	out
C	of
C	the
C	midst
C	of
C	it
C	,
C	no
C	one
C	could
C	answer
C	him
C	.
C	At
C	length
C	an
C	old
C	peasant
C	was
C	found
C	who
C	remembered
C	having
C	heard
C	his
C	grandfather
C	say
C	to
C	his
C	father
C	,
C	that
C	in
C	this
C	tower
C	was
C	a
C	princess
C	,
C	beautiful
C	as
C	the
C	day
C	,
C	who
C	was
C	doomed
C	to
C	sleep
C	there
C	for
C	one
C	hundred
C	years
C	,
C	until
C	awakened
C	by
C	a
C	king
C	'
C	s
C	son
C	,
C	her
C	destined
C	bridegroom
C	.
C	At
C	this
C	,
C	the
C	young
C	prince
C	,
C	who
C	had
C	the
C	spirit
C	of
C	a
C	hero
C	,
C	determined
C	to
C	find
C	out
C	the
C	truth
C	for
C	himself
C	.
C	Spurred
C	on
C	by
C	both
C	generosity
C	and
C	curiosity
C	,
C	he
C	leaped
C	from
C	his
C	horse
C	and
C	began
C	to
C	force
C	his
C	way
C	through
C	the
C	thick
C	wood
C	.
C	To
C	his
C	amazement
C	the
C	stiff
C	branches
C	all
C	gave
C	way
C	,
C	and
C	the
C	ugly
C	thorns
C	sheathed
C	themselves
C	of
C	their
C	own
C	accord
C	,
C	and
C	the
C	brambles
C	buried
C	themselves
C	in
C	the
C	earth
C	to
C	let
C	him
C	pass
C	.
C	This
C	done
C	,
C	they
C	closed
C	behind
C	him
C	,
C	allowing
C	none
C	of
C	his
C	suite
C	to
C	follow
C	:
C	but
C	,
C	ardent
C	and
C	young
C	,
C	he
C	went
C	boldly
C	on
C	alone
C	.
C	The
C	first
C	thing
C	he
C	saw
C	was
C	enough
C	to
C	smite
C	him
C	with
C	fear
C	.
C	Bodies
C	of
C	men
C	and
C	horses
C	lay
C	extended
C	on
C	the
C	ground
C	;
C	but
C	the
C	men
C	had
C	faces
C	,
C	not
C	death
C	-
C	white
C	,
C	but
C	red
C	as
C	peonies
C	,
C	and
C	beside
C	them
C	were
C	glasses
C	half
C	filled
C	with
C	wine
C	,
C	showing
C	that
C	they
C	had
C	gone
C	to
C	sleep
C	drinking
C	.
C	Next
C	he
C	entered
C	a
C	large
C	court
C	,
C	paved
C	with
C	marble
C	,
C	where
C	stood
C	rows
C	of
C	guards
C	presenting
C	arms
C	,
C	but
C	motionless
C	as
C	if
C	cut
C	out
C	of
C	stone
C	;
C	then
C	he
C	passed
C	through
C	many
C	chambers
C	where
C	gentlemen
C	and
C	ladies
C	,
C	all
C	in
C	the
C	costume
C	of
C	the
C	past
C	century
C	,
C	slept
C	at
C	their
C	ease
C	,
C	some
C	standing
C	,
C	some
C	sitting
C	.
C	The
C	pages
C	were
C	lurking
C	in
C	corners
C	,
C	the
C	ladies
C	of
C	honour
C	were
C	stooping
C	over
C	their
C	embroidery
C	frames
C	,
C	or
C	listening
C	apparently
C	with
C	polite
C	attention
C	to
C	the
C	gentlemen
C	of
C	the
C	court
C	,
C	but
C	all
C	were
C	as
C	silent
C	as
C	statues
C	and
C	as
C	immoveable
C	.
C	Their
C	clothes
C	,
C	strange
C	to
C	say
C	,
C	were
C	fresh
C	and
C	new
C	as
C	ever
C	:
C	and
C	not
C	a
C	particle
C	of
C	dust
C	or
C	spider
C	-
C	web
C	had
C	gathered
C	over
C	the
C	furniture
C	,
C	though
C	it
C	had
C	not
C	known
C	a
C	broom
C	for
C	a
C	hundred
C	years
C	.
C	Finally
C	the
C	astonished
C	prince
C	came
C	to
C	an
C	inner
C	chamber
C	,
C	where
C	was
C	the
C	fairest
C	sight
C	his
C	eyes
C	had
C	ever
C	beheld
C	.
C	A
C	young
C	girl
C	of
C	wonderful
C	beauty
C	lay
C	asleep
C	on
C	an
C	embroidered
C	bed
C	,
C	and
C	she
C	looked
C	as
C	if
C	she
C	had
C	only
C	just
C	closed
C	her
C	eyes
C	.
C	Trembling
C	,
C	the
C	prince
C	approached
C	and
C	knelt
C	beside
C	her
C	.
C	Some
C	say
C	he
C	kissed
C	her
C	,
C	but
C	as
C	nobody
C	saw
C	it
C	,
C	and
C	she
C	never
C	told
C	,
C	we
C	cannot
C	be
C	quite
C	sure
C	of
C	the
C	fact
C	.
C	However
C	,
C	as
C	the
C	end
C	of
C	the
C	enchantment
C	had
C	come
C	,
C	the
C	princess
C	awakened
C	at
C	once
C	,
C	and
C	looking
C	at
C	him
C	with
C	eyes
C	of
C	the
C	tenderest
C	regard
C	,
C	said
C	drowsily
C	,
C	""""
C	Is
C	it
C	you
C	,
C	my
C	prince
C	?
C	I
C	have
C	waited
C	for
C	you
C	very
C	long
C	.
C	""""
C	Charmed
C	with
C	these
C	words
C	,
C	and
C	still
C	more
C	with
C	the
C	tone
C	in
C	which
C	they
C	were
C	uttered
C	,
C	the
C	prince
C	assured
C	her
C	that
C	he
C	loved
C	her
C	more
C	than
C	his
C	life
C	.
C	Nevertheless
C	,
C	he
C	was
C	the
C	most
C	embarrassed
C	of
C	the
C	two
C	;
C	for
C	,
C	thanks
C	to
C	the
C	kind
C	fairy
C	,
C	the
C	princess
C	had
C	plenty
C	of
C	time
C	to
C	dream
C	of
C	him
C	during
C	her
C	century
C	of
C	slumber
C	,
C	while
C	he
C	had
C	never
C	even
C	heard
C	of
C	her
C	till
C	an
C	hour
C	before
C	.
C	For
C	a
C	long
C	time
C	did
C	they
C	sit
C	conversing
C	,
C	and
C	yet
C	had
C	not
C	said
C	half
C	enough
C	.
C	Their
C	only
C	interruption
C	was
C	the
C	little
C	dog
C	Puffy
C	,
C	who
C	had
C	awakened
C	with
C	his
C	mistress
C	,
C	and
C	now
C	began
C	to
C	be
C	exceedingly
C	jealous
C	that
C	the
C	princess
C	did
C	not
C	notice
C	him
C	as
C	much
C	as
C	she
C	was
C	wont
C	to
C	do
C	.
C	Meantime
C	all
C	the
C	attendants
C	,
C	whose
C	enchantment
C	was
C	also
C	broken
C	,
C	not
C	being
C	in
C	love
C	,
C	were
C	ready
C	to
C	die
C	of
C	hunger
C	after
C	their
C	fast
C	of
C	a
C	hundred
C	years
C	.
C	A
C	lady
C	of
C	honour
C	ventured
C	to
C	intimate
C	that
C	dinner
C	was
C	served
C	;
C	whereupon
C	the
C	prince
C	handed
C	his
C	beloved
C	princess
C	at
C	once
C	to
C	the
C	great
C	hall
C	.
C	She
C	did
C	not
C	wait
C	to
C	dress
C	for
C	dinner
C	,
C	being
C	already
C	perfectly
C	and
C	magnificently
C	attired
C	,
C	though
C	in
C	a
C	fashion
C	somewhat
C	out
C	of
C	date
C	.
C	However
C	,
C	her
C	lover
C	had
C	the
C	politeness
C	not
C	to
C	notice
C	this
C	,
C	nor
C	to
C	remind
C	her
C	that
C	she
C	was
C	dressed
C	exactly
C	like
C	her
C	royal
C	grandmother
C	,
C	whose
C	portrait
C	still
C	hung
C	on
C	the
C	palace
C	walls
C	.
C	During
C	the
C	banquet
C	a
C	concert
C	took
C	place
C	by
C	the
C	attendant
C	musicians
C	,
C	and
C	considering
C	they
C	had
C	not
C	touched
C	their
C	instruments
C	for
C	a
C	century
C	they
C	played
C	extremely
C	well
C	.
C	They
C	ended
C	with
C	a
C	wedding
C	march
C	:
C	for
C	that
C	very
C	evening
C	the
C	marriage
C	of
C	the
C	prince
C	and
C	princess
C	was
C	celebrated
C	,
C	and
C	though
C	the
C	bride
C	was
C	nearly
C	one
C	hundred
C	years
C	older
C	than
C	the
C	bridegroom
C	,
C	it
C	is
C	remarkable
C	that
C	the
C	fact
C	would
C	never
C	have
C	been
C	discovered
C	by
C	any
C	one
C	unacquainted
C	therewith
C	.
C	After
C	a
C	few
C	days
C	they
C	went
C	together
C	out
C	of
C	the
C	castle
C	and
C	enchanted
C	wood
C	,
C	both
C	of
C	which
C	immediately
C	vanished
C	,
C	and
C	were
C	never
C	more
C	beheld
C	by
C	mortal
C	eyes
C	.
C	The
C	princess
C	was
C	restored
C	to
C	her
C	ancestral
C	kingdom
C	,
C	but
C	it
C	was
C	not
C	generally
C	declared
C	who
C	she
C	was
C	,
C	as
C	during
C	a
C	hundred
C	years
C	people
C	had
C	grown
C	so
C	very
C	much
C	cleverer
C	that
C	nobody
C	then
C	living
C	would
C	ever
C	have
C	believed
C	the
C	story
C	.
C	So
C	nothing
C	was
C	explained
C	,
C	and
C	nobody
C	presumed
C	to
C	ask
C	any
C	questions
C	about
C	her
C	,
C	for
C	ought
C	not
C	a
C	prince
C	be
C	able
C	to
C	marry
C	whomsoever
C	he
C	pleases
C	?
C	Nor
C	--
C	whether
C	or
C	not
C	the
C	day
C	of
C	fairies
C	was
C	over
C	--
C	did
C	the
C	princess
C	ever
C	see
C	anything
C	further
C	of
C	her
C	seven
C	godmothers
C	.
C	She
C	lived
C	a
C	long
C	and
C	happy
C	life
C	,
C	like
C	any
C	other
C	ordinary
C	woman
C	,
C	and
C	died
C	at
C	length
C	,
C	beloved
C	,
C	regretted
C	,
C	but
C	,
C	the
C	prince
C	being
C	already
C	no
C	more
C	,
C	perfectly
C	contented
C	.
