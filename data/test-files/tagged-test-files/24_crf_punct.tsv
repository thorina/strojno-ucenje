O	In
O	times
O	of
O	yore
O	,
O	when
O	wishes
O	were
O	both
O	heard
O	and
O	granted
O	,
O	lived
O	a
C	king
O	whose
O	daughters
O	were
O	all
O	beautiful
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	youngest
O	was
O	so
O	lovely
O	that
O	the
O	sun
O	himself
O	,
O	who
O	has
O	seen
O	so
O	much
O	,
O	wondered
O	at
O	her
O	beauty
O	every
O	time
O	he
O	looked
O	in
O	her
O	face
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	near
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	castle
O	was
O	a
O	large
O	dark
O	forest
O	;
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	under
O	an
O	old
O	linden-tree
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	deep
O	well
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	day
O	was
O	very
O	hot
O	,
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	used
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	seat
O	herself
O	at
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	cool
O	well
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	became
O	wearied
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	take
O	a
O	golden
O	ball
O	,
O	throw
O	it
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	catch
O	it
O	again
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	her
O	favourite
O	amusement
O	.
O	Once
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	her
O	golden
O	ball
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	falling
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	little
O	hand
O	that
O	she
O	stretched
O	out
O	for
O	it
O	,
O	dropped
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	rolled
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	The
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	followed
O	it
O	with
O	her
O	eyes
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	ball
O	had
O	vanished
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	well
O	was
O	so
O	deep
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	could
O	see
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	,
O	wept
O	louder
O	and
O	louder
O	every
O	minute
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	console
O	herself
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	While
O	she
O	was
O	thus
O	lamenting
O	some
O	one
O	called
O	to
O	her
O	:
O	``
O	What

O	looked
O	around
O	to
O	see
O	whence
O	the
O	voice
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	frog

O	At

O	release
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	enchantment
O	and
O	take
O	him
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	well
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	a
O	carriage
O	drove
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	palace-gates
O	with
O	eight
O	white
O	horses
O	,
O	having
O	white
O	feathers
O	on
O	their
O	heads
O	and
O	golden
O	reins
O	.
O	Behind
O	it
O	stood
O	the
C	servant
O	of
O	the
O	young
C	prince
O	,
O	called
O	the
C	Faithful
C	Henry
O	.
O	This
O	faithful
O	Henry
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	grieved
O	when
O	his
O	master
O	was
O	changed
O	into
O	a
O	frog
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	compelled
O	to
O	have
O	three
O	iron
O	bands
O	fastened
O	round
O	his
O	heart
O	,
O	lest
O	it
O	should
O	break
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	carriage
O	came
O	to
O	convey
O	the
C	prince
O	to
O	his
O	kingdom
O	,
O	so
O	the
O	faithful
O	Henry
O	lifted
O	in
O	the
O	bride
O	and
O	bridegroom
O	,
O	and
O	mounted
O	behind
O	,
O	full
O	of
O	joy
O	at
O	his
O	lord
O	'
O	s
O	release
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	gone
O	a
O	short
O	distance
O	,
O	the
C	prince
O	heard
O	behind
O	him
O	a
O	noise
O	as
O	if
O	something
O	was
O	breaking
O	.
O	He
O	turned
O	round
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	out
O	,
O	``
O	Henry
O	,
O	the
O	carriage
O	is
O	breaking
O	!
O	``
O	But
O	Henry
O	replied
O	:
O	``
O	No
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	the
O	carriage
O	,
O	but
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	bands
O	from
O	my
O	heart
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	bind
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	or
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	broken
O	with
O	grief
O	,
O	while
O	you
O	sat
O	as
O	a
O	frog
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	well
O	.
O	``
O	Twice
O	again
O	this
O	happened
O	,
O	and
O	the
C	prince
O	always
O	thought
O	the
O	carriage
O	was
O	breaking
O	;
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	the
O	bands
O	breaking
O	off
O	from
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	faithful
O	Henry
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	joy
O	that
O	his
O	lord
O	the
O	Frog-Prince
O	was
O	a
O	frog
O	no
O	more
O	.
