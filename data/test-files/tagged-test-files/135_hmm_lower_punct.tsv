O	the

O	left
O	their

O	drank
O	a

O	thus
O	he
O	sent
O	for
O	cathbad
O	the

O	,
O	who
O	was
O	even
O	then
O	very
O	near

O	so
O	by
O	his
O	magic
O	cathbad
O	raised
O	a

O	shields
O	,
O	burst
O	suddenly
O	forth
O	from
O	the
O	blazing
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	a
O	way
O	for
O	themselves
O	through
O	the
O	hedge
O	as
O	though
O	they
O	sheared
O	green

O	.
O	and
O	,
O	laughing
O	aloud
O	,
O	they
O	took
O	a
O	terrible
O	toll
O	of

O	from
O	the
O	ultonians
O	who
O	would
O	have

O	then
O	again
O	the
O	druid
O	put
O	forth
O	his
O	power
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	noise
O	like
O	the

O	of

O	so
O	suddenly
O	the

O	then
O	suddenly
O	as

O	,
O	the
O	flood
O	abated

O	on
O	a
