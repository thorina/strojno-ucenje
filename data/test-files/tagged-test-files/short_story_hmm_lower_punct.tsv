O	once
O	when
O	a
O	lion
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	of
O	the
O	jungle
O	,
O	was
O	asleep
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	mouse
O	began
O	running
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	on
O	him
O	.
O	this
O	soon
O	awakened
O	the
O	lion
O	,
O	who
O	placed
O	his
O	huge
O	paw
O	on
O	the
O	mouse
O	,
O	and
O	opened
O	his
O	big
O	jaws
O	to
O	swallow
O	him
O	.
O	``
O	pardon
O	,
O	o
O	king
O	!
O	``
O	cried
O	the
O	little
O	mouse
O	,
O	``
O	forgive
O	me
O	this
O	time
O	.
O	i
O	shall
O	never
O	repeat
O	it
O	and
O	i
O	shall
O	never
O	forget
O	your
O	kindness
O	.
O	and
O	who
O	knows
O	,
O	i
O	may
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	do
O	you
O	a
O	good
O	turn
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	days
O	!
O	”
O	the
O	lion
O	was
O	so
O	tickled
O	by
O	the
O	idea
O	of
O	the
O	mouse
O	being
O	able
O	to
O	help
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	lifted
O	his
O	paw
O	and
O	let
O	him
O	go
O	.
O	sometime
O	later
O	,
O	a
O	few
O	hunters
O	captured
O	the
O	lion
O	,
O	and
O	tied
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	tree
O	.
O	after
O	that
O	they
O	went
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	a
O	wagon
O	,
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	zoo
O	.
O	just
O	then
O	the
O	little
O	mouse
O	happened
O	to
O	pass
O	by
O	.
O	on
O	seeing
O	the
O	lion’s
O	plight
O	,
O	he
O	ran
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	gnawed
O	away
O	the
O	ropes
O	that
O	bound
O	him
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	of
O	the
O	jungle
O	.
O	``
O	was
O	i
O	not
O	right
O	?
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	little
O	mouse
O	,
O	very
O	happy
O	to
O	help
O	the
O	lion
O	.
