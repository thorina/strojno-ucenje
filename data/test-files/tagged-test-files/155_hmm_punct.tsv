O	other
O	child
O	'
O	s
O	door
O	,
O	where
O	Pandora
O	would
O	never
O	have
O	set
O	eyes
O	on
O	it
O	.
O	So
O	perseveringly
O	as
O	did
O	she
O	babble
O	about
O	this
O	one
O	thing
O	!
O	The
O	box
O	,
O	the
O	box
O	,
O	and
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	box
O	!
O	It
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	box
O	were
O	bewitched
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	cottage
O	were
O	not
O	big
O	enough
O	to
O	hold
O	it
O	,
O	without
O	Pandora
O	'
O	s
O	continually
O	stumbling
O	over
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	Epimetheus
O	stumble
O	over
O	it
O	likewise
O	,
O	and
O	bruising
O	all
O	four
O	of
O	their
O	shins
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	really
O	hard
O	that
O	poor
O	Epimetheus
O	should
O	have
O	a
O	box
O	in
O	his
O	ears
O	from
O	morning
O	till
O	night
O	;
O	especially
O	as
O	the
O	little
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	were
O	so
O	unaccustomed
O	to
O	vexations
O	,
O	in
O	those
O	happy
O	days
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	knew
O	not
O	how
O	to
O	deal
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	a
O	small
O	vexation
O	made
O	as
O	much
O	disturbance
O	then
O	as
O	a
O	far
O	bigger
O	one
O	would
O	in
O	our
O	own
O	times
O	.
O	After
O	Epimetheus
O	was
O	gone
O	,
O	Pandora
O	stood
O	gazing
O	at
O	the
O	box
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	called
O	it
O	ugly
O	,
O	above
O	a
O	hundred
O	times
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	all
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	said
O	against
O	it
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	positively
O	a
O	very
O	handsome
O	article
O	of
O	furniture
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	quite
O	an
O	ornament
O	to
O	any
O	room
O	in
O	which
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	placed
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	made
O	of
O	a
O	beautiful
O	kind
O	of
O	wood
O	,
O	with
O	dark
O	and
O	rich
O	veins
O	spreading
O	over
O	its
O	surface
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	so
O	highly
O	polished
O	that
O	little
O	Pandora
O	could
O	see
O	her
O	face
O	in
O	it
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	child
O	had
O	no
O	other
O	looking
O	glass
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	odd
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	value
O	the
O	box
O	,
O	merely
O	on
O	this
O	account
O	.
O	The
O	edges
O	and
O	corners
O	of
O	the
O	box
O	were
O	carved
O	with
O	most
O	wonderful
O	skill
O	.
O	Around
O	the
O	margin
O	there
O	were
O	figures
O	of
O	graceful
O	men
O	and
O	women
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	prettiest
O	children
O	ever
O	seen
O	,
O	reclining
O	or
O	sporting
O	amid
O	a
O	profusion
O	of
O	flowers
O	and
O	foliage
O	;
O	and
O	these
O	various
O	objects
O	were
O	so
O	exquisitely
O	represented
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	wrought
O	together
O	in
O	such
O	harmony
O	,
O	that
O	flowers
O	,
O	foliage
O	,
O	and
O	human
O	beings
O	seemed
O	to
O	combine
O	into
O	a
O	wreath
O	of
O	mingled
O	beauty
O	.
O	But
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	peeping
O	forth
O	from
O	behind
O	the
O	carved
O	foliage
O	,
O	Pandora
O	once
O	or
O	twice
O	fancied
O	that
O	she
O	saw
O	a
O	face
O	not
O	so
O	lovely
O	,
O	or
O	something
O	or
O	other
O	that
O	was
O	disagreeable
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	stole
O	the
O	beauty
O	out
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	on
O	looking
O	more
O	closely
O	,
O	and
O	touching
O	the
O	spot
O	with
O	her
O	finger
O	,
O	she
O	could
O	discover
O	nothing
O	of
O	the
O	kind
O	.
O	Some
O	face
O	that
O	was
O	really
O	beautiful
O	had
O	been
O	made
O	to
O	look
O	ugly
O	by
O	her
O	catching
O	a
O	sideway
O	glimpse
O	at
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	most
O	beautiful
O	face
O	of
O	all
O	was
O	done
O	in
O	what
O	is
O	called
O	high
O	relief
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	of
O	the
O	lid
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	nothing
O	else
O	,
O	save
O	the
O	dark
O	,
O	smooth
O	richness
O	of
O	the
O	polished
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	one
O	face
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	garland
O	of
O	flowers
O	about
O	its
O	brow
O	.
O	Pandora
O	had
O	looked
O	at
O	this
O	face
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	times
O	,
O	and
O	imagined
O	that
O	the
O	mouth
O	could
O	smile
O	if
O	it
O	liked
O	,
O	or
O	be
O	grave
O	when
O	it
O	chose
O	,
O	the
O	same
O	as
O	any
O	living
O	mouth
O	.
O	The
O	features
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	all
O	wore
O	a
O	very
O	lively
O	and
O	rather
O	mischievous
O	expression
O	,
O	which
O	looked
O	almost
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	needs
O	must
O	burst
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	carved
O	lips
O	,
O	and
O	utter
O	itself
O	in
O	words
O	.
O	Had
O	the
O	mouth
O	spoken
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	probably
O	have
O	been
O	something
O	like
O	this
O	:
O	``
O	Do
O	not
O	be
O	afraid
O	,
O	Pandora
O	!
O	What
O	harm
O	can
O	there
O	be
O	in
O	opening
O	the
O	box
O	?
O	Never
O	mind
O	that
O	poor
O	,
O	simple
O	Epimetheus
O	!
O	You
O	are
O	wiser
O	than
O	he
O	,
O	and
O	have
O	ten
O	times
O	as
O	much
O	spirit
O	.
O	Open
O	the
O	box
O	,
O	and
O	see
O	if
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	find
O	something
O	very
O	pretty
O	!
O	``
O	The
O	box
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	almost
O	forgotten
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	was
O	fastened
O	;
O	not
O	by
O	a
O	lock
O	,
O	nor
O	by
O	any
O	other
O	such
O	contrivance
O	,
O	but
O	by
O	a
O	very
O	intricate
O	knot
O	of
O	gold
O	cord
O	.
O	There
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	no
O	end
O	to
O	this
O	knot
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	beginning
O	.
O	Never
O	was
O	a
O	knot
O	so
O	cunningly
O	twisted
O	,
O	nor
O	with
O	so
O	many
O	ins
O	and
O	outs
O	,
O	which
O	roguishly
O	defied
O	the
O	skilfullest
O	fingers
O	to
O	disentangle
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	yet
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	very
O	difficulty
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	Pandora
O	was
O	the
O	more
O	tempted
O	to
O	examine
O	the
O	knot
O	,
O	and
O	just
O	see
O	how
O	it
O	was
O	made
O	.
O	Two
O	or
O	three
O	times
O	,
O	already
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	stooped
O	over
O	the
O	box
O	,
O	and
O	taken
O	the
O	knot
O	between
O	her
O	thumb
O	and
O	forefinger
O	,
O	but
O	without
O	positively
O	trying
O	to
O	undo
O	it
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	really
O	believe

O	said
O	she
O	to
O	herself

O	``
O	that
O	I
O	begin

O	Nay
O	,
O	perhaps
O	I
O	could
O	tie
O	it
O	up
O	again
O	,
O	after
O	undoing
O	it
O	.
O	There
O	would
O	be
O	no

O	in
O	that
O	,
O	surely
O	.
O	Even
O	Epimetheus
O	would
O	not
O	blame
O	me
O	for

O	No

O	Only
O	,
O	if

O	peep
O	!
O	I
O	know
O	not
O	whether
O	Pandora
O	expected
O	any
O	toys
O	;
O	for
O	none
O	had
O	yet
O	begun
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	,
O	probably
O	,
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	world
O	itself
O	was
O	one
O	great
O	plaything
O	for
O	the
O	children
O	that
O	dwelt
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	Pandora
O	was
O	convinced
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	something
O	very
O	beautiful
O	and
O	valuable
O	in
O	the
O	box
O	;
O	and
O	therefore
O	she
O	felt
O	just
O	as
O	anxious
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	peep
O	as
O	any
O	of
O	these
O	little
O	girls
O	,
O	here
O	around
O	me
O	,
O	would
O	have
O	felt
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	possibly
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	so
O	;
O	but
O	of
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	quite
O	so
O	certain
O	.
O	On
O	this
O	particular
O	day
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	have
O	so
O	long
O	been
O	talking
O	about
O	her
O	curiosity
O	grew
O	so
O	much
O	greater
O	than
O	it
O	usually
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	she
O	approached
O	the
O	box
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	more
O	than
O	half
O	determined
O	to
O	open
O	it
O	,
O	if
O	she
O	could
O	.
O	Ah
O	,
O	naughty
O	Pandora
O	!
O	First
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	she
O	tried
O	to
O	lift
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	heavy
O	;
O	quite
O	too
O	heavy
O	for
O	the
O	slender
O	strength
O	of
O	a
O	child
O	like
O	Pandora
O	.
O	She
O	raised
O	one
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	box
O	a
O	few
O	inches
O	from
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	it
O	fall
O	again
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	pretty
O	loud
O	thump
O	.
O	A
O	moment
O	afterward
O	,
O	she
O	almost
O	fancied
O	that
O	she
O	heard
O	something
O	stir
O	inside
O	of
O	the
O	box
O	.
O	She
O	applied
O	her
O	ear
O	as
O	closely
O	as
O	possible
O	,
O	and
O	listened
O	.
O	Positively
O	,
O	there
O	did
O	seem
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	stifled
O	murmur
O	within
O	!
O	Or
O	was
O	it
O	merely
O	the
O	singing
O	in
O	Pandora
O	'
O	s
O	ears
O	?
O	Or
O	could
O	it
O	be
O	the
O	beating
O	of
O	her
O	heart
O	?
O	The
O	child
O	could
O	not
O	quite
O	satisfy
O	herself
O	whether
O	she
O	had
O	heard
O	anything
O	or
O	no
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	at
O	all
O	events
O	,
O	her
O	curiosity
O	was
O	stronger
O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	As
O	she
O	drew
O	back
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	her
O	eyes
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	knot
O	of
O	gold
O	cord
O	.
O	``
O	It
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	very
O	ingenious
O	person
O	who
O	tied
O	this
O	knot
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	Pandora
O	to
O	herself
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	I
O	think
O	I
O	could
O	untie
O	it
O	nevertheless
O	.
O	I
O	am
O	resolved
O	,
O	at
O	least
O	,
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	two
O	ends
O	of
O	the
O	cord
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	she
O	took
O	the
O	golden
O	knot
O	in
O	her
O	fingers
O	,
O	and
O	pried
O	into
O	its
O	intricacies
O	as
O	sharply
O	as
O	she
O	could
O	.
O	Almost
O	without
O	intending
O	it
O	,
O	or
O	quite
O	knowing
O	what
O	she
O	was
O	about
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	soon
O	busily
O	engaged
O	in
O	attempting
O	to
O	undo
O	it
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	the
O	bright
O	sunshine
O	came
O	through
O	the
O	open
O	window
O	;
O	as
O	did
O	likewise
O	the
O	merry
O	voices
O	of
O	the
O	children
O	,
O	playing
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	Epimetheus
O	among
O	them
O	.
O	Pandora
O	stopped
O	to
O	listen
O	.
O	What
O	a
O	beautiful
O	day
O	it
O	was
O	!
O	Would
O	it
O	not
O	be
O	wiser
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	to
O	let
O	the
O	troublesome
O	knot
O	alone
O	,
O	and
O	think
O	no
O	more
O	about
O	the
O	box
O	,
O	but
O	run
O	and
O	join
O	her
O	little
O	playfellow
O	and
O	be
O	happy
O	?
O	All
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	her
O	fingers
O	were
O	half
O	unconsciously
O	busy
O	with
O	the
O	knot
O	;
O	and
O	happening
O	to
O	glance
O	at
O	the
O	flower-wreathed
O	face
O	on
O	the
O	lid
O	of
O	the
O	enchanted
O	box
O	,
O	she
O	seemed
O	to
O	perceive
O	it
O	slyly
O	grinning
O	at
O	her
O	.
O	``
O	That
O	face
O	looks
O	very
O	mischievous
O	,
O	``
O	thought
O	Pandora
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	wonder
O	whether
O	it
O	smiles
O	because
O	I
O	am
O	doing
O	wrong
O	!
O	I
O	have
O	the
O	greatest
O	mind
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	to
O	run
O	away
O	!
O	``
O	But
O	just
O	then
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	merest
O	accident
O	,
O	she
O	gave
O	the
O	knot
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	twist
O	,
O	which
O	produced
O	a
O	wonderful
O	result
O	.
O	The
O	gold
O	cord
O	untwined
O	itself
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	by
O	magic
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	box
O	without
O	a
O	fastening
O	.
O	``
O	This
O	is
O	the
O	strangest
O	thing

O	Pandora
O	.
O	``
O	What

O	how

O	I
O	possibly
O	tie
O	it
O	up
O	again
O	?
O	``
O	She
O	made
O	one
O	or
O	two
O	attempts
O	to
O	restore
O	the
O	knot
O	,
O	but
O	soon
O	found
O	it
O	quite
O	beyond
O	her
O	skill
O	.
O	It
O	had
O	disentangled
O	itself
O	so
O	suddenly
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	remember
O	how
O	the
O	strings
O	had
O	been
O	doubled
O	into
O	one
O	another
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	tried
O	to
O	recollect
O	the
O	shape
O	and
O	appearance
O	of
O	the
O	knot

O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	have
O	gone
O	entirely
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	mind
O	.
O	Nothing
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	let
O	the

O	``
O	But
O	,

O	said
O	Pandora
O	,
O	``
O	when
O	he
O	finds

O	Oh

O	very
O	naughty

O	very
O	foolish
O	Pandora
O	!
O	You
O	should
O	have
O	thought
O	only
O	of
O	doing
O	what
O	was
O	right

O	and
O	of

O	Epimetheus
O	would

O	so
O	perhaps

O	more
O	distinctly
O	,
O	than
O	before
O	,
O	the
O	murmur
O	of
O	small

O	.
O	She
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	whether

O	or
O	no
O	;
O	but
O	there

O	quite
O	a

O	,

O	overripe
O	,

O	so
O	sweet
O	as
O	to
O	be
O	cloying
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	mirth
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	usually
O	made
O	his
O	voice
O	gush
O	out
O	,
O	of

O	swell
O	the
O	merriment

O	In
O	short
O	,
O	he
O	grew
O	so
O	uneasy
O	and
O	discontented
O	,
O	that
O	the

O	could
O	not

O	Neither

O	him
O	,
O	any
O	better
O	than

O	For

O	The

O	had
O	not

O	to

O	Not
O	a

O	At

O	,
O	discovering

O	,
O	somehow

O	put
O	a

O	Epimetheus
O	judged
O	it
O	best
O	to
O	go
O	back
O	to
O	Pandora
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	humour
O	better
O	suited
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	hope
O	of
O	giving
O	her
O	pleasure
O	,
O	he
O	gathered
O	some
O	flowers
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	them
O	into
O	a
O	wreath
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	meant
O	to
O	put
O	upon

O	a
O	trail
O	of
O	fragrance
O	behind
O	,
O	as
O	Epimetheus
O	carried
O	them
O	along
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	wreath
O	was
O	put
O	together
O	with
O	as
O	much
O	skill
O	as
O	could
O	reasonably
O	be
O	expected
O	of
O	a
O	boy
O	.
O	The
O	fingers
O	of
O	little
O	girls
O	,
O	it
O	has
O	always
O	appeared
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	are
O	the
O	fittest
O	to
O	twine
O	flower
O	wreaths
O	;
O	but
O	boys
O	could
O	do
O	it
O	,
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	,
O	rather
O	better
O	than
O	they
O	can
O	now
O	.
O	And
O	here
O	I
O	must
O	mention
O	that
O	a
O	great
O	black
O	cloud
O	had
O	been
O	gathering
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	past
O	,
O	although
O	it
O	had
O	not
O	yet
O	overspread
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	Epimetheus
O	reached
O	the
O	cottage
O	door
O	,
O	this
O	cloud
O	began
O	to
O	intercept
O	the
O	sunshine
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	sudden
O	and
O	sad
O	obscurity
O	.
O	He
O	entered
O	softly
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	meant
O	,
O	if
O	possible
O	,
O	to
O	steal
O	behind
O	Pandora
O	,
O	and
O	fling
O	the
O	wreath
O	of
O	flowers
O	over
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	before
O	she
O	should
O	be
O	aware
O	of
O	his
O	approach
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	happened
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	need
O	of
O	his
O	treading
O	so
O	very
O	lightly
O	.
O	He
O	might
O	have
O	trod
O	as
O	heavily
O	as
O	he
O	pleased
O	--
O	as
O	heavily
O	as
O	a
O	grown
O	man
O	--
O	as
O	heavily
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	as
O	an
O	elephant
O	--
O	without
O	much
O	probability
O	of
O	Pandora
O	'
O	s
O	hearing
O	his
O	footsteps
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	too
O	intent
O	upon
O	her
O	purpose
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	moment
O	of
O	his
O	entering
O	the
O	cottage
O	,
O	the
O	naughty
O	child
O	had
O	put
O	her
O	hand
O	to
O	the
O	lid
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	opening
O	the
O	mysterious
O	box
O	.
O	Epimetheus
O	beheld
O	her
O	.
O	If
O	he
O	had
O	cried
O	out
O	,
O	Pandora
O	would
O	probably
O	have
O	withdrawn
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fatal
O	mystery
O	of
O	the
O	box
O	might
O	never
O	have
O	been
O	known
O	.
O	But
O	Epimetheus
O	himself
O	,
O	although
O	he
O	said
O	very
O	little
O	about
O	it
O	,
O	had
O	his
O	own
O	share
O	of
O	curiosity
O	to
O	know
O	what
O	was
O	inside
O	.
O	Perceiving
O	that
O	Pandora
O	was
O	resolved
O	to
O	find
O	out
O	the
O	secret
O	,
O	he
O	determined
O	that
O	his
O	playfellow
O	should
O	not
O	be
O	the
O	only
O	wise
O	person
O	in
O	the
O	cottage
O	.
O	And
O	if
O	there
O	were
O	anything
O	pretty
O	or
O	valuable
O	in
O	the
O	box
O	,
O	he
O	meant
O	to
O	take
O	half
O	of
O	it
O	to
O	himself
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	his
O	sage
O	speeches
O	to
O	Pandora
O	about
O	restraining
O	her
O	curiosity
O	,
O	Epimetheus
O	turned
O	out
O	to
O	be
O	quite
O	as
O	foolish
O	,
O	and
O	nearly
O	as
O	much
O	in
O	fault
O	as
O	she
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	whenever
O	we
O	blame
O	Pandora
O	for
O	what
O	happened
O	,
O	we
O	must
O	not
O	forget
O	to
O	shake
O	our
O	heads
O	at
O	Epimetheus
O	likewise
O	.
O	As
O	Pandora
O	raised
O	the
O	lid
O	,
O	the
O	cottage
O	grew
O	very
O	dark
O	and
O	dismal
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	black
O	cloud
O	had
O	now
O	swept
O	quite
O	over
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	and
O	seemed
O	to
O	have
O	buried
O	it
O	alive
O	.
O	There
O	had
O	for
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	past
O	been
O	a
O	low
O	growling
O	and
O	muttering
O	,
O	which
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	broke
O	into
O	a
O	heavy
O	peal
O	of
O	thunder
O	.
O	But
O	Pandora
O	,
O	heeding
O	nothing
O	of
O	all
O	this
O	,
O	lifted
O	the
O	lid
O	nearly
O	upright
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	inside
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	a
O	sudden
O	swarm
O	of
O	winged
O	creatures
O	brushed
O	past
O	her
O	,
O	taking
O	flight
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	box
O	,
O	while
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	instant
O	,
O	she
O	heard
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	Epimetheus
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	lamentable
O	tone
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	in
O	pain
O	.
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	stung
O	!
O	``
O	cried
O	he
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	am
O	stung
O	!
O	Naughty
O	Pandora
O	!
O	why
O	have
O	you
O	opened
O	this
O	wicked
O	box
O	?
O	``
O	Pandora
O	let
O	fall
O	the
O	lid
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	starting
O	up
O	,
O	looked
O	about
O	her
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	had
O	befallen
O	Epimetheus
O	.
O	The
O	thunder
O	cloud
O	had
O	so
O	darkened
O	the
O	room
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	very
O	clearly
O	discern
O	what
O	was
O	in
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	heard
O	a
O	disagreeable
O	buzzing
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	huge
O	flies
O	,
O	or
O	gigantic
O	mosquitoes
O	,
O	or
O	those
O	insects
O	which
O	we
O	call
O	dor
O	bugs
O	,
O	and
O	pinching
O	dogs
O	,
O	were
O	darting
O	about
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	as
O	her
O	eyes
O	grew
O	more
O	accustomed
O	to
O	the
O	imperfect
O	light
O	,
O	she
O	saw
O	a
O	crowd
O	of
O	ugly
O	little
O	shapes
O	,
O	with
O	bats
O	'
O	wings
O	,
O	looking
O	abominably
O	spiteful
O	,
O	and
O	armed
O	with
O	terribly
O	long
O	stings
O	in
O	their
O	tails
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	that
O	had
O	stung
O	Epimetheus
O	.
O	Nor
O	was
O	it
O	a
O	great
O	while
O	before
O	Pandora
O	herself
O	began
O	to
O	scream
O	,
O	in
O	no
O	less
O	pain
O	and
O	affright
O	than
O	her
O	playfellow
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	a
O	vast
O	deal
O	more
O	hubbub
O	about
O	it
O	.
O	An
O	odious
O	little
O	monster
O	had
O	settled
O	on
O	her
O	forehead
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	stung
O	her
O	I
O	know
O	not
O	how
O	deeply
O	,
O	if
O	Epimetheus
O	had
O	not
O	run
O	and
O	brushed
O	it
O	away
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	if
O	you
O	wish
O	to
O	know
O	what
O	these
O	ugly
O	things
O	might
O	be
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	made
O	their
O	escape
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	box
O	,
O	I
O	must
O	tell
O	you
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	the
O	whole
O	family
O	of
O	earthly
O	Troubles
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	evil
O	Passions
O	;
O	there
O	were
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	species
O	of
O	Cares
O	;
O	there
O	were
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	hundred
O	and
O	fifty
O	Sorrows
O	;
O	there
O	were
O	Diseases
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	vast
O	number
O	of
O	miserable
O	and
O	painful
O	shapes
O	;
O	there
O	were
O	more
O	kinds
O	of
O	Naughtiness
O	than
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	of
O	any
O	use
O	to
O	talk
O	about
O	.
O	In
O	short
O	,
O	everything
O	that
O	has
O	since
O	afflicted
O	the
O	souls
O	and
O	bodies
O	of
O	mankind
O	had
O	been
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	mysterious
O	box
O	,
O	and
O	given
O	to
O	Epimetheus
O	and
O	Pandora
O	to
O	be
O	kept
O	safely
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	the
O	happy
O	children
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	might
O	never
O	be
O	molested
O	by
O	them
O	.
O	Had
O	they
O	been
O	faithful
O	to
O	their
O	trust
O	,
O	all
O	would
O	have
O	gone
O	well
O	.
O	No
O	grown
O	person
O	would
O	ever
O	have
O	been
O	sad
O	,
O	nor
O	any
O	child
O	have
O	had
O	cause
O	to
O	shed
O	a
O	single
O	tear
O	,
O	from
O	that
O	hour
O	until
O	this
O	moment
O	.
O	But
O	--
O	and
O	you
O	may
O	see
O	by
O	this
O	how
O	a
O	wrong
O	act
O	of
O	any
O	one
O	mortal
O	is
O	a
O	calamity
O	to
O	the
O	whole
O	world
O	--
O	by
O	Pandora
O	'
O	s
O	lifting
O	the
O	lid
O	of
O	that
O	miserable
O	box
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	fault
O	of
O	Epimetheus
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	in
O	not
O	preventing
O	her
O	,
O	these
O	Troubles
O	have
O	obtained
O	a
O	foothold
O	among
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	do
O	not
O	seem
O	very
O	likely
O	to
O	be
O	driven
O	away
O	in
O	a
O	hurry
O	.
O	For
O	it
O	was
O	impossible
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	will
O	easily
O	guess
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	two
O	children
O	should
O	keep
O	the
O	ugly
O	swarms
O	in
O	their
O	own
O	little
O	cottage
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	contrary
O	,
O	the
O	first
O	thing
O	that
O	they
O	did
O	was
O	to
O	fling
O	open
O	the
O	doors
O	and
O	windows
O	,
O	in
O	hopes
O	of
O	getting
O	rid
O	of
O	them
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	sure
O	enough
O	,
O	away
O	flew
O	the
O	winged
O	Troubles
O	all
O	abroad
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	pestered
O	and
O	tormented
O	the
O	small
O	people
O	,
O	everywhere
O	about
O	,
O	that
O	none
O	of
O	them
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	smiled
O	for
O	many
O	days
O	afterward
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	what
O	was
O	very
O	singular
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	flowers
O	and
O	dewy
O	blossoms
O	on
O	earth
O	not
O	one
O	of
O	which
O	had
O	hitherto
O	faded
O	,
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	droop
O	and
O	shed
O	their
O	leaves
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	day
O	or
O	two
O	.
O	The
O	children
O	,
O	moreover
O	,
O	who
O	before
O	seemed
O	immortal
O	in
O	their
O	childhood
O	,
O	now
O	grew
O	older
O	,
O	day
O	by
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	soon
O	to
O	be
O	youths
O	and
O	maidens
O	,
O	and
O	men
O	and
O	women
O	by
O	and
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	aged
O	people
O	,
O	before
O	they
O	dreamed
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	thing
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	the
O	naughty
O	Pandora
O	,
O	and
O	hardly
O	less
O	naughty
O	Epimetheus
O	,
O	remained
O	in
O	their
O	cottage
O	.
O	Both
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	been
O	grievously
O	stung
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	in
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	of
O	pain
O	,
O	which
O	seemed
O	the
O	more
O	intolerable
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	because
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	very
O	first
O	pain
O	that
O	had
O	ever
O	been
O	felt
O	since
O	the
O	world
O	began
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	entirely
O	unaccustomed
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	have
O	no
O	idea
O	what
O	it
O	meant
O	.
O	Besides
O	all
O	this
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	exceedingly
O	bad
O	humour
O	,
O	both
O	with
O	themselves
O	and
O	with
O	one
O	another
O	.
O	In
O	order
O	to
O	indulge
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	utmost
O	,
O	Epimetheus
O	sat
O	down
O	sullenly
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	with
O	his
O	back
O	toward
O	Pandora
O	;
O	while
O	Pandora
O	flung
O	herself
O	upon
O	the
O	floor
O	and
O	rested
O	her
O	head
O	on
O	the
O	fatal
O	and
O	abominable
O	box
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	crying
O	bitterly
O	,
O	and
O	sobbing
O	as
O	if
O	her
O	heart
O	would
O	break
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	gentle
O	little
O	tap
O	on
