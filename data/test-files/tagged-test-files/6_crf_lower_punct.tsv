O	of
O	the
O	sheep

O	in
O	the

O	he
O	used
O	to

O	and

O	a

O	he
O	was
O	eighteen
O	feet
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	three
O	yards
O	round
O	;
O	and
O	his
O	fierce
O	and
O	savage
O	looks
O	were
O	the
O	terror
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	neighbors
O	.
O	he
O	dwelt
O	in
O	a

O	on

O	,
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	glutted
O	his
O	appetite
O	upon
O	their
O	cattle
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	throw

O	,
O	and

O	so
O	march
O	back

O	the

O	for
O	many

O	shovel
O	,
O	a
O	pickaxe
O	,
O	and
O	a

O	s
O	evening
O	,
O	he
O	swam
O	to
O	the
O	mount
O	.
O	there
O	he
O	fell
O	to
O	work
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	morning
O	he
O	had
O	dug
O	a
O	pit
O	twenty-two
O	feet
O	deep
O	,
O	and
O	almost
O	as
O	many
O	broad
O	.
O	he
O	covered
O	it
O	over
O	with
O	sticks

O	straw
O	,
O	and
O	strewed
O	some
O	of

O	them
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	look
O	just

O	.
O	he
O	then
O	put
O	his
O	horn
O	to
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	blew
O	such
O	a
O	loud
O	and
O	long
O	tantivy
O	,
O	that
O	the
C	giant
O	awoke
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	towards
C	jack
O	,
O	roaring
O	like
O	thunder
O	:

O	very
O	civilly
O	,
O	for

O	a
C	welsh
C	giant

O	and
O	at
O	last
O	found
O	a
O	large
O	thick
O	billet
O	of
O	wood
O	;
O	he
O	laid
O	it
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	bed

O	and
O	hid
O	himself
O	in

O	the
C	giant
O	came
O	with

O	to
O	thank
O	him
O	for

O	the
C	giant
O	started
O	when

O	flitches
O	of
O	bacon
O	;
O	the
O	bristles

C	jack

O	down
O	from

O	,

O	turned
O	him
O	into

O	a
O	little

O	;
O	then
O	,
O	to
O	finish
O	the
O	work
O	,
O	he
O	ran
O	over
O	the
O	drawbridge
O	,
O	the
C	giant
O	going
O	after
O	him
O	with
O	his
O	club
O	:
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	middle
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	bridge
O	had
O	been
O	cut
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	,
O	the
O	great
O	weight
O	of
O	his
O	body
O	made
O	it
O	break
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	tumbled
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	rolled
O	about
O	like
O	a
O	large
O	whale
O	.
C	jack
O	now
O	stood
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	moat
O	,
O	and
O	laughed
O	and
O	jeered
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	``
O	i
O	think
O	you
O	told
O	me
O	you
O	would
O	grind
O	my
O	bones
O	to
O	powder
O	;
O	when
O	will
O	you
O	begin
O	?
O	``
O	the
C	giant
O	foamed
O	at
O	both
O	his
O	horrid
O	mouths
O	with
O	fury
O	,
O	and
O	plunged
O	from
O	side
O	to
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	moat
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	out
O	to
O	have
O	revenge
O	on
O	his
O	little
O	foe
O	.
O	at
O	last
C	jack
O	ordered
O	a
O	cart-rope
O	to
O	be
O	brought
O	to
O	him
O	;
O	he
O	then
O	drew
O	it
O	over
O	his
O	two
O	heads
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	a
O	team
O	of
O	horses
O	,
O	dragged
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	moat
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	heads
O	:
O	and
O	before
O	he
O	either
O	ate
O	or
O	drank
O	,
O	sent
O	them
O	both
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	of
C	king
C	arthur
O	.
O	he
O	then
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	table
O	with
O	the
O	company
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	was
O	spent
O	in
O	mirth
O	and
O	good
O	cheer
O	.
O	after
O	staying
O	with
O	the
C	knight
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
C	jack
O	grew
O	weary
O	of
O	such
O	an
O	idle
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	again
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	new
O	adventures
O	.
O	he
O	went
O	over
O	hills
O	and
O	dales
O	without
O	meeting
O	any
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	a
O	very
O	high
O	mountain
O	.
O	here
O	he
O	knocked
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	a
O	small
O	and
O	lonely
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	head
O	as
O	white
O	as
O	snow
O	,
O	let
O	him
O	in
O	.
O	``
O	good
O	father
O	,
O	``
O	said
C	jack
O	,
O	``

C	jack
O	entered

O	some

O	had
O	eaten

O	much

O	set
O	out

C	jack
O	then
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	,

O	at
O	the
