O	For
O	more
O	than
O	six
O	weeks
O	no
O	rain
O	had
O	fallen
O	along
O	the
O	southwest
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	Adirondacks
O	.
O	The
O	ground
O	was
O	parched
O	.
O	In
O	every
O	direction
O	from
C	Seabury
C	Settlement
O	fires
O	had
O	been
O	burning
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	yet
O	the
O	valley
O	of
O	the
O	West
C	Canada
O	had
O	escaped
O	.
O	But
O	one
O	night
O	a
O	careless
O	man
O	threw
O	a
O	burning
O	match
O	into
O	a
O	brush-heap
O	.
O	When
O	morning
O	came
O	the
O	west
O	wind
O	,
O	blowing
O	up
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	was
O	ash-laden
O	and
O	warm
O	with
O	the
O	fire
O	that
O	was
O	coming
O	eastward
O	toward
O	the
O	settlement
O	in
O	a
O	line
O	a
O	mile
O	wide
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	daybreak
C	Lem
C	Lawson
O	met
O	the
O	fire
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	Noblesborough
O	,
O	and
O	warned
O	the
O	settlement
O	of
O	its
O	danger
O	.
O	One
O	man
O	hastened
O	to
O	Noblesborough
O	for
O	the
O	fire-warden
O	,
O	two
O	went
O	up
O	the
O	West
C	Canada
O	to
O	the
O	lumber-camps
O	.
O	The
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	male
O	population
O	,
O	including
O	boys
O	,
O	hastened
O	down
O	the
O	main
O	road
O	to
O	an
O	old
O	log
O	trail
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	hoped
O	the
O	fire
O	might
O	be
O	stopped
O	at
O	the
O	open
O	the
O	road
O	afforded
O	.
O	With
O	hoes
O	and
O	shovels
O	the
O	men
O	dug
O	a
O	trench
O	through
O	the
O	loam
O	to
O	the
O	sand
O	,
O	scattering
O	the
O	dirt
O	over
O	the
O	leaves
O	toward
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	first
O	flames
O	came
O	along
O	,
O	they
O	redoubled
O	their
O	efforts
O	amid
O	the
O	flying
O	sparks
O	and
O	suffocating
O	smoke
O	,
O	but
O	without
O	avail
O	.
O	The
O	sparks
O	and
O	great
O	pieces
O	of
O	flaming
O	birch
O	curls
O	carried
O	the
O	flames
O	over
O	the
O	road
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	beyond
O	the
O	men
O	,
O	fairly
O	surrounding
O	them
O	with
O	fire
O	.
O	The
O	men
O	could
O	only
O	go
O	before
O	it
O	,
O	pausing
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	throw
O	dirt
O	on
O	a
O	spark
O	.
O	Those
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	settlement
O	glanced
O	from
O	side
O	to
O	side
O	,
O	wondering
O	if
O	the
O	fire
O	would
O	cross
O	the
O	brook
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	now
O	determined
O	to
O	make
O	another
O	and
O	the
O	last
O	possible
O	stand
O	.
O	The
O	settlement
O	was
O	built
O	along
O	the
O	brink
O	of
O	a
O	steep
O	side-hill
O	.
O	The
O	bed
O	of
O	the
O	stream
O	was
O	only
O	a
O	few
O	feet
O	wide
O	,
O	--
O	chiefly
O	sand-bar
O	and
O	dry
O	boulders
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	--
O	and
O	beyond
O	it
O	,
O	toward
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	flat
O	,
O	or
O	bottom
O	,
O	sixty
O	rods
O	wide
O	,
O	averaging
O	not
O	two
O	feet
O	above
O	the
O	bed
O	of
O	the
O	brook
O	.
O	Should
O	the
O	fire
O	cross
O	the
O	brook
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	climb
O	the
O	hill
O	and
O	burn
O	the
O	buildings
O	.
O	Then
O	it
O	would
O	sweep
O	across
O	the
O	narrow
O	fields
O	of
O	grass
O	,
O	or
O	go
O	round
O	the
O	ends
O	of
O	the
O	settlement

O	into
O	the
O	``

O	One
O	of
O	the

O	son

O	the
O	man

O	had
O	thrown
O	the

O	as
O	he
O	fought
O	with

O	along

O	he
O	heard
O	the

O	on

O	him
O	cursing
O	his
O	father
O	by

O	.
O	More
O	than
O	once
O	these
O	men
O	turned
O	on
O	Will
O	,

O	told

O	ought
O	to
O	put
O	that

O	caused
O	by
O	logs
O	and
O	boulders
O	rolling
O	with
O	the
O	flood
O	was
O	felt
O	.
O	Then
O	every
O	man
O	understood
O	what
O	was
O	done
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	log-drivers
O	all
O	their
O	lives
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	the
O	signs
O	of
O	a
O	loosed
O	sluicegate
O	or
O	of
O	a
O	broken
O	jam
O	.
O	They
O	climbed
O	the
O	steep
O	bank
O	toward
O	the
O	buildings
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	above
O	the
O	flood-line
O	,
O	yelling
O	warnings
O	that
O	were
O	half-cheers
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	the
O	water
O	was
O	below
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	gorge
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	it
O	rushed
O	over
O	the
O	low
O	west
O	bank
O	of
O	the
O	brook
O	and
O	spread
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	wide
O	flat
O	where
O	the
O	fire
O	was
O	raging
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	minute
O	clouds
O	of
O	steam
O	and
O	loud
O	hissing
O	marked
O	the
O	progress
O	of
O	the
O	wave
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	brush-heaps
O	from
O	edge
O	to
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	bottom
O	were
O	covered
O	and
O	the
O	fire
O	was
O	drowned
O	.
O	The
O	fires
O	left
O	in
O	the
O	trees
O	above
O	the
O	high-water
O	mark
O	and
O	the
O	flames
O	back
O	on
O	the
O	ridge
O	still
O	thrust
O	and
O	flared
O	,
O	but
O	were
O	unable
O	to
O	cross
O	the
O	wide
O	,
O	wet
O	flood-belt
O	.
O	The
O	settlement
O	and
O	the
O	``
O	big
O	woods
O	``
O	beyond
O	were
O	saved
O	.
C	Sol
C	Cardin
O	reached
O	the
O	settlement
O	on
O	the
O	following
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	In
O	response
O	to
O	an
O	offer
O	from
O	Will
O	,
O	he
O	replied
O	:
O	``
O	No
O	,
O	my
O	boy
O	,
O	you
O	needn
O	'
O	t
O	pay
O	for
O	the

O	timber
O	above

O	,

O	``
O	Then
O	he
O	added
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	quiet
O	way
O	characteristic
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	``
O	It
