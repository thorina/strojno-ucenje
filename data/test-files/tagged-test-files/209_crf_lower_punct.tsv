O	the
O	only
O	son
O	of
O	a
O	poor
O	widow
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	china
O	;
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	helping
O	his
O	mother
O	to
O	earn
O	their
O	living
O	,
O	he
O	let
O	her
O	do
O	all
O	the
O	hard
O	work
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	himself
O	only
O	thought
O	of
O	idling
O	and
O	amusement
O	.
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	playing
O	in
O	the
O	streets
O	,
O	a
O	stranger
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	claiming
O	him
O	as
O	his
O	long-lost
O	nephew
O	.
O	aladdin
O	had
O	never
O	heard
O	that
O	his
O	father
O	had
O	had
O	a
O	brother
O	;
O	but
O	as
O	the
O	stranger
O	gave
O	him
O	money
O	and
O	promised
O	to
O	buy
O	him
O	fine
O	clothes
O	and
O	set
O	him
O	up
O	in
O	business
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	ready
O	to
O	believe
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	told
O	him
O	.
O	the
O	man
O	was
O	a
C	magician
O	,
O	who
O	wanted
O	to
O	use
O	aladdin
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	purposes
O	.
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	the
O	stranger
O	came
O	again
O	,
O	brought
O	aladdin
O	a
O	beautiful
O	suit
O	of
O	clothes
O	,
O	gave
O	him
O	many
O	good
O	things
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	walk
O	,
O	telling
O	him
O	stories
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	to
O	amuse
O	him
O	.
O	after
O	they
O	had
O	walked
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	,
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	narrow
O	valley
O	,
O	bounded
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	by
O	tall
O	,
O	gloomy-looking
O	mountains
O	.
O	aladdin
O	was
O	beginning
O	to
O	feel
O	tired
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	like
O	the
O	look
O	of
O	this
O	place
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	he
O	wanted
O	to
O	turn
O	back
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	stranger
O	would
O	not
O	let
O	him
O	.
O	he
O	made
O	aladdin
O	follow
O	him
O	still
O	farther
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	length
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	he
O	intended
O	to
O	carry
O	out
O	his
O	evil
O	design
O	.
O	then
O	he
O	made
O	aladdin
O	gather
O	sticks
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	a
O	blaze
O	he
O	threw
O	into
O	them
O	some
O	powder
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	saying
O	some
O	mystical
O	words
O	,
O	which
O	aladdin
O	could
O	not
O	understand
O	.
O	immediately
O	they
O	were
O	surrounded
O	with
O	a
O	thick
O	cloud
O	of
O	smoke
O	.
O	the
O	earth
O	trembled
O	,
O	and
O	burst
O	open
O	at
O	their
O	feet
O	--
O	disclosing
O	a
O	large
O	flat
O	stone
O	with
O	a
O	brass
O	ring
O	fixed
O	in
O	it
O	.
O	aladdin
O	was
O	so
O	terribly
O	frightened
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	run
O	away
O	;
O	but
O	the
C	magician
O	gave
O	him
O	such
O	a
O	blow
O	on
O	the
O	ear
O	that
O	he
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	poor
O	aladdin
O	rose
O	to
O	his
O	feet
O	with
O	eyes
O	full
O	of
O	tears
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	reproachfully
O	--
O	``

O	bosom
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	the
C	genie
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	his
O	assistance
O	.
O	the
C	genie
O	,
O	having
O	first
O	thrown
O	out
O	the
C	magician
O	,
O	then

O	back
O	to
O	the

O	joy
O	at

O	given
O	over
O	to

O	,
O	and
O	for
O	ten
O	days
O	nothing
O	was
O	heard
O	but
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	drums
O	and
O	trumpets
O	and
O	cymbals
O	,
O	and
O	nothing
O	was
O	seen
O	but
O	illuminations
O	and
O	gorgeous
O	entertainments
O	in
O	honor
O	of
O	aladdin
O	'
O	s
O	safe
O	return

O	the

O	ascended
O	the
O	throne
O	after
