O	bokwewa
O	and
O	his
O	brother
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	far-off
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	by
O	such
O	as
O	had
O	knowledge
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	bokwewa
O	,
O	the
O	elder
O	,
O	although
O	deformed
O	and
O	feeble
O	of
O	person
O	,
O	was
O	considered
O	a
O	manito
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	assumed
O	the
O	mortal
O	shape
O	;
O	while
O	his
O	younger
O	brother
O	,
O	kwasynd
O	,
O	manly
O	in
O	appearance
O	,
O	active
O	,
O	and
O	strong
O	,
O	partook
O	of
O	the
O	nature
O	of
O	the
O	present
O	race
O	of
O	beings
O	.
O	they
O	lived
O	off
O	the
O	path
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	wild
O	,
O	lonesome
O	place
O	,
O	far
O	retired
O	from
O	neighbors
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	undisturbed
O	by
O	cares
O	,
O	they
O	passed
O	their
O	time
O	,
O	content
O	and
O	happy
O	.
O	the
O	days
O	glided
O	by
O	serenely
O	as
O	the
O	river
O	that
O	flowed
O	by
O	their
O	lodge
O	.
O	owing
O	to
O	his
O	lack
O	of
O	strength
O	,
O	bokwewa
O	never
O	engaged
O	in
O	the
O	chase
O	,
O	but
O	gave
O	his
O	attention
O	entirely
O	to
O	the
O	affairs
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	in
O	the
O	long
O	winter
O	evenings
O	he
O	passed
O	the
O	time
O	in
O	telling
O	his
O	brother
O	stories
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	,
O	spirits
O	,
O	weendigoes
O	,
O	and
O	fairies
O	of
O	the
O	elder
O	age
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	the
O	exclusive
O	charge
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	he
O	also
O	at
O	times
O	taught
O	his
O	brother
O	the
O	manner
O	in
O	which
O	game
O	should
O	be
O	pursued
O	,
O	pointed
O	out
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	ways
O	of
O	the
O	different
O	beasts
O	and
O	birds
O	of
O	the
O	chase
O	,
O	and
O	assigned
O	the
O	seasons
O	at
O	which
O	they
O	could
O	be
O	hunted
O	with
O	most
O	success
O	.
O	for
O	a
O	while
O	the
O	brother
O	was
O	eager
O	to
O	learn
O	,
O	and
O	keenly
O	attended
O	to
O	his
O	duties
O	as
O	the
O	provider
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	;
O	but
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	grew
O	weary
O	of
O	their
O	tranquil
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	desire
O	to
O	show
O	himself
O	among
O	men
O	.
O	he
O	became
O	restive
O	in
O	their
O	retirement
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	seized
O	with
O	a
O	longing
O	to
O	visit
O	remote
O	places
O	.
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	kwasynd
O	told
O	his
O	brother
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	leave
O	him
O	;
O	that
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	visit
O	the
O	habitations
O	of
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	procure
O	a
O	wife
O	.
O	bokwewa
O	objected
O	;
O	but
O	his
O	brother
O	overruled
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	every
O	remonstrance
O	,
O	he
O	departed
O	on
O	his
O	travels
O	.
O	he
O	traveled
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	.
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	fell
O	in
O	with
O	the
O	footsteps
O	of
O	men
O	.
O	they
O	were
O	moving
O	by
O	encampments
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	saw
O	,
O	at
O	several
O	spots
O	,
O	the
O	poles
O	where
O	they
O	had
O	passed
O	.
O	it
O	was
O	winter
O	;
O	and
O	coming
O	to
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	one
O	of
O	their
O	company
O	had
O	died
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	upon
O	a
O	scaffold
O	,
O	lying
O	at
O	length
O	in
O	the
O	cold
O	blue
O	air
O	,
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	a
O	beautiful
O	young
O	woman
O	.
O	``
O	she
O	shall
O	be
O	my
O	wife
O	!
O	``
O	exclaimed
O	kwasynd
O	.
O	he
O	lifted
O	her
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	bearing
O	her
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	.
O	``
O	brother
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	can

O	you

O	her
O	to

O	oh
O	,

O	me
O	that
O	favor
O	!
O	``
O	he
O	looked
O	upon
O	the
O	beautiful
O	female
O	with
O	a
O	longing
O	gaze
O	;
O	but
O	she
O	lay
O	as
O	cold
O	and
O	silent
O	as
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	found
O	her
O	upon
O	the
O	scaffold
O	.
O	``
O	i
O	will
O	try
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	bokwewa
O	.
O	these
O	words
O	had
O	been
O	scarcely
O	breathed
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	young
O	woman
O	rose
O	up
O	,
O	opened
O	her
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	upon
O	bokwewa
O	with
O	a
O	smile
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	known
O	him
O	before
O	.
O	to
O	kwasynd
O	she
O	paid
O	no
O	heed
O	whatever
O	;
O	but
O	presently
O	bokwewa
O	,
O	seeing
O	how
O	she
O	lingered
O	in
O	her
O	gaze
O	upon
O	himself
O	,
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	``
O	sister
O	,
O	that
O	is
O	your
O	husband
O	,
O	``
O	pointing
O	to
O	kwasynd
O	.
O	she
O	listened
O	to
O	his
O	voice
O	,
O	and
O	crossing
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	she
O	sat
O	by
O	kwasynd
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	man
O	and
O	wife
O	.
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	they
O	all
O	lived
O	contentedly
O	together
O	.
O	bokwewa
O	was
O	very
O	kind
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	sought
O	to
O	render
O	his
O	days
O	happy
O	.
O	he
O	was
O	ever
O	within
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	seeking
O	to
O	have
O	it
O	in
O	readiness
O	against
O	the
O	return
O	of
O	kwasynd
O	from
O	the
O	hunt
O	.
O	and
O	by
O	following
O	his
O	directions
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	those
O	of
O	one
O	deeply
O	skilled
O	in
O	the
O	chase
O	,
O	kwasynd
O	always
O	succeeded
O	in
O	returning
O	with
O	a
O	good
O	store
O	of
O	meat
O	.
O	but
O	the
O	charge
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	brothers
O	was
O	greatly
O	lightened
O	by
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	the
O	spirit-wife
O	;
O	for
O	without
O	labor
O	of
O	the
O	hand
O	,
O	she
O	ordered
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	willed
O	,
O	every
O	thing
O	took
O	its
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	at
O	once
O	in
O	proper
O	array
O	.
O	the
O	wish
O	of
O	her
O	heart
O	seemed
O	to
O	control
O	whatever
O	she
O	looked
O	upon
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	obeyed
O	her
O	desire
O	.
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	still
O	more
O	to
O	the
O	surprise
O	of
O	her
O	husband
O	kwasynd
O	that
O	she
O	never
O	partook
O	of
O	food
O	,
O	nor
O	shared
O	in
O	any
O	way
O	the
O	longings
O	and
O	appetites
O	of
O	a
O	mortal
O	creature
O	.
O	she
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	seen
O	arranging
O	her
O	hair
O	,
O	like
O	other
O	females
O	,
O	or
O	at
O	work
O	upon
O	her
O	garments
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	they
O	were
O	ever
O	seemly
O	,
O	and
O	without
O	blemish
O	or
O	disorder
O	.
O	behold
O	her
O	at
O	any
O	hour
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	ever
O	beautiful
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	seemed
O	to
O	need
O	no
O	ornament
O	,
O	nor
O	nourishment
O	,
O	nor
O	other
O	aid
O	,
O	to
O	give
O	grace
O	or
O	strength
O	to
O	her
O	looks
O	.
O	kwasynd
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	first
O	wonder
O	of
O	her
O	ways
O	had
O	passed
O	,
O	payed
O	little
O	heed
O	to
O	her
O	discourse
O	;
O	he
O	was
O	engrossed
O	with
O	the
O	hunt
O	,
O	and
O	chose
O	rather
O	to
O	be
O	abroad
O	,
O	pursuing
O	the
O	wild
O	game
O	,
O	or
O	in
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	enjoying
O	its
O	savory
O	spoil
O	,
O	than
O	the
O	society
O	of
O	his
O	spirit-wife
O	.
O	but
O	bokwewa
O	watched
O	closely
O	every
O	word
O	that
O	fell
O	from
O	her
O	lips
O	,
O	and
O	often
O	forgot
O	,
O	like
O	her
O	,
O	all
O	mortal
O	appetite
O	and
O	care
O	of
O	the
O	body
O	,
O	in
O	conferring
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	noting
O	what
O	she
O	had
O	to
O	say
O	of
O	spirits
O	and
O	fairies
O	,
O	of
O	stars
O	,
O	and
O	streams
O	that
O	never
O	ceased
O	to
O	flow
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	delight
O	of
O	the
O	happy
O	hunting-grounds
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	groves
O	of
O	the
O	blessed
O	.
O	one
O	day
O	kwasynd
O	had
O	gone
O	out
O	as
O	usual
O	,
O	and
O	bokwewa
O	was
O	sitting
O	in
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	opposite
O	side
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	suddenly
O	exclaimed
O	:
O	``
O	i
O	must
O	leave
O	you
O	,
O	``
O	as
O	a
O	tall
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	whose
O	face
O	was
O	like
O	the
O	sun
O	in
O	its
O	brightness
O	,
O	entered
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	her
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	he
O	led
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	she
O	made
O	no
O	resistance
O	,
O	but
O	turning
O	as
O	she
O	left
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	she
O	cast
O	upon
O	bokwewa
O	a
O	smile
O	of
O	kind
O	regard
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	companion
O	,
O	gone
O	from
O	his
O	view
O	.
O	he
O	ran
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	glanced
O	about
O	.
O	he
O	saw
O	nothing
O	;
O	but
O	looking
O	far
O	off
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	discover
O	,
O	at
O	a
O	great
O	distance
O	,
O	a
O	shining
O	track
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dim
O	figures
O	of
O	two
O	who
O	were
O	vanishing
O	in
O	heaven
O	.
O	when
O	his
O	brother
O	returned
O	,
O	bokwewa
O	related
O	all
O	to
O	him
O	exactly
O	as
O	it
O	had
O	happened
O	.
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	kwasynd
O	changed
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	dark
O	as
O	the
O	night
O	.
O	for
O	several
O	days
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	taste
O	food
O	.
O	sometimes
O	he
O	would
O	fall
O	to
O	weeping
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	only
O	it
O	seemed
O	that
O	he
O	remembered
O	how

O	the

O	at

O	he
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	go
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	her
O	.
O	bokwewa
O	tried
O	to

O	from
O	it
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	would

O	purpose
O	.
O	``

O	at

O	he
O	began
O	to

O	when

O	suddenly
O	reached

O	with

O	streams
O	of

O	.
O	as

O	pressed
O	on

O	of
O	his
O	years
O	.
O	all
O	whom
O	bokwewa
O	met
O	,
O	of
O	every
O	name
O	and
O	degree
O	,
O	were
O	heavily

O	bows
O	,
O	arrows
O	,

O	one
O	man
O	stopped
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	complained
O	of
O	the
O	weary
O	load
O	he
O	was
O	carrying
O	.
O	another
O	offered
O	him
O	a
O	kettle
O	;
O	another
O	his
O	bow
O	and
O	arrows
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	declined
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	free
O	of
O	foot
O	,
O	hastened
O	on
O	.
O	and
O	now
O	he
O	met
O	women
O	who
O	were
O	carrying
O	their
O	basket-work
O	,
O	and
O	painted
O	paddles

O	the

O	.
O	with
O	this

O	throng
O	,
O	bokwewa
O	was
O	borne
O	along
O	for
O	two
O	days
O	and
O	nights
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	arrived
O	at
O	a

O	,
O	and
O	so
O	beautiful
O	in
