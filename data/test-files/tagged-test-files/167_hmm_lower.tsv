O	two

O	,
O	new

O	to
O	visit
O	his
O	new
O	brunswick
O	acquaintance
O	during
O	the
O	deer
O	-
O	hunting
O	season
O	,
O	and
O	late
O	in
O	august
O	was
O	reminded
O	of
O	the
O	fact
O	.
O	a
O	second
O	letter
O	came
O	in
O	september
O	,
O	the
O	carefully
O	worded
O	school
O	english
O	of
O	the
O	writer
O	not
O	being
O	able
O	to
O	conceal
O	the
O	warmth
O	and
O	urgency
O	of
O	the
O	invitation
O	.
O	so
O	ray
O	telegraphed
O	his
O	acceptance
O	,
O	and
O	four
O	days
O	later
O	arrived
O	at
O	fredericton
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	secured
O	a
O	hunting
O	license
O	.
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	he
O	reached
O	two
O	rivers
O	,
O	and
O	jacques
O	met
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	span
O	of
O	ponies
O	,
O	attached
O	to
O	a
O	queer
O	spring
O	vehicle
O	,
O	mounted
O	on
O	wheels
O	that
O	seemed
O	out
O	of
O	all
O	proportion
O	to
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	carriage
O	.
O	ray
O	wondered
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	relic
O	of
O	acadia
O	,
O	but
O	did
O	not
O	like
O	to
O	ask
O	.
O	they
O	drove
O	for
O	a
O	dozen
O	miles
O	through
O	a
O	wooded
O	and
O	hilly
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	arrived
O	at
O	their
O	destination
O	shortly
O	before
O	nightfall
O	.
O	jacques
O	was
O	quite
O	alone
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	,
O	as
O	his
O	parents
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	visit
O	their
O	older
O	children
O	along
O	the

O	promised

O	at
O	least
O	one
O	deer
O	within
O	a
O	couple
O	of
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	another
O	within
O	a
O	week

O	the

O	resembled
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	better
O	class
O	of
O	_habitants_
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	a
O	difference
O	due
O	to
O	the
O	greater
O	prosperity
O	of
O	the
O	family
O	in
O	preceding
O	generations
O	.
O	the
O	main
O	room
O	had
O	a
O	huge
O	fireplace
O	,
O	used
O	only
O	occasionally
O	,
O	for
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	air

O	tight
O	stove
O	connected
O	with
O	the
O	chimney
O	just
O	above
O	it
O	,
O	to
O	afford
O	greater
O	warmth
O	in
O	winter
O	.
O	the
O	other
O	rooms
O	were
O	chiefly
O	detached
O	,
O	although
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	entry
O	-
O	like
O	porch
O	on
O	the
O	south
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	living
O	-

O	,
O	and
O	a
O	huge
O	door
O	opening
O	at
O	the
O	east
O	end
O	,
O	both
O	connecting
O	with
O	the
O	yard
O	outside
O	.

O	wood
O	-

O	a
O	rectangular

O	of
O	heavy
O	logs
O	,
O	with
O	low

O	the
O	homestead
O	was
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	a
O	cluster
O	of
O	houses
O	rather
O	than
O	a
O	single
O	dwelling
O	.
O	what
O	most
O	attracted
O	ray
O	'
O	s
O	attention
O	were
O	the
O	huge
O	bedsteads
O	in
O	the

O	they
O	were

O	had
O	seen
O	elsewhere

O	with
O	the
O	difference
O	that
O	a
O	canopy
O	covered
O	them
O	.
O	each
O	had
O	a
O	carved
O	wooden

O	,
O	surmounting
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	posts
O	like
O	a
O	roof
O	.
O	the

O	surface
O	being
O	covered
O	with
O	elaborate
O	foliage
O	and
O	armorial

O	of
O	some
O	old
O	french
O	artisan
O	of
O	the
O	seventeenth

O	the
O	original
O	emigrant
