C	A
C	Miller
O	,
O	dying
O	,
O	divided
O	all
O	his
O	property
O	between
O	his
O	three
O	children
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	simple
O	matter
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	leave
O	but
O	his
O	mill
O	,
O	his
O	ass
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	cat
O	;
O	so
O	he
O	made
O	no
O	will
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	in
O	no
O	lawyer
O	,
O	who
O	would
O	,
O	probably
O	,
O	have
O	taken
O	a
O	large
O	slice
O	out
O	of
O	these
O	poor
O	possessions
O	.
O	The
O	eldest
O	son
O	took
O	the
O	mill
O	,
O	the
O	second
O	the
O	ass
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	third
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	content
O	himself
O	with
O	the
O	cat
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	he
O	grumbled
O	very
O	much
O	.
O	``
O	My

O	he
O	,

O	s
O	words
O	,
O	still
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	rather
O	surprising
O	that
O	a
O	cat
O	should
O	speak
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	had
O	before
O	now
O	seen
O	him
O	show
O	so
O	much
O	adroitness
O	and
O	cleverness
O	in
O	catching
O	rats
O	and
O	mice
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	seemed
O	advisable
O	to
O	trust
O	him
O	a
O	little
O	farther
O	,
O	especially
O	as
O	,
O	poor
O	young
O	fellow
O	!
O	he
O	had
O	nobody
O	else
O	to

O	.
O	When
O	the
O	cat
O	got
O	his
O	boots
O	,
O	he
O	drew
O	them
O	on
O	with
O	a
O	grand
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	slinging
O	his
O	sack
O	over
O	his
O	shoulder
O	,
O	and
O	drawing
O	the
O	cords
O	of
O	it
O	round
O	his
O	neck
O	,
O	he
O	marched
O	bravely
O	to
O	a
O	rabbit-warren
O	hard
O	by
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	well
O	acquainted
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	putting
O	some
O	bran
O	and
O	lettuces
O	into
O	his
O	bag
O	,
O	and
O	stretching
O	himself
O	out

O	as
O	if

O	were
O	dead
O	,
O	he
O	waited
O	till
O	some

O	of
O	the
O	wickedness
O	and
O	deceit
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	should
O	peer
O	into
O	the
O	sack
O	to
O	eat
O	the

O	him
O	without

O	Then
O	,
O	very
O	proud
O	of
O	his
O	prey
O	,
O	he
O	marched
O	direct
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	begged
O	to

O	``

O	said
O	his

O	to
O	the
O	miller
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	;
O	who
O	bowed
O	,
O	and
O	answered
O	``
O	that
O	it

O	not
O	a

O	meadow
O	,
O	take
O	it

O	.
O	``
O	Then
O	the
O	cat
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	wheat-field
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	reapers
O	were
O	reaping
O	with
O	all
O	their
O	might
O	.
O	He
O	bounded
O	in
O	upon
O	them
O	:
O	``
O	The

O	``
O	The
O	reapers
O	,
O	very
O	much
O	alarmed
O	,
O	did
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	bid
O	,
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	congratulated
O	the
O	Marquis
O	upon
O	possessing
O	such
O	beautiful
O	fields
O	,
O	laden
O	with
O	such
O	an
O	abundant
O	harvest
O	.
O	They
O	drove
O	on
O	--
O	the
O	cat
O	always
O	running
O	before
O	and
O	saying
O	the
O	same
O	thing
O	to
O	everybody
O	he
O	met
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	to
O	declare
O	the
O	whole
O	country
O	belonged
O	to
O	his
O	master
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	even
O	the
C	king
O	was
O	astonished
O	at
O	the
O	vast
O	estate
O	of
O	my
O	lord
O	the
O	Marquis
O	of
O	Carabas
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	the
O	cat
O	arrived
O	at
O	a
O	great
O	castle
O	where
O	dwelt
O	an
C	Ogre
O	,
O	to
O	whom
O	belonged
O	all
O	the
O	land
O	through
O	which
O	the
O	royal
O	equipage
O	had
O	been
O	driving
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	cruel
O	tyrant
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	tenants
O	and
O	servants
O	were
O	terribly
O	afraid
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	which
O	accounted
O	for
O	their
O	being
O	so
O	ready
O	to
O	say
O	whatever
O	they
O	were
O	told
O	to
O	say
O	by
O	the
O	cat
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	taken
O	pains
O	to
O	inform
O	himself
O	of
O	all
O	about
O	the
C	Ogre
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	putting
O	on
O	the
O	boldest
O	face
O	he
O	could
O	assume
O	,
O	Puss
O	marched
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	with
O	his
O	boots
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	owner
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	on
O	his
O	travels
O	,
O	but
O	did
O	not
O	wish
O	to
O	pass
O	so
O	near
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	noble
C	gentleman
O	without
O	paying
O	his
O	respects
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	the
C	Ogre
O	heard
O	this
O	message
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	received
O	the
O	cat
O	as
O	civilly
O	as
O	an
C	Ogre
O	can
O	,
O	and
O	begged
O	him
O	to
O	walk
O	in
O	and
O	repose
O	himself
O	.
O	``
O	Thank
O	you

O	said
O	the
O	cat
O	;
O	``

O	satisfy

O	curiosity
O	.

O	``
O	``
O	That

O	``
O	He
O	did
O	so
O	;

O	the
O	cat
O	was
O	so
O	frightened
O	that
O	he
O	sprang
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	and
O	hid
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	gutter
O	--
O	a
O	proceeding
O	rather
O	inconvenient
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	his

O	which
O	were
O	not

O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	perceiving
O	that

O	had
O	resumed
O	his
O	original

O	,
O	he
O	came
O	down
O	again
O	stealthily
O	,
O	and
O	confessed
O	that

O	frightened
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	,

O	,
O	for

O	a
O	little
O	mouse
O	running
O	along
O	on
O	the

O	.
O	This
O	was
O	exactly
O	what

O	he
O	did
O	the

O	,

O	the

O	sprang
O	upon
O	the
O	mouse
O	and
O	gobbled
O	it
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	trice
O	.
O	So
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	end
O	of
O	the
C	Ogre
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	the
C	king
O	had
O	arrived
O	opposite
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	seized
O	with
O	a
O	strong
O	desire
O	to
O	enter
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	cat
O	,
O	hearing
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	the
O	carriage-wheels
O	,
O	ran
O	forward
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	hurry
O	,
O	and
O	standing
O	at
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	said
O	in
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	,
O	``

O	``
O	The
O	Marquis
O	,
O	without
O	speaking
O	,
O	offered
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	the
C	princess
O	to
O	assist
O	her
O	to
O	descend
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	standing
O	aside
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	might
O	enter
O	first
O	--
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	already
O	acquired
O	all
O	the
O	manners
O	of
O	a
O	court
O	--
O	followed
O	his
O	majesty
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	hall
O	,
O	where
O	a
O	magnificent
O	collation
O	was
O	laid
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	,
O	without
O	more
O	delay
O	,
O	they
O	all
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	feast
O	.
O	Before
O	the
O	banquet
O	was
O	over
O	,
O	the
C	king
O	,
O	charmed
O	with
O	the
O	good

O	of
O	the
O	Marquis
O	of
O	Carabas
O	--
O	and
O	likewise
O	with
O	his
O	wine
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	drunk
O	six
O	or
O	seven
O	cups
O	--
O	said
O	,
O	bowing
O	across
O	the
O	table
O	at
O	which
O	the
C	princess
O	and
O	the
O	miller
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	were
O	talking
O	very
O	confidentially
O	together
O	,
O	``
O	It
O	rests
O	with
O	you
O	,
O	Marquis
O	,
O	whether

O	.
O	``
O	``
O	I
O	shall
O	be

O	Marquis
O	,
O	and
O	the
C	princess
O	'
O	s
O	cast-down
O	eyes
O	declared
O	the

O	.
O	So
O	they
O	were
O	married
O	the
O	very
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	possession

O	castle
O	,

O	of

O	As
O	for
O	the
O	cat
O	,
O	he
O	became
O	at
O	once
O	a
O	grand
O	personage
O	,

O	had
O	never
O	more
O	any
O	need
O	to
O	run
O	after

O	,
O	except

O	diversion
O	.
O	THE
O	WOLF
O	AND
O	The
O	Seven
O	Young
O	Goslings
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	once
O	an
O	old
O	goose
O	who
O	had
O	seven
O	young
O	goslings
O	,

O	loved
O	them
O	as
O	only
O	a
O	mother
O	can
O	love
O	her
O	children
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	she
O	was
O	going
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	to
O	seek
O	for
O	provender
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	setting
O	off
O	she
O	called
O	all
O	seven
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``

O	all
O	.
O	The
O	villain
O	often
O	disguises
O	himself
O	,
O	but
O	you
O	can
O	easily

O	The

O	So
O	the

O	``
O	We
O	will
O	not
O	open
O	;
O	our
O	mother
O	has
O	not
O	black
O	feet
O	like
O	you
O	--
O	you
O	are
O	the
O	wolf
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	wolf
O	ran
O	off
O	to
O	the
O	baker
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	have
O	hurt
O	my
O	foot
O	,
O	put
O	some
O	dough
O	on
O	it
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	baker
O	had
O	plastered
O	it
O	with
O	dough
O	,
O	the
O	wolf
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	miller
O	and
O	cried
O	,
O	``
O	Strew
O	some
O	meal
O	on
O	my
O	paws
O	.
O	``
O	But
O	the
O	miller
O	thought
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	``
O	The
O	wolf
O	wants
O	to
O	deceive
O	some
O	one
O	,
O	``
O	and
O	he
O	hesitated
O	to
O	do
O	it
O	;
O	till
O	the
O	wolf
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	If
O	you
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	do
O	it
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	eat
O	you
O	up
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	miller
O	was
O	afraid
O	and
O	made
O	his
O	paws
O	white
O	.
O	Such
O	is
O	the
O	way
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	!
O	Now
O	came
O	the
O	rogue
O	back
O	for
O	the
O	third
O	time
O	,
O	knocked
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Open
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	dear
O	children
O	;
O	your
O	mother
O	has
O	come
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	has
O	brought
O	something
O	for
O	each
O	of
O	you
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	little
O	goslings
O	cried
O	,
O	``
O	Show
O	us
O	your
O	paws
O	first
O	,
O	that
O	we
O	may
O	see
O	whether
O	you
O	are
O	indeed
O	our
O	mother
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	he
O	laid
O	his
O	paws
O	on
O	the
O	window-sill
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	goslings
O	saw
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	white
O	,
O	they
O	believed
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	right
O	,
O	and
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	;
O	and
O	who
O	should
O	come
O	in
O	but
O	the
O	wolf
O	!
O	They
O	screamed
O	out
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	hide
O	themselves
O	;
O	one
O	jumped
O	under
O	the
O	table
O	,
O	another
O	into
O	the
O	bed
O	,
O	the
O	third
O	into
O	the
O	oven
O	;
O	the
O	fourth
O	ran
O	into
O	the
O	kitchen
O	,
O	the
O	fifth
O	hopped
O	into
O	a
O	chest
O	,
O	the
O	sixth
O	under
O	the
O	wash-tub
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	seventh
O	got
O	into
O	the
O	clock-case
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	wolf
O	seized
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	stood
O	on
O	no
O	ceremony
O	with
O	them
O	;
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	he
O	gobbled
O	them
O	all
O	up
O	,
O	except
O	the
O	youngest
O	,
O	who
O	being
O	in
O	the
O	clock-case
O	he
O	couldn
O	'
O	t
O	find
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	wolf
O	had
O	eaten
O	his
O	fill
O	,
O	he
O	strolled
O	forth
O	,
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	green
O	meadow
O	under
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	fast
O	asleep
O	.
O	Not
O	long
O	after
O	,
O	back
O	came
O	the
O	old
O	goose
O	home
O	from
O	the
O	wood
O	;
O	but
O	what
O	,
O	alas
O	!
O	did
O	she
O	see
O	?
O	The
O	house-door
O	stood
O	wide
O	open
O	;
O	table
O	,
O	chairs
O	,
O	benches
O	,
O	were
O	all
O	overthrown
O	;
O	the
O	wash-tub
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	ashes
O	;
O	blankets
O	and
O	pillows
O	were
O	torn
O	off
O	the
O	bed
O	.
O	She
O	looked
O	for
O	her
O	children
O	,
O	but
O	nowhere
O	could
O	she
O	find
O	them
O	;
O	she
O	called
O	them
O	each
O	by
O	name
O	,
O	but
O	nobody
O	answered
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	youngest
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	squeaking
O	voice
O	answered
O	,
O	``
O	Dear
O	mother
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	in
O	the
O	clock-case
O	.
O	``
O	She
O	pulled
O	him
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	how
O	the
O	wolf
O	had
O	come
O	and
O	had
O	eaten
O	up
O	all
O	the
O	others
O	.
O	You
O	may
O	think
O	how
O	she
O	wept
O	for
O	her
O	dear
O	children
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	in
O	her
O	grief
O	,
O	she
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	youngest
O	gosling
O	ran
O	beside
O	her
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	meadow
O	there
O	lay
O	the
O	wolf
O	under
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	snoring
O	till
O	the
O	boughs
O	shook
O	.
O	She
O	walked
O	round
O	and
O	examined
O	him
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	,
O	till
O	she
O	perceived
O	that
O	something
O	was
O	moving
O	and
O	kicking
O	about
O	inside
O	him
O	.
O	``
O	Can
O	it
O	be
O	,
O	``
O	thought
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	that
O	my
O	poor
O	children
O	whom
O	he
O	has
O	swallowed
O	for
O	his
O	supper
O	are
O	yet
O	alive
O	?
O	``
O	So
O	she
O	sent
O	the
O	little
O	gosling
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	house
O	for
O	scissors
O	,
O	needle
O	,
O	and
O	thread
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	slit
O	up
O	the
O	monster
O	'
O	s
O	stomach
O	.
O	Scarcely
O	had
O	she
O	given
O	one
O	snip
O	,
O	when
O	out
O	came
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	a
O	gosling
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	cut
O	a
O	little
O	further
O	,
O	the
O	six
O	jumped
O	out
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	,
O	not
O	having
O	taken
O	the
O	least
O	hurt
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	greedy
O	monster
O	had
O	swallowed
O	them
O	down
O	whole
O	.
O	That
O	was
O	a
O	joy
O	!
O	They
O	embraced
O	their
O	mother
O	tenderly
O	,
O	and
O	skipped
O	about
O	as
O	lively
O	as
O	a
O	tailor
O	at
O	his
O	wedding
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	old
O	goose
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Now
O	go
O	and
O	find
O	me
O	six
O	large
O	stones
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	will
O	put
O	inside
O	the
O	greedy
C	beast
O	while
O	he
O	is
O	still
O	asleep
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
O	goslings
O	got
O	the
O	stones
O	in
O	all
O	haste
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	put
O	them
O	inside
O	the
O	wolf
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	goose
O	sewed
O	him
O	up
O	again
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	hurry
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	never
O	once
O	moved
O	nor
O	took
O	any
O	notice
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	the
O	wolf
O	at
O	last
O	woke
O	up
O	and
O	got
O	upon
O	his
O	legs
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	thirsty
O	,
O	and
O	wished
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	spring
O	to
O	drink
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	move
O	the
O	stones
O	began
O	to
O	shake
O	and
O	rattle
O	inside
O	him
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	cried
O	,
O	--
O	``
O	What
O	'
O	s
O	this
O	rumbling
O	and
O	tumbling
O	,
O	What
O	'
O	s
O	this
O	rattling
O	like
O	bones
O	?
O	I
O	thought
O	I
O	had
O	eaten
O	six
O	little
O	geese
O	,
O	But
O	they
O	'
O	ve
O	turned
O	out
O	only
O	stones
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	spring
O	and
O	bent
O	down
O	his
O	head
O	to
O	drink
O	,
O	the
O	heavy
O	stones
O	overbalanced
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	he
O	went
O	head
O	over
O	heels
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	the
O	seven
O	goslings
O	saw
O	this
O	,
O	they
O	came
O	running
O	up
O	,
O	crying
O	loudly
O	,
O	``
O	The
O	wolf
O	is
O	dead
O	,
O	the
O	wolf
O	is
O	dead
O	!
O	``
O	and
O	danced
O	for
O	joy
O	all
O	round
O	the
O	spring
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	mother
O	with
O	them
O	.
