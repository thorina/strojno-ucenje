O	There
O	was
O	a
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	who
O	were
O	dotingly
O	fond
O	of
O	their
O	only
O	son
O	,
O	notwithstanding
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	equally
O	deformed
O	in
O	mind
O	and
O	person
O	.
O	The
C	king
O	was
O	quite
O	sensible
O	of
O	the
O	evil
O	disposition
O	of
O	his
O	son
O	,
O	but
O	the
C	queen
O	,
O	in
O	her
O	excessive
O	fondness
O	,
O	saw
O	no
O	fault
O	whatever
O	in
O	her
O	dear
O	Furibon
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	named
O	.
O	The
O	surest
O	way
O	to
O	win
O	her
O	favour
O	was
O	to
O	praise
O	Furibon
O	for
O	charms
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	possess
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	of
O	age
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	governor
O	,
O	the
C	king
O	made
O	choice
O	of
O	a
C	prince
O	who
O	had
O	an
O	ancient
O	right
O	to
O	the
O	crown
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	support
O	it
O	.
O	This
C	prince
O	had
O	a
O	son
O	,
O	named
O	Leander
O	,
O	handsome
O	,
O	accomplished
O	,
O	amiable
O	--
O	in
O	every
O	respect
O	the
O	opposite
O	of
C	Prince
C	Furibon
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	were
O	frequently
O	together
O	,
O	which
O	only
O	made
O	the
O	deformed
C	prince
O	more
O	repulsive
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	certain
O	ambassadors
O	having
O	arrived
O	from
O	a
O	far
O	country
O	,
O	the
O	princes
O	stood
O	in
O	a
O	gallery
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	;
O	when
O	,
O	taking
O	Leander
O	for
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	they
O	made
O	their
O	obeisance
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	treating
O	Furibon
O	as
O	a
O	mere
C	dwarf
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	the
O	latter
O	was
O	so
O	offended
O	that
O	he
O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	done
O	them
O	a
O	mischief
O	had
O	not
O	the
C	king
O	just
O	then
O	appeared
O	.
O	As
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	the
O	affair
O	produced
O	a
O	quarrel
O	,
O	which
O	ended
O	in
O	Leander
O	'
O	s
O	being
O	sent
O	to
O	a
O	far-away
O	castle
O	belonging
O	to
O	his
O	father
O	.
O	There
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	happy
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	lover
O	of
O	hunting
O	,
O	fishing
O	,
O	and
O	walking
O	:
O	he
O	understood
O	painting
O	,
O	read
O	much
O	,
O	and
O	played
O	upon
O	several
O	instruments
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	glad
O	to
O	be
O	freed
O	from
O	the
O	fantastic
O	humours
O	of
O	Furibon
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	walking
O	in
O	the
O	garden
O	,
O	finding
O	the
O	heat
O	increase
O	,
O	he
O	retired
O	into
O	a
O	shady
O	grove
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	play
O	upon
O	the
O	flute
O	to
O	amuse
O	himself
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	played
O	,
O	he
O	felt
O	something
O	wind
O	about
O	his
O	leg
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	down
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	adder
O	:
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	handkerchief
O	,
O	and
O	catching
O	it
O	by
O	the
O	head
O	,
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	kill
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	adder
O	,
O	looking
O	steadfastly
O	in
O	his
O	face
O	,
O	seemed
O	to
O	beg
O	his
O	pardon
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	instant
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	gardeners
O	happened
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	Leander
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	spying
O	the
O	snake
O	,
O	cried
O	out
O	to
O	his
O	master
O	,
O	``
O	Hold
O	him
O	fast
O	,
O	sir
O	;
O	it
O	is
O	but
O	an
O	hour
O	since
O	we
O	ran
O	after
O	him
O	to
O	kill
O	him
O	:
O	it
O	is
O	the
O	most
O	mischievous
O	creature
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	``
O	Leander
O	,
O	casting
O	his
O	eyes
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	upon
O	the
O	snake
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	speckled
O	with
O	a
O	thousand
O	extraordinary
O	colours
O	,
O	perceived
O	the
O	poor
O	creature
O	still
O	looked
O	upon
O	him
O	with
O	an
O	aspect
O	that
O	seemed
O	to
O	implore
O	compassion
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	tried
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	to
O	defend
O	itself
O	.
O	``
O	Though
O	thou
O	hast
O	such
O	a
O	mind
O	to
O	kill
O	it
O	,

O	said
O	he
O	to
O	the
O	gardener
O	,
O	``
O	yet
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	me
O	for

O	forbid

O	``
O	He
O	then
O	returned
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	carrying
O	the
O	snake
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	put
O	it
O	into
O	a
O	large
O	chamber
O	,
O	the
O	key
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	kept
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	ordered
O	bran

O	milk
O	,
O	and

O	to
O	be
O	given
O	to
O	it

O	sustenance
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	never
O	was
O	snake
O	so
O	happy
O	.
O	Leander
O	went
O	sometimes
O	to
O	see
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	it
O	perceived
O	him
O	it
O	made
O	haste
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	,
O	showing
O	him
O	all
O	the
O	little
O	marks
O	of
O	love
O	and
O	gratitude
O	of
O	which
O	a
O	poor
O	snake
O	was
O	capable
O	,

O	did
O	not

O	little
O	surprise
O	him

O	,

O	.
O	In
O	the

O	ladies
O	were
O	extremely
O	troubled
O	at

O	set
O	him
O	in

O	lap
O	,
O	took
O	up

O	it

O	corrected

O	came
O	running
O	in
O	;

O	nothing

O	Some
O	cried
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	was
O	mad
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	her
O	madness
O	proceeded

O	to
O	see
O	that
O	her
O	son
O	had
O	lost
O	one
O	ear
O	;
O	and
O	the

O	avoided

O	,

O	,
O	strawberries
O	,

O	set
O	such
O	a
O	high
O	value
O	on
O	them
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	as

O	a
O	man

O	came
O	running
O	towards
O	him
O	,
O	thinking
O	to
O	have
O	seized
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	;
O	he
O	had
O	slipped
O	behind
O	Furibon
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	bad
O	condition
O	already
O	.
O	But
O	Leander
O	played
O	him
O	one
O	trick
O	more
O	;
O	for
O	he
O	pushed
O	him
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	gravel-walk
O	,
O	and
O	frightened
O	him
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	soldiers
O	had
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	up
O	,
O	carry
O	him
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	him
O	to
O	bed
O	.
O	Satisfied
O	with
O	this
O	revenge
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	servants
O	,
O	who
O	waited
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	giving
O	them
O	money
O	,
O	sent
O	them
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	castle
O	,
O	that
O	none
O	might
O	know
O	the
O	secret
O	of
O	his
O	red
O	cap
O	and
O	roses
O	.
O	As
O	yet
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	determined
O	whither
O	to
O	go
O	;
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	mounted
O	his
O	fine
O	horse
C	Gris-de-line
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	laying
O	the
O	reins
O	upon
O	his
O	neck
O	,
O	let
O	him
O	take
O	his
O	own
O	road
O	:
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	arrived
O	in
O	a
O	forest
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	stopped
O	to
O	shelter
O	himself
O	from
O	the
O	heat
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	above
O	a
O	minute
O	there
O	before
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	lamentable
O	noise
O	of
O	sighing
O	and
O	sobbing
O	;
O	and
O	looking
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	beheld
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	ran
O	,
O	stopped
O	,
O	then
O	ran
O	again
O	,
O	sometimes
O	crying
O	,
O	sometimes
O	silent
O	,
O	then
O	tearing
O	his
O	hair
O	,
O	then
O	thumping
O	his
O	breast
O	like
O	some
O	unfortunate
O	madman
O	.
O	Yet
O	he
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	both
O	handsome
O	and
O	young
O	:
O	his
O	garments
O	had
O	been
O	magnificent
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	torn
O	them
O	all
O	to
O	tatters
O	.
O	The
C	prince
O	,
O	moved
O	with
O	compassion
O	,
O	made
O	towards
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	mildly
O	accosted
O	him
O	:
O	``
O	Sir
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	your
O	condition
O	appears
O	so
O	deplorable
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	must
O	ask

O	cause
O	of
O	your
O	sorrow
O	,

O	``
O	``
O	Oh
O	,

O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	the
O	young

O	,
O	``

O	is
O	to

O	to
O	a

O	of
O	a

O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Does
O	she
O	love
O	you
O	then
O	?
O	``
O	asked
O	Leander
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	flatter
O	myself

O	answered
O	the

O	``
O	Where

O	Leander
O	.
O	``

O	replied
O	the

O	``
O	Very

O	Leander
O	;
O	``

O	I
O	come
O	again
O	,

O	while
O	I
O	will
O	bring
O	you
O	good

O	``
O	He
O	then
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	little
O	red
O	cap
O	,
O	and
O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	hardly
O	got
O	thither
O	before
O	he
O	heard
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	music
O	;
O	he
O	entered
O	into
O	a
O	great
O	room
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	friends
O	and
O	kindred
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	and
O	the
O	young
O	lady
O	were
O	assembled
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	could
O	look
O	more
O	amiable
O	than
O	she
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	paleness
O	of
O	her
O	complexion
O	,
O	the
O	melancholy
O	that
O	appeared
O	in
O	her
O	countenance
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	tears
O	that
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	dropped
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	by
O	stealth
O	,
O	from
O	her
O	eyes
O	,
O	betrayed
O	the
O	trouble
O	of
O	her
O	mind
O	.
O	Leander
O	now
O	became
O	invisible
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	He
O	soon
O	perceived
O	the
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	of
O	the
O	bride
O	;
O	and
O	coming
O	behind
O	the
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	chair
O	,
O	whispered
O	in

O	ear
O	,
O	``
O	If

O	``
O	The
O	woman
O	,
O	frightened
O	to

O	such
O	a
O	terrible
O	sentence
O	pronounced
O	upon
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	not
O	know
O	from
O	whence
O	it
O	came
O	,
O	gave
O	a
O	loud
O	shriek
O	,
O	and
O	dropped
O	upon
O	the
O	floor
O	.
O	Her
O	husband
O	asked
O	what
O	ailed
O	her
O	:
O	she
O	cried
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	dead
O	woman
O	if
O	the
O	marriage
O	of

O	went
O	forward
O	,

O	therefore
O	she
O	would

O	consent
O	to
O	it
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	Her
O	husband
O	laughed
O	at
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	her
O	a
O	fool
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	invisible
O	Leander
O	accosting
O	the
O	man
O	,
O	threatened
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	way
O	,
O	which
O	frightened
O	him
O	so
O	terribly
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	also
O	insisted
O	on
O	the
O	marriage
O	being
O	broken
O	off
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	lover
O	complained
O	,
O	Leander
O	trod
O	hard
O	upon
O	his
O	gouty
O	toes
O	,
O	and
O	rang
O	such
O	an
O	alarum
O	in
O	his
O	ears
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	not
O	being
O	able
O	any
O	longer
O	to
O	hear
O	himself
O	speak
O	,
O	away
O	he
O	limped
O	,
O	glad
O	enough
O	to
O	go
O	.
O	The
O	real
O	lover
O	soon
O	appeared
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	fair
O	mistress
O	fell
O	joyfully
O	into
O	one
O	another
O	'
O	s
O	arms
O	,
O	the
O	parents
O	consenting
O	to
O	their
O	union
O	.
O	Leander
O	,
O	assuming
O	his
O	own
O	shape
O	,
O	appeared
O	at
O	the
O	hall-door
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	a
O	stranger
O	drawn
O	thither
O	by
O	the
O	report
O	of
O	this
O	extraordinary
O	wedding
O	.
O	From
O	hence
O	he
O	travelled
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	city
O	,
O	where
O	,
O	upon
O	his
O	arrival
O	,
O	he
O	understood
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	and
O	solemn
O	procession
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	shut
O	up
O	a
O	young
O	woman
O	,
O	against
O	her
O	will
O	,
O	among
O	the
O	vestal
O	nuns
O	.
O	The
C	prince
O	was
O	touched
O	with
O	compassion
O	;
O	and
O	thinking
O	the
O	best
O	use
O	he
O	could
O	make
O	of
O	his
O	cap
O	was
O	to
O	redress
O	public
O	wrongs
O	and
O	relieve
O	the
O	oppressed
O	,
O	he
O	flew
O	to
O	the
O	temple
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	young
O	woman
O	,
O	crowned
O	with
O	flowers
O	,
O	clad
O	in
O	white
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	her
O	dishevelled
O	hair
O	flowing
O	about
O	her
O	shoulders
O	.
O	Two
O	of
O	her
O	brothers
O	led
O	her
O	by
O	each
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	mother
O	followed
O	her
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	crowd
O	of
O	men
O	and
O	women
O	.
O	Leander
O	,
O	being
O	invisible
O	,
O	cried
O	out
O	,
O	``
O	Stop
O	,
O	stop

O	;
O	if
O	you
O	proceed
O	any
O	further
O	,
O	you
O	shall
O	be
O	squeezed
O	to
O	death
O	like
O	so
O	many
O	frogs
O	.
O	``
O	They
O	looked
O	about
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	conceive
O	from
O	whence
O	these
O	terrible
O	menaces
O	came
O	.
O	The
O	brothers
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	their
O	sister
O	'
O	s
O	lover
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	hid
O	himself
O	in
O	some
O	hole
O	;
O	at
O	which
O	Leander
O	,
O	in
O	wrath
O	,
O	took
O	a
O	long
O	cudgel
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	no
O	reason
O	to
O	say
O	the
O	blows
O	were
O	not
O	well
O	laid
O	on
O	.
O	The
O	multitude
O	fled
O	,
O	the
O	vestals
O	ran
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	Leander
O	was
O	left
O	alone
O	with
O	the
O	victim
O	;
O	immediately
O	he
O	pulled
O	off
O	his
O	red
O	cap
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	her
O	wherein
O	he
O	might
O	serve
O	her
O	.
O	She
O	answered
O	him
O	,
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	certain
O	gentleman
O	whom
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	glad
O	to

O	,
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	wanted
O	an
O	estate
O	.
O	Leander
O	then
O	shook
O	his
O	rose
O	so
O	long
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	supplied
O	them
O	with
O	ten
O	millions
O	;
O	after
O	which
O	they
O	married
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	happily
O	together
O	.
O	But
O	his
O	last
O	adventure
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	agreeable
O	.
O	Entering
O	into
O	a
O	wide
O	forest
O	,
O	he
O	heard
O	lamentable
O	cries
O	.
O	Looking
O	about
O	him
O	every
O	way
O	,
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	spied
O	four
O	men
O	well
O	armed
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	carrying
O	away
O	by
O	force
O	a

O	,
O	thirteen

O	,
O	``

O	cried
O	they
O	,
O	laughing
O	;
O	whereupon
O	the
C	prince
O	alighting
O	,
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	red
O	cap
O	,
O	not
O	thinking
O	it
O	otherwise
O	prudent
O	to

O	four

O	strong
O	enough

O	went
O	after

O	a

O	deal
O	of

O	exercise
O	.
O	Meantime
O	the
O	young
O	lady
O	continued
O	her
O	cries
O	and
O	complaints
O	:
O	``

O	seized
O	the
O	ruffian
O	that
O	held
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	bound
O	him
O	fast
O	to
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	time
O	or
O	strength
O	to
O	defend
O	himself
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	second
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	him
O	by
O	both

O	,
O	bound
O	him
O	in
O	the

O	manner
O	to
O	another
O	tree
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
C	Abricotina
O	made
O	the
O	best
O	of

O	good
O	fortune
O	,

O	herself
O	to

O	heels
O	,
O	not
O	knowing
O	which

O	she
O	went
O	.
O	But
O	Leander
O	,
O	missing
O	her
O	,
O	called
O	out
O	to
O	his
O	horse
C	Gris-de-line
O	;
O	who
O	,
O	by
O	two
O	kicks
O	with
O	his

O	,
O	rid
O	himself
O	of
O	the

O	.
O	And
O	now
O	Leander
O	only
O	wanted
O	to

C	Abricotina
O	;
O	for

O	so
O	handsome
O	that
O	he
O	wished
O	to

O	again
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	her
O	leaning
O	against
O	a

O	.
O	When

O	,
O	``

O	and
O	when

O	in
O	the

O	gallery
O	;

O	hold
O	a
O	box
O	of
O	diamonds
O	in
O	his

O	But
O	the

O	,
O	troubled
O	that

O	delight
O	the
O	princess
O	had
O	taken
O	in
O	beholding
O	the
O	monkeys
O	,
O	thought
O	of
O	nothing
O	now
O	but
O	to
O	get
O	a
O	little
O	repose
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	greatly
O	wanted
O	.
O	He
O	stayed
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	gallery
O	;
O	afterwards
O	,
O	going
O	down
O	a
O	pair

O	a

O	an
O	apartment
O	the

O	.
O	There
O	was
O	in
O	it
O	a
O	bed
O	of
O	cloth
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	enriched
O	with
O	pearls
O	,
O	intermixed
O	with
O	rubies
O	and
O	emeralds
O	;
O	for
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	there
O	appeared
O	daylight
O	sufficient
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	view
O	and
O	admire
O	the
O	magnificence
O	of
O	this
O	sumptuous
O	furniture
O	.
O	Having
O	made
O	fast
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	he
O	composed
O	himself
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	Next
O	day
O	he
O	rose
O	very
O	early
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	about
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	,
O	he
O	spied
O	a
O	painter

O	pallet
O	,
O	with
O	colours
O	ready
O	prepared
O	and

O	could
O	paint
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	most

O	)
O	seated
O	himself
O	before
O	a
O	mirror
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	his
O	own
O	picture
O	first
O	;
O	then
O	,
O	in
O	an
O	oval
O	,
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	princess
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	all
O	her
O	features
O	so
O	strong
O	in
O	his
O	imagination
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	no

O	;

O	set
O	him
O	to
O	work
O	,
O	never
O	did

O	bear
O	a
O	stronger
O	resemblance
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	painted
O	himself
O	upon
O	one
O	knee
O	,
O	holding
O	the
O	princess
O	'
O	s
O	picture
O	in

O	When

O	because
O	the

O	Rising
O	in

O	to
O	her
O	attendants
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	give
O	her
O	great
O	pleasure
O	to
O	know
O	how
O	the
O	ladies
O	were
O	dressed
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	courts
O	of
O	the
O	universe
O	.
O	There
O	needed
O	no
O	more
O	words
O	to
O	send
O	Leander
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	He
O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	China
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	bought
O	the
O	richest
O	stuffs
O	he
O	could
O	lay
O	his
O	hands
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	patterns
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	court
O	fashions
O	.
O	From
O	thence
O	he
O	flew
O	to
O	Siam
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	;
O	in
O	three
O	days
O	he
O	travelled
O	over
O	all
O	the
O	four
O	parts
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	from
O	time
O	to
O	time
O	,
O	brought
O	what
O	he
O	bought
O	to
O	the
O	Palace
O	of
O	Calm
O	Delights
O	,
O	and
O	hid
O	it
O	all
O	in
O	a
O	chamber
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	kept
O	always
O	locked
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	thus
O	collected
O	together
O	all
O	the
O	rarities
O	he
O	could
O	meet
O	with
O	--

O	he
O	never
O	wanted
O	money
O	,
O	his
O	rose
O	always
O	supplying
O	him
O	--
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	bought
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	dozen
O	of
O	dolls
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	caused
O	to
O	be
O	dressed
O	at
O	Paris
O	,
O	the
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	where
O	most
O	regard
O	is
O	paid
O	to
O	fashions
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	all
O	dressed
O	differently
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	magnificent
O	as
O	could
O	be
O	,
O	and
O	Leander
O	placed
O	them
O	all
O	in
O	the
O	princess
O	'
O	s
O	closet
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	entered
O	it
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	agreeably
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	such
O	a
O	company
O	of

O	the
O	most
O	remarkable
O	of
O	them
O	held
O	a
O	picture-box
O	in
O	its

O	the

O	opening
O	,
O	found
O	it
O	contained
O	Leander

O	She
O	gave
O	a
O	loud
O	shriek
O	,

O	looking
O	upon
C	Abricotina
O	,
O	``

O	a

O	When

O	entered

O	softly
O	that
O	Leander
O	could
O	not
O	hear
O	what

O	He
O	had
O	put
O	his
O	red
O	cap
O	on
O	,
O	that

O	might

O	at
O	first
O	;
O	but
O	having
O	taken
O	it
O	off
O	,
O	she
O	beheld

O	took
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	real
O	statue
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	observed
O	exactly
O	the
O	attitude
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	placed
O	himself
O	,
O	without
O	moving
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	a
O	finger
O	.
O	She
O	beheld
O	with
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	pleasure
O	intermixed
O	with
O	fear
O	,
O	but
O	pleasure
O	soon
O	dispelled
O	her
O	fear
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	continued
O	to
O	view
O	the
O	pleasing
O	figure
O	,
O	which
O	so
O	exactly
O	resembled
O	life
O	.
O	The
C	prince
O	having
O	tuned
O	his
O	lyre
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	play
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	the
O	princess
O	,
O	greatly
O	surprised
O	,
O	could
O	not
O	resist
O	the
O	fear
O	that
O	seized
O	her
O	;
O	she
O	grew
O	pale
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	swoon
O	.
O	Leander
O	leaped
O	from
O	the
O	pedestal
O	,
O	and
O	putting
O	on
O	his
O	little
O	red
O	cap
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	perceived
O	,
O	took
O	the
O	princess
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	her
O	all
O	the
O	assistance
O	that
O	his
O	zeal
O	and
O	tenderness
O	could
O	inspire
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	she
O	opened
O	her
O	charming
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	about
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	could
O	perceive
O	nobody
O	;
O	yet
O	she
O	felt
O	somebody
O	who
O	held
O	her
O	hands
O	,
O	kissed
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	bedewed
O	them
O	with
O	his
O	tears
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	before
O	she
O	durst
O	speak
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	spirits
O	were
O	in
O	a
O	confused
O	agitation
O	between
O	fear
O	and
O	hope
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	the
O	spirit
O	,
O	but
O	loved
O	the
O	figure
O	of
O	the
O	unknown
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	she
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	Courtly
O	invisible
O	,
O	why
O	are
O	you
O	not
O	the
O	person
O	I
O	desire
O	you
O	should
O	be
O	?
O	``
O	At
O	these
O	words
O	,
O	Leander
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	declare
O	himself
O	,
O	but
O	durst
O	not
O	do
O	it
O	yet
O	;
O	``
O	For
O	,
O	``
O	thought
O	he
O	,
O	``
O	if
O	I
O	again
O	affright
O	the
O	object
O	I
O	adore
O	,
O	and
O	make
O	her
O	fear
O	me
O	,
O	she
O	will
O	not
O	love
O	me
O	.
O	``
O	This
O	consideration
O	caused
O	him
O	to
O	keep
O	silence
O	.
O	The
O	princess
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	believing
O	herself
O	alone
O	,
O	called
C	Abricotina
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	all
O	the
O	wonders
O	of
O	the
O	animated
O	statue
O	;
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	played
O	divinely
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	invisible
O	person
O	had
O	greatly
O	assisted
O	her
O	when
O	she
O	lay
O	in
O	a
O	swoon
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	pity
O	'
O	tis
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	that

C	Abricotina
O	returned
O	with
O	these
O	ill
O	tidings
O	,
O	whereat
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	almost
O	distracted
O	;
O	and
O	this
O	was
O	soon
O	perceived
O	by
O	Leander
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	near
O	her
O	,
O	though
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	see
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	beheld
O	her
O	grief
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	pain
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	he
O	durst
O	not
O	then
O	open
O	his
O	lips
O	;
O	but
O	recollecting
O	that
O	Furibon
O	was
O	exceedingly
O	covetous
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	,
O	by
O	giving
O	him
O	a
O	sum
O	of
O	money
O	,
O	he
O	might
O	perhaps
O	prevail
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	retire
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	,
O	he
O	dressed
O	himself
O	like
O	an
O	Amazon
O	,
O	and
O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	to
O	catch
O	his
O	horse
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	called
O	him
O	than
C	Gris-de-line
O	came
O	leaping
O	,
O	prancing
O	,
O	and
O	neighing
O	for
O	joy
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	grown
O	quite
O	weary
O	of
O	being
O	so
O	long
O	absent
O	from
O	his
O	dear
O	master
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	beheld
O	him
O	dressed
O	as
O	a
O	woman
O	he
O	hardly
O	knew
O	him
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	his
O	voice
O	,
O	he
O	suffered
O	the
C	prince
O	to
O	mount
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	soon
O	arrived
O	in
O	the
O	camp
O	of
O	Furibon
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	gave
O	notice
O	that
O	a
O	lady
O	was
O	come
O	to
O	speak
O	with
O	him
O	from
O	the
C	Princess
O	of
O	Calm
O	Delights
O	.
O	Immediately
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	royal
O	robes
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	placed
O	himself
O	upon
O	his
O	throne
O	,
O	he
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	great
O	toad
O	counterfeiting
O	a
C	king
O	.
O	Leander
O	harangued
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	princess
O	,
O	preferring
O	a
O	quiet
O	and
O	peaceable
O	life
O	to
O	the
O	fatigues
O	of
O	war
O	,
O	had
O	sent
O	to
O	offer
O	his
O	majesty
O	as
O	much
O	money
O	as
O	he
O	pleased
O	to
O	demand
O	,
O	provided
O	he
O	would
O	suffer
O	her
O	to
O	continue
O	in
O	peace
O	;
O	but
O	if
O	he
O	refused
O	her
O	proposal
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	omit
O	no
O	means
O	that
O	might
O	serve
O	for
O	her
O	defence
O	.
O	Furibon
O	replied
O	that
O	he
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	grant
O	her
O	the
O	honour
O	of
O	his
O	protection
O	;
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	demanded
O	a
O	hundred
O	thousand
O	thousand
O	millions
O	of
O	pounds
O	,
O	and
O	without
O	which
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	return
O	to
O	his
O	kingdom
O	.
O	Leander
O	answered
O	that
O	such
O	a
O	vast
O	sum
O	would
O	be
O	too
O	long
O	a-counting
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	say
O	how
O	many
O	rooms
O	full
O	he
O	desired
O	to
O	have
O	,
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	generous
O	and
O	rich
O	enough
O	to
O	satisfy
O	him
O	.
O	Furibon
O	was
O	astonished
O	to
O	hear
O	that
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	entreating
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	rather
O	offer
O	more
O	;
O	and
O	it
O	came
O	into
O	his
O	wicked
O	mind
O	to
O	take
O	all
O	the
O	money
O	he
O	could
O	get
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	seize
O	the
O	Amazon
O	and
O	kill
O	her
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	never
O	return
O	to
O	her
O	mistress
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	Leander
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	thirty
O	chambers
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	all
O	full
O	to
O	the
O	ceiling
O	.
O	Leander
O	,
O	being
O	conducted
O	into
O	the
O	chambers
O	,
O	took
O	his
O	rose
O	and
O	shook
O	it
O	,
O	till
O	every
O	room
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	coin
O	.
O	Furibon
O	was
O	in
O	an
O	ecstasy
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	more
O	gold
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	greater
O	was
O	his
O	desire
O	to
O	get
O	hold
O	of
O	the
O	Amazon
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	all
O	the
O	rooms
O	were
O	full
O	,
O	he
O	commanded
O	his
O	guards
O	to
O	seize
O	her
O	,
O	alleging
O	she
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	counterfeit
O	money
O	.
O	Immediately
O	Leander
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	little
O	red
O	cap
O	and
O	disappeared
O	.
O	The
O	guards
O	,
O	believing
O	that
O	the
O	lady
O	had
O	escaped
O	,
O	ran
O	out
O	and
O	left
O	Furibon
O	alone
O	;
O	when
O	Leander
O	,
O	availing
O	himself
O	of
O	the
O	opportunity
O	,
O	took
O	the
O	tyrant
O	by
O	the
O	hair
O	,
O	and
O	twisted
O	his
O	head
O	off
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	ease
O	he
O	would
O	a
O	pullet
O	'
O	s
O	;
O	nor
O	did
O	the
O	little
O	wretch
O	of
O	a
C	king
O	see
O	the
O	hand
O	that
O	killed
O	him
O	.
O	Leander
O	having
O	got
O	his
O	enemy
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	,
O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	Palace
O	of
O	Calm
O	Delights
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	princess
O	walking
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	grief
O	considering
O	the
O	message
O	which
O	her
O	mother
O	had
O	sent
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	means
O	to
O	repel
O	Furibon
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	she
O	beheld
O	a
O	head
O	hanging
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	with
O	nobody
O	to
O	hold
O	it
O	.
O	This
O	prodigy
O	astonished
O	her
O	so
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	what
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	;
O	but
O	her
O	amazement
O	was
O	increased
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	head
O	laid
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	a
O	voice
O	utter
O	these
O	words
O	:
O	``
C	Charming
C	princess
O	,
O	cease
O	your
O	fear
O	Of
O	Furibon
O	;
O	whose
O	head
O	see
O	here
O	.
O	``
C	Abricotina
O	,
O	knowing
O	Leander
O	'
O	s
O	voice
O	,
O	cried
O	:
O	``
O	I
O	protest
O	,
O	madam
O	,
O	the
O	invisible
O	person
O	who
O	speaks

O	the
O	very
O	stranger
O	that
O	rescued
O	me
O	.
O	``
O	The
O	princess
O	seemed
O	astonished
O	,
O	but
O	yet
O	pleased
O	.
O	``
O	Oh
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	she
O	,
O	``

O	the
O	same
O	person
O	,
O	I
O	confess
O	I
O	shall
O	be
O	glad
O	to

O	him
O	my
O	acknowledgments
O	.
O	``
O	Leander
O	,
O	still
O	invisible
O	,
O	replied
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	yet
O	do
O	more
O	to
O	deserve
O	them
O	;
O	``
O	and
O	so
O	saying
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	Furibon
O	'
O	s
O	army
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	report
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	death
O	was
O	already
O	spread
O	throughout
O	the
O	camp
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	Leander
O	appeared
O	there
O	in
O	his
O	usual
O	habit
O	,
O	everybody
O	knew
O	him
O	;
O	all
O	the
O	officers
O	and
O	soldiers
O	surrounded
O	him
O	,
O	uttering
O	the
O	loudest
O	acclamations
O	of
O	joy
O	.
O	In
O	short
O	,
O	they
O	acknowledged
O	him
O	for
O	their
C	king
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	crown
O	of
O	right
O	belonged
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	which
O	he
O	thanked
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	first
O	mark
O	of
O	his
O	royal
O	bounty
O	,
O	divided
O	the
O	thirty
O	rooms
O	of
O	gold
O	among
O	the
O	soldiers
O	.
O	This
O	done
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	princess
O	,
O	ordering
O	the
O	army
O	to
O	march
O	back
O	into
O	his
O	kingdom
O	.
O	The
O	princess
O	was
O	gone
O	to
O	bed
O	.
O	Leander
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	retired
O	into
O	his
O	own
O	apartment
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	sleepy
O	--
O	so
O	sleepy
O	that
O	he
O	forgot
O	to
O	bolt
O	his
O	door
O	;
O	and
O	so
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	the
O	princess
O	,
O	rising
O	early
O	to
O	taste
O	the
O	morning
O	air
O	,
O	chanced
O	to
O	enter
O	into
O	this
O	very
O	chamber
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	greatly
O	astonished
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	young
C	prince
O	asleep
O	upon
O	the
O	bed
O	.
O	She
O	took
O	a
O	full
O	view
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	convinced
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	person
O	whose
O	picture
O	she
O	had
O	in
O	her
O	diamond
O	box
O	.
O	``
O	It
O	is
O	impossible
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	that
O	this
O	should
O	be
O	a
O	spirit
O	;
O	for
O	can
O	spirits

O	?
O	Is
O	this
O	a
O	body
O	composed
O	of
O	air
O	and
O	fire
O	,
O	without
O	substance
O	,
O	as
C	Abricotina
O	told
O	me
O	?
O	``
O	She
O	softly
O	touched
O	his
O	hair
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	him
O	breathe
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	him
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	could
O	have
O	looked
O	for
O	ever
O	.
O	While
O	she
O	was
O	thus
O	occupied
O	,
O	her
O	mother
O	,
O	the
C	fairy
O	,
O	entered
O	with
O	such
O	a
O	dreadful
O	noise
O	that
O	Leander
O	started
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	sleep
O	.
O	But
O	how
O	deeply
O	was
O	he
O	afflicted
O	,
O	to
O	behold
O	his
O	beloved
O	princess
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	deplorable
O	condition
O	!
O	Her
O	mother
O	dragged
O	her
O	by
O	the
O	hair
O	,
O	and
O	loaded
O	her
O	with
O	a
O	thousand
O	bitter
O	reproaches
O	.
O	In
O	what
O	grief
O	and
O	consternation
O	were
O	the
O	two
O	young
O	lovers
O	,
O	who
O	saw
O	themselves
O	now
O	upon
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	being
O	separated
O	for
O	ever
O	!
O	The
O	princess
O	durst
O	not
O	open
O	her
O	lips
O	,
O	but
O	cast
O	her
O	eyes
O	upon
O	Leander
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	to
O	beg
O	his
O	assistance
O	.
O	He
O	judged
O	rightly
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	ought
O	not
O	to
O	deal
O	rudely
O	with
O	a
O	power
O	superior
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	he
O	sought
O	,
O	by
O	his
O	eloquence
O	and
O	submission
O	,
O	to
O	move
O	the
O	incensed
C	fairy
O	.
O	He
O	ran
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	threw
O	himself
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	besought
O	her
O	to
O	have
O	pity
O	upon
O	a
O	young
C	prince
O	,
O	who
