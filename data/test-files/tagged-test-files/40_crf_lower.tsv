O	i
O	soon
O	again
O	grew
O	weary
O	of
O	living
O	a
O	life
O	of
O	idleness
O	,
O	and
O	hardening
O	myself
O	against
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	any
O	danger
O	,
O	i
O	embarked
O	with
O	some
O	merchants
O	on
O	another
O	long
O	voyage
O	.
O	we
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	ports
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	traded
O	.
O	one
O	day
O	we
O	were
O	overtaken
O	by
O	a
O	dreadful
O	tempest
O	,
O	which
O	drove
O	us
O	from
O	our
O	course
O	.
O	the
O	storm
O	continued
O	several
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	us
O	before
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	an
O	island
O	,
O	which
O	the
C	captain
O	was
O	very
O	unwilling
O	to
O	enter
O	;
O	but
O	we
O	were
O	obliged
O	to
O	cast
O	anchor
O	.
O	when
O	we
O	had
O	furled
O	our
O	sails
O	,
O	the
C	captain
O	told
O	us
O	that
O	this
O	and
O	some
O	other
O	neighboring
O	islands
O	were
O	inhabited
O	by
O	hairy
O	savages
O	,
O	who
O	would
O	speedily
O	attack
O	us
O	;
O	and
O	though
O	they
O	were
O	but
C	dwarfs
O	,
O	yet
O	that
O	we
O	must
O	make
O	no
O	resistance
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	more
O	in
O	number
O	than
O	the
O	locusts
O	;
O	and
O	if
O	we
O	happened
O	to
O	kill
O	one
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	all
O	fall
O	upon
O	us
O	and
O	destroy
O	us
O	.
O	we
O	soon
O	found
O	that
O	what
O	the
C	captain
O	had
O	told
O	us
O	was
O	but
O	too
O	true
O	.
O	an
O	innumerable
O	multitude
O	of
O	frightful
O	savages
O	,
O	about
O	two
O	feet
O	high
O	,
O	covered
O	all
O	over
O	with
O	red
O	hair
O	,
O	came
O	swimming
O	toward
O	us
O	and
O	encompassed
O	our
O	ship
O	.
O	they
O	chattered
O	as
O	they
O	came
O	near
O	,
O	but
O	we
O	understood
O	not
O	their
O	language
O	.
O	they
O	climbed
O	up
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	with
O	such
O	agility
O	as
O	surprised
O	us
O	.
O	they
O	took
O	down
O	our
O	sails
O	,
O	cut
O	the
O	cable
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	hauling
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	made
O	us
O	all
O	get
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	afterward
O	carried
O	the
O	ship
O	into
O	another
O	island
O	,
O	whence
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	.
O	as
O	we
O	advanced
O	,
O	we
O	perceived
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	a
O	vast
O	pile
O	of
O	building
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	toward
O	it
O	.
O	we
O	found
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	palace
O	,
O	elegantly
O	built
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	lofty
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	gate
O	of
O	ebony
O	of
O	two
O	leaves
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	opened
O	.
O	we
O	saw
O	before
O	us
O	a
O	large
O	apartment
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	porch
O	,
O	having
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	a
O	heap
O	of
O	human
O	bones
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	a
O	vast
O	number
O	of
O	roasting
O	-
O	spits
O	.
O	we
O	trembled
O	at
O	this
O	spectacle
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	seized
O	with
O	deadly
O	apprehension
O	,
O	when
O	suddenly
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	apartment
O	opened
O	with
O	a
O	loud
O	crash
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	came
O	out
O	the
O	horrible
O	figure
O	of
O	a
O	black
O	man
O	,
O	as
O	tall
O	as
O	a
O	lofty
O	palm
O	-
O	tree
O	.
O	he
O	had
O	but
O	one
O	eye
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	his
O	forehead
O	,
O	where
O	it
O	blazed
O	bright
O	as
O	a
O	burning
O	coal
O	.
O	his
O	fore
O	teeth
O	were
O	very
O	long
O	and
O	sharp
O	,
O	and
O	stood
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	as
O	deep
O	as
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	horse
O	.
O	his
O	upper
O	lip
O	hung
O	down
O	upon
O	his
O	breast
O	.
O	his
O	ears
O	resembled
O	those
O	of
O	an
O	elephant
O	,
O	and
O	covered
O	his
O	shoulders
O	;
O	and
O	his
O	nails
O	were
O	as
O	long
O	and
O	crooked
O	as
O	the
O	talons
O	of
O	the
O	greatest
O	birds
O	.
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	so
O	frightful
O	a
C	genie
O	,
O	we
O	became
O	insensible
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	like
O	dead
O	men
O	.
O	at
O	last
O	we
O	came
O	to
O	ourselves
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	him
O	sitting
O	in
O	the
O	porch
O	looking
O	at
O	us
O	.
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	considered
O	us
O	well
O	,
O	he
O	advanced
O	toward
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	laying
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	me
O	,
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	nape
O	of
O	my
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	turned
O	me
O	round
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	butcher
O	would
O	do
O	a
O	sheep
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	.
O	after
O	having
O	examined
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	perceiving
O	me
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	lean
O	that
O	i
O	had
O	nothing
O	but
O	skin
O	and
O	bone
O	,
O	he
O	let
O	me
O	go
O	.
O	he
O	took
O	up
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	viewed
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	.
O	the
C	captain
O	being
O	the
O	fattest
O	,
O	he
O	held
O	him
O	with
O	one
O	hand
O	,
O	as
O	i
O	would
O	do
O	a
O	sparrow
O	,
O	and
O	thrust
O	a
O	spit
O	through
O	him
O	;
O	he
O	then
O	kindled
O	a
O	great
O	fire
O	,
O	roasted
O	,
O	and
O	ate
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	apartment
O	for
O	his
O	supper
O	.
O	having
O	finished
O	his
O	repast
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	porch
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	,
O	snoring
O	louder
O	than
O	thunder
O	.
O	he
O	slept
O	thus
O	till
O	morning
O	.
O	as
O	to
O	ourselves
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	possible
O	for
O	us
O	to
O	enjoy
O	any
O	rest
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	we
O	passed
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	painful
O	apprehension
O	that
O	can
O	be
O	imagined
O	.
O	when
O	day
O	appeared
O	the
C	giant
O	awoke
O	,
O	got
O	up
O	,
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	us
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	the
O	next
O	night
O	we
O	determined
O	to
O	revenge
O	ourselves
O	on
O	the
O	brutish
C	giant
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	so
O	in
O	the
O	following
O	manner
O	.
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	again
O	finished
O	his
O	inhuman
O	supper
O	on
O	another
O	of
O	our
O	seamen
O	,
O	he
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	we
O	heard
O	him
O	snore
O	according
O	to
O	his
O	custom
O	,
O	nine
O	of
O	the
O	boldest
O	among
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	myself
O	,
O	took
O	each
O	of
O	us
O	a
O	spit
O	,
O	and
O	putting
O	the
O	points
O	of
O	them
O	into
O	his
O	fire
O	till
O	they
O	were
O	burning
O	hot
O	,
O	we
O	thrust
O	them
O	into
O	his
O	eye
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	blinded
O	him
O	.
O	the
O	pain
O	made
O	him
O	break
O	out
O	into
O	a
O	frightful
O	yell
O	:
O	he
O	started
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	stretched
O	out
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	sacrifice
O	i
O	some
O	of
O	us
O	to
O	his
O	rage
O	;
O	but
O	we
O	ran
O	to
O	such
O	places
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	reach
O	;
O	and
O	after
O	having
O	sought
O	for
O	us
O	in
O	vain
O	,
O	he
O	groped
O	for
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	howling
O	in
O	agony
O	.
O	we
O	immediately
O	left
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	made
O	some
O	rafts
O	,
O	each
O	large
O	enough
O	to
O	carry
O	three
O	men
O	,
O	with
O	some
O	timber
O	that
O	lay
O	about
O	in
O	great
O	quantities
O	.
O	we
O	waited
O	till
O	day
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	get
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	we
O	hoped
O	if
O	the
C	giant
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	by
O	sunrising
O	,
O	and
O	give
O	over
O	his
O	howling
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	still
O	heard
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	prove
O	to
O	be
O	dead
O	;
O	and
O	if
O	that
O	happened
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	case
O	,
O	we
O	resolved
O	to
O	stay
O	in
O	that
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	to
O	risk
O	our
O	lives
O	upon
O	the
O	rafts
O	.
O	but
O	day
O	had
O	scarcely
O	appeared
O	when
O	we
O	perceived
O	our
O	cruel
O	enemy
O	,
O	accompanied
O	by
O	two
O	others
O	,
O	almost
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	size
O	,
O	leading
O	him
O	;
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	more
O	coming
O	before
O	him
O	at
O	a
O	quick
O	pace
O	.
O	we
O	did
O	not
O	hesitate
O	to
O	take
O	to
O	our
O	rafts
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	to
O	sea
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	speed
O	we
O	could
O	.
O	the
O	giants
O	,
O	who
O	perceived
O	this
O	,
O	took
O	up
O	great
O	stones
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	running
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	entered
O	the
O	water
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	middle
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	so
O	exactly
O	that
O	they
O	sunk
O	all
O	the
O	rafts
O	but
O	that
O	i
O	was
O	upon
O	;
O	and
O	all
O	my
O	companions
O	except
O	the
O	two
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	were
O	drowned
O	.
O	we
O	rowed
O	with
O	all
O	our
O	might
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	reach
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	.
O	but
O	when
O	we
O	got
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	,
O	we
O	were
O	exposed
O	to
O	the
O	mercy
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	and
O	winds
O	,
O	and
O	spent
O	that
O	day
O	and
O	the
O	following
O	night
O	under
O	the
O	most
O	painful
O	uncertainty
O	as
O	to
O	our
O	fate
O	;
O	but
O	next
O	morning
O	we
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	fortune
O	to
O	be
O	thrown
O	upon
O	an
O	island
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	landed
O	with
O	much
O	joy
O	.
O	we
O	found
O	excellent
O	fruit
O	,
O	which
O	afforded
O	us
O	great
O	relief
O	,
O	and
O	recruited
O	our
O	strength
O	.
O	at
O	night
O	we
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	on
O	the
O	sea
O	-
O	shore
O	;
O	but
O	were
O	awakened
O	by
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	a
O	serpent
O	of
O	surprising
O	length
O	and
O	thickness
O	,
O	whose
O	scales
O	made
O	a
O	rustling
O	noise
O	as
O	he
O	wound
O	himself
O	along
O	.
O	it
O	swallowed
O	up
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	comrades
O	,
O	notwithstanding
O	his
O	loud
O	cries
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	efforts
O	he
O	made
O	to
O	extricate
O	himself
O	from
O	it
O	;
O	dashing
O	him
O	several
O	times
O	against
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	it
O	crushed
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	could
O	hear
O	it
O	gnaw
O	and
O	tear
O	the
O	poor
O	fellow
O	'
O	s
O	bones
O	,
O	though
O	we
O	had
O	fled
O	to
O	a
O	considerable
O	distance
O	.
O	the
O	following
O	day
O	,
O	to
O	our
O	great
O	terror
O	,
O	we
O	saw
O	the
O	serpent
O	again
O	,
O	when
O	i
O	exclaimed
O	,
O	""""
O	o
O	heaven
O	,
O	to
O	what
O	dangers
O	are
O	we
O	exposed
O	!
O	we
O	rejoiced
O	yesterday
O	at
O	having
O	escaped
O	from
O	the
O	cruelty
O	of
O	a

O	,
O	now
O	are
O	we
O	fallen
O	into
O	another
O	danger
O	equally
O	dreadful
O	.
O	""""
O	as
O	we
O	walked
O	about
O	we
O	saw
O	a
O	large
O	,
O	tall
O	tree
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	we
O	designed
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	following
O	night
O	for
O	our
O	security
O	;
O	and
O	having
O	satisfied
O	our
O	hunger
O	with
O	fruit
O	,
O	we
O	mounted
O	it
O	accordingly
O	.
O	shortly
O	after
O	the
O	serpent
O	came
O	hissing
O	to
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	;
O	raised
O	itself
O	up
O	against
O	the
O	trunk
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	meeting
O	with
O	my
O	comrade
O	,
O	who
O	sat
O	lower
O	than
O	i
O	,
O	swallowed
O	him
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	off
O	.
O	i
O	remained
O	upon
O	the
O	tree
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	came
O	down
O	,
O	more
O	like
O	a
O	dead
O	man
O	than
O	one
O	alive
O	,
O	expecting
O	the
O	same
O	fate
O	with
O	my
O	two
O	companions
O	.
O	this
O	filled
O	me
O	with
O	horror
O	,
O	and
O	i
O	advanced
O	some
O	steps
O	to
O	throw
O	myself
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	;
O	but
O	i
O	withstood
O	this
O	dictate
O	of
O	despair
O	,
O	and
O	submitted
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	god
O	,
O	who
O	disposes
O	of
O	our
O	lives
O	at
O	his
O	pleasure
O	.
O	in
O	the
O	meantime
O	i
O	collected
O	together
O	a
O	great
O	quantity
O	of
O	small
O	wood
O	,
O	brambles
O	,
O	and
O	dry
O	thorns
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	them
O	up
O	into
O	fagots
O	,
O	made
O	a
O	wide
O	circle
O	with
O	them
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	tied
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	branches
O	over
O	my
O	head
O	.
O	having
O	done
O	this
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	evening
O	came
O	,
O	i
O	shut
O	myself
O	up
O	within
O	this
O	circle
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	melancholy
O	satisfaction
O	that
O	i
O	had
O	neglected
O	nothing
O	which
O	could
O	preserve
O	me
O	from
O	the
O	cruel
O	destiny
O	with
O	which
O	i
O	was
O	threatened
O	.
O	the
O	serpent
O	failed
O	not
O	to
O	come
O	at
O	the
O	usual
O	hour
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	seeking
O	for
O	an
O	opportunity
O	to
O	devour
O	me
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	prevented
O	by
O	the
O	rampart
O	i
O	had
O	made
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	lay
O	till
O	day
O	,
O	like
O	a
C	cat
O	watching
O	in
O	vain
O	for
O	a
O	mouse
O	that
O	has
O	fortunately
O	reached
O	a
O	place
O	of
O	safety
O	.
O	when
O	day
O	appeared
O	he
O	retired
O	,
O	but
O	i
O	dared
O	not
O	leave
O	my
O	fort
O	until
O	the
O	sun
O	arose
O	.
O	god
O	took
O	compassion
O	on
O	my
O	hopeless
O	state
O	;
O	for
O	just
O	as
O	i
O	was
O	going
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	fit
O	of
O	desperation
O	,
O	to
O	throw
O	myself
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	i
O	perceived
O	a
O	ship
O	in
O	the

O	i
O	called
O	as
O	loud
O	as

O	could
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	unfolding
O	the
O	linen
O	of
O	my
O	turban
O	,
O	displayed
O	it
O	that
O	they
O	might

O	this
O	had
O	the
O	desired
