C	Ali

O	married
O	a

O	,
O	and

O	soon

O	returning

O	the

O	declared
O	by
O	all
O	worthy

O	He
O	condemned
O	himself
O	,
O	acknowledging
O	that
O	he
O	ought
O	to
O	have
O	taken

O	intruder
O	into
O	the
O	cave
O	,
O	another

O	himself
O	that

O	The
O	robber
O	,
O	at
O	his

O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	looked

O	of
O	distinguishing
C	Ali

O	the
O	others
O	;
O	and
O	the
C	captain
O	and
O	all
O	of
O	them
O	thought
O	it
O	must
O	succeed
O	.
O	They
O	conveyed
O	themselves
O	into
O	the
O	town
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	precaution
O	as
O	before
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	robber
O	and
O	his
C	captain
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	street

O	found
O	the
O	same
O	difficulty
O	;
O	at

O	the
C	captain
O	was
O	enraged

O	the
O	robber
O	in
O	as
O	great
O	confusion

O	his
O	predecessor
O	.
O	Thus
O	the
C	captain
O	and
O	his

O	were
O	forced
O	to
O	retire
O	a

O	much

O	dissatisfied

O	He
O	found
O	by

O	to

O	oil
O	-

O	,

O	,
O	put
O	out

O	then

O	not

O	perceiving
O	anything
O	whereby

O	could
O	judge
O	that

O	companions
O	stirred
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	grow
O	very
O	uneasy
O	,
O	threw
O	stones
O	a
O	second
O	and
O	also
O	a
O	third

O	,
O	and
O	could

O	the
O	reason
O	that
O	none
O	of
O	them
O	should
O	answer
O	his
O	signal
O	.
O	Much
O	alarmed
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	softly
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	yard
O	,
O	and
O	going
O	to
O	the
O	first

O	,
O	while
O	asking
O	the

O	,

C	Ali

O	,
O	enraged
O	to

O	at

O	in
