O	at
O	this
O	strange
O	adventure
O	,
O	he
O	suddenly
O	found
O	a
O	mist
O	before
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	felt
O	himself
O	lifted
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	by
O	some
O	extraordinary
O	power
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	desert
O	fairy
O	had
O	fallen
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	to
O	secure
O	him
O	for
O	herself
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	she
O	carried
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	frightful
O	cavern
O	,
O	hoping
O	he
O	would
O	there
O	forget
O	all-fair
O	.
O	but
O	finding
O	this
O	scheme
O	ineffectual
O	,
O	she
O	resolved
O	to
O	carry
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	place
O	altogether
O	as
O	pleasant
O	as
O	the
O	other
O	was
O	terrible
O	;
O	and
O	accordingly
O	placed
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	chariot
O	drawn
O	by
O	swans
O	.
O	in
O	passing
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	unspeakably
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	his
O	beloved
O	princess
O	in
O	a
O	castle
O	of
O	polished
O	steel
O	,
O	leaning
O	her
O	head
O	on
O	one
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	wiping
O	away
O	her
O	tears
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	she
O	happened
O	to
O	look
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	the
O	mortification
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	king
O	sitting
O	by
O	the
O	fairy
O	who
O	then
O	,
O	by
O	her
O	art
O	,
O	made
O	herself
O	appear
O	extremely
O	beautiful
O	.
O	had
O	not
O	the
O	king
O	been
O	sensible
O	of
O	the
O	fairy
O	'
O	s
O	power
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	certainly
O	have
O	tried
O	to
O	free
O	himself
O	from
O	her
O	by
O	some
O	means
O	or
O	other
O	;
O	but
O	he
O	knew
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	in
O	vain
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	made
O	believe
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	liking
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	stately
O	palace
O	,
O	fenced
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	by
O	walls
O	of
O	emeralds
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	by
O	a
O	boisterous
O	sea
O	.
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	by
O	pretending
O	an
O	attachment
O	to
O	the
O	fairy
O	,
O	obtained
O	the
O	liberty
O	to
O	walk
O	by
O	himself
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	there
O	,
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	voice
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	after
O	was
O	surprised
O	by
O	the
O	appearance
O	of
O	a
O	mermaid
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	swimming
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	pleasing
O	smile
O	,
O	spoke
O	to
O	this
O	effect
O	:
O	--
O	``

O	boldly
O	advanced
