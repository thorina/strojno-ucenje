O	Once

O	was
O	asleep
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	mouse
O	began
O	running
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	on
O	him
O	.
O	This
O	soon
O	awakened
O	the
O	lion
O	,
O	who
O	placed
O	his
O	huge
O	paw
O	on
O	the
O	mouse
O	,

O	opened
O	his

O	The
O	Lion
O	was
O	so
O	tickled
O	by
O	the
O	idea
O	of
O	the
O	mouse
O	being

O	the

O	tied
O	him
O	to
O	a

O	in

O	On

O	plight
O	,
O	he
O	ran
O	up
