C	Once

O	a
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	an
O	only
O	daughter
O	.
O	Her
O	incomparable
O	beauty
O	,
O	sweetness
O	,
O	and
O	intelligence
O	caused
O	her
O	to
O	be
O	named
C	Graciosa
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	all
O	her
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	joy
O	.
O	Every
O	day
O	she
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	a
O	different
O	dress
O	,
O	of
O	gold
O	brocade
O	,
O	velvet
O	,
O	or
O	satin
O	;
O	yet
O	she
O	was
O	neither
O	conceited
O	nor
O	boastful
O	.
O	She
O	used
O	to
O	pass
O	her
O	mornings
O	in
O	study
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	she
O	sat
O	sewing
O	by
O	the
C	queen
O	'
O	s
O	side
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	plenty
O	of
O	play
O	-
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	sweetmeats
O	without
O	end
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	altogether
O	the
O	happiest
C	princess
O	alive
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	same
O	court
O	was
O	an
O	elderly
O	young
O	lady
O	named
C	Duchess
C	Grognon
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	very
O	opposite
O	of
C	Graciosa
O	.
O	Her
O	hair
O	was
O	fiery
O	red
O	,
O	her
O	face
O	fat
O	and
O	spotty
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	had
O	but
O	one
O	eye
O	.
O	Her
O	mouth
O	was
O	so
O	big
O	that
O	you
O	might
O	have
O	thought
O	she
O	could
O	eat
O	you
O	up
O	,
O	only
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	teeth
O	to
O	do
O	it
O	with
O	;
O	she
O	was
O	also
O	humpbacked
O	and
O	lame
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	her
O	ugliness
O	,
O	and
O	nobody
O	would
O	have
O	disliked
O	her
O	for
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	of
O	such
O	an
O	unpleasant
O	temper
O	that
O	she
O	hated
O	everything
O	sweet
O	and
O	beautiful
O	,
O	and
O	especially
C	Graciosa
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	also
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	opinion
O	of
O	herself
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	any
O	one
O	praised
O	the
C	princess
O	,
O	would
O	say
