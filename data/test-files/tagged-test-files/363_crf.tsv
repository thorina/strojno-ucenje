O	At

O	,
O	and
O	by
O	ones
O	and
O	twos
O	the
O	knights
O	came
O	back
O	to

O	,
O	though

O	so

O	never

O	Great
O	was
O	the

C	Arthur
O	when

O	and

O	that
O	almost
O	he
O	had
O	feared
O	that

O	had
O	perished
O	.
O	In
O	their
O	honor
O	there
O	was
O	high
O	festival
O	for
O	many
O	days
O	in

O	,
O	where
O	Arthur
O	then
O	had
O	his
O	court
O	;
O	and
O	the

O	made
O	proclamation
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	tournament
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	hold
O	at

O	,
O	when

O	would
O	keep
O	the

O	So
O	,
O	one
O	fair
O	morning
O	of

O	,
C	King
C	Arthur
O	made
O	ready

O	and
O	all
O	his

O	with

O	,
O	saying
O	that

O	But
