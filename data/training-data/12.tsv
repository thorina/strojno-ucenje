O	There
O	lived
O	in
O	Norway
O	,
O	not

O	from
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Drontheim
O	,
O	a
O	rich
O	and
O	prosperous
O	gentleman
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	an
O	only
O	daughter
O	,
O	called
C	Aslog
O	,
O	the
O	fame
O	of
O	whose
O	beauty
O	spread
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	.
O	The
O	greatest
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	sought
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	were
O	alike
O	unsuccessful
O	in
O	their
O	suit
O	.
O	Her
C	father
O	,
O	who
O	thought
O	his
O	daughter
O	delayed
O	her
O	choice
O	only
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	choose
O	the
O	better
O	,
O	forbore
O	to
O	interfere
O	,
O	and
O	exulted
O	in
O	her
O	prudence
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	,
O	at
O	length
O	,
O	the
O	richest
O	and
O	noblest
O	had
O	tried
O	their
O	fortune
O	with
O	as
O	little
O	success
O	as
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	he
O	grew
O	angry
O	,
O	called
O	his
O	daughter
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	:
O	--
O	""""
O	Hitherto

O	since
O	I
O	see

O	""""
O	Now
C	Aslog
O	secretly
O	loved
O	a
O	youth
O	named
C	Orm
O	,
O	handsome
O	,
O	noble
O	and
O	brave
O	.
O	She
O	loved
O	him
O	with
O	her
O	whole
O	soul
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	sooner
O	die
O	than
O	bestow
O	her
O	hand
O	on
O	another
O	.
O	But
C	Orm
O	was
O	poor
O	,
O	and
O	poverty
O	compelled
O	him
O	to
O	keep
O	his
O	love
O	as
O	secret
O	as
O	her
O	own
O	.
O	When
C	Aslog
O	saw
O	the
O	darkness
O	of
O	her
C	father
O	'
O	s
O	countenance
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	his
O	angry
O	words
O	,
O	she
O	turned
O	pale
O	as
O	death
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	his
O	temper
O	,
O	and
O	doubted
O	not
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	put
O	his
O	threats
O	into
O	execution
O	.
O	Without
O	uttering
O	a
O	word
O	in
O	reply
O	,
O	she
O	retired
O	to
O	her
O	chamber
O	,
O	and
O	pondered
O	vainly
O	how
O	to
O	escape
O	the
O	storm
O	that
O	hung
O	over
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	great
O	festival
O	approached
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	anguish
O	increased
O	every
O	day
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	lovers
O	resolved
O	on
O	flight
O	.
C	Orm
O	knew
O	a
O	secure
O	place
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	could
O	hide
O	until
O	they
O	found
O	an
O	opportunity
O	of
O	quitting
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	So
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	were
O	asleep
O	,
O	he
O	led
O	the
O	trembling
C	Aslog
O	over
O	the
O	snow
O	and
O	ice-fields
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	mountains
O	.
O	The
O	moon
O	and
O	the
O	stars
O	lighted
O	them
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	under
O	their
O	arms
O	a
O	few
O	articles
O	of
O	dress
O	and
O	some
O	skins
O	of
O	animals
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	all
O	they
O	could
O	carry
O	.
O	They
O	ascended
O	the
O	mountains
O	the
O	whole
O	night
O	long
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	reached
O	a
O	lonely
O	spot
O	inclosed
O	with
O	lofty
O	rocks
O	.
O	Here
C	Orm
O	conducted
O	the
O	weary
C	Aslog
O	into
O	a
O	cave
O	,
O	the
O	low
O	and
O	narrow
O	entrance
O	to
O	which
O	was
O	hardly
O	perceptible
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	soon
O	enlarged
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	hall
O	,
O	reaching
O	deep
O	into
O	the
O	mountain
O	.
O	He
O	kindled
O	a
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	now
O	,
O	reposing
O	on
O	their
O	skins
O	,
O	sat
O	in
O	the
O	deepest
O	solitude
O	far
O	away
O	from
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	.
C	Orm
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	who
O	had
O	discovered
O	this
O	cave
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	shown
O	to
O	this
O	very
O	day
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	no
O	one
O	then
O	knew
O	anything
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	safe
O	from
O	the
O	pursuit
O	of
C	Aslog
O	'
O	s
C	father
O	.
O	They
O	passed
O	the
O	whole
O	winter
O	in
O	this
O	retirement
O	,
O	contented
O	and
O	even
O	happy
O	;
O	for
O	they
O	knew
O	they
O	were
O	married
O	,
O	and
O	belonged
O	to
O	one
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	cruel
C	father
O	could
O	separate
O	them
O	more
O	.
C	Orm
O	used
O	to
O	go
O	a-hunting
O	,
O	and
C	Aslog
O	stayed
O	at
O	home
O	in
O	the
O	cave
O	,
O	minded
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	prepared
O	the
O	necessary
O	food
O	.
O	Frequently
O	did
O	she
O	mount
O	the
O	points
O	of
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	but
O	her
O	eyes
O	,
O	did
O	they
O	wander
O	ever
O	so
O	far
O	,
O	saw
O	only
O	glittering
O	snow-fields
O	.
O	The
O	spring
O	now
O	came
O	on
O	--
O	the
O	woods
O	were
O	green
O	--
O	the
O	meadows
O	put
O	on
O	their
O	various
O	colors
O	,
O	people
O	began
O	to
O	wander
O	out
O	for
O	summer
O	pleasuring
O	,
O	and
C	Aslog
O	could
O	but
O	rarely
O	and
O	with
O	circumspection
O	venture
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	cave
O	.
O	One
O	evening
C	Orm
O	came
O	in
O	with
O	the
O	intelligence
O	that

O	had
O	recognised

O	servants
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	,
O	and
O	that

O	They
O	accordingly

O	,

O	reached
O	the

O	off
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boat
O	drove
O	into
O	the
O	open

O	.
O	They
O	had

O	At

C	Orm
O	lived
O	without

O	,
O	contented

O	.
C	Orm
O	never

O	without
O	getting
O	a

O	evidently

O	When

O	they

O	up

O	fire
O	on
O	the
O	hearth
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	twilight
O	approached
O	they
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	loft
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	remained
O	quite
O	still
O	and
O	quiet
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	it
O	grew
O	dark
O	;
O	they
O	thought

O	heard
O	a
O	sound
O	of
O	whizzing
O	and
O	snorting
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	the
O	swans
O	used
O	to
O	make
O	in
O	the
O	winter
O	time
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	roof
O	over
O	the
O	fireplace
O	,

O	the
O	light

O	,
O	or
O	to
O	afford
O	a
O	free
O	passage
O	for
O	the
O	smoke
O	.
C	Orm
O	lifted
O	up
O	the
O	lid
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	a
O	skin
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	out
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	But
O	what
O	a
O	wonderful
O	sight
O	then
O	presented
O	itself
O	to
O	his
O	eyes
O	!
O	The
O	little
O	islands
O	around
O	were
O	all
O	lit
O	up
O	with
O	countless
O	blue
O	lights
O	,
O	which
O	moved
O	about
O	without
O	ceasing
O	,
O	jumped
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	,
O	then
O	skipped
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	assembled
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	to
O	the
O	large
O	island
O	where
C	Orm
O	and
C	Aslog
O	lived
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	they
O	reached
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	arranged
O	themselves
O	in
O	a
O	circle
O	around
O	a
O	large
O	stone
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	which
C	Orm
O	well
O	knew
O	.
O	But
O	what
O	was
O	his
O	surprise
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	stone
O	had
O	now
O	completely
O	assumed
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	though
O	a
O	monstrous
O	and
O	gigantic
O	one
O	!
O	He
O	could
O	clearly
O	perceive
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	blue
O	lights
O	were
O	borne
O	by
C	Dwarfs
O	whose
O	pale
O	clay-coloured
O	faces
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	huge
O	noses
O	and
O	red
O	eyes
O	,
O	disfigured
O	too
O	by
O	birds
O	'
O	bills
O	and
O	owls
O	'
O	eyes
O	,
O	were
O	supported
O	by
O	misshapen
O	bodies
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	tottered
O	and
O	wabbled
O	about
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	merry
O	and
O	in
O	pain
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	the
O	circle
O	opened
O	;
O	the
O	little
O	ones
O	retired
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	,
O	and
C	Guru
O	was
O	the
O	woman
C	Guru
O	,
O	whom
C	Orm
O	recognised
O	immediately
O	,
O	though
O	she
O	had
O	risen
O	in
O	stature
O	and
O	size
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	be
O	almost
O	as
O	gigantic
O	as
O	the
O	stone
O	man
O	--
O	advanced
O	towards
O	it
O	.
O	She
O	threw
O	both
O	her
O	arms
O	round
O	the
O	image
O	,
O	which
O	immediately
O	seemed
O	to
O	receive
O	life
O	and
O	motion
O	.
O	Then
O	the
C	Dwarfs
O	,
O	with
O	wonderful
O	capers
O	and
O	grimaces
O	,
O	began
O	a
O	song
O	,
O	or
O	,
O	to
O	speak
O	more
O	properly
O	,
O	a
O	howl
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	the
O	whole
O	island
O	resounded
O	and
O	almost
O	trembled
O	at
O	the
O	noise
O	.
C	Orm
O	,
O	quite
O	terrified
O	,
O	drew
O	in
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	and
C	Aslog
O	remained
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	,
O	so
O	still
O	that
O	they
O	hardly
O	ventured
O	to
O	draw
O	their
O	breath
O	.
O	The
O	procession
O	moved
O	on
O	towards
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	as
O	might
O	be
O	clearly
O	perceived
O	by
O	the
O	nearer
O	approach
O	of
O	the
O	shouting
O	and
O	crying
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	now
O	all
O	come
O	in
O	,
O	light
O	and
O	active
O	;
O	the
C	Dwarfs
O	were
O	heard
O	jumping
O	about
O	on
O	the
O	benches
O	,
O	and
O	heavy
O	and
O	loud
O	sounded
O	at
O	intervals
O	the
O	steps
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	.
C	Orm
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	clattering
O	of
O	the
O	plates
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	shouts
O	of
O	joy
O	with
O	which
O	they
O	celebrated
O	their
O	banquet
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	over
O	and
O	midnight
O	drew
O	near
O	,
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	dance
O	to
O	that
O	ravishing
O	fairy-tune
O	,
O	which
O	some
O	have
O	heard
O	in
O	the
O	rocky
O	glens
O	,
O	and
O	learned
O	by
O	listening
O	to
O	the
O	underground
O	musicians
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
C	Aslog
O	caught
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	this
O	air
O	,
O	she
O	felt
O	an
