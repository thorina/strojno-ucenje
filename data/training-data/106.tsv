C	Madame

O	People

O	they
O	never
O	shivered
O	.
O	That
O	they
O	could
O	not

O	was
O	a

O	people
O	,
O	and
O	were

O	.
O	Who
O	the
O	Messiah
O	was
O	,
C	June
O	did
O	not
O	know;
O	but
O	she
O	had
O	heard
O	vague
O	stories
O	from
C	Creline
O	,
O	of
O	old-time
O	African
O	princes
O	,
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	great
O	free
O	forests
O	,
O	and
O	sailed
O	on
O	sparkling
O	rivers
O	in
O	boats
O	of
O	painted
O	bark
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	be
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	this
O	morning
O	,
C	Creline
O	had
O	whispered
O	mysteriously
O	to
C	June
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	went
O	up
O	the
O	street
O	to
O	sell
O	some
O	eggs
O	for
C	Madame
C	Joilet
O	,
O	that
C	Massa
C	Linkum
O	was
O	coming
O	that
O	very
O	day
O	.
C	June
O	knew
O	nothing
O	about

C	Linkum
O	,
O	and
O	nothing
O	about
O	those
O	grand
O	,
O	immortal
O	words
O	of
O	his
O	which
O	had
O	made
O	every
O	slave
O	in
O	Richmond
O	free;
O	it
O	had
O	never
O	entered
C	Madame
C	Joilet
O	'
O	s
O	plan
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	know
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	can
O	tell
O	,
O	reasoned
C	Madame
O	,
O	what
O	notions
O	the
O	little
O	nigger
O	will
O	get
O	if
O	she
O	finds
O	it
O	out
O	.
O	She
O	might
O	even
O	ask
O	for
O	wages
O	,
O	or
O	take
O	a
O	notion
O	to
O	learn
O	to
O	read
O	,
O	or
O	run
O	away
O	,
O	or
O	something
O	.
C	June
O	saw
O	no
O	one;
O	she
O	kept
O	her
O	prudently
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	Tell
O	her
O	?
O	_No
O	,

O	that
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	noon
O	the
O	rain
O	was
O	falling
O	,
O	dreary
O	and
O	chilly
O	and
O	sharp
O	.
O	It
O	soaked
C	June
O	'
O	s
O	feet
O	and
O	ragged
O	dress
O	,
O	and
O	pelted
O	in
O	her
O	face
O	.
O	The
O	wind
O	blew
O	against
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	whirled
O	about
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	tossed
O	her
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	,
O	--she
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	little
O	thing
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	weak
O	now
O	and
O	faint
O	.
O	Just
O	as
O	the
O	early
O	twilight
O	fell
O	from
O	the
O	leaden
O	sky
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	shadows
O	began
O	to
O	skulk
O	behind
O	the
O	bushes
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	birds
O	gathered
O	to
O	their
O	nests
O	with
O	sleepy
O	twitter
O	,
O	she
O	tripped
O	over
O	a
O	little
O	stone
O	,
O	fell
O	weakly
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	still
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	not
O	the
O	strength
O	to
O	get
O	to
O	her
O	feet
O	again
O	.
O	But
O	somehow
C	June
O	felt
O	neither
O	troubled
O	nor
O	afraid
O	.
O	She
O	lay
O	there
O	with
O	her
O	face
O	upturned
O	to
O	the
O	pelting
O	rain
O	,
O	watching
O	it
O	patter
O	from
O	leaf
O	to
O	leaf
O	,
O	listening
O	to
O	the
O	chirp
O	of
O	the
O	birds
O	in
O	the
O	nests
O	,
O	listening
O	to
O	the
O	crying
O	of
O	the
O	wind
O	.
O	She
O	liked
O	the
O	sound
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	a
O	dim
O	notion
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	like
O	an
O	old
O	camp-meeting
O	hymn
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	heard
C	Creline
O	sing
O	sometimes
O	.
O	She
O	never
O	understood
O	the
O	words
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	music
O	came
O	back
O	like
O	a
O	dream
O	.
O	She
O	wondered
O	if
C	Massa
C	Linkum
O	ever
O	heard
O	it
O	.
O	She
O	thought
O	he
O	looked
O	like
O	it
O	.
O	She
O	should
O	like
O	to
O	lie
O	there
O	all
O	night
O	and
O	listen
O	to
O	it;
O	and
O	then
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	they
O	would
O	go
O	on
O	and
O	find
O	him
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	morning;
O	it
O	would
O	come
O	very
O	soon
O	.
O	The
O	twilight
O	deepened
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	night
O	came
O	on
O	.
O	The
O	rain
O	fell
O	faster
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sharp
O	wind
O	cried
O	aloud
O	.
