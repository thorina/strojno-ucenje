O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	was
O	an
C	old
C	widow
C	woman
O	who
O	had
O	three
O	sons
O	:
O	the
O	first
O	two
O	were
O	clever
O	enough
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	third
O	,
C	Bobo
O	by
O	name
O	,
O	was
O	little
O	better
O	than
O	a
O	silly
O	simpleton
O	.
O	All
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	scoldings
O	and
O	beatings
O	--
O	and
O	she
O	smacked
O	the
O	poor
O	lad
O	soundly
O	a
O	dozen
O	times
O	a
O	day
O	--
O	did
O	him
O	no
O	good
O	whatever
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	one
O	morning
C	Princess
C	Zenza
O	,
O	the
O	ruler
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	happened
O	to
O	pass
O	by
O	the
O	cottage
O	and
O	heard
C	Bobo
O	being
O	given
O	a
O	terrible
O	tongue-lashing
O	.
O	Curious
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	noise
O	,
O	the
C	Princess
O	drew
O	rein
O	,
O	and
O	summoned
C	Bobo
O	'
O	s
O	mother
O	to
O	come
O	near
O	.
O	On
O	hearing
O	her
O	story
O	,
O	it
O	occurred
O	to
O	the
C	Princess
O	that
O	so
O	silly
O	a
O	lad
O	might
O	amuse
O	her
O	;
O	so
O	she
O	gave
O	the
O	mother
O	a
O	golden
O	florin
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	poor
O	silly
C	Bobo
O	with
O	her
O	to
O	be
O	her
O	page
O	.
O	Just
O	as
O	the
C	dragon
O	'
O	s
O	mouth
O	was
O	at
O	,
O	its
O	widest
O	.
O	.
O	.
O	.
O	You
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	that
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	take
O	the
O	wise
O	folk
O	at
O	the
O	castle
O	long
O	to
O	discover
O	how
O	great
O	a
O	simpleton
O	had
O	arrived
O	.
O	Courtiers
O	,
O	footmen
O	,
O	lackeys
O	,
O	turnspits
O	even
O	,
O	were
O	forever
O	sending
O	him
O	off
O	on
O	ridiculous
O	errands
O	.
O	Now
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	sent
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	white
O	craw
O	'
O	s
O	feather
O	or
O	a
O	spray
O	of
O	yellow
O	bluebells
O	;
O	now
O	he
O	was
O	ordered
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	a
O	square
O	wheel
O	or
O	a
O	glass
O	of
O	dry
O	water
O	.
O	Everybody
O	laughed
O	at
O	him
O	and
O	made
O	fun
O	of
O	him
O	--
O	that
O	is
O	,
O	everybody
O	except
O	little
C	Tilda
O	,
O	the
O	kitchen-maid
O	.
O	When
O	poor
C	Bobo
O	used
O	to
O	return
O	from
O	some
O	wild-goose
O	chase
O	,
O	tired
O	out
O	,
O	mud-stained
O	,
O	and
O	often
O	enough
O	wet
O	to
O	the
O	skin
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	laughing
O	,
O	little
C	Tilda
O	would
O	find
O	him
O	a
O	glass
O	of
O	warm
O	milk
O	,
O	hang
O	his
O	coat
O	by
O	the
O	fire
O	to
O	dry
O	,
O	and
O	tell
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	such
O	a
O	simpleton
O	again
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	while
O	,
C	Bobo
O	learned
O	to
O	ask
C	Tilda
O	'
O	s
O	advice
O	before
O	going
O	away
O	on
O	a
O	wild-goose
O	chase
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	in

O	from

C	Tilda
O	,
O	the

O	night
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	dawn
O	broke
O	,
O	all
O	sign
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	had
O	disappeared
O	.
O	Looking
O	about
O	,
C	Bobo
O	found
O	himself
O	on
O	a
O	lovely
O	island
O	whose
O	heart
O	was
O	a
O	high
O	mountain
O	mass
O	hidden
O	in
O	the
O	fog
O	still
O	sweeping
O	in
O	from
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	house
O	,
O	a
O	road
O	,
O	or
O	a
O	path
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	Suddenly
C	Bobo
O	noticed
O	a
O	strange
O	little
O	door
O	in
O	the
O	bark
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	lonely
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	opening
O	this
O	door
O	,
O	he
O	discovered
O	a
O	little
O	cupboard
O	in
O	which
O	were
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	wooden
O	shoes
O	.
O	Above
O	the
O	shoes
O	was
O	a
O	card
O	,
O	saying
O	simply
O	,
O	--
O	PUT
O	US
O	ON
O	.
O	So
C	Bobo
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	a
O	stone
O	by
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	on
O	the
O	wooden
O	shoes
O	,
O	which
O	fitted
O	him
O	very
O	nicely
O	.
O	Now
O	these
O	shoes
O	were
O	magic
O	shoes
O	,
O	and
C	Bobo
O	had
O	hardly
O	stepped
O	into
O	them
O	before
O	they
O	turned
O	his
O	feet
O	inland
O	.
O	So
C	Bobo
O	obediently
O	let
O	the
O	shoes
O	guide
O	him
O	.
O	At
O	corners
O	the
O	shoes
O	always
O	turned
O	in
O	the
O	right
O	direction
O	,
O	and
O	if
C	Bobo
O	forgot
O	and
O	blundered
O	on
O	the
O	wrong
O	way
O	,
O	the
O	shoes
O	swiftly
O	began
O	to
O	pinch
O	his
O	toes
O	.
O	For
O	two
O	days
C	Bobo
O	walked
O	inland
O	toward
O	the
O	great
O	mountain
O	.
O	A
O	warm
O	wind
O	blew
O	the
O	clouds
O	and
O	rain
O	away
O	,
O	the
O	sun
O	shone
O	sweet
O	and
O	clear
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morning
O	of
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	simpleton
O	entered
O	a
O	wood
O	of
O	tall
O	silent
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	that
O	day
O	was
O	drawing
O	to
O	a
O	close
O	,
O	turrets
O	of
O	a
O	magnificent
O	castle
O	rose
O	far
O	away
O	over
O	the
O	leaves
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	.
C	Bobo
O	arrived
O	at
O	twilight
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	beautiful
O	garden
O	,
O	lying
O	between
O	the
O	castle
O	walls
O	and
O	the
O	rising
O	slopes
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	mountain
O	.
O	Strange
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	not
O	a
O	living
O	creature
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	there
O	were

O	in

O	castle
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	even
O	a
O	warder
O	at
O	the
O	gate
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	a
O	great
O	booming
O	bell
O	struck
O	seven
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	;
C	Bobo
O	began
O	to

O	;
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	before
O	the
O	humming
O	of

O	had
O	died
O	away
O	,
O	a
O	youth
O	mounted
O	on
O	a
O	splendid
O	black
O	horse
O	dashed
O	at
O	lightning
O	speed
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	and
O	disappeared
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	An

O	But

O	.
O	He
O	had
O	arrived
O	half

O	Things

O	Something

O	from
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	flew
O	hissing
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	to
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	sun
O	itself
O	,
O	turning
O	round
O	like
O	a

O	And
O	,
O	sure
O	enough
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	brave
O	little
C	Tilda
O	standing
O	alone
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	field
O	waiting
O	for
O	the
C	dragon
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	take
O	her
O	away
O	.
O	Lumbering
O	heavily
O	along
O	like
O	a
O	monstrous
O	turtle
O	,
O	and
O	snorting
O	blue
O	smoke
O	,
O	the
C	dragon
O	was
O	advancing

O	.
C	Bobo
O	ran
O	down

O	stood
O	beside
C	Tilda
O	,
O	ready

O	The

O	sword

O	he
O	roared

O	continued

O	.
C	Bobo
O	struck
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	.
O	The
O	blade
O	broke
O	upon
O	his
O	steely
O	scales
O	.
O	The
C	dragon
O	roared
O	again
O	.
O	Now
O	just
O	as
O	the
C	dragon

C	Bobo

O	and
O	soon

O	Then
C	Tilda
