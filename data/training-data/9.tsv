O	In
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Famagosta
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	Cyprus
O	,
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	very
O	rich
O	gentleman
O	.
O	His
O	name
O	was
C	Theodorus
O	:
O	he
O	married
O	a
O	lady
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	greatest
O	beauty
O	in
O	Cyprus
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	as
O	rich
O	as
O	himself
O	;
O	she
O	was
O	called
C	Graciana
O	.
O	They
O	both
O	had
O	every
O	pleasure
O	that
O	wealth
O	could
O	buy
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	style
O	.
O	Besides
O	all
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	lady
C	Graciana
O	brought
O	her
O	husband
O	a
O	fine
O	little
O	son
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	named
C	Fortunatus
O	;
O	so
O	one
O	would
O	think
O	nothing
O	could
O	have
O	kept
C	Theodorus
O	from
O	being
O	the
O	most
O	happy
O	person
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	the
O	case
O	;
O	for
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	enjoyed
O	all
O	these
O	pleasures
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	he
O	grew
O	tired
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	keep
O	company
O	with
O	young
O	noblemen
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	,
O	with
O	whom
O	he
O	sat
O	up
O	all
O	night
O	drinking
O	and
O	playing
O	cards
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	years
O	he
O	spent
O	all
O	his
O	fortune
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	now
O	very
O	sorry
O	for
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	too
O	late
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	work
O	at
O	some
O	trade
O	to
O	support
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	child
O	.
O	For
O	all
O	this
O	the
O	lady
C	Graciana
O	never
O	found
O	fault
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	still
O	loved
O	her
O	husband
O	the
O	same

O	climbed
O	up

O	,

O	he
O	had

O	seated
O	himself
O	in

O	,

O	fiercely
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	spring
O	to
O	drink
O	.
O	This
O	made
O	him
O	very

O	gone
O	away

O	came
O	to

O	;

O	,
O	as
O	the

O	shone
O	very
O	bright
O	,
O	the
O	beast
O	looked
O	up
O	,

O	straightway
O	began
O	to
O	climb
O	up
O	the
O	tree
O	to
O	get
O	at
O	him
O	.
C	Fortunatus
O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	quiet
O	till
O	the
O	bear
O	was
O	come
O	within

O	;
O	and
O	then

O	ran
O	him
O	through

O	.
O	This
O	drove
O	the
O	bear
O	so
O	very
O	savage
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	great

O	.

O	now

O	In
O	less
O	than
O	a
O	moment
O	he
O	was
O	carried
O	on
O	board
O	of
O	her
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	sail
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	being
O	a
O	brisk
O	gale
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	in
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	,
O	before
O	the
O	sultan
O	had
O	even
O	time
O	to
O	repent
O	of
O	his
O	folly
O	for
O	letting
C	Fortunatus
O	try
O	the
O	cap
O	on
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	The
O	ship
O	came
O	safe
O	to
O	Famagosta
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	happy
O	passage
O	,
O	and
C	Fortunatus
O	found
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	children
O	well
O	;
O	but
C	Lord
C	Loch-Fitty
O	and
O	his
O	lady
O	had
O	died
O	of
O	old
O	age
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	buried
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	grave
O	.
C	Fortunatus
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	take
O	great
O	pleasure
O	in
O	teaching
O	his
O	two
O	boys
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	useful
O	learning
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	such
O	manly
O	sports
O	as
O	wrestling
O	and
O	tilting
O	.
O	Now
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	thought
O	about
O	the
O	curious
O	cap
O	which
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	would
O	wish
O	he
O	could
O	just
O	take
O	a
O	peep
O	at
O	what
O	was
O	passing
O	in
O	other
O	countries
O	;
O	which
O	wish
O	was
O	always
O	fulfilled
O	:
O	but
O	he
O	never
O	stayed
O	there
O	more
O	than
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	two
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	Lady
C	Cassandra
O	did
O	not
O	miss
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	made
O	uneasy
O	by
O	his
O	love
O	of
O	travelling
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
C	Fortunatus
O	began
O	to
O	grow
O	old
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Lady
C	Cassandra
O	fell
O	sick
O	and
O	died
O	.
O	The
O	loss
O	of
O	her
O	caused
O	him
O	so
O	much
O	grief
O	,
O	that
O	soon
O	after
O	he
O	fell
O	sick
O	too
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	long
O	to
O	live
O	,
O	he
O	called
O	his
O	two
O	sons
O	to
O	his
O	bedside
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	the
O	secrets
O	of
O	the
O	purse
O	and
O	the
O	cap
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	begged
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	,
O	on
O	any
O	account
O	,
O	make
O	known
O	to
O	others
O	.
