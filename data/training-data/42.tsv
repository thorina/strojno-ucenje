O	All
O	the
O	troubles

O	could
O	not
O	cure
O	me
O	of
O	my
O	inclination
O	to
O	make
O	new
O	voyages
O	.
O	I
O	therefore
O	bought
O	goods
O	,
O	departed
O	with
O	them
O	for
O	the
O	best
O	seaport
O	;
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	obliged
O	to
O	depend
O	upon
O	a
C	captain
O	,
O	but
O	have
O	a
O	ship
O	at
O	my
O	own
O	command
O	,
O	I
O	remained
O	till
O	one
O	was
O	built
O	on
O	purpose
O	,
O	at
O	my
O	own
O	charge
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	ready
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	with
O	my
O	goods
O	;
O	but
O	not
O	having
O	enough
O	to
O	load
O	her
O	,
O	I
O	agreed
O	to
O	take
O	with
O	me
O	several
C	merchants
O	of
O	different
O	nations
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	merchandise
O	.
O	We
O	sailed
O	with
O	the
O	first
O	fair
O	wind
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	long
O	navigation
O	,
O	the
O	first
O	place
O	we
O	touched
O	at
O	was
O	a
O	desert
O	island
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	found
O	an
O	egg
O	of
O	a
O	roc
O	,
O	equal
O	in
O	size
O	to
O	that
O	I
O	formerly
O	mentioned
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	young
O	roc
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	just
O	ready
O	to
O	be
O	hatched
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	beak
O	had
O	begun
O	to
O	break
O	the
O	egg
O	.
O	The
C	merchants
O	who
O	landed
O	with
O	me
O	broke
O	the
O	egg
O	with
O	hatchets
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	pulled
O	out
O	the
O	young
O	roc
O	,
O	piecemeal
O	,
O	and
O	roasted
O	it
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	in
O	vain
O	entreated
O	them
O	not
O	to
O	meddle
O	with
O	the
O	egg
O	.
O	Scarcely
O	had
O	they
O	finished
O	their
O	repast
O	,
O	When
O	there
O	appeared
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	at
O	a
O	considerable
O	distance
O	,
O	two
O	great
O	clouds
O	.
O	The
C	captain
O	of
O	my
O	ship
O	,
O	knowing
O	by
O	experience
O	what
O	they
O	meant
O	,
O	said
O	they
O	were
O	the
O	male
O	and
O	female
O	parents
O	of
O	the
O	roc
O	,
O	and
O	pressed
O	us
O	to
O	re-
O	embark
O	with
O	all
O	speed
O	,
O	to
O	prevent
O	the
O	misfortune
O	which
O	he
O	saw
O	would
O	otherwise
O	befall
O	us
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	rocs
O	approached
O	with
O	a
O	frightful
O	noise
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	redoubled
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	egg
O	broken
O	and
O	their
O	young
O	one
O	gone
O	.
O	They
O	flew
O	back
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	,
O	and
O	disappeared
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	while
O	we
O	made
O	all
O	the
O	sail
O	we
O	could
O	to
O	endeavor
O	to
O	prevent
O	that
O	which
O	unhappily
O	befell
O	us
O	.
O	They
O	soon
O	returned
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	observed
O	that
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	carried
O	between
O	its
O	talons
O	an
O	enormous
O	rock
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	directly
O	over
O	my
O	ship
O	,
O	they
O	hovered
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	let
O	go
O	his
O	rock
O	;
O	but
O	by
O	the
O	dexterity
O	of
O	the
O	steersman
O	it
O	missed
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	so
O	exactly
O	hit
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	as
O	to
O	split
O	it
O	into
O	pieces
O	.
O	The
O	mariners
O	and
O	passengers
O	were
O	all
O	crushed
O	to
O	death
O	,
O	or
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	I
O	myself
O	was
O	of
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	the
O	latter
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	came
O	up
O	again
O	,
O	I
O	fortunately
O	caught
O	hold
O	of
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	the
O	wreck
O	,
O	and
O	swimming
O	,
O	sometimes
O	with
O	one
O	hand
O	and
O	sometimes
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	but
O	always
O	holding
O	fast
O	the
O	plank
O	,
O	the
O	wind
O	and
O	the
O	tide
O	favoring
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	an
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	safely
O	ashore
O	.
O	I
O	sat
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	grass
O	,
O	to
O	recover
O	myself
O	from
O	my
O	fatigue
O	,
O	after
O	which
O	I
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	island
O	to
O	explore
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	delicious
O	garden
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	trees
O	everywhere
O	,
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	bearing
O	green
O	and
O	others
O	ripe
O	fruits
O	,
O	and
O	streams
O	of
O	fresh
O	pure
O	water
O	.
O	I
O	ate
O	of
O	the
O	fruits
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	excellent
O	;
O	and
O	drank
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	very
O	light
O	and
O	good
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	advanced
O	into
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	appeared
O	very
O	weak
O	and
O	infirm
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	sitting
O	on
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	a
O	stream
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	first
O	I
O	took
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	one
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	shipwrecked
O	like
O	myself
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	toward
O	him
O	and
O	saluted
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	only
O	slightly
O	bowed
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	I
O	asked
O	him
O	why
O	he
O	sat
O	so
O	still
O	;
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	answering
O	me
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	upon
O	my
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	carry
O	him
O	over
O	the
O	brook
O	.
O	I
O	believed
O	him
O	really
O	to
O	stand
O	in
O	need
O	of
O	my
O	assistance
O	,
O	took
O	him
O	upon
O	my
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	carried
O	him
O	over
O	,
O	bade
O	him
O	get
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	that
O	end
O	stooped
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	get
O	off
O	with
O	ease
O	;
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	doing
O	so
O	(
O	which
O	I
O	laugh
O	at
O	every
O	time
O	I
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	)
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	to
O	me
O	appeared
O	quite
O	decrepit
O	,
O	threw
O	his
O	legs
O	nimbly
O	about
O	my
O	neck
O	.
O	He
O	sat
O	astride
O	upon
O	my
O	shoulders
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	my
O	throat
O	so
O	tight
O	that
O	I
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	strangled
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	fainted
O	away
O	.
O	Notwithstanding
O	my
O	fainting
O	,
O	the
O	ill-natured
O	old
O	fellow
O	still
O	kept
O	his
O	seat
O	upon
O	my
O	neck
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	recovered
O	my
O	breath
O	,
O	he
O	thrust
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	feet
O	against
O	my
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	me
O	so
O	rudely
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	that
O	he
O	forced
O	me
O	to
O	rise
O	up
O	against
O	my
O	will
O	.
O	Having
O	arisen
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	me
O	carry
O	him
O	under
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	forced
O	me
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	stop
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	gather
O	and
O	eat
O	fruit
O	.
O	He
O	never
O	left
O	his
O	seat
O	all
O	day
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	rest
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	he
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	holding
O	still
O	fast
O	about
O	my
O	neck
O	.
O	Every
O	morning
O	he
O	pinched
O	me
O	to
O	make
O	me
O	awake
O	,
O	and
O	afterward
O	obliged
O	me
O	to
O	get
O	up
O	and
O	walk
O	,
O	and
O	spurred
O	me
O	with
O	his
O	feet
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	I
O	found
O	several
O	dry
O	calabashes
O	that
O	had
O	fallen
O	from
O	a
O	tree
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	a
O	large
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	cleaning
O	it
O	,
O	pressed
O	into
O	it
O	some
O	juice
O	of
O	grapes
O	,
O	which
O	abounded
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	;
O	having
O	filled
O	the
O	calabash
O	,
O	I
O	put
O	it
O	by
O	in
O	a
O	convenient
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	going
O	thither
O	again
O	some
O	days
O	after
O	,
O	I
O	tasted
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	wine
O	so
O	good
O	that
O	it
O	gave
O	me
O	new
O	vigor
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	exhilarated
O	my
O	spirits
O	that
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	and
O	dance
O	as
O	I
O	carried
O	my
O	burden
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	perceiving
O	the
O	effect
O	which
O	this
O	had
O	upon
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	carried
O	him
O	with
O	more
O	ease
O	than
O	before
O	,
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	sign
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	some
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	I
O	handed
O	him
O	the
O	calabash
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	liquor
O	pleasing
O	his
O	palate
O	,
O	he
O	drank
O	it
O	off
O	.
O	There
O	being
O	a
O	considerable
O	quantity
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	he
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	move
O	about
O	from
O	side
O	to
O	side
O	in
O	his
O	seat
O	upon
O	my
O	shoulders

O	and
O	by
O	degrees
O	to
O	loosen
O	his
O	legs
O	from
O	about
O	me
O	.
O	Finding
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	press
O	me
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	I
O	threw
O	him
O	upon
O	the
O	ground

O	lay
O	without
O	motion

O	I
O	then
O	took
O	up
O	a

O	Having
O	thus
O	spoken
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	me
O	provisions
O	for
O	the
O	journey
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	went
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	We
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	thick
O	forest
O	of
O	cocoa
O	trees
O	,
O	very
O	lofty
O	,
O	with
O	trunks
O	so
O	smooth
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	possible
O	to
O	climb
O	to
O	the
O	branches
O	that
O	bore
O	the
O	fruit
O	.
O	When
O	we
O	entered
O	the
O	forest
O	we
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	apes
O	of
O	several
O	sizes
O	,
O	who
O	fled
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	perceived
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	climbed
O	to
O	the
O	tops
O	of
O	the
O	trees
O	with
O	amazing
O	swiftness
O	.
O	The
C	merchants
O	with
O	whom
O	I
O	was
O	gathered
O	stones
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	them
O	at
O	the
O	apes
O	on
O	the
O	trees
O	.
O	I
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	apes
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	revenge
O	,
O	threw
O	coconuts
O	at
O	us
O	so
O	fast
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	such
O	gestures
O	,
O	as
O	sufficiently
O	testified
O	their
O	anger
O	and
O	resentment
O	.
O	We
O	gathered
O	up
O	the
O	cocoanuts
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	time
O	to
O	time
O	threw
O	stones
O	to
O	provoke
O	the
O	apes
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	by
O	this
O	stratagem
O	we
O	filled
O	our
O	bags
O	with
O	cocoanuts
O	.
O	I
O	thus
O	gradually
O	collected
O	as
O	many
O	cocoanuts
O	as
O	produced
O	me
O	a
O	considerable
O	sum
O	.
O	Having
O	laden
O	our
O	vessel
O	with
O	cocoanuts
O	,
O	we
O	set
O	sail
O	,
O	and
O	passed
O	by
O	the
O	islands
O	where
O	pepper
O	grows
O	in
O	great
O	plenty
O	.
O	From
O	thence
O	we
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	Isle
O	of
O	Comari
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	best
O	species
O	of
O	wood
O	of
O	aloes
O	grows
O	.
O	I
O	exchanged
O	my
O	cocoa
O	in
O	those
O	two
O	islands
O	for
O	pepper
O	and
O	wood
O	of
O	aloes
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	with
O	other
C	merchants
O	a-pearl-fishing
O	,
O	I
O	hired
O	divers
O	,
O	who
O	brought
O	me
O	up
O	some
O	that
O	were
O	very
O	large
O	and
O	pure
O	.
O	I
O	embarked
O	in
O	a
O	vessel
O	that
O	happily
O	arrived
O	at
O	Bussorah
O	;
O	from
O	thence
O	I
O	returned
O	to
O	Bagdad
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	realized
O	vast
O	sums
O	from
O	my
O	pepper
O	,
O	wood
O	of
O	aloes
O	,
O	and
O	pearls
O	.
O	I
O	gave
O	the
O	tenth
O	of
O	my
O	gains
O	in
O	alms
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	done
O	upon
O	my
O	return
O	from
O	my
O	other
O	voyages
O	,
O	and
O	rested
O	from
O	my
O	fatigues
O	.
C	Sindbad
O	here
O	ordered
O	one
O	hundred
O	sequins
O	to
O	be
O	given
O	to
C	Hindbad
O	,
O	and
O	requested
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	guests
O	to

O	with
O	him
O	the
O	next
