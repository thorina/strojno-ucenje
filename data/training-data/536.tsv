O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	a
O	wicked
O	nobleman
O	rose
O	in
O	rebellion
O	against
O	his
O	rightful
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	the
O	royal
O	forces
O	by
O	surprise
O	,
O	defeated
O	them
O	and
O	seized
O	the
O	kingdom
O	.
O	The
O	dethroned
C	King
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	severely
O	wounded
O	in
O	battle
O	,
O	was
O	cast
O	in
O	prison
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	soon
O	died
O	;
O	but
O	his
O	widow
O	,
O	the
C	Queen
O	,
O	managed
O	to
O	escape
O	from
O	the
O	palace
O	before
O	the
O	usurper
O	could
O	lay
O	hands
O	upon
O	her
O	.
O	Into
O	the
O	dark
O	forest
O	which
O	lay
O	behind
O	the
O	palace
O	ran
O	the
C	Queen
O	,
O	holding
O	her
O	baby
C	daughter
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	winter
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	heavy
O	snow
O	had
O	hidden
O	the
O	foot-paths
O	and
O	the
O	roads
O	.
O	Presently
O	the
C	Queen
O	realized
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	lost
O	.
O	All
O	afternoon
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	she
O	trudged
O	bravely
O	on
O	through
O	the
O	silence
O	and
O	the
O	cold
O	,
O	her
O	heart
O	sinking
O	as
O	mile
O	after
O	mile
O	revealed
O	no
O	sign
O	of
O	a
O	house
O	or
O	a
O	shelter
O	.
O	But
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	red
O	shield
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	could
O	scarcely
O	be
O	seen
O	through
O	the
O	tangle
O	of
O	the
O	wild
O	wood-branches
O	,
O	she
O	perceived
O	a
O	light
O	coming
O	from
O	a
O	little
O	grove
O	of
O	cedars
O	by
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	a
O	frozen
O	lake
O	.
O	The
C	Queen
O	made
O	her
O	way
O	toward
O	this
O	light
O	,
O	and
O	discovered
O	a
O	little
O	thatched
O	hut
O	in
O	the
O	silent
O	wood
O	;
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	The
C	dwarf
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	the
C	Queen
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	efforts
O	were
O	vain
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	poor
O	woman
O	was
O	so
O	weak
O	and
O	exhausted
O	that
O	she
O	died
O	without
O	telling
O	the
C	dwarf
O	anything
O	about
O	herself
O	or
O	the
O	child
O	she
O	carried
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	little
C	dwarf
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	,
O	kind
O	old
O	fellow
O	,
O	brought
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	up
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	his
O	own
O	child
O	.
O	His
O	brother
O	,
O	the
O	dwarf
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	,
O	made
O	her
O	the
O	prettiest
O	red-leather
O	shoes
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	cousins
O	,
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	of
O	the
O	pines
O	,
O	made
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	dresses
O	from
O	cloth
O	woven
O	on
O	fairy
O	looms
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	night
O	her
O	mother
O	brought
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	hut
O	,
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	was
O	wearing
O	a
O	golden
O	heart-shaped
O	locket
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	crown
O	and
O	the
O	letter
O	M
O	upon
O	it
O	in
O	diamonds
O	.
O	So
O	the
C	dwarf
O	called
O	the
O	little
O	girl
C	Marianna
O	.
O	Seventeen
O	years
O	passed
O	,
O	and
C	Marianna
O	grew
O	to
O	be
O	quite
O	the
O	loveliest
O	lass
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	Her
O	hair
O	was
O	as
O	black
O	as
O	the
O	raven

O	s
O	wing
O	,
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	as
O	blue
O	as
O	the
O	midsummer
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	skin
O	was
O	fair
O	as
O	the
O	petal
O	of
O	a
O	rose
O	.
O	One
O	spring
O	morning
O	a
O	little

O	flew
O	into

O	cedar
O	grove
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	the
C	dwarf
O	a
O	letter
O	which
O	it
O	held
O	in
O	its
O	beak
O	.
O	The
C	dwarf
O	read
O	the
