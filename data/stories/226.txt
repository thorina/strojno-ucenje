At the expiration of another year , I prepared for a sixth voyage . This
proved very long and unfortunate , for the pilot lost his course and knew
not where to steer . At length he told us we must inevitably be dashed to
pieces against a rock , which we were fast approaching . In a few moments
the vessel was a complete wreck . We saved our lives , our provisions , and
our goods . 

The shore on which we were cast was at the foot of a mountain which it
was impossible to climb , so that I shortly beheld my companions die one
after another . There was a frightful cavern in the rock , through which
flowed a river . To this , in a fit of desperation , I resolved to trust
myself . I went to work and made a long raft . I loaded it with bales of
rich stuffs , and large pieces of rock crystal , of which the mountain was
in a great measure formed . I went on board the raft , and the current
carried me along . I was carried in darkness during many days , and at
last fell asleep . When I awoke , I found myself in a pleasant country . 
My raft was tied up and some blacks , who were near me , said that they
had found me floating in the river which waters their land . They took me
to their King , and carefully conducted my cargo with me . When we came to
the city of Serindib , I related my story to the monarch , who ordered it
to be written in letters of gold . I presented the King with some of the
most beautiful pieces of rock crystal , and entreated him to let me
return to my own country , which he readily agreed to , and even gave me
a letter and a present to my sovereign , the Caliph Haroun Alrashid . The
present consisted of a ruby made into a cup , and decorated with pearls;
the skin of a serpent , which appeared like burnished gold , and which
could repel disease; some aloe-wood , camphire , and a beautiful female
slave . I returned to my native country , delivered the present to the
Caliph , and received his thanks , with a reward .
