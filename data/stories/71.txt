Once upon a time , ages and ages ago , so long ago that the tiger had no
stripes upon his back and the rabbit still had his tail , there was a
tiger who had a farm . The farm was very much overgrown with underbrush
and the owner sought a workman to clear the ground for him to plant . 

The tiger called all the beasts together and said to them when they
had assembled ,  " I need a good workman at once to clear my farm of the
underbrush . To the one of you who will do this work I offer an ox in
payment . " 

The monkey was the first one to step forward and apply for the
position . The tiger tried him for a little while but he was not a good
workman at all . He did not work steadily enough to accomplish
anything . The tiger discharged him very soon and he did not pay him . 

Then the tiger hired the goat to do the work . The goat worked
faithfully enough but he did not have the brains to do the work well . 
He would clear a little of the farm in one place and then he would go
away and work on another part of it . He never finished anything
neatly . The tiger discharged him very soon without paying him . 

Next the tiger tried the armadillo . The armadillo was very strong and
he did the work well . The trouble with him was that he had such an
appetite . There were a great many ants about the place and the
armadillo could never pass by a sweet tender juicy ant without
stopping to eat it . It was lunch time all day long with him . The tiger
discharged him and sent him away without paying him anything . 

At last the rabbit applied for the position . The tiger laughed at him
and said ,  " Why , little rabbit , you are too small to do the work . The
monkey , the goat , and the armadillo have all failed to give
satisfaction . Of course a little beast like you will fail too . " 

However , there were no other beasts who applied for the position so
the tiger sent for the rabbit and told him that he would try him for a
little while . 

The rabbit worked faithfully and well , and soon he had cleared a
large portion of the ground . The next day he worked just as well . The
tiger thought that he had been very lucky to hire the rabbit . He got
tired staying around to watch the rabbit work . The rabbit seemed to
know just how to do the work anyway , without orders , so the tiger
decided to go away on a hunting trip . He left his son to watch the
rabbit . 

After the tiger had gone away the rabbit said to the tiger ' s son ,  " The
ox which your father is going to give me is marked with a white spot
on his left ear and another on his right side , isn ' t he ? " 

 " O , no , " replied the tiger ' s son .  " He is red all over with just a tiny
white spot on his right ear . " 

The rabbit worked for a while longer and then he said ,  " The ox which
your father is going to give me is kept by the river , isn ' t he ? " 

 " Yes , " replied the tiger ' s son . 

The rabbit had made a plan to go and get the ox without waiting to
finish his work . Just as he started off he saw the tiger returning . 
The tiger noticed that the rabbit had not worked so well when he was
away . After that he stayed and watched the rabbit until the whole farm
was cleared . Then the tiger gave the rabbit the ox as he had promised . 

 " You must kill this ox , " he said to the rabbit ,  " in a place where
there are neither flies nor mosquitoes . " 

The rabbit went away with the ox . After he had gone for some distance
he thought he would kill him . He heard a cock , however , crowing in
the distance and he knew that there must be a farm yard near . There
would be flies of course . He went on farther and again he thought that
he would kill the ox . The ground looked moist and damp and so did the
leaves on the bushes . Since the rabbit thought there would be
mosquitoes there he decided not to kill the ox . He went on and on and
finally he came to a high place where there was a strong breeze
blowing .  " There are no mosquitoes here , " he said to himself .  " The
place is so far removed from any habitation that there are no flies , 
either . " He decided to kill the ox . 

Just as he was ready to eat the ox , along came the tiger .  " O , rabbit , 
you have been such a good friend of mine , " said the tiger ,  " and now I
am so very , very hungry that all my ribs show , as you yourself can
see . Will you not be a good kind rabbit and give me a piece of your
ox ? " 

The rabbit gave the tiger a piece of the ox . The tiger devoured it in
the twinkling of an eye . Then he leaned back and said ,  " Is that all
you are going to give me to eat ? " 

The tiger looked so big and savage that the rabbit did not dare refuse
to give him any more of the ox . The tiger ate and ate and ate until he
had devoured that entire ox . The rabbit had been able to get only a
tiny morsel of it . He was very , very angry at the tiger . 

One day not long after the rabbit went to a place not far from the
tiger ' s house and began cutting down big staves of wood . The tiger
soon happened along and asked him what he was doing . 

 " I ' m getting ready to build a stockade around myself , " replied the
rabbit .  " Haven ' t you heard the orders ? " The tiger said that he hadn ' t
heard any orders . 

 " That is very strange , " said the rabbit .  " The order has gone forth
that every beast shall fortify himself by building a stockade around
himself . All the beasts are doing it . " 

The tiger became very much alarmed .  " O , dear ! O , dear ! What shall I
do , " he cried .  " I don ' t know how to build a stockade . I never could do
it in the world . O , good rabbit ! O , kind rabbit ! You are such , a very
good friend of mine . Couldn ' t you , as a great favour , because of our
long friendship , build a stockade about me before you build one
around yourself ? " 

The rabbit replied that he could not think of risking his own life by
building the tiger ' s fortifications first . Finally , however , he
consented to do it . 

The rabbit cut down great quantities of long sharp sticks . He set them
firmly in the ground about the tiger . He fastened others securely over
the top until the tiger was completely shut in by strong bars . Then he
went away and left the tiger . 

The tiger waited and waited for something to happen to show him the
need of the fortifications . Nothing at all happened . 

He got very hungry and thirsty . After a while the monkey passed that
way . 

The tiger called out ,  " O , monkey , has the danger passed ? " 

The monkey did not know what danger the tiger meant , but he replied , 
 " Yes . " 

Then the tiger said ,  " O , monkey , O , good , kind monkey , will you not
please be so kind as to help me out of my stockade ? " 

 " Let the one who got you in there help you out , " replied the monkey
and he went on his way . 

Along came the goat and the tiger called out ,  " O , goat , has the danger
passed ? " 

The goat did not know anything about any danger , but he replied , 
 " Yes . " 

Then the tiger said ,  " O , goat , O , good kind goat , please be so kind as
to help me out of my stockade . " 

 " Let the one who got you in there help you out , " replied the goat as
he went on his way . 

Along came the armadillo and the tiger called out ,  " O , armadillo , has
the danger passed ? " 

The armadillo had not heard of any danger , but he replied that it had
passed . 

Then the tiger said ,  " O , armadillo , O , good , kind armadillo , you have
always been such a good friend and neighbour . Please help me now to
get out of my stockade . " 

 " Let the one who got you in there help you out , " replied the armadillo
as he went on his way . 

The tiger jumped and jumped with all his force at the top of the
stockade , but he could not break through . He jumped and jumped with
all his might at the front side of the stockade , but he could not
break through . He thought that never in the world would he be able to
break out . He rested for a little while and as he rested he thought . 
He thought how bright the sun was shining outside . He thought what
good hunting there was in the jungle . He thought how cool the water
was at the spring . Once more he jumped and jumped with all his might
at the back side of the stockade . At last he broke through . He did not
get through , however , without getting bad cuts on both his sides from
the sharp edges of the staves . Until this day the tiger has stripes on
both his sides .
