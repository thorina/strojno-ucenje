A long , long time ago there lived in a little hut on the borders of a
great forest a huntsman and his wife and son . From his earliest years
the boy , whose name was Fergus , used to hunt with his father in the
forest , and he grew up strong and active , sure and swift-footed as a
deer , and as free and fearless as the wind . He was tall and handsome; as
supple as a mountain ash , his lips were as red as its berries; his eyes
were as blue as the skies in spring; and his hair fell down over his
shoulders like a shower of gold . His heart was as light as a bird ' s , 
and no bird was fonder of green woods and waving branches . He had lived
since his birth in the hut in the forest , and had never wished to leave
it , until one winter night a wandering minstrel sought shelter there , 
and paid for his night ' s lodging with songs of love and battle . Ever
since that night Fergus pined for another life . He no longer found joy
in the music of the hounds or in the cries of the huntsmen in forest
glades . He yearned for the chance of battle , and the clang of shields , 
and the fierce shouts of fighting warriors , and he spent all his spare
hours practicing on the harp and learning the use of arms , for in those
days the bravest warriors were also bards . In this way the spring and
summer and autumn passed; and when the winter came again it chanced that
on a stormy night , when thunder was rattling through the forest , smiting
the huge oaks and hurling them crashing to the earth , Fergus lay awake
thinking of his present lot , and wondering what the future might have in
store for him . The lightning was playing around the hut , and every now
and then a flash brightened up the interior . 

After a peal , louder than any which had preceded it , Fergus heard three
loud knocks at the door . He called out to his parents that someone was
knocking . 

 " If that is so , " said his father ,  " open at once; this is no night to
keep a poor wanderer outside our door . " 

Fergus did as he was bidden , and as he opened the door a flash of
lightning showed him , standing at the threshold , a little wizened old
man with a small harp under his arm . 

 " Come in , and welcome , " said Fergus , and the little man stepped into
the room . 

 " It is a wild night , neighbors , " said he . 

 " It is , indeed , a wild night , " said the huntsman and his wife , who had
got up and dressed themselves;  " and sorry we are we have no better
shelter or better fare to offer you , but we give you the best we have . " 

 " A king cannot do more than his best , " said the little man . 

The huntsman ' s wife lit the fire , and soon the pine logs flashed up into
a blaze , and made the hut bright and warm . She then brought forth a
peggin of milk and a cake of barley-bread . 

 " You must be hungry , sir , " she said . 

 " Hungry I am , " said he;  " but I wouldn ' t ask for better fare than this if
I were in the king ' s palace . " 

 " Thank you kindly , sir , " said she ,  " and I hope you will eat enough , and
that it will do you good . " 

 " And while you are eating your supper , " said the huntsman ,  " I ' ll make
you a bed of fresh rushes . " 

 " Don ' t put yourself to that trouble , " said the little man .  " When I have
done my supper I ' ll lie down here by the fire , if it is pleasing to you , 
and I ' ll sleep like a top until morning . And now go back to your beds
and leave me to myself , and maybe some time when you won ' t be expecting
it I ' ll do a good turn for your kindness to the poor wayfarer . " 

 " Oh , it ' s no kindness at all , " said the huntsman ' s wife .  " It would be
a queer thing if an Irish cabin would not give shelter and welcome in
a wild night like this . So good night , now , and we hope you will sleep
well . " 

 " Good night , " said the little man ,  " and may you and yours never sup
sorrow until your dying day . " 

The huntsman and his wife and Fergus then went back to their beds , and
the little man , having finished his supper , curled himself up by the
fire , and was soon fast asleep . 

About an hour after a loud clap of thunder awakened Fergus , and before
it had died away he heard three knocks at the door . He aroused his parents
and told them . 

 " Get up at once , " said his mother ,  " this is no night to keep a stranger
outside our door . " 

Fergus rose and opened the door , and a flash of lightning showed him a
little old woman , with a shuttle in her hand , standing outside . 

 " Come in , and welcome , " said he , and the little old woman stepped into
the room . 

 " Blessings be on them who give welcome to a wanderer on a wild night
like this , " said the old woman . 

 " And who wouldn ' t give welcome on a night like this ? " said the
huntsman ' s wife , coming forward with a peggin of milk and a barley cake
in her hand ,  " and sorry we are we have not better fare to offer you . " 

 " Enough is as good as a feast , " said the little woman ,  " and now go back
to your beds and leave me to myself . " 

 " Not till I shake down a bed of rushes for you , " said the huntsman ' s
wife . 

 " Don ' t mind the rushes , " said the little woman;  " go back to your beds . 
I ' ll sleep here by the fire . " 

The huntsman ' s wife went to bed , and the little old woman , having eaten
her supper , lay down by the fire , and was soon fast asleep . 

About an hour later another clap of thunder startled Fergus . Again he
heard three knocks at the door . He roused his parents , but he did not
wait for orders from them . He opened the door , and a flash of lightning
showed him outside the threshold a low-sized , shaggy , wild-looking
horse . And Fergus knew it was the Pooka , the wild horse of the
mountains . Bold as Fergus was , his heart beat quickly as he saw fire
issuing from the Pooka ' s nostrils . But , banishing fear , he cried out : 

 " Come in , and welcome . " 

 " Welcome you are , " said the huntsman ,  " and sorry we are that we have not
better shelter or fare to offer you . " 

 " I couldn ' t wish a better welcome , " said the Pooka , as he came over near
the fire and sat down on his haunches . 

 " Maybe you would like a little bit of this , Master Pooka , " said the
huntsman ' s wife , as she offered him a barley cake . 

 " I never tasted anything sweeter in my life , " said the Pooka , crunching
it between his teeth ,  " and now if you can give me a sup of milk , I ' ll
want for nothing . " 

The huntsman ' s wife brought him a peggin of milk . When he had drunk it , 
 " Now , " says the Pooka ,  " go back to your beds , and I ' ll curl myself up by
the fire and sleep like a top till morning . " 

And soon everybody in the hut was fast asleep . 

When the morning came the storm had gone , and the sun was shining
through the windows of the hut . At the song of the lark Fergus got up , 
and no one in the world was ever more surprised than he when he saw no
sign of the little old man , or the little old woman , or the wild horse
of the mountains . His parents were also surprised , and they all thought
that they must have been dreaming until they saw the empty peggins
around the fire and some pieces of broken bread; and they did not know
what to think of it all . 

From that day forward the desire grew stronger in the heart of Fergus
for a change of life; and one day he told his parents that he was
resolved to seek his fortune . He said he wished to be a soldier , and that
he would set out for the king ' s palace , and try to join the ranks of the
Feni . 

About a week afterwards he took leave of his parents , and having
received their blessing he struck out for the road that led to the
palace of the High King of Erin . He arrived there just at the time when
the great captain of the Fenian host was recruiting his battalions , 
which had been thinned in recent battle . 

The manly figure of Fergus , his gallant bearing , and handsome face , all
told in his favor . But before he could be received into the Fenian ranks
he had to prove that he could play the harp like a bard , that he could
contend with staff and shield against nine Fenian warriors , that he
could run with plaited hair through the tangled forest without loosening
a single hair , and that in his course he could jump over trees as high
as his head , and stoop under trees as low as his knee , and that he could
run so lightly that the rotten twigs should not break under his feet . 
Fergus proved equal to all the tests , thanks to the wandering minstrel
who taught him the use of the harp , to his own brave heart , and to his
forest training . He was enrolled in the second battalion of the Feni , 
and before long he was its bravest and ablest champion . 

At that very time it happened that the niece of the High King of
Erin was staying with the king and queen in their palace at Tara . The
princess was the loveliest lady in all the land . She was as proud as
she was beautiful . The princes and chieftains of Erin in vain sought her
hand in marriage . From Alba and Spain , and the far-off isles of Greece , 
kings came to woo her . From the northern lands came vikings in stately
galleys with brazen prows , whose oarsmen tore the white foam from the
emerald seas as they swept towards the Irish coasts . But the lady had
vowed she would wed with no one except a battle champion who could excel
in music the chief bard of the High King of Erin; who could outstrip on
his steed in the great race of Tara the white steed of the plains; and
who could give her as a wedding robe a garment of all the colors of the
rainbow , so finely spun that when folded up it would fit in the palm of
her small white hand . To fulfill these three conditions was impossible
for all her suitors , and it seemed as if the loveliest lady of the land
would go unmarried to her grave . 

It chanced that once , on a day when the Fenian battalions were engaged
in a hurling-match , Fergus beheld the lady watching the match from her
sunny bower . He no sooner saw her than he fell over head and ears in
love with her , and he thought of her by night , and he thought of her by
day , and believing that his love was hopeless , he often wished he had
never left his forest-home . 

The great fair of Tara[8] was coming on , and all the Feni were busy from
morning till night practicing feats of arms and games , in order to take
part in the contests to be held during the fair . And Fergus , knowing
that the princess would be present , determined to do his best to win the
prizes which were to be contended for before the ladies ' eyes . 

The fair began on the 1st of August , but for a whole week before the
five great roads of Erin were thronged with people of all sorts . Princes
and warriors on their steeds , battle champions in their chariots , 
harpers in hundreds , smiths with gleaming spears and shields and
harness for battle steeds and chariots; troops of men and boys leading
racehorses; jewelers with gold drinking-horns , and brooches , and pins , 
and earrings , and costly gems of all kinds , and chessboards of silver
and gold , and golden and silver chessmen in bags of woven brass; dyers
with their many-colored fabrics; bands of jugglers; drovers goading on
herds of cattle; shepherds driving their sheep; huntsmen with spoils
of the chase; dwellers in the lakes or by the fish-abounding rivers
with salmon and speckled trout; and countless numbers of peasants on
horseback and on foot , all wending their way to the great meeting-place
by the mound , which a thousand years before had been raised over the
grave of the great queen . For there the fair was to be held . 

On the opening day the High King , attended by the four kings of Erin , 
set out from the palace , and with them went the queen and the ladies of
the court in sparkling chariots . The princess rode in the chariot with
the High Queen , under an awning made of the wings of birds , to protect
them from the rays of the sun . Following the queen were the court ladies
in other chariots , under awnings of purple or of yellow silk . Then came
the brehons , the great judges of the land , and the chief bards of the
high court of Tara , and the Druids , crowned with oak leaves , and
carrying wands of divination in their hands . 

When the royal party reached the ground it took its place in inclosures
right up against the monumental mound . The High King sat with the four
kings of Erin , all wearing their golden helmets , for they wore their
diadems in battle only . In an inclosure next the king ' s sat the queen
and the princess and all the ladies of the court . At either side of the
royal pavilions were others for the dames and ladies and nobles and
chiefs of different degrees , forming part of a circle on the plain , and
the stands and benches for the people were so arranged as to complete
the circle , and in the round green space within it , so that all might
hear and see , the contests were to take place . 

At a signal from the king , who was greeted with a thunderous cheer , the
heralds rode round the circle , and having struck their sounding shields
three times with their swords , they made a solemn proclamation of peace . 
Then was sung by all the assembled bards , to the accompaniment of their
harps , the chant in honor of the mighty dead . When this was ended , again
the heralds struck their shields , and the contests began . The first
contest was the contest of spear-throwing between the champions of the
seven battalions of the Feni . When the seven champions took their places
in front of the royal inclosure , everyone , even the proud princess , was
struck by the manly beauty and noble bearing of Fergus . 

The champions poised their spears , and at a stroke from the heralds upon
their shields the seven spears sped flashing through the air . They all
struck the ground , shafts up , and it was seen that two were standing
side by side in advance of the rest , one belonged to Fergus , the other
to the great chief , Oscar . The contest for the prize then lay between
Oscar and Fergus , and when they stood in front of the king , holding
their spears aloft , every heart was throbbing with excitement . Once more
the heralds struck their shields , and , swifter than the lightning ' s
flash , forth went the spears , and when Fergus ' s spear was seen shivering
in the ground a full length ahead of the great chief Oscar ' s , the air was
shaken by a wild cheer that was heard far beyond the plains of Tara . And
as Fergus approached the high king to receive the prize the cheers were
renewed . But Fergus thought more of the winsome glance of the princess
than he did of the prize or the sounding cheers . And Princess Maureen
was almost sorry for her vow , for her heart was touched by the beauty
of the Fenian champion . 

Other contests followed , and the day passed , and the night fell , and
while the Fenian warriors were reveling in their camps the heart of
Fergus , victor as he was , was sad and low . He escaped from his
companions , and stole away to his native forest , for--

  " When the heart is sick and sorest , 
 There is balsam in the forest--
 There is balsam in the forest
 For its pain . " 

And as he lay under the spreading branches , watching the stars glancing
through the leaves , and listening to the slumb ' rous murmur of the
waters , a strange peace came over him . 

But in the camp which he had left , and in the vast multitude on the plains
of Tara , there was stir and revelry , and babbling speculation as to the
contest of to-morrow--the contest which was to decide whether the chief
bard of Erin was to hold his own against all comers , or yield the palm . 
For rumor said that a great Skald had come from the northern lands to
compete with the Irish bard . 

At last , over the Fenian camp , and over the great plain and the
multitude that thronged it , sleep fell , clothing them with a silence as
deep as that which dwelt in the forest , where , dreaming of the princess , 
Fergus lay . He awoke at the first notes of the birds , but though he felt
he ought to go back to his companions and be witness of the contest
which might determine whether the princess was to be another ' s bride , 
his great love and his utter despair of winning her so oppressed him
that he lay as motionless as a broken reed . He scarcely heard the music
of the birds , and paid no heed to the murmur of the brook rushing by his
feet . The crackling of branches near him barely disturbed him , but when
a shadow fell across his eyes he looked up gloomily , and saw , or thought
he saw , someone standing before him . He started up , and who should he see
but the little wizened old man who found shelter in his father ' s hut on
the stormy night . 

 " This is a nice place for a battle champion to be . This is a nice place
for _you_ to be on the day which is to decide who will be the successful
suitor of the princess . " 

 " What is it to me , " said Fergus ,  " who is to win her since I cannot ? " 

 " I told you , " said the little man ,  " the night you opened the door for
me , that the time might come when I might be able to do a good turn for
you and yours . The time has come . Take this harp , and my luck go with
you , and in the contest of the bards to-day you ' ll reap the reward of
the kindness you did when you opened your door to the poor old wayfarer
in the midnight storm . " 

The little man handed his harp to Fergus and disappeared as swiftly as
the wind that passes through the leaves . 

Fergus , concealing the harp under his silken cloak , reached the camp
before his comrades had aroused themselves from sleep . 

At length the hour arrived when the great contest was to take place . 

The king gave the signal , and as the chief bard of Erin was seen
ascending the mound in front of the royal inclosures he was greeted with
a roar of cheers , but at the first note of his harp silence like that of
night fell on the mighty gathering . 

As he moved his fingers softly over the strings every heart was hushed , 
filled with a sense of balmy rest . The lark soaring and singing above
his head paused mute and motionless in the still air , and no sound was
heard over the spacious plain save the dreamy music . Then the bard
struck another key , and a gentle sorrow possessed the hearts of his
hearers , and unbidden tears gathered to their eyes . Then , with bolder
hand , he swept his fingers across his lyre , and all hearts were moved
to joy and pleasant laughter , and eyes that had been dimmed by tears
sparkled as brightly as running waters dancing in the sun . When the last
notes had died away a cheer arose , loud as the voice of the storm in the
glen when the live thunder is reveling on the mountain tops . As soon as
the bard had descended the mound the Skald from the northern lands took
his place , greeted by cries of welcome from a hundred thousand throats . 
He touched his harp , and in the perfect silence was heard the strain of
the mermaid ' s song , and through it the pleasant ripple of summer waters
on the pebbly beach . Then the theme was changed , and on the air was
borne the measured sweep of countless oars and the swish of waters
around the prows of contending galleys , and the breezy voices of the
sailors and the sea-bird ' s cry . Then his theme was changed to the mirth
and laughter of the banquet-hall , the clang of meeting drinking-horns , 
and songs of battle . When the last strain ended , from the mighty host a
great shout went up , loud as the roar of winter billows breaking in the
hollows of the shore; and men knew not whom to declare the victor , the
chief bard of Erin or the Skald of the northern lands . 

In the height of the debate the cry arose that another competitor had
ascended the mound , and there standing in view of all was Fergus , the
huntsman ' s son . All eyes were fastened upon him , but no one looked so
eagerly as the princess . 

He touched his harp with gentle fingers , and a sound low and soft as
a faint summer breeze passing through forest trees stole out , and then
was heard the rustle of birds through the branches , and the dreamy
murmur of waters lost in deepest woods , and all the fairy echoes
whispering when the leaves are motionless in the noonday heat; then
followed notes cool and soft as the drip of summer showers on the
parched grass , and then the song of the blackbird , sounding as clearly
as it sounds in long silent spaces of the evening , and then in one sweet
jocund burst the multitudinous voices that hail the breaking of the
morn . And the lark , singing and soaring above the minstrel , sank mute
and motionless upon his shoulder , and from all the leafy woods the birds
came thronging out and formed a fluttering canopy above his head . 

When the bard ceased playing no shout arose from the mighty multitude , 
for the strains of his harp , long after its chords were stilled , held
their hearts spellbound . 

And when he had passed away from the mound of contest all knew there was
no need to declare the victor . [9] And all were glad the comely Fenian
champion had maintained the supremacy of the bards of Erin . But there
was one heart sad , the heart of the princess; and now she wished more
than ever that she had never made her hateful vow . 

Other contests went on , but Fergus took no interest in them; and once
more he stole away to the forest glade . His heart was sorrowful , for he
thought of the great race of the morning , and he knew that he could not
hope to compete with the rider of the white steed of the plains . And as
he lay beneath the spreading branches during the whole night long his
thoughts were not of the victory he had won , but of the princess , who
was as far away from him as ever . He passed the night without sleep , and
when the morning came he rose and walked aimlessly through the woods . 

A deer starting from a thicket reminded him of the happy days of his
boyhood , and once more the wish came back to him that he had never left
his forest home . As his eyes followed the deer wistfully , suddenly he
started in amazement . The deer vanished from view , and in his stead was
the wild horse of the mountains . 

 " I told you I ' d do you a good turn , " said the Pooka ,  " for the kindness
you and yours did me on that wild winter ' s night . The day is passing . 
You have no time to lose . The white steed of the plains is coming to the
starting-post . Jump on my back , and remember ,  ' Faint heart never won
fair lady . ' " 

In half a second Fergus was bestride the Pooka , whose coat of shaggy
hair became at once as glossy as silk , and just at the very moment
when the king was about to declare there was no steed to compete with
the white steed of the plains , the Pooka , with Fergus upon his back , 
galloped up in front of the royal inclosure . When the people saw the
champion a thunderous shout rose up that startled the birds in the
skies , and sent them flying to the groves . 

And in the ladies ' inclosure was a rustle of many-colored scarves waving
in the air . At the striking of the shields the contending steeds rushed
from the post with the swiftness of a swallow ' s flight . But before the
white steed of the plains had gone halfway round , Fergus and the wild
horse of the mountains had passed the winning post , greeted by such
cheers as had never before been heard on the plains of Tara . 

Fergus heard the cheers , but scarcely heeded them , for his heart went
out through his eyes that were fastened on the princess , and a wild hope
stirred him that his glance was not ungrateful to the loveliest lady of
the land . 

And the princess was sad and sorry for her vow , for she believed that it
was beyond the power of Fergus to bring her a robe of all the colors of
the rainbow , so subtly woven as to fit in the palm of her soft , white
hand . 

That night also Fergus went to the forest , not too sad , because there
was a vague hope in his heart that had never been there before . He lay
down under the branches , with his feet towards the rustling waters , and
the smiles of the princess gilded his slumbers , as the rays of the
rising sun gild the glades of the forest; and when the morning came he
was scarcely surprised when before him appeared the little old woman
with the shuttle he had welcomed on the winter ' s night . 

 " You think you have won her already , " said the little woman .  " And so you
have , too; her heart is all your own , and I ' m half inclined to think
that my trouble will be thrown away , for if you had never a wedding robe
to give her , she ' d rather have you this minute than all the kings of
Erin , or than all the other princes and kings and chieftains in the
whole world . But you and your father and mother were kind to me on a
wild winter ' s night , and I ' d never see your mother ' s son without a
wedding robe fit for the greatest princess that ever set nations to
battle for her beauty . So go and pluck me a handful of wild forest
flowers , and I ' ll weave out of them a wedding robe with all the colors
of the rainbow , and one that will be as sweet and as fragrant as the
ripe , red lips of the princess herself . " 

Fergus , with joyous heart , culled the flowers , and brought them to the
little old woman . 

In the twinkling of an eye she wove with her little shuttle a wedding
robe , with all the colors of the rainbow , as light as the fairy dew , as
soft as the hand of the princess , as fragrant as her little red mouth , 
and so small that it would pass through the eye of a needle . 

 " Go now , Fergus , " said she ,  " and may luck go with you; but , in the days
of your greatness and of the glory which will come to you when you are
wedded to the princess , be as kind , and have as open a heart and as open
a door for the poor as you had when you were only a poor huntsman ' s son . " 

Fergus took the robe and went towards Tara . It was the last day of the
fair , and all the contests were over , and the bards were about to chant
the farewell strains to the memory of the great queen . But before the
chief bard could ascend the mound , Fergus , attended by a troop of Fenian
warriors on their steeds , galloped into the inclosure , and rode up in
front of the queen ' s pavilion . Holding up the glancing and many-colored
robe , he said : 

 " O Queen and King of Erin ! I claim the princess for my bride . You , 
O king , have decided that I have won the prize in the contest of the
bards; that I have won the prize in the race against the white steed of
the plains; it is for the princess to say if the robe which I give her
will fit in the hollow of her small white hand . " 

 " Yes , " said the king .  " You are victor in the contests; let the princess
declare if you have fulfilled the last condition . " 

The princess took the robe from Fergus , closed her fingers over it , so
that no vestige of it was seen . 

 " Yes , O king ! " said she ,  " he has fulfilled the last condition; but
before ever he had fulfilled a single one of them , my heart went out to
the comely champion of the Feni . I was willing then , I am ready now , to
become the bride of the huntsman ' s son . "
