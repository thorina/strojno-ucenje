Once a little Indian girl was very sad and unhappy . The Great Spirit had
taken her father and mother , and she had gone to live with relatives who
did not want her . Often she went to sleep hungry , for only the scraps of
food that were left from a meal were given to her . 

One day , the relatives of the little girl brought in a fine deer from
the chase , and made ready for a feast . They told the girl to get out of
the lodge , for there was neither room , nor meat for her . 

The little girl ran and hid herself in a great field of corn . There she
cried aloud . 

Soon a band of strange Little People gathered about her , to comfort her . 
On all sides , from the folds of the green cornstalks they came . 

They stroked her head , wiped the tears from her eyes , and said ,  " Don ' t
cry , little girl . We will take care of you . You shall come and live with
us . We will make a feast for you . We know why you are sad , for we can
read the thoughts of all the earth children . Come with us , and we will
show you more wonderful things than you have ever seen . " 

At this the little girl dried her tears , and smiled at the kind Little
People . 

 " You are very good to me , " she said .  " Who are you ? " 

 " We are the _Jo gah oh_ , " they replied ,  " the Little People . Come , and we
will show you what we can do . " 

Then they slipped some winged moccasins upon her feet . They wrapped her
in an invisible blanket and put a magic corn plume in her hair , and the
next moment all were flying through the air . 

They flew to a ledge of great rocks . At the touch of the Little People , 
the rocks opened , and they passed within . 

The girl found herself in a beautiful lodge . Kind _Jo gah oh_ mothers
were baking cakes and roasting meat . They welcomed the girl , and soon a
feast was spread in her honor . 

Now the heart of the little girl was so light that she danced with joy . 

 " What wonderful people you are ! Can you go anywhere , or do anything you
wish ? " 

 " Yes , " said the little chief ,  " the _Jo gah oh_ are small , but they are
great . Come with us , and you shall see what we can do . " 

Again they were flying through the air . Soon they reached the lodge
where the little girl had lived . It was night , and her relatives were
asleep , but she could see the deer that hung outside ready for the
feast . 

 " Now , " said the _Jo gah oh_ chief ,  " we will call out a pack of wolves
from the wood yonder , and there will be no fat deer for this selfish
feast , at sunrise . " 

Now no wolves had been seen in that wood for many moons . But at the call
of the fairies , a pack sprang from it , ran to the lodge , seized the
deer , and tore it into shreds . Then they again disappeared in the wood . 

The little girl ' s eyes were large now with wonder , as they flew back to
the fairy lodge in the rocks , but she was not afraid of these strange
Little People . She was so happy with them she wished she might always
live in a _Jo gah oh_ lodge . 

One morning , the little chief said ,  " Today we shall see more wonders . " 

This time a tiny canoe was waiting . They stepped into it and sailed
down a river until they came to a great tree . 

 " In that tree , " said the little chief ,  " lives a great , black bear . Every
day he comes out that door you see high up in the bear tree . I will make
the door fast so he cannot open it . A deep sleep will fall on him . He
will sleep for many moons . " 

Then the chief threw three stones through the open door of the bear
tree . Each time , a flame spread like a blanket over the door . A growling
and scratching was heard within . Then all became still . 

 " Now , " said the chief ,  " the bear will sleep until I call him in the
spring . He is locked up for the winter . Come , let us go on . " 

The little girl drew her invisible blanket closer , as the canoe went
sailing with the birds through the clouds . The birds that were swift of
wing called loudly for a race . 

 " Come on ! " said the fairy chief . 

Then he spread wide the invisible sails of his canoe , and they flew past
the birds like a streak of lightning . Even the eagle was left far
behind . They seemed to shoot through the sky . 

And , oh , what fun it was to be a bird ! The little girl would have sailed
on forever , but the little chief said ,  " You shall now return to your
people . We have given them soft hearts and kind minds . They are calling
for you . They will be glad to see you . " 

And soon the little girl was again in the wigwam of her relatives , 
sitting by the warm fire . 

They greeted her with joy , spread a soft skin for her to sit upon , and
gave her the best food . And the little girl lived with them , ever after , 
and was happy . ï»¿
