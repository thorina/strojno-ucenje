I know , my friends , that you will wish to hear how , after having
been shipwrecked five times , and escaped so many dangers , I could
resolve again to tempt fortune , and expose myself to new
hardships . I am myself astonished at my conduct when I reflect
upon it , and must certainly have been actuated by my destiny , from
which none can escape . Be that as it may , after a year ' s rest I
prepared for a sixth voyage , notwithstanding the entreaties of my
kindred and friends , who did all in their power to dissuade me . 

Instead of taking my way by the Persian Gulf , I travelled once
more through several provinces of Persia and the Indies , and
arrived at a seaport , where I embarked in a ship , the captain of
which was bound on a long voyage , in which he and the pilot lost
their course . Suddenly we saw the captain quit his rudder , 
uttering loud lamentations . He threw off his turban , pulled his
beard , and beat his head like a madman . We asked him the reason;
and he answered that we were in the most dangerous place in all
the ocean .  " A rapid current carries the ship along with it , and we
shall all perish in less than a quarter of an hour . Pray to God to
deliver us from this peril; we cannot escape if He do not take
pity on us . " At these words he ordered the sails to be lowered;
but all the ropes broke , and the ship was carried by the current
to the foot of an inaccessible mountain , where she struck and went
to pieces; yet in such a manner that we saved our lives , our
provisions , and the best of our goods . 

The mountain at the foot of which we were was covered with wrecks , 
with a vast number of human bones , and with an incredible quantity
of goods and riches of all kinds . These objects served only to
augment our despair . In all other places it is usual for rivers to
run from their channels into the sea; but here a river of fresh
water runs from the sea into a dark cavern , whose entrance is very
high and spacious . What is most remarkable in this place is that
the stones of the mountain are of crystal , rubies , or other
precious stones . Here is also a sort of fountain of pitch or
bitumen , that runs into the sea , which the fish swallow , and
evacuate soon afterward , turned into ambergris; and this the waves
throw up on the beach in great quantities . Trees also grow here , 
most of which are of wood of aloes , equal in goodness to those of
Comari . 

To finish the description of this place , it is not possible for
ships to get off when once they approach within a certain
distance . If they be driven thither by a wind from the sea , the
wind and the current impel them; and if they come into it when a
land wind blows , which might seem to favor their getting out
again , the height of the mountain stops the wind , and occasions a
calm , so that the force of the current carries them ashore : and
what completes the misfortune is that there is no possibility of
ascending the mountain , or of escaping by sea . 

We continued upon the shore , at the foot of the mountain , in a
state of despair , and expected death every day . On our first
landing we had divided our provisions as equally as we could , and
thus every one lived a longer or shorter time , according to his
temperance , and the use he made of his provisions . 

I survived all my companions; and when I buried the last I had so
little provisions remaining that I thought I could not long
survive , and I dug a grave , resolving to lie down in it , because
there was no one left to pay me the last offices of respect . But
it pleased God once more to take compassion on me , and put it in
my mind to go to the bank of the river which ran into the great
cavern . Considering its probable course with great attention , I
said to myself ,  " This river , which runs thus underground , must
somewhere have an issue . If I make a raft , and leave myself to the
current , it will convey me to some inhabited country , or I shall
perish . If I be drowned I lose nothing , but only change one kind
of death for another . " 

I immediately went to work upon large pieces of timber and cables , 
for I had a choice of them from the wrecks , and tied them together
so strongly that I soon made a very solid raft . When I had
finished , I loaded it with some chests of rubies , emeralds , 
ambergris , rock crystal and bales of rich stuffs . Having balanced
my cargo exactly , and fastened it well to the raft , I went on
board with two oars that I had made , and leaving it to the course
of the river , resigned myself to the will of God . 

As soon as I entered the cavern I lost all light , and the stream
carried me I knew not whither . Thus I floated on in perfect
darkness , and once , found the arch so low that it very nearly
touched my head , which made me cautious afterward to avoid the
like danger . All this while I ate nothing but what was just
necessary to support nature; yet , notwithstanding my frugality , 
all my provisions were spent . Then I became insensible . I cannot
tell how long I continued so; but when I revived , I was surprised
to find myself in an extensive plain on the brink of a river , 
where my raft was tied , among a great number of negroes . I got up
as soon as I saw them , and saluted them . They spoke to me , but I
did not understand their language . 

I was so transported with joy that I knew not whether I was asleep
or awake; but being persuaded that I was not asleep , I recited the
following words in Arabic aloud : 

 " Call upon the Almighty , He will help thee; thou needst not
perplex thyself about anything else : shut thy eyes , and while thou
art asleep God will change thy bad fortune into good . " 

One of the negroes , who understood Arabic , hearing me speak thus , 
came toward me , and said :  " Brother , be not surprised to see us; we
are inhabitants of this country , and water our fields from this
river , which comes out of the neighboring mountain . We saw your
raft , and one of us swam into the river , and brought it hither , 
where we fastened it , as you see , until you should awake . Pray
tell us your history . Whence did you come ? " 

I begged of them first to give me something to eat , and then I
would satisfy their curiosity . They gave me several sorts of food , 
and when I had satisfied my hunger , I related all that had
befallen me , which they listened to with attentive surprise . As
soon as I had finished they told me , by the person who spoke
Arabic and interpreted to them what I said , that I must go along
with them , and tell my story to their king myself; it being too
extraordinary to be related by any other than the person to whom
the events had happened . 

They immediately sent for a horse , and having helped me to mount , 
some of them walked before to show the way , while the rest took my
raft and cargo and followed . 

We marched till we came to the capital of Serendib , for it was in
that island I had landed . The negroes presented me to their king;
I approached his throne , and saluted him as I used to do the kings
of the Indies; that is to say , I prostrated myself at his feet . 
The prince ordered me to rise , received me with an obliging air , 
and made me sit down near him . 

I concealed nothing from the king; but related to him all that I
have told you . At last my raft was brought in , and the bales
opened in his presence : he admired the quantity of wood of aloes
and ambergris; but above all , the rubies and emeralds , for he had
none in his treasury that equalled them . 

Observing that he looked on my jewels with pleasure , and viewed
the most remarkable among them , one after another , I fell
prostrate at his feet , and took the liberty to say to him ,  " Sire , 
not only my person is at your majesty ' s service , but the cargo of
the raft , and I would beg of you to dispose of it as your own . " 

He answered me with a smile ,  " Sindbad , I will take nothing of
yours; far from lessening your wealth , I design to augment it , and
will not let you quit my dominions without marks of my liberality . " 

He then charged one of his officers to take care of me , and
ordered people to serve me at his own expense . The officer was
very faithful in the execution of his commission , and caused all
the goods to be carried to the lodgings provided for me . 

I went every day at a set hour to make my court to the king , and
spent the rest of my time in viewing the city , and what was most
worthy of notice . 

The capital of Serendib stands at the end of a fine valley , in the
middle of the island , encompassed by high mountains . They are seen
three days ' sail off at sea . Rubies and several sorts of minerals
abound . All kinds of rare plants and trees grow there , especially
cedars and cocoanut . There is also a pearl-fishery in the mouth of
its principal river; and in some of its valleys are found
diamonds . I made , by way of devotion , a pilgrimage to the place
where Adam was confined after his banishment from Paradise , and
had the curiosity to go to the top of the mountain . 

When I returned to the city I prayed the king to allow me to
return to my own country , and he granted me permission in the most
obliging and honorable manner . He would force a rich present upon
me; and at the same time charged me with a letter for the
Commander of the Faithful , our sovereign , saying to me ,  " I pray
you give this present from me , and this letter , to the Caliph
Haroun-al-Raschid , and assure him of my friendship . " 

The letter from the King of Serendib was written on the skin of a
certain animal of great value , very scarce , and of a yellowish
color . The characters of this letter were of azure , and the
contents as follows : 

 " The King of the Indies , before whom march one hundred elephants , 
who lives in a palace that shines with one hundred thousand
rubies , and who has in his treasury twenty thousand crowns
enriched with diamonds , to Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid . 

 " Though the present we send you be inconsiderable , receive it , 
however , as a brother and a friend , in consideration of the hearty
friendship which we bear for you , and of which we are willing to
give you proof . We desire the same part in your friendship , 
considering that we believe it to be our merit , as we are both
kings . We send you this letter as from one brother to another . 
Farewell . " 

The present consisted , first , of one single ruby made into a cup , 
about half a foot high , an inch thick , and filled with round
pearls of half a drachm each . 2 . The skin of a serpent , whose
scales were as bright as an ordinary piece of gold , and had the
virtue to preserve from sickness those who lay upon it . 3 . Fifty
thousand drachms of the best wood of aloes , with thirty grains of
camphire as big as pistachios . And 4 . A female slave of great
beauty , whose robe was covered over with jewels . 

The ship set sail , and after a very successful navigation we
landed at Bussorah , and from thence I went to the city of Bagdad , 
where the first thing I did was to acquit myself of my commission . 

I took the King of Serendib ' s letter , and went to present myself
at the gate of the Commander of the Faithful , and was immediately
conducted to the throne of the caliph . I made my obeisance , and
presented the letter and gift . When he had read what the King of
Serendib wrote to him , he asked me if that prince were really so
rich and potent as he represented himself in his letter . I
prostrated myself a second time , and , rising again , said , 
 " Commander of the Faithful , I can assure your majesty he doth not
exceed the truth . I bear him witness . Nothing is more worthy of
admiration than the magnificence of his palace . When the prince
appears in public he has a throne fixed on the back of an
elephant , and rides between two ranks of his ministers , favorites , 
and other people of his court . Before him , upon the same elephant , 
an officer carries a golden lance in his hand; and behind him
there is another , who stands with a rod of gold , on the top of
which is an emerald , half a foot long and an inch thick . He is
attended by a guard of one thousand men , clad in cloth of gold and
silk , and mounted on elephants richly caparisoned . The officer who
is before him on the same elephant cries from time to time , with a
loud voice ,  ' Behold the great monarch , the potent and redoubtable
Sultan of the Indies , the monarch greater than Solomon , and the
powerful Maharaja . ' 

 " After he has pronounced those words , the officer behind the
throne cries in his turn ,  ' This monarch , so great and so powerful , 
must die , must die , must die ! ' And the officer before replies , 
 ' Praise alone be to Him who liveth for ever and ever . ' " 

The caliph was much pleased with my account , and sent me home with
a rich present . 

Here Sindbad commanded another hundred sequins to be paid to
Hindbad , and begged his return on the morrow to hear his seventh
and last voyage .
