There was an emperor who had three sons . One day the eldest son went out
hunting , and , when he got outside the town , up sprang a hare out of a
bush , and he after it , and hither and thither , till the hare fled into a
water-mill , and the prince after it . But it was not a hare , but a
dragon , and it waited for the prince and devoured him . When several days
had elapsed and the prince did not return home , people began to wonder
why it was that he was not to be found . Then the middle son went
hunting , and as he issued from the town , a hare sprang out of a bush , 
and the prince after it , and hither and thither , till the hare fled into
the water-mill and the prince after it; but it was not a hare , but a
dragon , which waited for and devoured him . When some days had elapsed
and the princes did not return , either of them , the whole court was in
sorrow . Then the third son went hunting , to see whether he could not
find his brothers . When he issued from the town , again up sprang a hare
out of a bush , and the prince after it , and hither and thither , till the
hare fled into the water-mill . But the prince did not choose to follow
it , but went to find other game , saying to himself :  " When I return I
shall find you . " After thus he went for a long time up and down the
hill , but found nothing , and then returned to the water-mill; but when
he got there , there was only an old woman in the mill . The prince
invoked God in addressing her :  " God help you , old woman ! " The old woman
replied :  " God help you , my son ! " Then the prince asked her :  " Where , old
woman , is my hare ? " She replied :  " My son , that was not a hare , but a
dragon . It kills and throttles many people . " Hearing this , the prince
was somewhat disturbed , and said to the old woman :  " What shall we do
now ? Doubtless my two brothers also have perished here . " The old woman
answered :  " They have indeed; but there ' s no help for it . Go home , my
son , lest you follow them . " Then he said to her :  " Dear old woman , do you
know what ? I know that you will be glad to liberate yourself from that
pest . " The old woman interrupted him :  " How should I not ? It captured me , 
too , in this way , but now I have no means of escape . " Then he proceeded : 
 " Listen well to what I am going to say to you . Ask it whither it goes
and where its strength is; then kiss all that place where it tells you
its strength is , as if from love , till you ascertain it , and afterward
tell me when I come . " Then the prince went off to the palace , and the
old woman remained in the water-mill . When the dragon came in , the old
woman began to question it :  " Where in God ' s name have you been ? Whither
do you go so far ? You will never tell me whither you go . " The dragon
replied :  " Well , my dear old woman , I do go far . " Then the old woman
began to coax it :  " And why do you go so far ? Tell me where your strength
is . If I knew where your strength is , I don ' t know what I should do for
love; I would kiss all that place . " Thereupon the dragon smiled and said
to her :  " Yonder is my strength , in that fireplace . " Then the old woman
began to fondle and kiss the fireplace , and the dragon on seeing it
burst into a laugh and said to her :  " Silly old woman , my strength isn ' t
there; my strength is in that tree-fungus in front of the house . " Then
the old woman began again to fondle and kiss the tree , and the dragon
again laughed , and said to her :  " Away , old woman ! my strength isn ' t
there . " Then the old woman inquired :  " Where is it ? " The dragon began to
give an account in detail :  " My strength is a long way off , and you
cannot go thither . Far in another empire under the emperor ' s city is a
lake , in that lake is a dragon , and in that dragon a boar , and in the
boar a pigeon , and in that is my strength . " The next morning when the
dragon went away from the mill , the prince came to the old woman , and
the old woman told him all that she had heard from the dragon . Then he
left his home , and disguised himself; he put shepherd ' s boots to his
feet , took a shepherd ' s staff in his hand , and went into the world . As
he went on thus from village to village , and from town to town , at last
he came into another empire and into the imperial city , in a lake under
which the dragon was . On going into the town he began to inquire who
wanted a shepherd . The citizens told him that the emperor did . Then he
went straight to the emperor . After he announced himself , the emperor
admitted him into his presence , and asked him :  " Do you wish to keep
sheep ? " He replied :  " I do , illustrious crown ! " Then the emperor engaged
him , and began to inform and instruct him :  " There is here a lake , and
alongside of the lake very beautiful pasture , and when you call the
sheep out , they go thither at once , and spread themselves round the
lake; but whatever shepherd goes off there , that shepherd returns back
no more . Therefore , my son , I tell you , don ' t let the sheep have their
own way and go where _they_ will , but keep them where _you_ will . " The
prince thanked the emperor , got himself ready , and called out the sheep , 
taking with him , more-over , two hounds that could catch a boar in the
open country , and a falcon that could capture any bird , and carrying
also a pair of bagpipes . When he called out the sheep he let them go at
once to the lake , and when the sheep arrived at the lake , they
immediately spread round it , and the prince placed the falcon on a
stump , and the hounds and bagpipes under the stump , then tucked up his
hose and sleeves , waded into the lake , and began to shout :  " Dragon , 
dragon ! come out to single combat with me to-day that we may measure
ourselves together , unless you ' re a woman . " [6] The dragon called out in
reply ,  " I will do so now , prince--now ! " Erelong behold the dragon ! it is
large , it is terrible , it is disgusting ! When the dragon came out , it
seized him by the waist , and they wrestled a summer day till afternoon . 
But when the heat of afternoon came on , the dragon said :  " Let me go , 
prince , that I may moisten my parched head in the lake , and toss you to
the sky . " But the prince replied :  " Come , dragon , don ' t talk nonsense; if
I had the emperor ' s daughter to kiss me on the forehead , I would toss
you still higher . " Thereupon , the dragon suddenly let him go , and went
off into the lake . On the approach of evening , he washed and got himself
up nicely , placed the falcon on his arm , the hounds behind him , and the
bagpipes under his arm , then drove the sheep and went into the town
playing on the bagpipes . When he arrived at the town , the whole town
assembled as to see a wondrous sight because he had come , whereas
previously no shepherd had been able to come from the lake . The next day
the prince got ready again , and went with his sheep straight to the
lake . But the emperor sent two grooms after him to go stealthily and see
what he did , and they placed themselves on a high hill whence they could
have a good view . When the shepherd arrived , he put the hounds and
bagpipes under the stump and the falcon upon it , then tucked up his hose
and sleeves waded into the lake and shouted :  " Dragon , dragon ! come out
to single combat with me , that we may measure ourselves once more
together , unless you are a woman ! " The dragon replied :  " I will do so , 
prince , now , now ! " Erelong , behold the dragon ! it was large , it was
terrible , it was disgusting ! And it seized him by the waist and wrestled
with him a summer ' s day till afternoon . But when the afternoon heat came
on , the dragon said :  " Let me go , prince , that I may moisten my parched
head in the lake , and may toss you to the sky . " The prince replied : 
 " Come , dragon , don ' t talk nonsense; if I had the emperor ' s daughter to
kiss me on the forehead , I would toss you still higher . " Thereupon the
dragon suddenly left hold of him , and went off into the lake . When night
approached the prince drove the sheep as before , and went home playing
the bagpipes When he arrived at the town , the whole town was astir and
began to wonder because the shepherd came home every evening , which no
one had been able to do before . Those two grooms had already arrived at
the palace before the prince , and related to the emperor in order
everything that they had heard and seen . Now when the emperor saw that
the shepherd returned home , he immediately summoned his daughter into
his presence and told her all , what it was and how it was .  " But , " said
he ,  " to-morrow you must go with the shepherd to the lake and kiss him on
the forehead . " When she heard this she burst into tears and began to
entreat her father .  " You have no one but me , and I am your only
daughter , and you don ' t care about me if I perish . " Then the emperor
began to persuade and encourage her :  " Don ' t fear , my daughter; you see
we have had so many changes of shepherds , and of all that went out to
the lake not one has returned; but _he_ had been contending with the
dragon for two whole days and it has done him no hurt . I assure you , in
God ' s name , that he is able to overcome the dragon , only go to-morrow
with him to see whether he will free us from this mischief which has
destroyed so many people . " 

When , on the morrow , the day dawned and the sun came forth , up rose the
shepherd , up rose the maiden too , to begin to prepare for going to the
lake . The shepherd was cheerful , more cheerful than ever , but the
emperor ' s daughter was sad and shed tears . The shepherd comforted her : 
 " Lady sister , I pray you , do not weep , but do what I tell you . When it
is time , run up and kiss me , and fear not . " As he went and drove the
sheep , the shepherd was thoroughly cheery , and played a merry tune on
his bagpipes; but the damsel did nothing but weep as she went beside
him , and he several times left off playing and turned toward her :  " Weep
not , golden one; fear nought . " When they arrived at the lake , the sheep
immediately spread round it , and the prince placed the falcon on the
stump , and the hounds and bagpipes under it , then tucked up his hose and
sleeves , waded into the water , and shouted :  " Dragon ! dragon ! Come out to
single combat with me; let us measure ourselves once more , unless you ' re
a woman ! " The dragon replied :  " I will , prince; now , now ! " Erelong , 
there was the dragon ! it was huge , it was terrible , it was disgusting ! 
When it came out , they seized each other by the middle , and wrestled a
summer ' s day till afternoon . But when the afternoon heat came on , the
dragon said :  " Let me go , prince , that I may moisten my parched head in
the lake , and toss you to the skies . " The prince replied :  " Come , dragon , 
don ' t talk nonsense; if I had the emperor ' s daughter to kiss me on the
forehead , I would toss you much higher . " When he said this , the
emperor ' s daughter ran up and kissed him on the face , on the eye , and on
the forehead . Then he swung the dragon , and tossed it high into the air , 
and when it fell to the ground it burst into pieces . But as it burst
into pieces , out of it sprang a wild boar , and started to run away . But
the prince shouted to his shepherd dogs :  " Hold it ! don ' t let it go ! " and
the dogs sprang up and after it , caught it , and soon tore it to pieces . 
But out of the boar flew a pigeon , and the prince loosed the falcon , and
the falcon caught the pigeon and brought it into the prince ' s hands . The
prince said to it :  " Tell me now , where are my brothers ? " The pigeon
replied :  " I will; only do me no harm . Immediately behind your father ' s
town is a water-mill , and in the water-mill are three wands that have
sprouted up . Cut these three wands up from below , and strike with them
upon their root; an iron door will immediately open into a large vault . 
In that vault are many people , old and young , rich and poor , small and
great , wives and maidens , so that you could settle a populous empire;
there , too , are your brothers . " When the pigeon had told him all this , 
the prince immediately wrung its neck . 

The emperor had gone out in person , and posted himself on the hill from
which the grooms had viewed the shepherd , and he , too , was a spectator
of all that had taken place . After the shepherd had thus obtained the
dragon ' s head , twilight began to approach . He washed himself nicely , 
took the falcon on his shoulder , the hounds behind him , and the bagpipes
under his arm , played as he went , drove the sheep , and proceeded to the
emperor ' s palace , with the damsel at his side still in terror . When they
came to the town , all the town assembled as to see a wonder . The
emperor , who had seen all his heroism from the hill , called him into
his presence , and gave him his daughter , went immediately to church , had
them married , and held a wedding festival for a week . After this the
prince told him who and whence he was , and the emperor and the whole
town rejoiced still more . Then , as the prince was urgent to go to his
own home , the emperor gave him a large escort , and equipped him for the
journey . When they were in the neighbourhood of the water-mill , the
prince halted his attendants , went inside , cut up the three wands , and
struck the root with them , and the iron door opened at once . In the
vault was a vast multitude of people . The prince ordered them to come
out one by one , and go whither each would , and stood himself at the
door . They came out thus one after another , and lo ! there were his
brothers also , whom he embraced and kissed . When the whole multitude had
come out , they thanked him for releasing and delivering them , and went
each to his own home . But he went to his father ' s house with his
brothers and bride , and there lived and reigned to the end of his days .
