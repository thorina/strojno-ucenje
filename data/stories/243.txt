All the troubles and calamities I had undergone could not cure me
of my inclination to make new voyages . I therefore bought goods , 
departed with them for the best seaport; and there , that I might
not be obliged to depend upon a captain , but have a ship at my own
command , I remained till one was built on purpose , at my own
charge . When the ship was ready I went on board with my goods; but
not having enough to load her , I agreed to take with me several
merchants of different nations , with their merchandise . 

We sailed with the first fair wind , and , after a long navigation , 
the first place we touched at was a desert island , where we found
an egg of a roc , equal in size to that I formerly mentioned . There
was a young roc in it , just ready to be hatched , and its beak had
begun to break the egg . The merchants who landed with me broke the
egg with hatchets , and made a hole in it , pulled out the young
roc , piecemeal , and roasted it . I had in vain entreated them not
to meddle with the egg . 

Scarcely had they finished their repast , When there appeared in
the air , at a considerable distance , two great clouds . The captain
of my ship , knowing by experience what they meant , said they were
the male and female parents of the roc , and pressed us to re-
embark with all speed , to prevent the misfortune which he saw
would otherwise befall us . 

The two rocs approached with a frightful noise , which they
redoubled when they saw the egg broken and their young one gone . 
They flew back in the direction they had come , and disappeared for
some time , while we made all the sail we could to endeavor to
prevent that which unhappily befell us . 

They soon returned , and we observed that each of them carried
between its talons an enormous rock . When they came directly over
my ship , they hovered , and one of them let go his rock; but by the
dexterity of the steersman it missed us , and fell into the sea . 
The other so exactly hit the middle of the ship as to split it
into pieces . The mariners and passengers were all crushed to
death , or fell into the sea . I myself was of the number of the
latter; but , as I came up again , I fortunately caught hold of a
piece of the wreck , and swimming , sometimes with one hand and
sometimes with the other , but always holding fast the plank , the
wind and the tide favoring me , I came to an island , and got safely
ashore . 

I sat down upon the grass , to recover myself from my fatigue , 
after which I went into the island to explore it . It seemed to be
a delicious garden . I found trees everywhere , some of them bearing
green and others ripe fruits , and streams of fresh pure water . I
ate of the fruits , which I found excellent; and drank of the
water , which was very light and good . 

When I was a little advanced into the island , I saw an old man , 
who appeared very weak and infirm . He was sitting on the bank of a
stream , and at first I took him to be one who had been shipwrecked
like myself . I went toward him and saluted him , but he only
slightly bowed his head . I asked him why he sat so still; but
instead of answering me , he made a sign for me to take him upon my
back , and carry him over the brook . 

I believed him really to stand in need of my assistance , took him
upon my back , and having carried him over , bade him get down , and
for that end stooped , that he might get off with ease; but instead
of doing so  ( which I laugh at every time I think of it ) , the old
man , who to me appeared quite decrepit , threw his legs nimbly
about my neck . He sat astride upon my shoulders , and held my
throat so tight that I thought he would have strangled me , and I
fainted away . 

Notwithstanding my fainting , the ill-natured old fellow still kept
his seat upon my neck . When I had recovered my breath , he thrust
one of his feet against my side , and struck me so rudely with the
other that he forced me to rise up against my will . Having arisen , 
he made me carry him under the trees , and forced me now and then
to stop , that he might gather and eat fruit . He never left his
seat all day; and when I lay down to rest at night , he laid
himself down with me , holding still fast about my neck . Every
morning he pinched me to make me awake , and afterward obliged me
to get up and walk , and spurred me with his feet . 

One day I found several dry calabashes that had fallen from a
tree . I took a large one , and , after cleaning it , pressed into it
some juice of grapes , which abounded in the island; having filled
the calabash , I put it by in a convenient place , and going thither
again some days after , I tasted it , and found the wine so good
that it gave me new vigor , and so exhilarated my spirits that I
began to sing and dance as I carried my burden . 

The old man , perceiving the effect which this had upon me , and
that I carried him with more ease than before , made me a sign to
give him some of it . I handed him the calabash , and the liquor
pleasing his palate , he drank it off . There being a considerable
quantity of it , he soon began to sing , and to move about from side
to side in his seat upon my shoulders , and by degrees to loosen
his legs from about me . Finding that he did not press me as
before , I threw him upon the ground , where he lay without motion;
I then took up a great stone and slew him . 

I was extremely glad to be thus freed for ever from this
troublesome fellow . I now walked toward the beach , where I met the
crew of a ship that had cast anchor to take in water; they were
surprised to see me , but more so at hearing the particulars of my
adventures .  " You fell , " said they ,  " into the hands of the Old Man
of the Sea , and are the first who ever escaped strangling by his
malicious embraces . He never quitted those he had once made
himself master of till he had destroyed them , and he has made this
island notorious by the number of men he has slain . " They carried
me with them to the captain , who received me with great kindness . 
He put out again to sea , and , after some days ' sail , we arrived at
the harbor of a great city , the houses of which overhung the sea . 

One of the merchants who had taken me into his friendship invited
me to go along with him . He gave me a large sack , and having
recommended me to some people of the town , who used to gather
cocoanuts , desired them to take me with them .  " Go , " said he , 
 " follow them , and act as you see them do; but do not separate from
them , otherwise you may endanger your life . " Having thus spoken , 
he gave me provisions for the journey , and I went with them . 

We came to a thick forest of cocoa trees , very lofty , with trunks
so smooth that it was not possible to climb to the branches that
bore the fruit . When we entered the forest we saw a great number
of apes of several sizes , who fled as soon as they perceived us , 
and climbed to the tops of the trees with amazing swiftness . 

The merchants with whom I was gathered stones , and threw them at
the apes on the trees . I did the same; and the apes , out of
revenge , threw coconuts at us so fast , and with such gestures , as
sufficiently testified their anger and resentment . We gathered up
the cocoanuts , and from time to time threw stones to provoke the
apes; so that by this stratagem we filled our bags with cocoanuts . 
I thus gradually collected as many cocoanuts as produced me a
considerable sum . 

Having laden our vessel with cocoanuts , we set sail , and passed by
the islands where pepper grows in great plenty . From thence we
went to the Isle of Comari , where the best species of wood of
aloes grows . I exchanged my cocoa in those two islands for pepper
and wood of aloes , and went with other merchants a-pearl-fishing , 
I hired divers , who brought me up some that were very large and
pure . I embarked in a vessel that happily arrived at Bussorah;
from thence I returned to Bagdad , where I realized vast sums from
my pepper , wood of aloes , and pearls . I gave the tenth of my gains
in alms , as I had done upon my return from my other voyages , and
rested from my fatigues . 

Sindbad here ordered one hundred sequins to be given to Hindbad , 
and requested him and the other guests to dine with him the next
day , to hear the account of his sixth voyage .
