 My good blade carves the casques of men , 
 My tough lance thrusteth sure , 
 My strength is as the strength of ten , 
 Because my heart is pure . 
 The shattering trumpet shrilleth high , 
 The hard brands shiver on the steel , 
 The splinter ' d spear-shafts crack and fly , 
 The horse and rider reel : 
 They reel , they roll in changing lists , 
 And when the tide of combat stands , 
 Perfume and flowers fall in showers , 
 That lightly rain from ladies ' hands . 

 How sweet are looks that ladies bend
 On whom their favours fall ! 
 For them I battle till the end , 
 To save from shame and thrall : 
 But all my heart is drawn above , 
 My knees are bow ' d in crypt and shrine : 
 I never felt the kiss of love , 
 Nor maiden ' s hand in mine . 
 More bounteous aspects on me beam , 
 Me mightier transports move and thrill;
 So keep I fair thro ' faith and prayer
 A virgin heart in work and will . 

 When down the stormy crescent goes , 
 A light before me swims , 
 Between dark stems the forest glows , 
 I hear a noise of hymns : 
 Then by some secret shrine I ride;
 I hear a voice but none are there;
 The stalls are void , the doors are wide , 
 The tapers burning fair . 
 Fair gleams the snowy altar-cloth , 
 The silver vessels sparkle clean , 
 The shrill bell rings , the censer swings , 
 And solemn chaunts resound between . 

 Sometimes on lonely mountain-meres
 I find a magic bark;
 I leap on board : no helmsman steers : 
 I float till all is dark . 
 A gentle sound , an awful light ! 
 Three angels bear the Holy Grail : 
 With folded feet , in stoles of white , 
 On sleeping wings they sail . 
 Ah , blessed vision ! blood of God ! 
 My spirit beats her mortal bars , 
 As down dark tides the glory slides , 
 And star-like mingles with the stars . 

 When on my goodly charger borne
 Thro ' dreaming towns I go , 
 The cock crows ere the Christmas morn , 
 The streets are dumb with snow . 
 The tempest crackles on the leads , 
 And , ringing , spins from brand and mail;
 But o ' er the dark a glory spreads , 
 And gilds the driving hail . 

 I leave the plain , I climb the height;
 No branchy thicket shelter yields;
 But blessed forms in whistling storms
 Fly o ' er waste fens and windy fields . 

 A maiden knight--to me is given
 Such hope , I know not fear;
 I yearn to breathe the airs of heaven
 That often meet me here . 
 I muse on joy that will not cease , 
 Pure spaces clothed in living beams , 
 Pure lilies of eternal peace , 
 Whose odors haunt my dreams;
 And , stricken by an angel ' s hand , 
 This mortal armour that I wear , 
 This weight and size , this heart and eyes , 
 Are touch ' d , are turn ' d to finest air . 

 The clouds are broken in the sky , 
 And thro ' the mountain-walls
 A rolling organ-harmony
 Swells up , and shakes and falls . 
 Then move the trees , the copses nod , 
 Wings flutter , voices hover clear : 
  " O just and faithful knight of God ! 
 Ride on ! the prize is near . " 
 So pass I hostel , hall , and grange;
 By bridge and ford , by park and pale , 
 All-arm ' d I ride , whate ' er betide , 
 Until I find the Holy Grail .
