Little Fairy Tenderheart was weeping . She sat on a ledge that overlooked
the world , and her tears fell fast . In twos and threes her sisters flew
from Fairyland to put their arms about her , but none could comfort her . 
 " Come , dance and sing with us and forget your grief , " they said . She
shook her head .  " The terrible fighting ! " she said .  " See where far below
men rage , killing each other . Rivers run red with blood , and the sorrow
of weeping women rises through the air to where I sit . How can I dance
and sing ? " 

 " It is the world at war , " said an older fairy sadly .  " I too have wept in
earlier days when men have fought . But our tears are wasted , little
sister . Come away . " 

Fairy Tenderheart looked eagerly at her .  " You who have watched the world
so many years , " she said ,  " tell me why such dreadful deeds are done down
there . " 

The older fairy bent her eyes on the blackened plains of earth .  " I
cannot tell you that , " she slowly said .  " We watch and pity , but we
cannot know what works in the hearts of men that they should gather in
their millions to destroy their brothers and themselves . No other
creature turns on its own kind and kills so terribly as man . " 

 " What can we do ? It must be stopped . What can we do ? " 

 " We can do nothing , little sister . See where the women of the world
stretch out their hands , imploring men to live in peace . They beg the
lives of fathers , husbands , sons; they point to ruined homes and
desolated lands .  ' War wrecks our lives ! ' they cry . Yet even for those
they love men will not give up battle . What , then , can fairies do ? Tears
are useless . Come away . " 

 " I must stay here . I must think of something I can do , " said Fairy
Tenderheart; and she would not go . 

Her tears had stopped . She searched with anxious eyes across the world
to find some means of helping men to better things , but no way could she
find . And still the fighters shot and stabbed , and the dying and the
dead lay piled upon the fields . 

Another fairy flew to her .  " Come away , little sister ! " she said .  " I
cannot bear to see you sorrowing . Come , or you will forget the merry
ways of Fairyland and grow like the Oldest Fairy of All , who spends her
life brooding over this dreary earth . " 

Fairy Tenderheart sprang up .  " Where is she ? Tell me where to find her . 
Why did I not know of her before ? I will go to her that we may be
companions in our sorrow . Perhaps together we may find a way to help . " 

 " Ah , do not go . Listen ! She is so old that she has watched the world
since the beginning of wars , yet , as you see , she has found no way of
stopping them . How then can you ? " 

 " I must go . " 

 " She left our joyful Fairyland for a Magic Garden , and whoever enters
that Garden can never come back to us . There she dwells for ever alone , 
at work or in thought , or preparing for her mysterious journeys to the
earth . Do not go , or you too will be cut off from our life of dance and
song , never to return . " 

 " I will go . Tell me the way . " 

The fairy flew off .  " I will not tell you , " she said .  " You shall not go . " 

 " I will go , " said Fairy Tenderheart again . With steadfast steps she
searched through Fairyland until she found a narrow track that led
between the winding mountains and far out across wide , shimmering
plains . This track she followed till she came upon the Magic Garden . 

The Oldest Fairy of All sat thinking among her flowers , and her eyes
were filled with peace . She looked at Fairy Tenderheart standing at the
gate .  " Who enters here can never return to Fairyland , " she said , and her
voice was sweeter than the songs of birds . 

Fairy Tenderheart pushed open the gate and stepped within the Garden . 
 " Who enters here finds joy , " said the Oldest Fairy of All , and a crown
of happiness sat on her hair . 

 " You come to work ? " she asked . 

 " I come to learn what I may do to help the suffering earth , " said Fairy
Tenderheart .  " Its cries of agony have beaten on my heart until there was
no rest for me in Fairyland . Is there no way to make war cease ? I come
to you for wisdom . " 

The Oldest Fairy of All rose up and smiled , and her face was brighter
than the moon and stars .  " Look closely at my flowers , " she said ,  " and
tell me which you think most beautiful . " 

The flowers bloomed on every side , in every lovely hue--crimson and gold
and orange , blue and purple and pink and softest lavender . All were
scented , and all were beautiful; but there was one plant that pleased
the little fairy more than any other . It grew no taller than the rest , 
made no great show of colour , yet through its stems and leaves there
shone a radiance as if a light hid in them . Its flowers were clear as
crystal--one could see quite through them--but the sunlight falling on
them was broken into glowing colours , so that every blossom was a little
bunch of flashing rainbows . And where the flowers had closed and grown
to fruit they hung golden as the sun and fragrant with a scent that
stole upon the wind and made the heart heat high with happiness . 

 " This is the most beautiful , " said Fairy Tenderheart . 

 " You have chosen well , " said the Oldest Fairy of All .  " You are fitted to
help me in my work . That is the Plant of Knowledge; its crystal
blossoms are called the Flowers of Understanding , and its fruit is Love . 
By it alone can war be made to cease . " 

She pointed far below .  " I have planted it upon the earth in many spots , " 
she said .  " Here and there it has flourished and spread , and its fruit
has sweetened all the air . But , alas ! " her eyes grew sad ,  " too often it
has been trampled under foot and killed , and war has broken out afresh . 
If only men would care for it and let it grow the world would soon be
wrapped in peace . " 

 " Can we not plant more and more until it spreads across the world in
spite of all neglect ? " asked Fairy Tenderheart . 

The Oldest Fairy shook her head .  " I have done my best , " she said;  " but
while men tramp it down it cannot spread across the world . Even when it
has grown well it cannot do the good it ought to do : a nation which has
eaten of its Fruit of Love and has learned to scorn the littleness of
war is yet forced by that same Love to fight , that it may rescue a weak
and helpless country from the greedy clutches of those who have refused
to let my dear plant bloom . In the end it shall spread , no doubt , and
my work shall be complete; but the time is long , the time is long . " 

She mused , and Fairy Tenderheart gazed thoughtfully upon the earth . 
Presently she raised her eyes , and they were bright with hope . 

 " See where a group of children gathers round your precious plant ! " she
said .  " How eagerly they stretch their hands towards it , and how they
look into its flashing flowers . They will never tread it in the mud , for
they have seen its splendour . Let me take seeds to all the children ' s
gardens in the world . The Children ! They will welcome your Plant of
Knowledge with its Flowers of Understanding , and when they have tasted
its Fruit of Love they will grow up scorning war , and the world will
live in peace . " 

The Oldest Fairy laughed with joy .  " Oh , little sister , you have come to
help indeed ! " she said .  " You are right . The Children ! It is to them we
must take our plant . Come , let us gather seeds and start at once . " 

They gathered the golden seeds and carried them swiftly down . In the
children ' s gardens across the world they planted them , and everywhere
the children ran to gaze at the wonder of the springing plants , and to
watch the flowers unclose . And when through later days they ate and ate
again of the fragrant golden fruit , Love filled their veins and they
became a new race , scorning the littleness of war . And the world was
wrapped in peace . ï»¿
