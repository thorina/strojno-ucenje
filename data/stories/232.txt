Once upon a time a king and a queen gave a magnificent party in honor of
the christening of their new-born son , Prince Rolandor . To this party
the royal parents took good care to invite every single fairy in
Fairyland , for they knew very well the unhappy consequences of
forgetting to invite fairies to christenings . When all the invitations
had been sent out , the Queen went down to the kitchen to superintend the
cooking of the master-dainty of the feast , a huge strawberry-tart . 

The morning on which the grand ceremony was to take place arrived . At
half-past ten the Court Astrologer , who was master of ceremonies , gave
the order to form in line; and at ten minutes to eleven the splendid
procession started for the church . The road was lined with the King ' s
vassals shouting ,  " Hurrah , hurrah ! " Countless little elves with gauzy
wings watched from the branches of the trees; and the great cathedral
bells went clang , bang , clang , as merrily as could be . 

Just behind the royal body-guard came the King ' s gold-and-diamond coach
shining in the sunlight of June , with the King and the Queen in it on
one side and the Court Astrologer and the fairy Titania , prospective
godparents of the little Prince , on the other . The Prince himself , 
swathed in a wonderful silk mantle edged with pearls and turquoises , 
slept in the Astrologer ' s arms . 

The procession entered the church , where the venerable Lord Archbishop , 
surrounded by a magnificent choir , was awaiting its coming . A hush went
over the great assembly as the parents and the godparents advanced to
the flower-decked font , and the silence lasted until His Eminence had
sprinkled the Prince and given him the name of Rolandor . Then the bells
rang again , the organ roared so that the windows shook in their
casements , and the choristers sang like birds on a summer afternoon . 

The christening over , the procession went back to the castle , past the
waiting rows of bystanders , not one of whom had changed his place or
gone away , so superb had been the spectacle . 

The christening banquet was laid in the great hall of the castle , and , 
thanks to the Court Astrologer , things went off beautifully . It was the
only large banquet ever known in the history of the world where courses
were served all at one time , and while one person was finishing an ice , 
another was not beginning with the soup . Nor was the menu mixed , which
happens so frequently to-day that you are apt to have soup , ice , cake , 
roast , soup , and a roast again . No , from soup to ice the banquet was a
huge success; but , alas , disaster came with the strawberry-tart . 

As the Queen was chatting with the Lord Chancellor of the Enchanted
Islands , she happened to notice--for like a good hostess she had been
keeping an eye to the comfort of her guests--that nobody on the
right-hand side of the hall had been served with strawberry-tart . Almost
at the same moment , the chief cook , looking rather pale and worried , 
bustled through the throng and whispered in her ear ,  " Your Majesty , the
strawberry-tart has given out ! " 

The Queen turned pale . At length she managed to ask in a weak voice , 
 " Have you plenty of other pastries ? " 

 " Yes , Your Majesty , " replied the cook . 

 " Then let them be served at once . " 

The cook withdrew , and the Queen , though somewhat shaken , took up the
conversation again . Ten minutes passed , and she was beginning to forget
her start , when a voice , rising clear and rasping over the hubbub of the
hall , said suddenly ,  " Where ' s my piece of strawberry-tart ? " 

Everybody turned toward the speaker , an elderly fairy from the Kingdom
of the Black Mountains , named Malvolia . She stood up in her place , her
arms akimbo , glowering at her plate , on which an attendant had just
deposited a small chocolate eclair . 

 " Where ' s my piece of strawberry-tart ? " she repeated . 

The Queen rose .  " I am very sorry , Madam Malvolia , " said she in her
sweetest voice ,  " but the strawberry-tart has given out . " 

 " Hoity-toity , " answered Malvolia rudely;  " you mean that you only baked
enough for your own personal friends . " 

At this several guests cried ,  " Sh ! Sh ! " and the King began to look
worried . 

 " We will send for some at once , " announced His Majesty . 

 " Oh yes , --strawberry-tart baked by the Queen ' s own hands for her own
dear friends , " said Malvolia sneeringly;  " but for me , a fairy of age and
distinction , an ordinary , low baker ' s eclair . The Kingdom of the Black
Mountains has been deliberately insulted in my person ! " 

 " No , no , no , no ! " cried the King and the Queen .  " We assure you , madam , 
that it was a simple mischance . " 

 " Pish and tush ! " replied Malvolia , who , like a great many people , 
secretly enjoyed feeling herself aggrieved .  " I consider the affair an
affront , a deliberate affront . And you shall pay dear for this
humiliation , " she screamed , quickly losing control of her temper .  " Every
time the Prince sneezes something shall change until-- " 

At this very moment , alas , a northeast wind blew gustily through the
open windows of the hall , shaking the tapestries from the walls , and
carrying away the last of Malvolia ' s sentence . The angry fairy turned
herself into a great black raven and flew , cawing hoarsely , over the
heads of the banqueters and out of the window with the wind . 

A baby ' s cry was heard , and the King and the Queen rushed panic-stricken
to where their little son lay in his cradle on a raised platform at the
head of the hall . The little Prince ' s fat , pink face was twisted into
dreadful lines; he opened his mouth wide several times and half closed
it again; then , opening it wider than ever , he sneezed a terrible
sneeze . 

There came a loud clap of thunder . When the confusion was over , the
Court Astrologer was found to have turned into an eight-day clock , with
a sun , moon , and stars arrangement , a planetary indicator , and a
calendar calculated for two thousand years . The banquet ended rather
gloomily , although the gifts of the other fairies , such as health , 
wealth , and beauty , managed to make everyone a little more cheerful . 

When the guests were gone , the King and Queen sent for Doctor Pill , the
court physician , to consult him in regard to the measures which ought to
be taken to prevent the Prince ' s sneezing . As for the poor Court
Astrologer , he was hung up in the sacristy of the cathedral , and every
eight days his wife wound him up , with tears . 

 " What shall we do , doctor ? " asked the King rather mournfully . 

 " The Prince must be preserved from the things which cause sneezing , " 
said the doctor sagely . 

 " Such as draughts ? " suggested the King . 

 " Draughts , head-colds , snuff , and pepper , " answered the leech .  " Let his
little highness be put into a special suite of rooms; admit no person to
them until he has been examined for head-cold , and has put on germ-proof
garments; and as his little highness grows older , forbid the use of
pepper in his food . Better still , if Your Majesty has a castle in the
mountains , let the Prince be taken there for the sake of the purer air . " 

 " There is the tower on the Golden Mountain , " said the King . 

At this the Queen began to weep again , for she , quite naturally , did not
wish to part with her child . 

 " But , my dear , we can ' t have him sneezing , and things changing all the
time , " said the King . 

 " I beg Your Majesty to consider the danger of a head-cold , " put in the
doctor . 

 " Yes , think of the danger of a head-cold , " echoed the King , who saw
clearer than the Queen the chaos that might result if the Prince was
attacked by a prolonged fit of sneezing .  " People with head-colds may
sneeze ten or fifteen times a day . " 

 " Or fifty , " said the doctor . 

 " Or fifty , " echoed the King again , shaking his head , for he was torn
between paternal love and kingly duty .  " Imagine fifty enchantments in a
day ! By eventide the whole kingdom would be upset , undone , and the
people plotting a revolution . " 

 " The tower on the Golden Mountain is in a fine healthful locality , " said
the doctor ,  " and the Prince could be brought up as happily there as in
the palace . " 

So at length the Queen consented . In a few days the little Prince , who
had not sneezed a second time , was removed to the tower on the Golden
Mountain . His room , designed by Doctor Pill , was completely protected
from draughts , and every breath of air that entered it was
tri-bi-sterilized . Mrs . Pill , who had been a hospital nurse , took care
of him . Three times a week , on Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays , his
royal parents rode out to the tower , and after putting on germ-proof
garments , were admitted to the nursery of their infant son . 

And so the years went by . Nobody was found able to break Malvolia ' s
spell , and the clue to its undoing had been carried away by the wind . 
Malvolia herself had disappeared . 

The Prince became a handsome little boy . Accomplished teachers taught
him history , music , drawing , dancing , and all the other things that a
prince ought to know . But of real life he knew almost nothing at all . 

His most faithful friend during these lonely years was a French poodle , 
who spoke both French and English exceedingly well . Of course , he had a
marked canine accent , rather growling his g ' s and howling the aw ' s and
the ow ' s , but his words were well chosen and his vocabulary extensive . 
Never was seen a more friendly , wise , and devoted animal . 

When the King decided to have him sent away for a while , for he feared
that his son was getting a touch of Poldo ' s barky manner of speaking , 
from too close an association , the little Prince became really ill from
grief , and the King was forced to alter his decision . 

During his imprisonment in the tower , in spite of all precautions , the
Prince sneezed three times . At the first sneeze , all the dogs in the
kingdom except Poldo changed into cats , and all the cats into dogs . 
Though this was not a serious trouble , the change was certainly
inconvenient . All the dog-cats came out meowing at people as the dogs
used to bark at them , and they chased people down the street; the
cat-dogs , on the other hand , stayed in the kitchen under the stove , and
watched for mice in the pantry . Great St . Bernards might be seen licking
their paws and rubbing them over their foreheads , and fat , old
cat-lap-dogs used to try to purr . 

At the second sneeze , all the elderly gentlemen over seventy changed
into elm trees , a proceeding that caused a terrible lot of trouble . 

At the third sneeze , all the people in the pictures at the Art Museum
became alive , and for a week the soldiers of the royal guard spent most
of their time rescuing poor , bewildered fauns , satyrs , nymphs , Roman
senators , and long dead celebrities and historical personages from the
worst destitution . The King finally had to build a special castle for
them . 

As the Prince ' s twenty-first birthday drew near , he began to feel very
sad at the idea of having to stay shut up in the tower all his life . 
Though he was a very brave and very manly young man , he lay down on his
couch and wept in sorrow . 

Suddenly , standing with his forepaws on the coverlet ,  " Why do you weep , 
dear master ? " said the little dog . 

 " At my fate , " replied the poor Prince .  " I cannot bear to think that I
may have to spend all my days in this tower , and never see the great
wide world . " 

The poodle was silent for a few minutes . At length he said ,  " Dear Prince
Rolandor , do not give up hope . Have you ever thought of consulting my
old master , the Giant of the North Pole ? He has a large chest in his
palace full of secrets which the winds have overheard , and perhaps the
key to Malvolia ' s spell is among them . If you will have a warm fur coat
and four fur boots made for me , I will go to the Giant and ask him . " 

The Prince gave his consent , and on the next day the royal tailor made
the poodle a magnificent sealskin coat and four splendid fur-lined
boots . Then the King wished him good speed , the Queen cried over him , 
and the Prince , who could see from his high tower every corner of the
kingdom , watched him till he disappeared over the hills and far away . 

Straight north the poodle ran . Soon he had left the fertile plains
behind him , and entered great , black pine forests where never a road was
to be seen . The cold wind howled through the trees , and at night the
brilliant stars sparkled over the dark and waving branches . Hungry
wolves and savage bears often pursued him , but somehow he always managed
to escape them all . At the end of the forest he found the frozen ocean
lit by the shuddering light of the aurora , flashing in a great fan from
east to west . Past white-tusked walruses and sleepy penguins he flew , 
till on the eleventh day he saw the green , icy pinnacles of the Giant ' s
palace against the waving curtain of the Polar lights . On the evening of
the twelfth day he entered the castle . 

The Giant of the North Pole was a tall , strong , yellow-haired fellow
wearing a crown of ice and a great sweeping mantle made from the white
fur of the polar bear . His servants were the Gusts , --strange , supple , 
shadowy creatures moving quickly to and fro , --and his courtiers were
the whirlwinds and the storms . The Giant ' s wife sat by his side; she had
dark hair and eyes of icy , burning blue . 

 " Welcome , little Poldo , " said the Giant; and his voice sounded like the
wind in the treetops;  " what seek you here ? " 

 " I seek some words of the Fairy Malvolia which were carried away by the
northeast wind at Prince Rolandor ' s christening , " replied the poodle . 

 " Whew , oo-oo , " whistled the Giant of the North Pole .  " If I have them , 
the words are yours . " 

He summoned two Gusts to bring forth the chest of secrets . It was made
of black stone; and edged with diamonds of ice . In it were stored all
the mysteries which the wind had ever overheard; there were secrets , 
confessions , vows , merry laughs , and simple words . And sure enough , in
the corner of the chest lay the rest of Malvolia ' s spell--a row of
little , old-fashioned , dusty words; the words :  " Until he finds someone
brave enough to marry him . " 

So the good poodle learned the words by heart , thanked the Giant , and
hurried home with the message . When he came to the King ' s palace , he
ran , barking with joy , right into the King ' s own room . There he saw the
unhappy parents . 

 " Have you found the last of the sentence ? " cried the Queen . 

 " Yes , " said Poldo .  " The spell will end when the prince marries . " 

That very evening the King and the Queen sent forth ambassadors to ask
for the hand of the loveliest princess of all Fairyland , Princess Adatha
of the Adamant Mountains . But so afraid was Adatha of being turned into
something else , that she refused the offer . 

The King and the Queen then made a request for the hand of Princess
Alicia of the Crystal Lakes . But Alicia also was afraid of being turned
into something else , and she too refused the alliance . So did the
Princess of the Golden Coasts , the Princess of the Seven Cities , and
many others . Finally the only princess left in all Fairyland was a
princess who herself lay under an enchantment . A jealous witch had
turned her golden hair bright blue , and given her a nose a foot long . 
This unhappy maiden was the only princess willing to accept poor
Rolandor . 

The wedding day arrived . The Prince , though perhaps a little pale from
his confined life , looked very handsome , and led his ugly bride to the
altar like a man . Just exactly as the marriage ceremony was half over , a
spasm contorted the muscles of the Prince ' s face; the poor young man
felt strongly inclined to sneeze . Though he could be seen making heroic
efforts to control the impulse , the audience got very nervous and
panicky . 

All was in vain ! The Prince sneezed ,  " Ker choo ! " A terrific clap of
thunder rent the air , and everybody looked about to see what had
happened . 

The effect of the sneeze was an odd one . As it had occurred exactly at
the moment when the Prince was half-married , the spell had reacted upon
itself .  " Just like a kick from a gun , " Dr . Pill said next day . 

The cats became dogs again , and the dogs became cats; the elm trees
became cross , elderly gentlemen looking for their families; the poor , 
excited Roman senators , fauns , nymphs , satyrs , celebrities and
historical personages , went back to their pictures; and to cap the
climax , the ugly bride became once more her sweet and lovely self . 

While everybody was cheering , who should walk out of the sacristy but
the Court Astrologer ! An instant later , he had fallen into the
affectionate arms of the faithful wife who had wound him up for
twenty-one years . 

After the wedding reception , the Prince and his bride went on a
honeymoon to the Enchanted Islands . As for Poldo the poodle , he was
created Prime Minister and lived to a fine old age .
