In the days of King Arthur , Merlin , the most learned enchanter of his
time , was on a journey; and , being very weary , stopped one day at the
cottage of an honest ploughman to ask for refreshment . The ploughman ' s
wife , with great civility , immediately brought him some milk in a wooden
bowl , and some brown bread on a wooden platter . Merlin could not help
observing , that , although every thing within the cottage was
particularly neat and clean , and in good order , the ploughman and his
wife had the most sorrowful air imaginable . So he questioned them on the
cause of their melancholy , and learned that they were very miserable
because they had no children . The poor woman declared , with tears in her
eyes , that she should be the happiest creature in the world if she had a
son , although he were no bigger than his father ' s thumb . Merlin was much
amused with the thoughts of a boy no bigger than a man ' s thumb , and , as
soon as he returned home , he sent for the queen of the fairies  ( with
whom he was very intimate ) , and related to her the desire of the
ploughman and his wife to have a son the size of his father ' s thumb . The
queen of the fairies liked the plan exceedingly , and declared their wish
should speedily be granted . Accordingly the ploughman ' s wife had a son , 
who in a few minutes grew as tall as his father ' s thumb . The queen of
the fairies came in at the window as the mother was sitting up in bed
admiring the child . The queen kissed the infant , and giving it the name
of Tom Thumb , immediately summoned several fairies from Fairy Land to
clothe her little new favourite : 

  " An oak leaf hat he had for his crown , 
 His shirt it was by spiders spun;
 With doublet wove of thistle ' s down , 
 His trousers up with points were done . 
 His stockings , of apple rind , they tie
 With eye-lash plucked from his mother ' s eye , 
 His shoes were made of a mouse ' s skin , 
 Nicely tanned , with the hair within . " 

Tom never was any bigger than his father ' s thumb , which was not a large
thumb either; but , as he grew older , he became very cunning and sly , for
which his mother did not sufficiently correct him , so that when he was
able to play with the boys for cherry stones , and had lost all his own , 
he used to creep into the boys ' bags , fill his pockets , and come out
again to play . But one day as he was getting out of a bag of cherry
stones , the boy to whom it belonged chanced to see him .  " Ah ha , my
little Tom Thumb ! " said the boy ,  " have I caught you at your bad tricks
at last ? Now I will reward you for thieving . " Then drawing the string
tight round his neck , and shaking the bag heartily , the cherry stones
bruised Tom ' s legs , thighs , and body sadly; which made him beg to be let
out , and promise never to be guilty of such things any more . Shortly
afterwards , Tom ' s mother was making a batter pudding , and , that he might
see how she mixed it , he climbed on the edge of the bowl; but his foot
happening to slip , he fell over head and ears into the batter , and his
mother not observing him , stirred him into the pudding , and popped him
into the pot to boil . The hot water made Tom kick and struggle; and his
mother , seeing the pudding jump up and down in such a furious manner , 
thought it was bewitched; and a tinker coming by just at the time , she
quickly gave him the pudding , who put it into his budget and walked on . 

As soon as Tom could get the batter out of his mouth , he began to cry
aloud; which so frightened the poor tinker , that he flung the pudding
over the hedge , and ran away from it as fast as he could run . The
pudding being broken to pieces by the fall , Tom was released , and walked
home to his mother , who gave him a kiss and put him to bed . Tom Thumb ' s
mother once took him with her when she went to milk the cow; and it
being a very windy day , she tied him with a needleful of thread to a
thistle , that he might not be blown away . The cow liking his oak leaf
hat took him and the thistle up at one mouthful . While the cow chewed
the thistle , Tom , terrified at her great teeth , which seemed ready to
crush him to pieces , roared ,  " Mother , Mother ! " as loud as he could bawl . 
 " Where are you , Tommy , my dear Tommy ? " said the mother .  " Here , mother , 
here in the red cow ' s mouth . " The mother began to cry and wring her
hands; but the cow surprised at such odd noises in her throat , opened
her mouth and let him drop out . His mother clapped him into her apron , 
and ran home with him . Tom ' s father made him a whip of a barley straw to
drive the cattle with , and being one day in the field , he slipped into a
deep furrow . A raven flying over , picked him up with a grain of corn , 
and flew with him to the top of a giant ' s castle , by the seaside , where
he left him; and old Grumbo the giant , coming soon after to walk upon
his terrace , swallowed Tom like a pill , clothes and all . Tom presently
made the giant very uncomfortable , and he threw him up into the sea . A
great fish then swallowed him . The fish was soon after caught , and sent
as a present to King Arthur . When it was cut open , every body was
delighted with little Tom Thumb . The king made him his dwarf; he was the
favourite of the whole court; and , by his merry pranks , often amused the
queen and the knights of the Round Table . The king , when he rode on
horseback , frequently took Tom in his hand; and , if a shower of rain
came on , he used to creep into the king ' s waist-coat pocket , and sleep
till the rain was over . The king also , sometimes questioned Tom
concerning his parents; and when Tom informed his majesty they were very
poor people , the king led him into his treasury , and told him he should
pay his friends a visit , and take with him as much money as he could
carry . Tom procured a little purse , and putting a threepenny piece into
it , with much labour and difficulty got it upon his back; and , after
travelling two days and nights , arrived at his father ' s house . 

His mother met him at the door , almost tired to death , having in
forty-eight hours travelled almost half a mile with a huge silver
threepence upon his back . His parents were glad to see him , especially
when he had brought such an amazing sum of money with him . They placed
him in a walnut shell by the fire side , and feasted him for three days
upon a hazel nut , which made him sick , for a whole nut usually served
him a month . Tom got well , but could not travel because it had rained;
therefore his mother took him in her hand , and with one puff blew him
into King Arthur ' s court; where Tom entertained the king , queen , and
nobility at tilts and tournaments , at which he exerted himself so much
that he brought on a fit of sickness , and his life was despaired of . At
this juncture the queen of the fairies came in a chariot drawn by flying
mice , placed Tom by her side , and drove through the air , without
stopping till they arrived at her palace; when , after restoring him to
health , and permitting him to enjoy all the gay diversions of Fairy
Land , the queen commanded a fair wind , and , placing Tom before it , blew
him straight to the court of King Arthur . But just as Tom should have
alighted in the court-yard of the palace , the cook happened to pass along
with the king ' s great bowl of firmity  ( King Arthur loved firmity ) , and
poor Tom Thumb fell plump into the middle of it and splashed the hot
firmity into the cook ' s eyes . Down went the bowl .  " Oh dear; oh dear ! " 
cried Tom;  " Murder ! murder ! " bellowed the cook ! and away ran the king ' s
nice firmity into the kennel . The cook was a red-faced , cross fellow , 
and swore to the king , that Tom had done it out of mere mischief; so he
was taken up , tried , and sentenced to be beheaded . Tom hearing this
dreadful sentence , and seeing a miller stand by with his mouth wide
open , he took a good spring , and jumped down the miller ' s throat , 
unperceived by all , even by the miller himself . 

Tom being lost , the court broke up , and away went the miller to his
mill . But Tom did not leave him long at rest , he began to roll and
tumble about , so that the miller thought himself bewitched , and sent for
a doctor . When the doctor came , Tom began to dance and sing; the doctor
was as much frightened as the miller , and sent in great haste for five
more doctors , and twenty learned men . While all these were debating upon
the affair , the miller  ( for they were very tedious ) happened to yawn , 
and Tom , taking the opportunity , made another jump , and alighted on his
feet in the middle of the table . The miller , provoked to be thus
tormented by such a little creature , fell into a great passion , caught
hold of Tom , and threw him out of the window , into the river . A large
salmon swimming by , snapped him up in a minute . The salmon was soon
caught and sold in the market to the steward of a lord . The lord , 
thinking it an uncommon fine fish , made a present of it to the king , who
ordered it to be dressed immediately . When the cook cut open the salmon , 
he found poor Tom , and ran with him directly to the king; but the king
being busy with state affairs , desired that he might be brought another
day . The cook resolving to keep him safely this time , as he had so
lately given him the slip , clapped him into a mouse-trap , and left him
to amuse himself by peeping through the wires for a whole week; when the
king sent for him , he forgave him for throwing down the firmity , ordered
him new clothes and knighted him . 

  " His shirt was made of butterflies ' wings;
 His boots were made of chicken skins;
 His coat and breeches were made with pride;
 A tailor ' s needle hung by his side;
 A mouse for a horse he used to ride . " 

Thus dressed and mounted , he rode a hunting with the king and nobility , 
who all laughed heartily at Tom and his fine prancing steed . As they
rode by a farm house one day , a cat jumped from behind the door , seized
the mouse and little Tom , and began to devour the mouse . However , Tom
boldly drew his sword and attacked the cat , who then let him fall . The
king and his nobles seeing Tom falling , went to his assistance , and one
of the lords caught him in his hat; but poor Tom was sadly scratched , 
and his clothes were torn by the claws of the cat . In this condition he
was carried home , when a bed of down was made for him in a little ivory
cabinet . The queen of the fairies came , and took him again to Fairy
Land , where she kept him for some years; and then , dressing him in
bright green , sent him flying once more through the air to the earth , in
the days of King Thunstone . The people flocked far and near to look at
him; and the king , before whom he was carried , asked him who he was , 
whence he came , and where he lived ? Tom answered : 

  " My name is Tom Thumb , 
 From the Fairies I come;
 When King Arthur shone , 
 This court was my home . 
 In me he delighted , 
 By him I was knighted , 
 Did you never hear of
 Sir Thomas Thumb ? " 

The king was so charmed with this address , that he ordered a little
chair to be made , in order that Tom might sit on his table , and also a
palace of gold a span high , with a door an inch wide , for little Tom to
live in . He also gave him a coach drawn by six small mice . This made the
queen angry , because she had not a new coach too . Therefore , resolving
to ruin Tom , she complained to the king that he had behaved very
insolently to her . The king sent for him in a rage . Tom , to escape his
fury , crept into an empty snail-shell , and there lay till he was almost
starved; when peeping out of the shell , he saw a fine butterfly settled
on the ground . He now ventured out , and getting astride , the butterfly
took wing , and mounted into the air with little Tom on his back . Away he
flew from field to field , from tree to tree , till at last he flew to the
king ' s court . The king , queen , and nobles , all strove to catch the
butterfly , but could not . At length poor Tom , having neither bridle nor
saddle , slipped from his seat , and fell into a white pot , where he was
found almost drowned . The queen vowed he should be guillotined : but
while the guillotine was getting ready , he was secured once more in a
mouse-trap; when the cat seeing something stir , and supposing it to be
the mouse , patted the trap about till she broke it , and set Tom at
liberty . Soon afterwards a spider , taking him for a fly , made at him . 
Tom drew his sword and fought valiantly , but the spider ' s poisonous
breath overcame him : 

  " He fell dead on the ground where late he had stood , 
 And the spider sucked up the last drop of his blood . " 

King Thunstone and his whole court went into mourning for little Tom
Thumb . They buried him under a rosebush , and raised a nice white marble
monument over his grave , with the following epitaph : 

  " Here lies Tom Thumb , King Arthur ' s knight , 
 Who died by spider ' s cruel bite . 
 He was well known in Arthur ' s court , 
 Where he afforded gallant sport;
 He rode at tilt and tournament , 
 And on a mouse a hunting went;
 Alive he filled the court with mirth , 
 His death to sorrow soon gave birth . 
 Wipe , wipe your eyes , and shake your head
 And cry ,  ' Alas ! Tom Thumb is dead . ' "
