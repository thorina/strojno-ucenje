O	.
O	And
C	Naoise
O	and

O	,

C	Conor
O	called
O	to

O	Buinne
O	,

O	brother
O	,
C	Illann
O	the
O	Fair
O	,
O	filled
O	with
O	shame
O	,
O	did
O	what
O	he
O	could
O	to
O	make
O	amends
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	forth
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	hundreds
O	of
O	the
O	besieging
O	army
O	fell
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	ere
O	death
O	stayed
O	his
O	loyal
O	hand
O	.
O	At
O	his
O	death
O	the
O	Ultonians
O	again
O	fired
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	first
C	Ardan
O	and
O	then
C	Ainle
O	left
O	their
O	chess
O	for
O	a
O	fiercer
O	game
O	,
O	and
O	glutted
O	their
O	sword
O	blades
O	with
O	the
O	blood
O	of
O	their
O	enemies
O	.
O	Last
O	came
O	the
O	turn
O	of
C	Naoise
O	.
O	He
O	kissed
C	Deirdrê
O	,
O	and
O	drank
O	a
O	drink
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	against
O	the
O	men
O	of
C	Conor
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	his
O	brothers
O	had
O	slain
O	hundreds
O	,
O	a
O	thousand
O	fell
O	before
O	his
O	sword
O	.
O	Then
O	fear
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	heart
O	of
C	Conor
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	foresaw
O	that
O	against
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	no
O	man
O	could
O	prevail
O	,
O	save
O	by
O	magic
O	.
O	Thus
O	he
O	sent
O	for
C	Cathbad
O	the
O	Druid
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	even
O	then
O	very
O	near
O	death
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	was
O	carried
O	on
O	a
O	litter
O	to
O	the
O	House
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Branch
O	,
O	from
O	which
O	the
O	flames
O	were
O	leaping
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	which
O	the
O	dead
O	lay
O	in
O	heaps
O	.
O	And
C	Conor
O	besought
O	him
O	to
O	help
O	him
O	to
O	subdue
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	ere
O	they
O	should
O	have
O	slain
O	every
O	Ultonian
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	So
O	by
O	his
O	magic
C	Cathbad
O	raised
O	a
O	hedge
O	of
O	spears
O	round
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	But
C	Naoise
O	,
C	Ardan
O	,
O	and
C	Ainle
O	,
O	with
C	Deirdrê
O	in
O	their
O	centre
O	,
O	sheltered
O	by
O	their
O	shields
O	,
O	burst
O	suddenly
O	forth
O	from
O	the
O	blazing
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	a
O	way
O	for
O	themselves
O	through
O	the
O	hedge
O	as
O	though
O	they
O	sheared
O	green
O	wheat
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	laughing
O	aloud
O	,
O	they
O	took
O	a
O	terrible
O	toll
O	of
O	lives
O	from
O	the
O	Ultonians
O	who
O	would
O	have
O	withstood
O	them
O	.
O	Then
O	again
O	the
O	Druid
O	put
O	forth
O	his
O	power
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	noise
O	like
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	many
O	waters
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	ears
O	of
O	all
O	who
O	were
O	there
O	.
O	So
O	suddenly
O	the
O	magic
O	flood
O	arose
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	chance
O	of
O	escape
O	for
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	.
O	Higher
O	it
O	mounted
O	,
O	ever
O	higher
O	,
O	and
C	Naoise
O	held
C	Deirdrê
O	on
O	his
O	shoulder
O	,
O	and
O	smiled
O	up
O	in
O	her
O	eyes
O	as
O	the
O	water
O	rose
O	past
O	his
O	middle
O	.
O	Then
O	suddenly
O	as
O	it
O	had
O	come
O	,
O	the
O	flood
O	abated
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	was
O	well
O	with
O	the
O	Ultonians
O	who
O	had
O	sheltered
O	on
O	a
O	rising
O	ground
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	found
O	themselves
O	entrapped
O	in
O	a

C	Conor
