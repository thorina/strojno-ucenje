O	as
O	command
O	all
O	the
O	sea-roads
O	in
O	its
O	vicinity
O	.
O	He
O	guessed
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	delay
O	of
O	the
O	French
O	in
O	opening
O	fire
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	waiting
O	for
O	their
O	siege-train
O	to
O	arrive
O	by
O	sea
O	.
O	He
O	kept
O	vigilant
O	watch
O	,
O	pounced
O	on
O	the
O	French
O	flotilla
O	as
O	it
O	rounded
O	the
O	promontory
O	of
O	Mount
O	Carmel
O	,
O	captured
O	nine
O	of
O	the
O	vessels
O	,
O	carried
O	them
O	with
O	their
O	guns
O	and
O	warlike
O	material
O	to
O	Acre
O	,
O	and
O	mounted
O	his
O	thirty-four
O	captured
O	pieces
O	on
O	the
O	batteries
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	Thus
O	the
O	disgusted
O	French
O	saw
O	the
O	very
O	guns
O	which
O	were
O	intended
O	to
O	batter
O	down
O	the
O	defences
O	of
O	Acre--and
O	which
O	were
O	glorious
O	with
O	the
O	memories
O	of
O	a
O	dozen
O	victories
O	in
O	Italy--frowning
O	at
O	them
O	,
O	loaded
O	with
O	English
O	powder
O	and
O	shot
O	,
O	and
O	manned
O	by
O	English
O	sailors
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	needless
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	a
O	siege
O	directed
O	by
O	Napoleon--the
O	siege
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	looked
O	upon
O	as
O	a
O	contemptible
O	and
O	almost
O	defenceless
O	town
O	,
O	the
O	single
O	barrier
O	betwixt
O	his
O	ambition
O	and
O	its
O	goal--was
O	urged
O	with
O	amazing
O	fire
O	and
O	vehemence
O	.
O	The
O	wall
O	was
O	battered
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	,
O	a
O	breach
O	fifty
O	feet
O	wide
O	made
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	than
O	twelve
O	assaults
O	delivered
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	daring
O	of
O	which
O	French
O	soldiers
O	,
O	gallantly
O	led
O	,
O	are
O	capable
O	.
O	So
O	sustained
O	was
O	the
O	fighting
O	,
O	that
O	on
O	one
O	occasion
O	the
O	combat
O	raged
O	in
O	the
O	ditch
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	breach
O	for
O	_twenty-five_
O	successive
O	hours
O	.
O	So
O	close
O	and
O	fierce
O	was
O	it
O	that
O	one
O	half-ruined
O	tower
O	was
O	held
O	by
O	_both_
O	besiegers
O	and
O	besieged
O	for
O	twelve
O	hours
O	in
O	succession
O	,
O	and
O	neither
O	would
O	yield
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	breach
O	,
O	again
O	,
O	the
O	two
O	lines
O	of
O	desperately
O	fighting
O	men
O	on
O	repeated
O	occasions
O	clashed
O	bayonets
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	wrestled
O	and
O	stabbed
O	and
O	died
O	,
O	till
O	the
O	survivors
O	were
O	parted
O	by
O	the
O	barrier
O	of
O	the
O	dead

O	grew
O	beneath
O	their
O	feet
O	.
O	Sidney

O	like
