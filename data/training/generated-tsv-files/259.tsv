O	s
O	head
O	,
O	twilight
O	began
O	to
O	approach
O	.
O	He
O	washed
O	himself
O	nicely
O	,
O	took
O	the
O	falcon
O	on
O	his
O	shoulder
O	,
O	the
O	hounds
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bagpipes
O	under
O	his
O	arm
O	,
O	played
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	,
O	drove
O	the
O	sheep
O	,
O	and
O	proceeded
O	to
O	the
O	emperor
O	'
O	s
O	palace
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	damsel
O	at
O	his
O	side
O	still
O	in
O	terror
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	town
O	assembled
O	as
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	wonder
O	.
O	The
O	emperor
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	seen
O	all
O	his
O	heroism
O	from
O	the
O	hill
O	,
O	called
O	him
O	into
O	his
O	presence
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	his
O	daughter
O	,
O	went
O	immediately
O	to
O	church
O	,
O	had
O	them
O	married
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	a
O	wedding
O	festival
O	for
O	a
O	week
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	the
O	prince
O	told
O	him
O	who
O	and
O	whence
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	emperor
O	and
O	the
O	whole
O	town
O	rejoiced
O	still
O	more
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	prince
O	was
O	urgent
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	home
O	,
O	the
O	emperor
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	large
O	escort
O	,
O	and
O	equipped
O	him
O	for
O	the
O	journey
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	of
O	the
O	water-mill
O	,
O	the
O	prince
O	halted
O	his
O	attendants
O	,
O	went
O	inside
O	,
O	cut
O	up
O	the
O	three
O	wands
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	the
O	root
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	iron
O	door
O	opened
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	vault
O	was
O	a
O	vast
O	multitude
O	of
O	people
O	.
O	The
O	prince
O	ordered
O	them
O	to
O	come
O	out
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	go
O	whither
O	each
O	would
O	,
O	and
O	stood
O	himself
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	They
O	came
O	out
O	thus
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	lo
O	!
O	there
O	were
O	his
O	brothers
O	also
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	embraced
O	and
O	kissed
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	whole
O	multitude
O	had
O	come
O	out
O	,
O	they
O	thanked
O	him
O	for
O	releasing
O	and
O	delivering
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	each
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	home
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	with
O	his
O	brothers
O	and
O	bride
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	lived
O	and
O	reigned
O	to
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	his
O	days
O	.
