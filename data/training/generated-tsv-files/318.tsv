O	One
O	afternoon
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	going
O	down
O	,
O	a
O	mother
O	and
O	her
O	little
O	boy
O	sat
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	their
O	cottage
O	,
O	talking
O	about
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	but
O	to
O	lift
O	their
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	it
O	was
O	plainly
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	,
O	though
O	miles
O	away
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	sunshine
O	brightening
O	all
O	its
O	features
O	.
O	And
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	?
O	Embosomed
O	among
O	a
O	family
O	of
O	lofty
O	mountains
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	valley
O	so
O	spacious
O	that
O	it
O	contained
O	many
O	thousand
O	inhabitants
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	these
O	good
O	people
O	dwelt
O	in
O	log
O	huts
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	black
O	forest
O	all
O	around
O	them
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	steep
O	and
O	difficult
O	hillsides
O	.
O	Others
O	had
O	their
O	homes
O	in
O	comfortable
O	farmhouses
O	,
O	and
O	cultivated
O	the
O	rich
O	soil
O	on
O	the
O	gentle
O	slopes
O	or
O	level
O	surfaces
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	.
O	Others
O	,
O	again
O	,
O	were
O	congregated
O	into
O	populous
O	villages
O	,
O	where
O	some
O	wild
O	,
O	highland
O	rivulet
O	,
O	tumbling
O	down
O	from
O	its
O	birthplace
O	in
O	the
O	upper
O	mountain
O	region
O	,
O	had
O	been
O	caught
O	and
O	tamed
O	by
O	human
O	cunning
O	,
O	and
O	compelled
O	to
O	turn
O	the
O	machinery
O	of
O	cotton
O	factories
O	.
O	The
O	inhabitants
O	of
O	this
O	valley
O	,
O	in
O	short
O	,
O	were
O	numerous
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	many
O	modes
O	of
O	life
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	grown
O	people
O	and
O	children
O	,
O	had
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	familiarity
O	with
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	,
O	although
O	some
O	possessed
O	the
O	gift
O	of
O	distinguishing
O	this
O	grand
O	natural
O	phenomenon
O	more
O	perfectly
O	than
O	many
O	of
O	their
O	neighbors
O	.
O	The
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	work
O	of
O	Nature
O	in
O	her
O	mood
O	of
O	majestic
O	playfulness
O	,
O	formed
O	on
O	the
O	perpendicular
O	side
O	of
O	a
O	mountain
O	by
O	some
O	immense
O	rocks
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	thrown
O	together
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	position
O	as
O	,
O	when
O	viewed
O	at
O	a
O	proper
O	distance
O	,
O	precisely
O	to
O	resemble
O	the
O	features
O	of
O	the
O	human
O	countenance
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	an
O	enormous
O	giant
O	,
O	or
O	a
O	Titan
O	,
O	had
O	sculptured
O	his
O	own
O	likeness
O	on
O	the
O	precipice
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	the
O	broad
O	arch
O	of
O	the
O	forehead
O	,
O	a
O	hundred
O	feet
O	in
O	height;
O	the
O	nose
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	long
O	bridge;
O	and
O	the
O	vast
O	lips
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	could
O	have
O	spoken
O	,
O	would
O	have
O	rolled
O	their
O	thunder
O	accents
O	from
O	one
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	True
O	it
O	is
O	,
O	that
O	if
O	the
O	spectator
O	approached
O	too
O	near
O	,
O	he
O	lost
O	the
O	outline
O	of
O	the
O	gigantic
O	visage
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	discern
O	only
O	a
O	heap
O	of
O	ponderous
O	and
O	gigantic
O	rocks
O	,
O	piled
O	in
O	chaotic
O	ruin
O	one
O	upon
O	another
O	.
O	Retracing
O	his
O	steps
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	wondrous
O	features
O	would
O	again
O	be
O	seen;
O	and
O	the
O	further
O	he
O	withdrew
O	from
O	them
O	,
O	the
O	more
O	like
O	a
O	human
O	face
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	its
O	original
O	divinity
O	intact
O	,
O	did
O	they
O	appear;
O	until
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	grew
O	dim
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	clouds
O	and
O	glorified
O	vapor
O	of
O	the
O	mountains
O	clustering
O	about
O	it
O	,
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	seemed
O	positively
O	to
O	be
O	alive
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	happy
O	lot
O	for
O	children
O	to
O	grow
O	up
O	to
O	manhood
O	or
O	womanhood
O	with
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	before
O	their
O	eyes
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	features
O	were
O	noble
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	expression
O	was
O	at
O	once
O	grand
O	and
O	sweet
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	the
O	glow
O	of
O	a
O	vast
O	,
O	warm
O	heart
O	,
O	that
O	embraced
O	all
O	mankind
O	in
O	its
O	affections
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	room
O	for
O	more
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	an
O	education
O	only
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	it
O	.
O	According
O	to
O	the
O	belief
O	of
O	many
O	people
O	,
O	the
O	valley
O	owed
O	much
O	of
O	its
O	fertility
O	to
O	this
O	benign
O	aspect

O	was
O	continually
O	beaming
O	over
O	it
O	,
O	illuminating
O	the
O	clouds

O	its

O	into
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	endowed
O	by

O	with
O	that

O	,
O	that
O	whatever
O	he

O	with

O	finger
O	immediately
O	glistened
O	,
O	and
O	grew
O	yellow
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	changed
O	at
O	once
O	into
O	sterling
O	metal
O	,

O	which
O	suited

O	so

O	rich
O	that

O	a

O	years
O	only
O	to
O	count
O	his

O	,
O	he
O	bethought

O	of

O	native
O	valley
O	,
O	and
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	back
O	thither
O	,
O	and
O	end
O	his

O	he
O	was
O	born
O	.
O	With
O	this
O	purpose
O	in
O	view
O	,
O	he
O	sent
O	a
O	skilful
O	architect
O	to
O	build
O	him
O	such
O	a
O	palace
O	as
O	should

O	fit
O	for
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	his
O	vast
O	wealth
O	to
O	live
O	in
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	have
O	said
O	above

O	it
O	had
O	already
O	been
O	rumored
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	that
O	Mr

O	Gathergold
O	had
O	turned
O	out
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	prophetic
O	personage
O	so
O	long
O	and
O	vainly
O	looked
O	for
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	his
O	visage
O	was
O	the
O	perfect
O	and
O	undeniable
O	similitude
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	.
O	People
O	were
O	the
O	more
O	ready
O	to
O	believe
O	that
O	this
O	must
O	needs
O	be
O	the
O	fact
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	beheld
O	the
O	splendid
O	edifice
O	that
O	rose
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	by

O	site
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	old
O	weather-beaten
O	farmhouse
O	.
O	The

O	was
O	of

O	so
O	dazzlingly
O	white
O	that
O	it

O	,

O	been

O	.
O	It
O	had
O	a
O	richly
O	ornamented
O	portico
O	,
O	supported
O	by
O	tall
O	pillars
O	,
O	beneath
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	lofty
O	door
O	,
O	studded
O	with
O	silver
O	knobs
O	,
O	and
O	made

O	a

O	,

O	,
O	respectively
O	,
O	of
O	but
O	one
O	enormous
O	pane
O	of
O	glass
O	,
O	so
O	transparently
O	pure
O	that

O	be
O	a
O	finer
O	medium
O	than
O	even
O	the

O	Hardly
O	anybody
O	had
O	been
O	permitted
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	interior
O	of
O	this
O	palace;
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	reported

O	with
O	good

O	of
O	truth

O	such
O	a
O	glittering
O	appearance
O	that
O	no

O	would
O	have
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	close

O	But
O	,
O	on
O	the

O	,
O	Mr

O	Gathergold
O	was
O	now

O	,
O	that
O	perhaps
O	he
O	could
O	not

O	closed
O	his
O	eyes
O	unless
O	where
O	the

O	In

O	""""
O	The
O	years
O	went
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	Ernest
O	ceased
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	boy
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	grown
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	young
O	man
O	now
O	.
O	He
O	attracted
O	little
O	notice
O	from
O	the
O	other
O	inhabitants
O	of
O	the
O	valley;
O	for
O	they
O	saw
O	nothing
O	remarkable
O	in
O	his
O	way
O	of
O	life
O	,
O	save
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	labor
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	was
O	over
O	,
O	he
O	still
O	loved
O	to
O	go
O	apart
O	and
O	gaze
O	and
O	meditate
O	upon
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	.
O	According
O	to
O	their
O	idea
O	of
O	the
O	matter
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	folly
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	but
O	pardonable
O	,
O	inasmuch
O	as
O	Ernest
O	was
O	industrious
O	,
O	kind
O	,
O	and
O	neighborly
O	,
O	and
O	neglected
O	no
O	duty
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	indulging
O	this
O	idle
O	habit
O	.
O	They
O	knew
O	not
O	that
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	had
O	become
O	a
O	teacher
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	sentiment
O	which
O	was
O	expressed
O	in
O	it
O	would
O	enlarge
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	fill
O	it
O	with
O	wider
O	and
O	deeper
O	sympathies
O	than
O	other
O	hearts
O	.
O	They
O	knew
O	not
O	that
O	thence
O	would
O	come
O	a
O	better
O	wisdom
O	than
O	could
O	be
O	learned
O	from
O	books
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	better
O	life
O	than
O	could
O	be
O	molded
O	on
O	the
O	defaced
O	example
O	of
O	other
O	human
O	lives
O	.
O	Neither
O	did
O	Ernest
O	know
O	that
O	the
O	thoughts
O	and
O	affections
O	which
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	so
O	naturally
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	fields
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	fireside
O	,
O	and
O	wherever
O	he
O	communed
O	with
O	himself
O	,
O	were
O	of
O	a
O	higher
O	tone
O	than
O	those
O	which
O	all
O	men
O	shared
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	A
O	simple
O	soul--simple
O	as
O	when
O	his
O	mother
O	first
O	taught
O	him
O	the
O	old
O	prophecy--he
O	beheld
O	the
O	marvellous
O	features
O	beaming
O	adown
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	and
O	still
O	wondered
O	that
O	their
O	human
O	counterpart
O	was
O	so
O	long
O	in
O	making
O	his
O	appearance
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	poor
O	Mr
O	.
O	Gathergold
O	was
O	dead
O	and
O	buried;
O	and
O	the
O	oddest
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	matter
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	his
O	wealth
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	body
O	and
O	spirit
O	of
O	his
O	existence
O	,
O	had
O	disappeared
O	before
O	his
O	death
O	,
O	leaving
O	nothing
O	of
O	him
O	but
O	a
O	living
O	skeleton
O	,
O	covered
O	over
O	with
O	a
O	wrinkled
O	,
O	yellow
O	skin
O	.
O	Since
O	the
O	melting
O	away
O	of
O	his
O	gold
O	,
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	very
O	generally
O	conceded
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	such
O	striking
O	resemblance
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	,
O	between
O	the
O	ignoble
O	features
O	of
O	the
O	ruined
O	merchant
O	and
O	that
O	majestic
O	face
O	upon
O	the
O	mountain-side
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	people
O	ceased
O	to
O	honor
O	him
O	during
O	his
O	lifetime
O	,
O	and
O	quietly
O	consigned
O	him
O	to
O	forgetfulness
O	after
O	his
O	decease
O	.
O	Once
O	in
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	true
O	,
O	his
O	memory
O	was
O	brought
O	up
O	in
O	connection
O	with
O	the
O	magnificent
O	palace
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	built
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	had
O	long
O	ago
O	been
O	turned
O	into
O	a
O	hotel
O	for
O	the
O	accommodation
O	of
O	strangers
O	,
O	multitudes
O	of
O	whom
O	came
O	,
O	every
O	summer
O	,
O	to
O	visit
O	that
O	famous
O	natural
O	curiosity
O	,
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	Gathergold
O	being
O	discredited
O	and
O	thrown
O	into
O	the
O	shade
O	,
O	the
O	man
O	of
O	prophecy
O	was
O	yet
O	to
O	come
O	.
O	It
O	so
O	happened
O	that
O	a
O	native-born
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	many
O	years
O	before
O	,
O	had
O	enlisted
O	as
O	a
O	soldier
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	hard
O	fighting
O	,
O	had
O	now
O	become
O	an
O	illustrious
O	commander
O	.
O	Whatever
O	he
O	may
O	be
O	called
O	in
O	history
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	known
O	in
O	camps
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	battle-field
O	under
O	the
O	nickname
O	of
O	Old
O	Blood-and-Thunder
O	.
O	This
O	war-worn
O	veteran
O	,
O	being
O	now
O	infirm
O	with
O	age
O	and
O	wounds
O	,
O	and
O	weary
O	of
O	the
O	turmoil
O	of
O	a
O	military
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	roll
O	of
O	the
O	drum
O	and
O	the
O	clangor
O	of
O	the
O	trumpet
O	,
O	that
O	had
O	so
O	long
O	been
O	ringing
O	in
O	his
O	ears
O	,
O	had
O	lately
O	signified
O	a
O	purpose
O	of
O	returning
O	to
O	his
O	native
O	valley
O	,
O	hoping
O	to
O	find
O	repose
O	where
O	he
O	remembered
O	to
O	have
O	left
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	inhabitants
O	,
O	his
O	old
O	neighbors
O	and
O	their
O	grown-up
O	children
O	,
O	were
O	resolved
O	to
O	welcome
O	the
O	renowned
O	warrior
O	with
O	a
O	salute
O	of
O	cannon
O	and
O	a
O	public
O	dinner;
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	more
O	enthusiastically
O	,
O	it
O	being
O	affirmed
O	that
O	now
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	the
O	likeness
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	had
O	actually
O	appeared
O	.
O	An
O	aid-de-camp
O	of
O	Old
O	Blood-and-Thunder
O	,
O	travelling
O	through
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	was
O	said
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	struck
O	with
O	the
O	resemblance
O	.
O	Moreover
O	the
O	schoolmates
O	and
O	early
O	acquaintances
O	of
O	the
O	general
O	were
O	ready
O	to
O	testify
O	,
O	on
O	oath
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	their
O	recollection
O	,
O	the
O	aforesaid
O	general
O	had
O	been
O	exceedingly
O	like
O	the
O	majestic
O	image
O	,
O	even
O	when
O	a
O	boy
O	,
O	only
O	that
O	the
O	idea
O	had
O	never
O	occurred
O	to
O	them
O	at
O	that
O	period
O	.
O	Great
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	excitement
O	throughout
O	the
O	valley;
O	and
O	many
O	people
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	never
O	once
O	thought
O	of
O	glancing
O	at
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	for
O	years
O	before
O	,
O	now
O	spent
O	their
O	time
O	in
O	gazing
O	at
O	it
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	knowing
O	exactly
O	how
O	General
O	Blood-and-Thunder
O	looked
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	day
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	festival
O	,
O	Ernest
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	other
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	left
O	their
O	work
O	,
O	and
O	proceeded
O	to
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	the
O	sylvan
O	banquet
O	was
O	prepared
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	approached
O	,
O	the
O	loud
O	voice
O	of
O	the
O	Rev
O	.
O	Dr
O	.
O	Battleblast
O	was
O	heard
O	,
O	beseeching
O	a
O	blessing
O	on
O	the
O	good
O	things
O	set
O	before
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	distinguished
O	friend
O	of
O	peace
O	in
O	whose
O	honor
O	they
O	were
O	assembled
O	.
O	The
O	tables
O	were
O	arranged
O	in
O	a
O	cleared
O	space
O	of
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	shut
O	in
O	by
O	the
O	surrounding
O	trees
O	,
O	except
O	where
O	a
O	vista
O	opened
O	eastward
O	,
O	and
O	afforded
O	a
O	distant
O	view
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	.
O	Over
O	the
O	general
O	'
O	s
O	chair
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	relic
O	from
O	the
O	home
O	of
O	Washington
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	arch
O	of
O	verdant
O	boughs
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	laurel
O	profusely
O	intermixed
O	,
O	and
O	surmounted
O	by
O	his
O	country
O	'
O	s
O	banner
O	,
O	beneath
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	won
O	his
O	victories
O	.
O	Our
O	friend
O	Ernest
O	raised
O	himself
O	on
O	his
O	tip-toes
O	,
O	in
O	hopes
O	to
O	get
O	a
O	glimpse
O	of
O	the
O	celebrated
O	guest;
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	mighty
O	crowd
O	about
O	the
O	tables
O	anxious
O	to
O	hear
O	the
O	toasts
O	and
O	speeches
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	catch
O	any
O	word
O	that
O	might
O	fall
O	from
O	the
O	general
O	in
O	reply;
O	and
O	a
O	volunteer
O	company
O	,
O	doing
O	duty
O	as
O	a
O	guard
O	,
O	pricked
O	ruthlessly
O	with
O	their
O	bayonets
O	at
O	any
O	particularly
O	quiet
O	person
O	among
O	the
O	throng
O	.
O	So
O	Ernest
O	,
O	being
O	of
O	an
O	unobtrusive
O	character
O	,
O	was
O	thrust
O	quite
O	into
O	the
O	background
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	no

O	if

O	still
O	blazing
O	on
O	the

O	himself

O	,
O	like
O	a

O	the

O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	Meantime

O	there
O	were
O	reports
O	and
O	many

O	had
O	appeared
O	upon

O	,

O	,
O	was
O	a

O	,

O	had
O	left

O	in

O	early

O	,
O	and
O	taken
O	up
O	the

O	Instead

O	So
O	wonderfully
O	eloquent
O	was
O	he
O	,
O	that
O	whatever
O	he
O	might
O	choose
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	his

O	mere
O	breath
O	,
O	and
O	obscure

O	.
O	His
O	tongue
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	magic
O	instrument:
O	sometimes
O	it
O	rumbled
O	like

O	thunder;
O	sometimes
O	it
O	warbled
O	like

O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	blast
O	of
O	war--the
O	song
O	of
O	peace;
O	and
O	it
O	seemed

O	have

O	,

O	was
O	no

O	.
O	In
O	good
O	truth
O	,

O	man;
O	and
O	when
O	his
O	tongue
O	had
O	acquired

O	all
O	other

O	success--when
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	heard
O	in

O	,
O	and
O	in

O	princes
O	and

O	had
O	made
O	him
O	known

O	world
O	,
O	even
O	as
O	a
O	voice
O	crying
O	from
O	shore
O	to

O	finally
O	persuaded
O	his
O	countrymen
O	to
O	select

O	Before

O	,
O	as
O	soon
O	as

O	began
O	to
O	grow

O	resemblance
O	between

O	and
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face;
O	and
O	so
O	much
O	were
O	they
O	struck
O	by
O	it
O	,
O	that
O	throughout
O	the
O	country
O	this
O	distinguished
O	gentleman
O	was
O	known
O	by
O	the
O	name
O	of

O	Stony
O	Phiz
O	.

O	phrase
O	was
O	considered
O	as

O	favorable
O	aspect
O	to

O	political
O	prospects;
O	for

O	,

O	was
O	called
O	,
O	set
O	out
O	on
O	a
O	visit
O	to
O	the
O	valley
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	born
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	other
O	object
O	than
O	to
O	shake
O	hands
O	with
O	his
O	fellow-citizens
O	,
O	and
O	neither
O	thought
O	nor
O	cared
O	about
O	any
O	effect
O	which
O	his
O	progress
O	through
O	the
O	country
O	might
O	have
O	upon
O	the
O	election
O	.
O	Magnificent
O	preparations
O	were
O	made
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	illustrious
O	statesman;
O	a
O	cavalcade
O	of
O	horsemen
O	set
O	forth
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	at
O	the
O	boundary
O	line
O	of
O	the
O	State
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	left
O	their
O	business
O	and
O	gathered
O	along
O	the
O	wayside
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	pass
O	.
O	Among
O	these
O	was
O	Ernest
O	.
O	Though
O	more
O	than
O	once
O	disappointed
O	,
O	as
O	we
O	have
O	seen
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	such
O	a
O	hopeful
O	and
O	confiding
O	nature
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	always
O	ready
O	to
O	believe
O	in
O	whatever
O	seemed
O	beautiful
O	and
O	good
O	.
O	He
O	kept
O	his
O	heart
O	continually
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	was
O	sure
O	to
O	catch
O	the
O	blessing
O	from
O	on
O	high
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	should
O	come
O	.
O	So
O	now
O	again
O	,
O	as
O	buoyantly
O	as

O	that

O	,
O	or
O	soaring
O	to
O	its
O	summit
O	,
O	than
O	had
O	before
O	been
O	seen
O	there
O	.
O	If
O	his
O	theme
O	were
O	a
O	lovely
O	lake
O	,
O	a
O	celestial
O	smile
O	had
O	now
O	been
O	thrown
O	over
O	it
O	,
O	to
O	gleam
O	forever
O	on
O	its
O	surface
O	.
O	If
O	it
O	were
O	the
O	vast
O	old
O	sea
O	,
O	even
O	the
O	deep
O	immensity
O	of
O	its
O	dread
O	bosom
O	seemed
O	to
O	swell
O	the

O	,
O	as
O	if
O	moved
O	by
O	the
O	emotions
O	of
O	the

O	.
O	Thus
O	the
O	world
O	assumed
O	another
O	and
O	a
O	better
O	aspect
O	from
O	the
O	hour
O	that
O	the
O	poet
O	blessed
O	it
O	with
O	his
O	happy
O	eyes
O	.
O	The
O	Creator
O	had
O	bestowed
O	him
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	last
O	best
O	touch
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	handiwork
O	.
O	Creation
O	was
O	not
O	finished
O	till
O	the
O	poet
O	came
O	to
O	interpret
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	complete
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	effect
O	was
O	no
O	less
O	high
O	and
O	beautiful
O	,
O	when
O	his
O	human
O	brethren
O	were
O	the
O	subject
O	of
O	his
O	verse
O	.
O	The
O	man
O	or
O	woman
O	,
O	sordid
O	with
O	the
O	common
O	dust
O	of
O	life
O	,
O	who
O	crossed
O	his
O	daily
O	path
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	child
O	who
O	played
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	were
O	glorified
O	if
O	he
O	beheld
O	them
O	in
O	his
O	mood
O	of
O	poetic
O	faith
O	.
O	He
O	showed
O	the
O	golden
O	links
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	chain
O	that
O	intertwined
O	them
O	with
O	an
O	angelic
O	kindred;
O	he
O	brought
O	out
O	the
O	hidden
O	traits
O	of
O	a
O	celestial
O	birth
O	that
O	made
O	them
O	worthy
O	of
O	such
O	kin
O	.
O	Some
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	,
O	who
O	thought
O	to
O	show
O	the
O	soundness
O	of
O	their
O	judgment
O	by
O	affirming
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	beauty
O	and
O	dignity
O	of
O	the
O	natural
O	world
O	existed
O	only
O	in
O	the
O	poet
O	'
O	s
O	fancy
O	.
O	Let
O	such
O	men
O	speak
O	for
O	themselves
O	,
O	who
O	undoubtedly
O	appear
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	spawned
O	forth
O	by
O	Nature
O	with
O	a
O	contemptuous
O	bitterness;
O	she
O	having
O	plastered
O	them
O	up
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	refuse
O	stuff
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	the
O	swine
O	were

O	.
O	As
O	respects
O	all
O	things
O	else
O	,
O	the
O	poet
O	'
O	s
O	ideal
O	was
O	the
O	truest
O	truth
O	.
O	The
O	songs
O	of
O	this
O	poet
O	found
O	their
O	way
O	to
O	Ernest
O	.
O	He
O	read
O	them
O	after

O	,

O	""""
O	The
O	poet
O	spoke
O	sadly
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	eyes
O	were
O	dim
O	with
O	tears
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	likewise
O	,
O	were
O	those
O	of
O	Ernest
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	hour
O	of
O	sunset
O	,
O	as
O	had
O	long
O	been
O	his
O	frequent
O	custom
O	,
O	Ernest
O	was
O	to
O	discourse
O	to
O	an
O	assemblage
O	of
O	the
O	neighboring
O	inhabitants
O	in
O	the
O	open
O	air
O	.
O	He
O	and
O	the
O	poet
O	,
O	arm
O	in
O	arm
O	,
O	still
O	talking
O	together
O	as
O	they
O	went
O	along
O	,
O	proceeded
O	to
O	the
O	spot
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	small
O	nook
O	among
O	the
O	hills
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	gray
O	precipice
O	behind
O	,
O	the
O	stern
O	front
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	relieved
O	by
O	the
O	pleasant
O	foliage
O	of
O	many
O	creeping
O	plants
O	,
O	that
O	made
O	a
O	tapestry
O	for
O	the
O	naked
O	rock
O	,
O	by
O	hanging
O	their
O	festoons
O	from
O	all
O	its
O	rugged
O	angles
O	.
O	At
O	a
O	small
O	elevation
O	above
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	set
O	in
O	a
O	rich
O	framework
O	of
O	verdure
O	,
O	there
O	appeared
O	a
O	niche
O	,
O	spacious
O	enough
O	to
O	admit
O	a
O	human
O	figure
O	,
O	with
O	freedom
O	for
O	such
O	gestures
O	as
O	spontaneously
O	accompany
O	earnest
O	thought
O	and
O	genuine
O	emotion
O	.
O	Into
O	this
O	natural
O	pulpit
O	Ernest
O	ascended
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	a
O	look
O	of
O	familiar
O	kindness
O	around
O	upon
O	his
O	audience
O	.
O	They
O	stood
O	,
O	or
O	sat
O	,
O	or
O	reclined
O	upon
O	the
O	grass
O	,
O	as
O	seemed
O	good
O	to
O	each
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	departing
O	sunshine
O	falling
O	obliquely
O	over
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	mingling
O	its
O	subdued
O	cheerfulness
O	with
O	the
O	solemnity
O	of
O	a
O	grove
O	of
O	ancient
O	trees
O	,
O	beneath
O	and
O	amid
O	the
O	boughs
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	golden
O	rays
O	were
O	constrained
O	to
O	pass
O	.
O	In
O	another
O	direction
O	was
O	seen
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	cheer
O	,
O	combined
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	solemnity
O	,
O	in
O	its
O	benignant
O	aspect
O	.
O	Ernest
O	began
O	to
O	speak
O	,
O	giving
O	to
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	what
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	and
O	mind
O	.
O	His
O	words
O	had
O	power
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	accorded
O	with
O	his
O	thoughts;
O	and
O	his
O	thoughts
O	had
O	reality
O	and
O	depth
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	harmonized
O	with
O	the
O	life
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	always
O	lived
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	mere
O	breath
O	that
O	this
O	preacher
O	uttered;
O	they
O	were
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	life
O	,
O	because
O	a
O	life
O	of
O	good
O	deeds
O	and
O	holy
O	love
O	was
O	melted
O	into
O	them
O	.
O	Pearls
O	,
O	pure
O	and
O	rich
O	,
O	had
O	been
O	dissolved
O	into
O	this
O	precious
O	draught
O	.
O	The
O	poet
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	listened
O	,
O	felt
O	that
O	the
O	being
O	and
O	character
O	of
O	Ernest
O	were
O	a
O	nobler
O	strain
O	of
O	poetry
O	than
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	written
O	.
O	His
O	eyes
O	glistening
O	with
O	tears
O	,
O	he
O	gazed
O	reverentially
O	at
O	the
O	venerable
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	within
O	himself
O	that
O	never
O	was
O	there
O	an
O	aspect
O	so
O	worthy
O	of
O	a
O	prophet
O	and
O	a
O	sage
O	as
O	that
O	mild
O	,
O	sweet
O	,
O	thoughtful
O	countenance
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	glory
O	of
O	white
O	hair
O	diffused
O	about
O	it
O	.
O	At
O	a
O	distance
O	,
O	but
O	distinctly
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	,
O	high
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	golden
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	setting
O	sun
O	,
O	appeared
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	,
O	with
O	hoary
O	mists
O	around
O	it
O	,
O	like
O	the
O	white
O	hairs
O	around
O	the
O	brow
O	of
O	Ernest
O	.
O	Its
O	look
O	of
O	grand
O	beneficence
O	seemed
O	to
O	embrace
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	At
O	that
O	moment
O	,
O	in
O	sympathy
O	with
O	a
O	thought
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	utter
O	,
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	Ernest
O	assumed
O	a
O	grandeur
O	of
O	expression
O	,
O	so
O	imbued
O	with
O	benevolence
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	poet
O	,
O	by
O	an
O	irresistible
O	impulse
O	,
O	threw
O	his
O	arms
O	aloft
O	,
O	and
O	shouted:
O	""""
O	Behold
O	!
O	Behold
O	!
O	Ernest
O	is
O	himself
O	the
O	likeness
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	Stone
O	Face
O	!
O	""""
O	Then
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	looked
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	what
O	the
O	deep-sighted
O	poet
O	said
O	was
O	true
O	.
O	The
O	prophecy
O	was
O	fulfilled
O	.
O	But
O	Ernest
O	,
O	having
O	finished
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	took
O	the
O	poet
O	'
O	s
O	arm
O	,
O	and
O	walked
O	slowly
O	homeward
O	,
O	still
O	hoping
O	that
O	some
O	wiser
O	and
O	better
O	man
O	than
O	himself
O	would
O	by
O	and
O	by
O	appear
O	,
O	bearing
O	a
O	resemblance
O	to
O	the
O	GREAT
O	STONE
O	FACE
O	.
