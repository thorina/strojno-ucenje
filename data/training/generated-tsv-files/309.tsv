O	There

O	little
O	Brownie
O	,
O	who

O	do
O	you
O	think
O	he
O	lived
O	?
O	--in
O	a
O	coal
O	cellar
O	.
O	Now
O	a
O	coal
O	cellar
O	may
O	seem
O	a
O	most
O	curious
O	place
O	to
O	choose
O	to
O	live
O	in;
O	but
O	then
O	a
O	Brownie
O	is
O	a
O	curious
O	creature--a
O	fairy
O	and
O	yet
O	not
O	one
O	of
O	that
O	sort
O	of
O	fairies
O	who
O	fly
O	about
O	on
O	gossamer
O	wings
O	,
O	and
O	dance
O	in
O	the
O	moonlight
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	on
O	.
O	He
O	never
O	dances;
O	and
O	as

O	wings
O	,
O	what
O	use
O	would
O	they
O	be
O	to
O	him
O	in
O	a

O	?
O	He
O	is
O	a
O	sober
O	,
O	stay-at-home
O	,
O	household
O	elf--nothing
O	much
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	,
O	even
O	if
O	you
O	did
O	see
O	him
O	,
O	which
O	you
O	are
O	not
O	likely
O	to
O	do--only
O	a
O	little
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	about
O	a
O	foot
O	high
O	,
O	all
O	dressed
O	in
O	brown
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	brown
O	face
O	and
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	brown
O	peaked
O	cap
O	,
O	just
O	the
O	color
O	of
O	a
O	brown
O	mouse
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	mouse
O	,
O	he
O	hides
O	in
O	corners--especially
O	kitchen
O	corners
O	,
O	and
O	only
O	comes
O	out
O	after
O	dark
O	when
O	nobody
O	is
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	sometimes
O	people
O	call

O	Mr

O	.
O	I
O	said

O	to
O	see
O	him
O	.
O	I
O	never
O	did
O	,
O	certainly
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	knew

O	but
O	still
O	,
O	if
O	you
O	were
O	to

O	you
O	would
O	hear
O	many

O	stories
O	about
O	Brownies
O	in
O	general
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	I
O	may
O	as
O	well
O	tell
O	you
O	the
O	adventures
O	of
O	this
O	particular
O	Brownie
O	,
O	who
O	belonged
O	to
O	a
O	family
O	there;
O	which
O	family
O	he
O	had
O	followed
O	from
O	house
O	to
O	house
O	most
O	faithfully
O	,
O	for
O	years
O	and
O	years
O	.
O	A
O	good
O	many
O	people
O	had
O	heard
O	him--or
O	supposed
O	they
O	had--when
O	there
O	were
O	extraordinary
O	noises
O	about
O	the
O	house;
O	noises
O	which
O	must
O	have
O	come
O	from
O	a
O	mouse
O	or
O	a
O	rat--or
O	a
O	Brownie
O	.
O	But
O	nobody
O	had
O	ever
O	seen
O	him
O	except
O	the
O	children
O	,
O	--the
O	three
O	little
O	boys
O	and
O	three
O	little
O	girls
O	,
O	--who
O	declared
O	he
O	often
O	came
O	to
O	play
O	with
O	them
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	alone
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	the
O	nicest
O	companion
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	such
O	an
O	old
O	man--hundreds
O	of
O	years
O	old
O	!
O	He
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	fun
O	and
O	mischief
O	,
O	and
O	up
O	to
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	tricks
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	never
O	did
O	anybody
O	any
O	harm
O	unless
O	they
O	deserved
O	it
O	.
O	Brownie
O	was
O	supposed
O	to
O	live
O	under
O	one
O	particular
O	coal
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	darkest
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	cellar
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	never
O	allowed
O	to
O	be
O	disturbed
O	.
O	Why
O	he
O	had
O	chosen
O	it
O	nobody
O	knew
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	he
O	lived
O	there
O	nobody
O	knew
O	either
O	,
O	nor
O	what
O	he
O	lived
O	upon
O	.
O	Except
O	that
O	,
O	ever
O	since
O	the
O	family
O	could
O	remember
O	,
O	there
O	had
O	always
O	been
O	a
O	bowl
O	of
O	milk
O	put
O	behind
O	the
O	coal-cellar
O	door
O	for
O	the
O	Brownie
O	'
O	s
O	supper
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	he
O	drank
O	it--perhaps
O	he
O	didn
O	'
O	t:
O	anyhow
O	the
O	bowl
O	was
O	always
O	found
O	empty
O	next
O	morning
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	Cook
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	lived
O	all
O	her
O	life
O	in
O	the
O	family
O	,
O	had
O	never
O	once
O	forgotten
O	to
O	give
O	Brownie
O	his
O	supper;
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	died
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	young
O	Cook
O	came
O	in

O	who
O	was
O	very

O	She
O	was
O	also

O	again
O	,

O	and
O	so
O	succeeded
O	in
O	quieting
O	her
O	.
O	After
O	that
O	he
O	enjoyed
O	himself
O	amazingly
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	more
O	marks
O	than
O	ever
O	on
O	the
O	white
O	tablecloth;
O	for
O	he
O	began
O	jumping
O	about
O	like
O	a
O	pea
O	on
O	a
O	trencher
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	make
O	his
O	particularly
O	large
O	supper
O	agree
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	absence
O	of
O	the
O	cat
O	,
O	he
O	teased
O	the
O	puppy
O	for
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	two
O	,
O	till
O	,
O	hearing
O	the
O	clock
O	strike
O	five
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	as
O	well
O	to
O	turn
O	into
O	a
O	mouse
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	creep
O	back
O	cautiously
O	into
O	his
O	cellar
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	only
O	just
O	in
O	time
O	,
O	for
O	Muff
O	opened
O	one
O	eye
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	just
O	going
O	to
O	pounce
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	changed
O	himself
O	back
O	into
O	a
O	Brownie
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	so
O	startled
O	that
O	she
O	bounded
O	away
O	,
O	her
O	tail
O	growing
O	into
O	twice

O	natural
O	size
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	eyes
O	gleaming
O	like
O	round
O	green
O	globes
O	.
O	But
O	Brownie
O	only
O	said
O	,
O	""""
O	Ha

O	and
O	walked

O	.

O	downstairs
