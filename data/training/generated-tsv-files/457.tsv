O	a

O	day
O	Rustem
O	arose
O	from

O	filled
O	with

O	He
O	bethought
O	him
O	therefore
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	to

O	So
O	he

O	And
O	when

O	,
O	he
O	started
O	a
O	herd

O	made
O	sport

O	till
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	weary

O	the

O	he
O	caught
O	one

O	it
O	for
O	his
O	meal

O	,
O	he
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	to

O	Rakush

O	the

O	.
O	Now
O	while
O	the

O	there
O	passed
O	by
O	seven
O	knights
O	of
O	Turan
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	beheld
O	Rakush
O	and
O	coveted
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	threw
O	their
O	cords
O	at
O	him
O	to
O	ensnare

O	.
O	But
O	Rakush
O	,

O	the

O	And

O	bare
O	with
O	them
O	gifts
O	of
O	great
O	price
O	to
O	pour
O	before
O	the
O	face
O	of

O	.
O	And
O	they
O	bare
O	also
O	a
O	letter
O	filled
O	with
O	soft
O	words
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	the
O	letter
O	Afrasiyab
O	lauded
O	Sohrab
O	for
O	his
O	resolve
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	how
O	that
O	if
O	Iran
O	be
O	subdued
O	the
O	world
O	would
O	henceforth
O	know
O	peace
O	,
O	for
O	upon
O	his
O	own
O	head
O	should
O	he
O	place
O	the
O	crown
O	of
O	the
O	Kaianides;
O	and
O	Turan
O	,
O	Iran
O	,
O	and
O	Samengan
O	should
O	be
O	as
O	one
O	land
O	.
O	When
O	Sohrab
O	had
O	read
O	this
O	letter
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	gifts
O	and
O	the
O	aid
O	sent
O	out
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	rejoiced
O	aloud
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	deemed
O	that
O	now
O	none
O	could
O	withstand
O	his
O	might
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	caused
O	the
O	cymbals
O	of
O	departure
O	to
O	be
O	clashed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	army
O	made
O	them
O	ready
O	to
O	go
O	forth
O	.
O	Then
O	Sohrab
O	led
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	Iran
O	.
O	And
O	their
O	track
O	was
O	marked
O	by
O	desolation
O	and
O	destruction
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	spared
O	nothing
O	that
O	they
O	passed
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	spread
O	fire
O	and
O	dismay
O	abroad
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	marched
O	on
O	unstayed
O	until
O	they
O	came
O	unto
O	the
O	White
O	Castle
O	,
O	the
O	fortress
O	wherein
O	Iran
O	put
O	its
O	trust
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	guardian
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	was
O	named
O	Hujir
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	lived
O	with
O	him
O	Gustahem
O	the
O	grave
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	grown
O	old
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	aid
O	no
O	longer
O	save
O	with
O	his
O	counsels
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	abode
O	also
O	his
O	daughter
O	Gurdafrid
O	,
O	a
O	warlike
O	maid
O	,
O	firm
O	in
O	the
O	saddle
O	,
O	and
O	practised
O	in
O	the
O	fight
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	Hujir
O	beheld
O	from
O	afar
O	a
O	dusky
O	cloud
O	of
O	armed
O	men
O	he
O	came
O	forth
O	to
O	meet
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	Sohrab
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	him
O	,
O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	demanded
O	his
O	name
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	prepare
O	to
O	meet
O	his
O	end
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	taunted
O	him
O	with
O	rashness
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	come
O	forth
O	thus
O	unaided
O	to
O	stand
O	against
O	a
O	lion
O	.
O	But
O	Hujir
O	answered
O	Sohrab
O	with
O	taunts
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	vowed
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	sever
O	his
O	head
O	from
O	his
O	trunk
O	and
O	send
O	it
O	for
O	a
O	trophy
O	unto
O	the
O	Shah
O	.
O	Yet
O	Sohrab
O	only
O	smiled
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	these
O	words
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	challenged
O	Hujir
O	to
O	come
O	near
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	met
O	in
O	combat
O	,
O	and
O	wrestled
O	sore
O	one
O	with
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	stalwart
O	were
O	their
O	strokes
O	and
O	strong;
O	but
O	Sohrab
O	overcame
O	Hujir
O	as
O	though
O	he
O	were
O	an
O	infant
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	bound
O	him
O	and
O	sent
O	him
O	captive
O	unto
O	Human
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	those
O	within
O	the
O	castle
O	learned
O	that
O	their
O	chief
O	was
O	bound
O	they
O	raised
O	great
O	lamentation
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	fears
O	were
O	sore
O	.
O	And
O	Gurdafrid
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	learned
O	it
O	,
O	was
O	grieved
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	ashamed
O	also
O	for
O	the
O	fate
O	of
O	Hujir
O	.
O	So
O	she
O	took
O	forth
O	burnished
O	mail
O	and
O	clad
O	herself
O	therein
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	hid
O	her
O	tresses
O	under
O	a
O	helmet
O	of
O	Roum
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	mounted
O	a
O	steed
O	of
O	battle
O	and
O	came
O	forth
O	before
O	the
O	walls
O	like
O	to
O	a
O	warrior
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	uttered
O	a
O	cry
O	of
O	thunder
O	,
O	and
O	flung
O	it
O	amid
O	the
O	ranks
O	of
O	Turan
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	defied
O	the
O	champions
O	to
O	come
O	forth
O	to
O	single
O	combat
O	.
O	And
O	none
O	came
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	beheld
O	her
O	how
O	she
O	was
O	strong
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	knew
O	not
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a

O	,

O	were
O	afraid

O	But
O	Sohrab
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	it
O	,
O	stepped
O	forth
O	and
O	said:

O	Then
O	he
O	girded

O	And
O	the
O	maid
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	saw

O	was
O	ready
O	,
O	rained

O	she

O	dropped

O	the

O	Now
O	Zindeh

O	,
O	whom

O	bring
O	torches
O	,

O	all
O	the
O	warriors
O	and
O	singing

O	followed
O	after

O	.
O	Then
O	when
O	Sohrab
O	saw
O	that

O	Then
O	he

O	,
O	and

O	he
O	stood

O	And
O	he

O	""""
O	Then
O	he

O	swathed
O	in
O	rich
O	brocades
O	of
O	gold
O	worthy

O	And
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	enfolded
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	Rustem
O	learned
O	that
O	the
O	Turanians
O	had
O	quitted
O	the
O	borders

O	he
O	made
O	ready
O	his
O	army

O	And
O	the
O	nobles
O	marched
O	before
O	the
O	bier
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	heads
O	were
O	covered
O	with
O	ashes
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	garments
O	were
O	torn
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	drums
O	of
O	the
O	war-elephants
O	were
O	shattered
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	cymbals
O	broken
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	tails
O	of
O	the
O	horses
O	were
O	shorn
O	to
O	the
O	root
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	signs
O	of

O	Now
O	Zal
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	host
O	returning
O	thus
O	in
O	sorrow
O	,
O	marvelled
O	what
O	was
O	come
O	about;
O	for
O	he
O	beheld
O	Rustem
O	at
O	their
O	head
O	,
O	wherefore
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	wailing
O	was
O	not
O	for
O	his
O	son
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	came
O	before
O	Rustem
O	and
O	questioned
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	Rustem
O	led
O	him
O	unto
O	the
O	bier
O	and
O	showed
O	unto
O	him
O	the
O	youth
O	that
O	was
O	like
O	in
O	feature
O	and
O	in
O	might
O	unto
O	Saum
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	Neriman
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	told
O	him
O	all
O	that
O	was
O	come
O	to
O	pass
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	this
O	was
O	his
O	son
O	,
O	who
O	in
O	years
O	was
O	but
O	an
O	infant
O	,
O	but
O	a
O	hero
O	in
O	battle
O	.
O	And
O	Rudabeh
O	too
O	came
O	out
O	to
O	behold
O	the
O	child
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	joined
O	her
O	lamentations
O	unto
O	theirs
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	built
O	for
O	Sohrab
O	a
O	tomb
O	like
O	to
O	a
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	hoof
O	,
O	and
O	Rustem
O	laid
O	him
O	therein
O	in
O	a
O	chamber
O	of
O	gold
O	perfumed
O	with
O	ambergris
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	covered
O	him
O	with
O	brocades
O	of
O	gold
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	done
O	,
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	Rustem
O	grew
O	like
O	to
O	a
O	grave
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	courts
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	sorrow
O	.
O	And
O	no
O	joy
O	would
O	enter
O	into
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	Rustem
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	long
O	before
O	he
O	held
O	high
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	Meantime
O	the
O	news
O	spread
O	even
O	unto
O	Turan
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	too
O	did
O	all
O	men
O	grieve
O	and
O	weep
O	for
O	the
O	child
O	of
O	prowess
O	that
O	was
O	fallen
O	in
O	his
O	bloom
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Samengan
O	tore
O	his
O	vestments
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	his
O	daughter
O	learned
O	it
O	she
O	was
O	beside
O	herself
O	with
O	affliction
O	.
O	And
O	Tahmineh
O	cried
O	after
O	her
O	son
O	,
O	and
O	bewailed
O	the
O	evil
O	fate
O	that
O	had
O	befallen
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	heaped
O	black
O	earth
O	upon
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	tore
O	her
O	hair
O	,
O	and
O	wrung
O	her
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	rolled
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	in
O	her
O	agony
O	.
O	And
O	her
O	mouth
O	was
O	never
O	weary
O	of
O	plaining
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	caused
O	the
O	garments
O	of
O	Sohrab
O	to
O	be
O	brought
O	unto
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	throne
O	and
O	his
O	steed
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	regarded
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	stroked
O	the
O	courser
O	and
O	poured
O	tears
O	upon
O	his
O	hoofs
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	cherished
O	the
O	robes
O	as
O	though
O	they
O	yet
O	contained
O	her
O	boy
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	pressed
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	palfrey
O	unto
O	her
O	breast
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	kissed
O	the
O	helmet
O	that
O	Sohrab
O	had
O	worn
O	.
O	Then
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	she
O	cut
O	off
O	the
O	tail
O	of
O	his
O	steed
O	and
O	set
O	fire
O	unto
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	Sohrab
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	gave
O	his
O	gold
O	and
O	jewels
O	unto
O	the
O	poor
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	a
O	year
O	had
O	thus
O	rolled
O	over
O	her
O	bitterness
O	,
O	the
O	breath
O	departed
O	from
O	out
O	her
O	body
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	spirit
O	went
O	forth
O	after
O	Sohrab
O	her
O	son
O	.
