O	Many
O	years
O	ago
O	there
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	Pawnee
O	tribe
O	an
O	old
O	woman
O	and
O	her
O	grandson
O	a
O	boy
O	about
O	sixteen
O	years
O	old
O	.
O	These
O	people
O	had
O	no
O	relations
O	and
O	were
O	very
O	poor
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	so
O	poor
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	despised
O	by
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	tribe
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	nothing
O	of
O	their
O	own;
O	and
O	always
O	,
O	after
O	the
O	village
O	started
O	to
O	move
O	the
O	camp
O	from
O	one
O	place
O	to
O	another
O	,
O	these
O	two
O	would
O	stay
O	behind
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	to
O	look
O	over
O	the
O	old
O	camp
O	and
O	pick
O	up
O	anything
O	that
O	the
O	other
O	Indians
O	had
O	thrown
O	away
O	as
O	worn
O	out
O	or
O	useless
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	way
O	they
O	would
O	sometimes
O	get
O	pieces
O	of
O	robes
O	,
O	wornout
O	moccasins
O	with
O	holes
O	in
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	bits
O	of
O	meat
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	it
O	happened
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	after
O	the
O	tribe
O	had
O	moved
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	camp
O	,
O	that
O	this
O	old
O	woman
O	and
O	her
O	boy
O	were
O	following
O	along
O	the
O	trail
O	behind
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	miserable
O	old
O	wornout
O	dun
O	horse
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	supposed
O	had
O	been
O	abandoned
O	by
O	some
O	Indians
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	thin
O	and
O	exhausted
O	,
O	was
O	blind
O	of
O	one
O	eye
O	,
O	had
O	a
O	bad
O	sore
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	forelegs
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	swollen
O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	worthless
O	that
O	none
O	of
O	the
O	Pawnees
O	had
O	been
O	willing
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	trouble
O	to
O	try
O	to
O	drive
O	him
O	along
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	and
O	her
O	boy
O	came
O	along
O	,
O	the

O	So
O	the

O	and
O	drove

O	,
O	but
O	he
O	limped
O	and
O	could
O	only
O	go
O	very
O	slowly
O	.
O	The
O	tribe
O	moved
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	North
O	Platte
O	,

O	they

O	who
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	out
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	buffalo
O	,
O	came
O	hurrying
O	into
O	camp
O	and
O	told
O	the
O	chiefs

O	a
O	large
O	herd
O	of
O	buffalo
O	were
O	near
O	,
O	and
O	that

O	a

O	The

O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	about
O	the
O	spotted

O	ordered
O	his

O	decided
