O	I
O	was
O	surprised
O	one
O	morning
O	by
O	seeing
O	no
O	less
O	than
O	five
O	canoes
O	all
O	on
O	shore
O	together
O	on
O	my
O	side
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	who
O	belonged
O	to
O	them
O	all
O	landed
O	and
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	sight
O	.
O	The
O	number
O	of
O	them
O	broke
O	all
O	my
O	measures;
O	for
O	seeing
O	so
O	many
O	,
O	and
O	knowing
O	that
O	they
O	always
O	came
O	four
O	or
O	six
O	or
O	sometimes
O	more
O	in
O	a
O	boat
O	,
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	what
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	or
O	how
O	to
O	take
O	my
O	measures
O	to
O	attack
O	twenty
O	or
O	thirty
O	men
O	single-handed;
O	so
O	lay
O	still
O	in
O	my
O	castle
O	perplexed
O	and
O	discomforted
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	I
O	put
O	myself
O	into
O	the
O	same
O	position
O	for
O	an
O	attack
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	formerly
O	provided
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	just
O	ready
O	for
O	action
O	if
O	anything
O	had
O	presented
O	.
O	Having
O	waited
O	a
O	good
O	while
O	listening
O	to
O	hear
O	if
O	they
O	made
O	any
O	noise
O	,
O	at
O	length
O	,
O	being
O	very
O	impatient
O	,
O	I
O	set
O	my
O	guns
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	my
O	ladder
O	,
O	and
O	clambered
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	hill
O	,
O	by
O	my
O	two
O	stages
O	,
O	as
O	usual;
O	standing
O	so
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	my
O	head
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	above
O	the
O	hill
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	perceive
O	me
O	by
O	any
O	means
O	.
O	Here
O	I
O	observed
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	my
O	perspective
O	glass
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	no
O	less
O	than
O	thirty
O	in
O	number;
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	a
O	fire
O	kindled
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	meat
O	dressed
O	.
O	How
O	they
O	had
O	cooked
O	it
O	I
O	knew
O	not
O	,
O	or
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	dancing
O	,
O	in
O	I
O	know
O	not
O	how
O	many
O	barbarous
O	gestures
O	and
O	figures
O	,
O	their
O	own
O	way
O	,
O	round
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	While
O	I
O	was
O	thus
O	looking
O	on
O	them
O	,
O	I
O	perceived
O	,
O	by
O	my
O	perspective
O	,
O	two
O	miserable
O	wretches
O	dragged
O	from
O	the
O	boats
O	,
O	where
O	,
O	it
O	seems
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	laid
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	now
O	brought
O	out
O	for
O	the
O	slaughter
O	.
O	I
O	perceived
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	immediately
O	fall
O	,
O	being
O	knocked
O	down
O	,
O	I
O	suppose
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	club
O	or
O	wooden
O	sword
O	,
O	for
O	that
O	was
O	their
O	way;
O	and
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	others
O	were
O	at
O	work
O	immediately
O	,
O	cutting
O	him
O	open
O	for
O	their
O	cookery
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	other
O	victim
O	was
O	left
O	standing
O	by
O	himself
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	should
O	be
O	ready
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	In
O	that
O	very
O	moment
O	,
O	this
O	poor
O	wretch
O	seeing
O	himself
O	a
O	little
O	at
O	liberty
O	and
O	unbound
O	,
O	nature
O	inspired
O	him
O	with
O	hopes
O	of
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	started
O	away
O	from
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	with
O	incredible
O	swiftness
O	along
O	the
O	sands
O	,
O	directly
O	towards
O	me;
O	I
O	mean
O	towards
O	that
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	coast
O	where
O	my
O	habitation
O	was
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	dreadfully
O	frightened
O	,
O	I
O	must
O	acknowledge
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	perceived
O	him
O	run
O	my
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	especially
O	when
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	thought
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	him
O	pursued
O	by
O	the
O	whole
O	body;
O	and
O	now
O	I
O	expected
O	that
O	part
O	of
O	my
O	dream
O	was
O	coming
O	to
O	pass
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	certainly
O	take
O	shelter
O	in
O	my
O	grove;
O	but
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	depend
O	,
O	by
O	any
O	means
O	,
O	upon
O	my
O	dream
O	that
O	the
O	other
O	savages
O	would
O	not
O	pursue
O	him
O	thither
O	and
O	find
O	him
O	there
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	I
O	kept
O	my
O	station
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	spirits
O	began
O	to
O	recover
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	above
O	three
O	men
O	that
O	followed
O	him;
O	and
O	still
O	more
O	was
O	I
O	encouraged
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	he
O	outstripped
O	them
O	exceedingly
O	in
O	running
O	,
O	and
O	gained
O	ground
O	on
O	them;
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	but
O	hold
O	out
O	for
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	easily
O	he
O	would
O	fairly
O	get
O	away
O	from
O	them
O	all
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	between
O	them
O	and
O	my
O	castle
O	the
O	creek
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	mentioned
O	often
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	part
O	of
O	my
O	story
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	landed
O	my
O	cargoes
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	I
O	saw
O	plainly
O	he
O	must
O	necessarily
O	swim
O	over
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	poor
O	wretch
O	would
O	be
O	taken
O	there;
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	savage
O	escaping
O	came
O	thither
O	he
O	made
O	nothing
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	tide
O	was
O	then
O	up
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	plunging
O	in
O	,
O	swam
O	through
O	in
O	about
O	thirty
O	strokes
O	,
O	or
O	thereabouts
O	,
O	landed
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	with
O	exceeding
O	strength
O	and
O	swiftness
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	three
O	persons
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	creek
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	two
O	of
O	them
O	could
O	swim
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	third
O	could
O	not
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	standing
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	,
O	he
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	others
O	,
O	but
O	went
O	no
O	farther
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	after
O	went
O	softly
O	back
O	again;
O	which
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	happened
O	,
O	was
O	very
O	well
O	for
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	end
O	.
O	I
O	observed
O	that
O	the
O	two
O	who
O	swam
O	were
O	yet
O	more
O	than
O	twice
O	as
O	long
O	swimming
O	over
O	the
O	creek
O	as
O	the
O	fellow
O	was
O	that
O	fled
O	from
O	them
O	.
O	It
O	came
O	very
O	warmly
O	upon
O	my
O	thoughts
O	,
O	and
O	indeed
O	irresistibly
O	,
O	that
O	now
O	was
O	the
O	time
O	to
O	get
O	me
O	a
O	servant
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	a
O	companion
O	or
O	assistant;
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	plainly
O	called
O	by
O	Providence
O	to
O	save
O	this
O	poor
O	creature
O	'
O	s
O	life
O	.
O	I
O	immediately
O	ran
O	down
O	the
O	ladders
O	with
O	all
O	possible
O	expedition
O	,
O	fetched
O	my
O	two
O	guns
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	both
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	ladders
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	observed
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	getting
O	up
O	again
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	haste
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	hill
O	,
O	I
O	crossed
O	towards
O	the
O	sea;
O	and
O	having
O	a
O	very
O	short
O	cut
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	down
O	hill
O	,
O	placed
O	myself
O	in
O	the
O	way
O	between
O	the
O	pursuers
O	and
O	the
O	pursued
O	,
O	hallooing
O	aloud
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	fled
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	looking
O	back
O	,
O	was
O	at
O	first
O	perhaps
O	as
O	much
O	frightened
O	at
O	me
O	as
O	at
O	them;
O	but
O	I
O	beckoned
O	with
O	my
O	hand
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	come
O	back
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	meantime
O	,
O	I
O	slowly
O	advanced
O	towards
O	the
O	two
O	that
O	followed;
O	then
O	rushing
O	at
O	once
O	upon
O	the
O	foremost
O	,
O	I
O	knocked
O	him
O	down
O	with
O	the
O	stock
O	of
O	my
O	piece
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	loath
O	to
O	fire
O	,
O	because
O	I
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	the
O	rest
O	hear;
O	though
O	,
O	at
O	that
O	distance
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	been
O	easily
O	heard
O	,
O	and
O	being
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	smoke
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	known
O	what
O	to
O	make
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	Having
O	knocked
O	this
O	fellow
O	down
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	who
O	pursued
O	him
O	stopped
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	frightened
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	advanced
O	towards
O	him;
O	but
O	as
O	I
O	came
O	nearer
O	,
O	I
O	perceived
O	presently
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	bow
O	and
O	arrow
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	fitting
O	it
O	to
O	shoot
O	at
O	me:
O	so
O	I
O	was
O	then
O	obliged
O	to
O	shoot
O	at
O	him
O	first
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	did
O	,
O	and
O	killed
O	him
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	shot
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	savage
O	who
O	fled
O	,
O	but
O	had
O	stopped
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	saw
O	both
O	his
O	enemies
O	fallen
O	and
O	killed
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	thought
O	,
O	yet
O	was
O	so
O	frightened
O	with
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	noise
O	of
O	my
O	piece
O	that
O	he
O	stood
O	stock
O	still
O	and
O	neither
O	came
O	forward
O	nor
O	went
O	backward
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	seemed
O	rather
O	inclined
O	still
O	to
O	fly
O	than
O	to
O	come
O	on
O	.
O	I
O	hallooed
O	again
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	signs
O	to
O	come
O	forward
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	easily
O	understood
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	a
O	little
O	way;
O	then
O	stopped
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	a
O	little
O	farther
O	,
O	and
O	stopped
O	again;
O	and
O	I
O	could
O	then
O	perceive
O	that
O	he
O	stood
O	trembling
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	taken
O	prisoner
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	just
O	been
O	sentenced
O	to
O	be
O	killed
O	,
O	as
O	his
O	two
O	enemies
O	were
O	.
O	I
O	beckoned
O	to
O	him
O	again
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	all
O	the
O	signs
O	of
O	encouragement
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	think
O	of;
O	and
O	he
O	came
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	,
O	kneeling
O	down
O	every
O	ten
O	or
O	twelve
O	steps
O	,
O	in
O	token
O	of
O	acknowledgment
O	for
O	saving
O	his
O	life
O	.
O	I
O	smiled
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	pleasantly
O	,
O	and
O	beckoned
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	come
O	still
O	nearer;
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	came
O	close
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	kneeled
O	down
O	again
O	,
O	kissed
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	laid
O	his
O	head
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	me
O	by
O	the
O	foot
O	set
O	my
O	foot
O	upon
O	his
O	head;
O	this
O	,
O	it
O	seems
O	,
O	was
O	in
O	token
O	of
O	swearing
O	to
O	be
O	my
O	slave
O	forever
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	him
O	up
O	and
O	made
O	much
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	encouraged
O	him
O	all
O	I
O	could
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	more
O	work
O	to
O	do
O	yet
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	perceived
O	the
O	savage
O	whom
O	I
O	had
O	knocked
O	down
O	was
O	not
O	killed
O	,
O	but
O	stunned
O	with
O	the
O	blow
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	himself;
O	so
O	I
O	pointed
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	him
O	the
O	savage
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	dead;
O	upon
O	this
O	he
O	spoke
O	some
O	words
O	to
O	me
O	and
O	,
O	though
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	understand
O	them
O	,
O	yet
O	I
O	thought
O	they
O	were
O	pleasant
O	to
O	hear
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	the
O	first
O	sound
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	voice
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	heard
O	,
O	my
O	own
O	excepted
O	,
O	for
O	above
O	twenty-five
O	years
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	time
O	for
O	such
O	reflections
O	now;
O	the
O	savage
O	who
O	was
O	knocked
O	down
O	recovered
O	himself
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	to
O	sit
O	up
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	perceived
O	that
O	my
O	savage
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	afraid;
O	but
O	when
O	I
O	saw
O	that
O	,
O	I
O	presented
O	my
O	other
O	piece
O	at
O	the
O	man
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	I
O	would
O	shoot
O	him;
O	upon
O	this
O	my
O	savage
O	,
O	for
O	so
O	I
O	call
O	him
O	now
O	,
O	made
O	a
O	motion
O	to
O	me
O	to
O	lend
O	him
O	my
O	sword
O	,
O	which
O	hung
O	naked
O	in
O	a
O	belt
O	by
O	my
O	side
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	did
O	.
O	He
O	no
O	sooner
O	had
O	it
O	but
O	he
O	runs
O	to
O	his
O	enemy
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	one
O	blow
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	head
O	so
O	cleverly
O	no
O	executioner
O	in
O	Germany
O	could
O	have
O	done
O	it
O	sooner
O	or
O	better;
O	which
O	I
O	thought
O	very
O	strange
O	for
O	one
O	who
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	reason
O	to
O	believe
O	,
O	never
O	saw
O	a
O	sword
O	in
O	his
O	life
O	before
O	,
O	except
O	their
O	own
O	wooden
O	swords
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	it
O	seems
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	learned
O	afterwards
O	,
O	they
O	make
O	their
O	wooden
O	swords
O	so
O	sharp
O	,
O	so
O	heavy
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wood
O	is
O	so
O	hard
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	will
O	even
O	cut
O	off
O	heads
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	ay
O	,
O	and
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	at
O	one
O	blow
O	,
O	too
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	comes
O	laughing
O	to
O	me
O	in
O	sign
O	of
O	triumph
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	me
O	the
O	sword
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	abundance
O	of
O	gestures
O	which
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	understand
O	,
O	laid
O	it
O	down
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	savage
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	killed
O	,
O	just
O	before
O	me
O	.
O	But
O	that
O	which
O	astonished
O	him
O	most
O	was
O	to
O	know
O	how
O	I
O	killed
O	the
O	other
O	Indian
O	so
O	far
O	off;
O	so
O	,
O	pointing
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	signs
O	to
O	me
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	go
O	to
O	him;
O	and
O	I
O	bade
O	him
O	go
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	stood
O	like
O	one
O	amazed
O	,
O	looking
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	turning
O	him
O	first
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	then
O	on
O	the
O	other;
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	wound
O	the
O	bullet
O	had
O	made
O	,
O	which
O	it
O	seems
O	was
O	just
O	in
O	his
O	breast
O	,
O	where
O	it
O	had
O	made
O	a
O	hole
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	great
O	quantity
O	of
O	blood
O	had
O	followed;
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	bled
O	inwardly
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	dead
O	.
O	He
O	took
O	up
O	his
O	bow
O	and
O	arrows
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	back;
O	so
O	I
O	turned
O	to
O	go
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	beckoned
O	him
O	to
O	follow
O	me
O	,
O	making
O	sign
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	more
O	might
O	come
O	after
O	them
O	.
O	Upon
O	this
O	he
O	made
O	signs
O	to
O	me
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	bury
O	them
O	with
O	sand
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	seen
O	by
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	followed;
O	and
O	so
O	I
O	made
O	signs
O	to
O	him
O	again
O	to
O	do
O	so
O	.
O	He
O	fell
O	to
O	work;
O	and
O	in
O	an
O	instant
O	he
O	had
O	scraped
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	sand
O	with
O	his
O	hands
O	big
O	enough
O	to
O	bury
O	the
O	first
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	dragged
O	him
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	covered
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	so
O	by
O	the
O	other
O	also;
O	I
O	believe
O	he
O	had
O	buried
O	them
O	both
O	in
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	calling
O	him
O	away
O	,
O	I
O	carried
O	him
O	,
O	not
O	to
O	my
O	castle
O	,
O	but
O	quite
O	away
O	to
O	my
O	cave
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	farther
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	island:
O	so
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	let
O	my
O	dream
O	come
O	to
O	pass
O	in
O	that
O	part
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	my
O	grove
O	for
O	shelter
O	.
O	Here
O	I
O	gave
O	him
O	bread
O	and
O	a
O	bunch
O	of
O	raisins
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	draught
O	of
O	water
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	he
O	was
O	indeed
O	in
O	great
O	distress
O	for
O	,
O	from
O	his
O	running;
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	refreshed
O	him
O	,
O	I
O	made
O	signs
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	lie
O	down
O	to
O	sleep
O	,
O	showing
O	him
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	laid
O	some
O	rice-straw
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	blanket
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	used
O	to
O	sleep
O	upon
O	myself
O	sometimes;
O	so
O	the
O	poor
O	creature
O	lay
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	comely
O	,
O	handsome
O	fellow
O	,
O	perfectly
O	well
O	made
O	,
O	with
O	straight
O	,
O	strong
O	limbs
O	,
O	not
O	too
O	large;
O	tall
O	,
O	and
O	well-shaped;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	reckon
O	,
O	about
O	twenty-six
O	years
O	of
O	age
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	countenance
O	,
O	not
O	a
O	fierce
O	and
O	surly
O	aspect
O	,
O	but
O	seemed
O	to
O	have
O	something
O	very
O	manly
O	in
O	his
O	face;
O	and
O	yet
O	he
O	had
O	all
O	the
O	sweetness
O	and
O	softness
O	of
O	a
O	European
O	in
O	his
O	countenance
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	especially
O	when
O	he
O	smiled
O	.
O	His
O	hair
O	was
O	long
O	and
O	black
O	,
O	not
O	curled
O	like
O	wool;
O	his
O	forehead
O	very
O	high
O	and
O	large;
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	vivacity
O	and
O	sparkling
O	sharpness
O	in
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	The
O	color
O	of
O	his
O	skin
O	was
O	not
O	quite
O	black
O	,
O	but
O	very
O	tawny;
O	and
O	yet
O	not
O	an
O	ugly
O	,
O	yellow
O	,
O	nauseous
O	tawny
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	Brazilians
O	and
O	Virginians
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	natives
O	of
O	America
O	are
O	,
O	but
O	of
O	a
O	bright
O	kind
O	of
O	a
O	dun
O	olive-color
O	,
O	that
O	had
O	in
O	it
O	something
O	very
O	agreeable
O	,
O	though
O	not
O	very
O	easy
O	to
O	describe
O	.
O	His
O	face
O	was
O	round
O	and
O	plump;
O	his
O	nose
O	small
O	,
O	not
O	flat
O	,
O	like
O	the
O	negroes;
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	mouth
O	,
O	thin
O	lips
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	fine
O	teeth
O	well
O	set
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	white
O	as
O	ivory
O	.
O	After
O	he
O	had
O	slumbered
O	,
O	rather
O	than
O	slept
O	,
O	about
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	,
O	he
O	awoke
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	cave
O	to
O	me--for
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	milking
O	my
O	goats
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	in
O	the
O	enclosure
O	just
O	by;
O	when
O	he
O	espied
O	me
O	he
O	came
O	running
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	laying
O	himself
O	down
O	again
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	possible
O	signs
O	of
O	an
O	humble
O	,
O	thankful
O	disposition
O	,
O	making
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	antic
O	gestures
O	to
O	show
O	it
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	lays
O	his
O	head
O	flat
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	close
O	to
O	my
O	foot
O	,
O	and
O	sets
O	my
O	other
O	foot
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	before;
O	and
O	after
O	this
O	made
O	all
O	the
O	signs
O	to
O	me
O	of
O	subjection
O	,
O	servitude
O	,
O	and
O	submission
O	imaginable
O	,
O	to
O	let
O	me
O	know
O	how
O	he
O	would
O	serve
O	me
O	so
O	long
O	as
O	he
O	lived
O	.
O	I
O	understood
O	him
O	in
O	many
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	him
O	know
O	I
O	was
O	very
O	well
O	pleased
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	speak
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	teach
O	him
O	to
O	speak
O	to
O	me;
O	and
O	first
O	,
O	I
O	let
O	him
O	know
O	his
O	name
O	should
O	be
O	Friday
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	day
O	I
O	saved
O	his
O	life:
O	I
O	called
O	him
O	so
O	for
O	the
O	memory
O	of
O	the
O	time
O	.
O	I
O	likewise
O	taught
O	him
O	to
O	say
O	Master
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	let
O	him
O	know
O	that
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	my
O	name;
O	I
O	likewise
O	taught
O	him
O	to
O	say
O	yes
O	and
O	no
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	know
O	the
O	meaning
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	I
O	gave
O	him
O	some
O	milk
O	in
O	an
O	earthen
O	pot
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	him
O	see
O	me
O	drink
O	it
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	sop
O	my
O	bread
O	in
O	it;
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	cake
O	of
O	bread
O	to
O	do
O	the
O	like
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	quickly
O	complied
O	with
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	signs
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	good
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	I
O	kept
O	there
O	with
O	him
O	all
O	that
O	night;
O	but
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	day
O	I
O	beckoned
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	come
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	him
O	know
O	I
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	some
O	clothes;
O	at
O	which
O	he
O	seemed
O	very
O	glad
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	stark
O	naked
O	.
O	As
O	we
O	went
O	by
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	buried
O	the
O	two
O	men
O	,
O	he
O	pointed
O	exactly
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	me
O	the
O	marks
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	to
O	find
O	them
O	again
O	,
O	making
O	signs
O	to
O	me
O	that
O	we
O	should
O	dig
O	them
O	up
O	again
O	and
O	eat
O	them
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	I
O	appeared
O	very
O	angry
O	,
O	expressed
O	my
O	abhorrence
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	made
O	as
O	if
O	I
O	would
O	vomit
O	at
O	the
O	thoughts
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	beckoned
O	with
O	my
O	hand
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	come
O	away
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	did
O	immediately
O	,
O	with
O	great
O	submission
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	led
O	him
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	hill
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	his
O	enemies
O	were
O	gone;
O	and
O	pulling
O	out
O	my
O	glass
O	I
O	looked
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	plainly
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	,
O	but
O	no
O	appearance
O	of
O	them
O	or
O	their
O	canoes;
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	plain
O	they
O	were
O	gone
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	left
O	their
O	two
O	comrades
O	behind
O	them
O	,
O	without
O	any
O	search
O	after
O	them
O	.
O	We
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	our
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	I
O	fell
O	to
O	work
O	for
O	my
O	man
O	Friday;
O	and
O	first
O	of
O	all
O	I
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	linen
O	drawers
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	poor
O	gunner
O	'
O	s
O	chest
O	I
O	mentioned
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	in
O	the
O	wreck
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	little
O	alteration
O	,
O	fitted
O	him
O	very
O	well;
O	and
O	then
O	I
O	made
O	him
O	a
O	jerkin
O	of
O	goat
O	'
O	s
O	skin
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	my
O	skill
O	would
O	allow
O	(
O	for
O	I
O	was
O	now
O	grown
O	a
O	tolerably
O	good
O	tailor
O	)
O	;
O	and
O	I
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	cap
O	which
O	I
O	made
O	of
O	hare
O	'
O	s
O	skin
O	,
O	very
O	convenient
O	,
O	and
O	fashionable
O	enough;
O	and
O	thus
O	he
O	was
O	clothed
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	present
O	,
O	tolerably
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	mighty
O	well
O	pleased
O	to
O	see
O	himself
O	almost
O	as
O	well
O	clothed
O	as
O	his
O	master
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	true
O	he
O	went
O	awkwardly
O	in
O	these
O	clothes
O	at
O	first:
O	wearing
O	the
O	drawers
O	was
O	very
O	awkward
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sleeves
O	of
O	the
O	waistcoat
O	galled
O	his
O	shoulders
O	and
O	the
O	inside
O	of
O	his
O	arms;
O	but
O	a
O	little
O	easing
O	them
O	where
O	he
O	complained
O	they
O	hurt
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	using
O	himself
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	to
O	them
O	at
O	length
O	very
O	well
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	after
O	I
O	came
O	home
O	to
O	my
O	hutch
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	consider
O	where
O	I
O	should
O	lodge
O	him;
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	might
O	do
O	well
O	for
O	him
O	and
O	yet
O	be
O	perfectly
O	easy
O	myself
O	,
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	little
O	tent
O	for
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	vacant
O	place
O	between
O	my
O	two
O	fortifications
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	inside
O	of
O	the
O	last
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	outside
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	.
O	As
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	door
O	or
O	entrance
O	there
O	into
O	my
O	cave
O	,
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	formal
O	framed
O	door-case
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	door
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	of
O	boards
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	it
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	passage
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	within
O	the
O	entrance;
O	and
O	,
O	causing
O	the
O	door
O	to
O	open
O	in
O	the
O	inside
O	,
O	I
O	barred
O	it
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	taking
O	in
O	my
O	ladders
O	,
O	too;
O	so
O	that
O	Friday
O	could
O	no
O	way
O	come
O	at
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	inside
O	of
O	my
O	innermost
O	wall
O	without
O	making
O	so
O	much
O	noise
O	in
O	getting
O	over
O	that
O	it
O	must
O	needs
O	awaken
O	me;
O	for
O	my
O	first
O	wall
O	had
O	now
O	a
O	complete
O	roof
O	over
O	it
O	of
O	long
O	poles
O	,
O	covering
O	all
O	my
O	tent
O	,
O	and
O	leaning
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	hill;
O	which
O	was
O	again
O	laid
O	across
O	with
O	smaller
O	sticks
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	laths
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	thatched
O	over
O	a
O	great
O	thickness
O	with
O	the
O	rice-straw
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	strong
O	,
O	like
O	reeds;
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	hole
O	or
O	place
O	which
O	was
O	left
O	to
O	go
O	in
O	or
O	out
O	by
O	the
O	ladder
O	I
O	had
O	placed
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	trap-door
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	attempted
O	on
O	the
O	outside
O	,
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	opened
O	at
O	all
O	,
O	but
O	would
O	have
O	fallen
O	down
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	.
O	As
O	to
O	weapons
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	them
O	all
O	into
O	my
O	side
O	every
O	night
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	needed
O	none
O	of
O	all
O	this
O	precaution;
O	for
O	never
O	man
O	had
O	a
O	more
O	faithful
O	,
O	loving
O	,
O	sincere
O	servant
O	than
O	Friday
O	was
O	to
O	me;
O	without
O	passions
O	,
O	sullenness
O	,
O	or
O	designs
O	,
O	perfectly
O	obliged
O	and
O	engaged;
O	his
O	very
O	affections
O	were
O	tied
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	like
O	those
O	of
O	a
O	child
O	to
O	a
O	father
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	dare
O	say
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	sacrificed
O	his
O	life
O	to
O	save
O	mine
O	upon
O	any
O	occasion
O	whatsoever;
O	the
O	many
O	testimonies
O	he
O	gave
O	me
O	of
O	this
O	put
O	it
O	out
O	of
O	doubt
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	convinced
O	me
O	that
O	I
O	needed
O	to
O	use
O	no
O	precautions
O	for
O	my
O	safety
O	on
O	his
O	account
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	greatly
O	delighted
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	it
O	my
O	business
O	to
O	teach
O	him
O	everything
O	that
O	was
O	proper
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	useful
O	,
O	handy
O	,
O	and
O	helpful;
O	but
O	especially
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	speak
O	,
O	and
O	understand
O	me
O	when
O	I
O	spoke;
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	aptest
O	scholar
O	that
O	ever
O	was;
O	and
O	particularly
O	was
O	so
O	merry
O	,
O	so
O	constantly
O	diligent
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	pleased
O	when
O	he
O	could
O	but
O	understand
O	me
O	,
O	or
O	make
O	me
O	understand
O	him
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	pleasant
O	to
O	me
O	to
O	talk
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	Now
O	my
O	life
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	easy
O	that
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	say
O	to
O	myself
O	that
O	could
O	I
O	but
O	have
O	been
O	safe
O	from
O	more
O	savages
O	,
O	I
O	cared
O	not
O	if
O	I
O	was
O	never
O	to
O	remove
O	from
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	lived
O	.
