O	It
O	was
O	about
O	nine
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	when
O	the
O	ship
O	first
O	appeared
O	.
O	At
O	once
O	there
O	was
O	the
O	greatest
O	excitement
O	in
O	the
O	village
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	British
O	warship
O	.
O	What
O	would
O	she
O	do
O	?
O	Would
O	she
O	tack
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	bay
O	to
O	pick
O	up
O	stray
O	coasters
O	as
O	prizes
O	,
O	or
O	would
O	she
O	land
O	soldiers
O	to
O	burn
O	the
O	town
O	?
O	In
O	either
O	case
O	there
O	would
O	be
O	trouble
O	enough
O	.
O	Those
O	were
O	sad
O	days
O	,
O	those
O	old
O	war-times
O	in
O	1812
O	.
O	The
O	sight
O	of
O	a
O	British
O	warship
O	in
O	Boston
O	Bay
O	was
O	not
O	pleasant
O	.
O	We
O	were
O	poor
O	then
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	no
O	monitors
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	and
O	sink
O	the
O	enemy
O	or
O	drive
O	him
O	off
O	.
O	Our
O	navy
O	was
O	small
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	though
O	we
O	afterwards
O	had
O	the
O	victory
O	and
O	sent
O	the
O	troublesome
O	ships
O	away
O	,
O	never
O	to
O	return
O	,
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	they
O	often
O	came
O	near
O	enough
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	good
O	people
O	in
O	the
O	little
O	village
O	of
O	Scituate
O	Harbor
O	were
O	in
O	great
O	distress
O	over
O	the
O	strange
O	ship
O	that
O	had
O	appeared
O	at
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	harbor
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	fishing-place
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	harbor
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	smacks
O	and
O	boats
O	of
O	all
O	kinds
O	.
O	The
O	soldiers
O	could
O	easily
O	enter
O	the
O	harbor
O	and
O	burn
O	up
O	,
O	everything
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	one
O	could
O	prevent
O	them
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	men
O	enough
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	good
O	fight
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	poorly
O	armed
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	nothing
O	but
O	fowling-pieces
O	and
O	shotguns
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	soldiers
O	had
O	muskets
O	and
O	cannon
O	.
O	The
O	tide
O	was
O	down
O	during
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	danger
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	hours;
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	went
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	cliffs
O	and
O	beaches
O	to
O	watch
O	the
O	ship
O	and
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	would
O	happen
O	next
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	low
O	,
O	sandy
O	spit
O	that
O	makes
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	harbor
O	,
O	stood
O	the
O	little
O	white
O	tower
O	known
O	as
O	Scituate
O	Light
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	house
O	behind
O	the
O	light
O	lived
O	the
O	keeper
O	'
O	s
O	family
O	,
O	consisting
O	of
O	himself
O	,
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	several
O	boys
O	and
O	girls
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	time
O	the
O	ship
O	appeared
O	,
O	the
O	keeper
O	was
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	one
O	at
O	home
O	save
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Bates
O	,
O	the
O	eldest
O	daughter
O	,
O	Rebecca
O	,
O	about
O	fourteen
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	boys
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	young
O	girl
O	named
O	Sarah
O	Winsor
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	visiting
O	Rebecca
O	.
O	Rebecca
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	first
O	to
O	discover
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	while
O	she
O	was
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	light-house
O	tower
O	polishing
O	the
O	reflector
O	.
O	She
O	at
O	once
O	descended
O	the
O	steep
O	stairs
O	and
O	sent
O	off
O	the
O	boys
O	to
O	the
O	village
O	to
O	give
O	the
O	alarm
O	.
O	For
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	two
O	,
O	the
O	ship
O	tacked
O	and
O	stood
O	off
O	to
O	sea
O	,
O	then
O	tacked
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	for
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	Men
O	,
O	women
O	and
O	children
O	watched
O	her
O	with
O	anxious
O	interest
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	tide
O	turned
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	flow
O	into
O	the
O	harbor
O	.
O	The
O	boats
O	aground
O	on
O	the
O	flats
O	floated
O	,
O	and
O	those
O	in
O	deep
O	water
O	swung
O	round
O	at
O	their
O	moorings
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	soldiers
O	would
O	probably
O	land
O	.
O	If
O	the
O	people
O	meant
O	to
O	save
O	anything
O	it
O	was
O	time
O	to
O	be
O	stirring
O	.
O	Boats
O	were
O	hastily
O	put
O	out
O	from
O	the
O	wharf
O	,
O	and
O	such
O	clothing
O	,
O	nets
O	and
O	other
O	valuables
O	as
O	could
O	be
O	handled
O	were
O	brought
O	ashore
O	,
O	loaded
O	into
O	hay
O	carts
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	away
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	of
O	no
O	use
O	to
O	resist
O	.
O	The
O	soldiers
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	were
O	well
O	armed
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	the
O	people
O	made
O	a
O	stand
O	among
O	the
O	houses
O	,
O	that
O	would
O	not
O	prevent
O	the
O	enemy
O	from
O	destroying
O	the
O	shipping
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	tide
O	spread
O	out
O	over
O	the
O	sandy
O	flats
O	it
O	filled
O	the
O	harbor
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	a
O	small
O	channel
O	,
O	it
O	became
O	a
O	wide
O	and
O	beautiful
O	bay
O	.
O	The
O	day
O	was
O	fine
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	gentle
O	breeze
O	rippling
O	the
O	water
O	and
O	making
O	it
O	sparkle
O	in
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	What
O	a
O	splendid
O	day
O	for
O	fishing
O	or
O	sailing
O	!
O	Not
O	much
O	use
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	either
O	while
O	that
O	warship
O	crossed
O	and
O	recrossed
O	before
O	the
O	harbor
O	mouth
O	.
O	About
O	two
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	the
O	tide
O	reached
O	high
O	water
O	mark
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	dismay
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	the
O	ship
O	let
O	go
O	her
O	anchor
O	,
O	swung
O	her
O	yards
O	round
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	quiet
O	about
O	half-a-mile
O	from
O	the
O	first
O	cliff
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	going
O	to
O	land
O	to
O	burn
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	With
O	their
O	spy-glass
O	the
O	people
O	could
O	see
O	the
O	boats
O	lowered
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	soldiers
O	ashore
O	.
O	Ah
O	!
O	then
O	there
O	was
O	confusion
O	and
O	uproar
O	.
O	Every
O	horse
O	in
O	the
O	village
O	was
O	put
O	into
O	some
O	kind
O	of
O	team
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	women
O	and
O	children
O	were
O	hurried
O	off
O	to
O	the
O	woods
O	behind
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	The
O	men
O	would
O	stay
O	and
O	offer
O	as
O	brave
O	a
O	resistance
O	as
O	possible
O	.
O	Their
O	guns
O	were
O	light
O	and
O	poor
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	could
O	use
O	the
O	old
O	fish-houses
O	as
O	a
O	fort
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	make
O	a
O	brave
O	fight
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	If
O	worse
O	came
O	to
O	worse
O	,
O	they
O	could
O	at
O	least
O	retreat
O	and
O	take
O	to
O	the
O	shelter
O	of
O	the
O	woods
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	splendid
O	sight
O	.
O	Five
O	large
O	boats
O	,
O	manned
O	by
O	sailors
O	,
O	and
O	filled
O	with
O	soldiers
O	in
O	gay
O	red
O	coats
O	.
O	How
O	their
O	guns
O	glittered
O	in
O	the
O	sun
O	!
O	The
O	oars
O	all
O	moved
O	together
O	in
O	regular
O	order
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	officers
O	in
O	their
O	fine
O	uniforms
O	stood
O	up
O	to
O	direct
O	the
O	expedition
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	courageous
O	company
O	come
O	with
O	a
O	warship
O	and
O	cannon
O	to
O	fight
O	helpless
O	fishermen
O	.
O	So
O	Rebecca

O	rushed
O	these
O	two
O	young

O	,
O	bent
O	on
O	doing
O	what
O	they
O	could

O	.
O	They
O	burst
O	into
O	the

O	like
O	a
O	whirlwind
O	,
O	with
O	rosy
O	cheeks
O	and
O	flying
O	hair
O	.
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Bates
O	sat
O	sorrowfully
O	gazing
O	out

O	at
O	the
O	scene
O	of
O	destruction
O	going
O	on

O	,
O	and
O	praying

O	that

O	might

O	She
O	could

O	Son
O	and
O	husband
O	were
O	shouldering
O	their
O	poor
O	old
O	guns
O	in
O	the

O	,

O	Not
O	so
O	the
O	two
O	girls
O	.
O	They
O	meant
O	to
O	do
O	something
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	fever
O	of
O	excitement
O	,
O	they
O	got
O	the
O	drum

O	Mrs

O	did
O	not

O	them
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	slipped
O	out
O	by
O	the
O	back
O	door
O	,
O	unnoticed
O	.
O	They
O	must
O	be
O	careful
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	soldiers
O	would
O	see
O	them
O	.
O	They
O	went
O	round
O	back
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	to
O	the
O	north
O	and
O	towards
O	the
O	outside

O	,
O	and
O	then
O	turned

O	through
O	the
O	deep
O	sand
O	just
