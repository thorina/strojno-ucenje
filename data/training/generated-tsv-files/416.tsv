O	It
O	pleased
O	Darius
O	to
O	set
O	over
O	the
O	kingdom
O	an
O	hundred
O	and
O	twenty
O	princes
O	,
O	which
O	should
O	be
O	over
O	the
O	whole
O	kingdom
O	.
O	And
O	over
O	these
O	three
O	presidents;
O	of
O	whom
O	Daniel
O	was
O	first:
O	that
O	the
O	princes
O	might
O	give
O	accounts
O	unto
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	should
O	have
O	no
O	damage
O	.
O	Then
O	this
O	Daniel
O	was
O	preferred
O	above
O	the
O	presidents
O	and
O	princes
O	,
O	because
O	an
O	excellent
O	spirit
O	was
O	in
O	him;
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	thought
O	to
O	set
O	him
O	over
O	the
O	whole
O	realm
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	presidents
O	and
O	princes
O	sought
O	to
O	find
O	occasion
O	against
O	Daniel
O	concerning
O	the
O	kingdom;
O	but
O	they
O	could
O	find
O	none
O	occasion
O	nor
O	fault;
O	forasmuch
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	faithful
O	,
O	neither
O	was
O	there
O	any
O	error
O	or
O	fault
O	found
O	in
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	these
O	men
O	,
O	We
O	shall
O	not
O	find
O	any
O	occasion
O	against
O	this
O	Daniel
O	,
O	except
O	we
O	find
O	it
O	against
O	him
O	concerning
O	the
O	law
O	of
O	his
O	God
O	.
O	Then
O	these
O	presidents
O	and
O	princes
O	assembled
O	together
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	thus
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	King
O	Darius
O	,
O	live
O	for
O	ever
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	presidents
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	,
O	the
O	governors
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	princes
O	,
O	the
O	counsellors
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	captains
O	,
O	have
O	consulted
O	together
O	to
O	establish
O	a
O	royal
O	statute
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	firm
O	decree
O	,
O	that
O	whosoever
O	shall
O	ask
O	a
O	petition
O	of
O	any
O	god
O	or
O	man
O	for
O	thirty
O	days
O	,
O	save
O	of
O	thee
O	,
O	O
O	King
O	,
O	he
O	shall
O	be
O	cast
O	into
O	the
O	den
O	of
O	lions
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	O
O	King
O	,
O	establish
O	the
O	decree
O	,
O	and
O	sign
O	the
O	writing
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	be
O	not
O	changed
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	law
O	of
O	the
O	Medes
O	and
O	Persians
O	,
O	which
O	altereth
O	not
O	.
O	Wherefore
O	King
O	Darius
O	signed
O	the
O	writing
O	and
O	the
O	decree
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	Daniel
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	writing
O	was
O	signed
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	into
O	his
O	house;
O	and
O	his
O	windows
O	being
O	open
O	in
O	his
O	chamber
O	toward
O	Jerusalem
O	,
O	he
O	kneeled
O	upon
O	his
O	knees
O	three
O	times
O	a
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	prayed
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	thanks
O	before
O	his
O	God
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	aforetime
O	.
O	Then
O	these
O	men
O	assembled
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	Daniel
O	praying
O	and
O	making
O	supplication
O	before
O	his
O	God
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	came
O	near
O	,
O	and
O	spake
O	before
O	the
O	King
O	concerning
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	decree;
O	Hast
O	thou
O	not
O	signed
O	a
O	decree
O	,
O	that
O	every
O	man
O	that
O	shall
O	ask
O	a
O	petition
O	of
O	any
O	god
O	or
O	man
O	within
O	thirty
O	days
O	,
O	save
O	of
O	thee
O	,
O	O
O	King
O	,
O	shall
O	be
O	cast
O	into
O	the
O	den
O	of
O	lions
O	?
O	The
O	King
O	answered
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	The
O	thing
O	is
O	true
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	law
O	of
O	the
O	Medes
O	and
O	Persians
O	,
O	which
O	altereth
O	not
O	.
O	Then
O	answered
O	they
O	and
O	said
O	before
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	That
O	Daniel
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	of
O	the
O	children
O	of
O	the
O	captivity
O	of
O	Judah
O	,
O	regardeth
O	not
O	thee
O	,
O	O
O	King
O	,
O	nor
O	the
O	decree
O	that
O	thou
O	hast
O	signed
O	,
O	but
O	maketh
O	his
O	petition
O	three
O	times
O	a
O	day
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	these
O	words
O	,
O	was
O	sore
O	displeased
O	with
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	his
O	heart
O	on
O	Daniel
O	to
O	deliver
O	him:
O	and
O	he
O	laboured
O	till
O	the
O	going
O	down
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	to
O	deliver
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	these
O	men
O	assembled
O	unto
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	unto
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	Know
O	,
O	O
O	King
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	law
O	of
O	the
O	Medes
O	and
O	Persians
O	is
O	,
O	That
O	no
O	decree
O	nor
O	statute
O	which
O	the
O	King
O	establisheth
O	may
O	be
O	changed
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	King
O	commanded
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	brought
O	Daniel
O	,
O	and
O	cast
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	den
O	of
O	lions
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	King
O	spake
O	and
O	said
O	unto
O	Daniel
O	,
O	Thy
O	God
O	whom
O	thou
O	servest
O	continually
O	,
O	he
O	will
O	deliver
O	thee
O	.
O	And
O	a
O	stone
O	was
O	brought
O	,
O	and
O	laid
O	upon
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	den;
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	sealed
O	it
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	signet
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	signet
O	of
O	his
O	lords;
O	that
O	the
O	purpose
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	changed
O	concerning
O	Daniel
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	King
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	passed
O	the
O	night
O	fasting:
O	neither
O	were
O	instruments
O	of
O	music
O	brought
O	before
O	him:
O	and
O	his
O	sleep
O	went
O	from
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	King
O	arose
O	very
O	early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	in
O	haste
O	unto
O	the
O	den
O	of
O	lions
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	den
O	,
O	he
O	cried
O	with
O	a
O	lamentable
O	voice
O	unto
O	Daniel:
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	spake
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	Daniel
O	,
O	O
O	Daniel
O	,
O	servant
O	of
O	the
O	living
O	God
O	,
O	is
O	thy
O	God
O	,
O	whom
O	thou
O	servest
O	continually
O	,
O	able
O	to
O	deliver
O	thee
O	from
O	the
O	lions
O	?
O	Then
O	said
O	Daniel
O	unto
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	O
O	King
O	,
O	live
O	for
O	ever
O	.
O	My
O	God
O	hath
O	sent
O	his
O	angel
O	,
O	and
O	hath
O	shut
O	the
O	lions
O	'
O	mouths
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	have
O	not
O	hurt
O	me:
O	forasmuch
O	as
O	before
O	him
O	innocency
O	was
O	found
O	in
O	me:
O	and
O	also
O	before
O	thee
O	,
O	O
O	King
O	,
O	have
O	I
O	done
O	no
O	hurt
O	.
O	Then
O	was
O	the
O	King
O	exceeding
O	glad
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	commanded
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	take
O	Daniel
O	up
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	den
O	.
O	So
O	Daniel
O	was
O	taken
O	up
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	den
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	manner
O	of
O	hurt
O	was
O	found
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	believed
O	in
O	his
O	God
O	.
