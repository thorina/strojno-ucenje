O	It
O	was
O	when
O	James
O	the
O	Sixth
O	was
O	king
O	in
O	Scotland
O	that
O	the
O	young
O	Wemyss
O	of
O	Logie
O	got
O	into
O	sore
O	trouble
O	.
O	Wemyss
O	of
O	Logie
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	courtiers;
O	a
O	tall
O	,
O	handsome
O	lad
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	favourite
O	with
O	both
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	.
O	Now
O	King
O	James
O	had
O	brought
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	Queen
O	Anne
O	,
O	across
O	the
O	sea
O	to
O	Scotland
O	.
O	Her
O	home
O	was
O	in
O	Denmark
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	,
O	a
O	royal
O	bride
O	,
O	to
O	Scotland
O	,
O	she
O	brought
O	with
O	her
O	a
O	few
O	fair
O	Danish
O	maids
O	.
O	She
O	thought
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	dull
O	in
O	her
O	new
O	home
O	unless
O	she
O	had
O	some
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	country-folk
O	around
O	her
O	.
O	Among
O	these
O	maids
O	was
O	a
O	tall
O	,
O	beautiful
O	girl
O	named
O	Margaret
O	Twynlace
O	.
O	Her
O	the
O	queen
O	loved
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	oft
O	would
O	she
O	speak
O	with
O	Margaret
O	of
O	their
O	old
O	free
O	life
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	over
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	It
O	chanced
O	on
O	a
O	day
O	that
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	was
O	in
O	attendance
O	upon
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Danish
O	maid
O	,
O	Margaret
O	Twynlace
O	,
O	in
O	waiting
O	upon
O	the
O	queen;
O	and
O	that
O	day
O	they
O	two
O	looked
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	another
O	day
O	they
O	two
O	talked
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	indeed
O	many
O	were
O	the
O	times
O	they
O	met
O	.
O	And
O	before
O	long
O	it
O	was
O	well
O	known
O	at
O	court
O	that
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	loved
O	the
O	Danish
O	maid
O	Margaret
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	marry
O	her
O	an
O	he
O	could
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	trouble
O	befell
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	seen
O	talking
O	with
O	the
O	Earl
O	of
O	Bothwell
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	a
O	traitor
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	Nor
O	was
O	it
O	alone
O	that
O	Wemyss
O	of
O	Logie
O	had
O	been
O	seen
O	to
O	speak
O	with
O	Bothwell
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	even
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	letters
O	written
O	by
O	the
O	traitor
O	in
O	his
O	room
O	at
O	Holyrood
O	.
O	No
O	sooner
O	had
O	this
O	rumour
O	reached
O	the
O	king
O	than
O	orders
O	were
O	given
O	to
O	search
O	both
O	young
O	Logie
O	himself
O	and
O	the
O	room
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	used
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	On
O	his
O	person
O	no
O	letters
O	were
O	found
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	his
O	room
O	,
O	flung
O	carelessly
O	into
O	his
O	trunk
O	,
O	lay
O	a
O	packet
O	of
O	letters
O	tied
O	and
O	sealed
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	seal
O	was
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	traitor
O	,
O	the
O	Earl
O	of
O	Bothwell
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	laird
O	was
O	taken
O	at
O	once
O	before
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	He
O	spoke
O	in
O	his
O	usual
O	fearless
O	tones
O	.
O	'
O	It
O	is
O	true
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	I
O	have
O	ofttimes
O	spoken
O	to
O	the
O	Earl
O	of
O	Bothwell
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	true
O	that
O	I
O	received
O	from
O	him
O	the
O	sealed
O	packet
O	which
O	was
O	found
O	in
O	my
O	trunk
O	.
O	But
O	of
O	that
O	which
O	is
O	written
O	in
O	the
O	packet
O	know
O	I
O	nought
O	.
O	The
O	seal
O	is
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	see
O	,
O	unbroken
O	.
O	Nor
O	knew
O	I
O	that
O	the
O	earl
O	was
O	still
O	acting
O	as
O	traitor
O	,
O	'
O	added
O	the
O	lad
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	displeasure
O	written
O	on
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	But
O	despite
O	all
O	he
O	could
O	say
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	was
O	arrested
O	as
O	a
O	traitor
O	and
O	thrown
O	into
O	prison
O	.
O	Margaret
O	Twynlace
O	with
O	her
O	own
O	eyes
O	saw
O	Sir
O	John
O	Carmichael
O	,
O	keeper
O	of
O	the
O	prison
O	,
O	turn
O	the
O	key
O	in
O	the
O	lock
O	.
O	Margaret
O	went
O	quickly
O	to
O	the
O	queen
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	did
O	she
O	neither
O	sew
O	nor
O	sing
O	.
O	She
O	sat
O	twining
O	her
O	fingers
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	,
O	while
O	she
O	cried
O	,
O	'
O	Woe
O	is
O	me
O	that
O	ever
O	I
O	was
O	born
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	ever
O	I
O	left
O	my
O	home
O	in
O	Denmark
O	.
O	I
O	would
O	I
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	then
O	Margaret
O	wept
O	bitterly
O	,
O	for
O	having
O	seen
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	,
O	she
O	loved
O	him
O	well
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	queen
O	came
O	to
O	her
O	bower
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	grieved
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	favourite
O	maid
O	in
O	tears
O	.
O	Yet
O	had
O	she
O	no
O	comfort
O	to
O	offer
O	her
O	,
O	for
O	well
O	she
O	knew
O	that
O	,
O	even
O	should
O	he
O	wish
O	it
O	,
O	little
O	power
O	had
O	the
O	king
O	to
O	save
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	queen
O	spoke
O	kindly
O	to
O	the
O	maid
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	,
O	Margaret
O	,
O	might
O	e
O	'
O	en
O	go
O	herself
O	to
O	King
O	James
O	to
O	beg
O	for
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	.
O	For
O	it
O	was
O	well
O	known
O	that
O	the
O	sentence
O	passed
O	on
O	him
O	would
O	be
O	death
O	.
O	Then
O	Margaret
O	Twynlace
O	wiped
O	from
O	her
O	face
O	all
O	traces
O	of
O	her
O	tears
O	.
O	She
O	put
O	on
O	her
O	soft
O	green
O	silk
O	gown
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	combed
O	out
O	her
O	bonny
O	yellow
O	hair
O	.
O	Thus
O	she
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	fell
O	on
O	her
O	knee
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	Why
O	,
O	May
O	Margaret
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	is
O	it
O	thou
O	?
O	What
O	dost
O	thou
O	at
O	my
O	feet
O	,
O	my
O	bonny
O	maid
O	?
O	'
O	'
O	Ah
O	,
O	sire
O	,
O	'
O	cried
O	she
O	,
O	'
O	I
O	have
O	come
O	to
O	beg
O	of
O	thee
O	a
O	boon
O	.
O	Nor
O	ever
O	since
O	I
O	came
O	over
O	the
O	sea
O	have
O	I
O	begged
O	of
O	thee
O	until
O	now
O	.
O	Give
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	beseech
O	of
O	thee
O	,
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Alas
O	,
O	May
O	Margaret
O	,
O	'
O	cried
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	cannot
O	I
O	do
O	!
O	An
O	thou
O	gavest
O	to
O	me
O	all
O	the
O	gold
O	that
O	is
O	in
O	Scotland
O	yet
O	could
O	I
O	not
O	save
O	the
O	lad
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	Margaret
O	Twynlace
O	turned
O	away
O	and
O	crept
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	queen
O	'
O	s
O	bower
O	.
O	Yet
O	now
O	no
O	tears
O	fell
O	from
O	her
O	blue
O	eyes
O	,
O	for
O	if
O	neither
O	king
O	nor
O	queen
O	could
O	help
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie
O	,
O	she
O	herself
O	would
O	save
O	him
O	from
O	death
O	.
O	She
O	would
O	wait
O	until
O	night
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	slumbered
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	she
O	would
O	carry
O	out
O	her
O	plan
O	.
O	A
O	brave
O	plan
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	for
O	Margaret
O	Twynlace
O	was
O	no
O	coward
O	maid
O	.
O	Quiet
O	and
O	patient
O	she
O	waited
O	in
O	the
O	little
O	ante-room
O	,
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	queen
O	'
O	s
O	bedchamber
O	,
O	waited
O	until
O	she
O	felt
O	sure
O	the
O	royal
O	pair
O	were
O	fast
O	asleep
O	.
O	Then
O	tripping
O	lightly
O	on
O	tiptoe
O	,
O	she
O	stole
O	into
O	the
O	bedroom
O	,
O	where
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	guessed
O	,
O	both
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	were
O	slumbering
O	sound
O	.
O	She
O	crossed
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	quiet
O	as
O	any
O	mouse
O	,
O	and
O	reached
O	the
O	toilet
O	table
O	.
O	There
O	lay
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	gold
O	comb
O	,

O	Margaret
O	,
O	still
O	on
O	tiptoe
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	ante-room
O	,
O	and
O	stood
O	,
O	her
O	breath
O	coming
O	quick
O	.

O	.
O	The
O	royal
O	pair
O	slept
O	sound
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	Then
O	downstairs
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	fled
O	Margaret
O	,
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	room
O	where
O	Sir

O	lay
O	slumbering
O	,

O	prisoner
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	Laird
O	of
O	Logie

O	Loud
O	did
O	the
O	maiden
O	knock
O	at

O	door
O	,
O	loud
O	and
O	long
O	,

O	was
O	roused
O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	John

O	out
O	to

O	the
O	gold

O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	when
O	Sir

O	had
O	opened

O	.
O	He
O	knew

O	well
O	and
O	hastened
O	to
O	do
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	will
O	,
O	rubbing
O	his
O	sleepy
O	eyes
O	the
O	while
O	,
O	and
O	muttering
O	under
O	his
O	breath
O	,
O	'
O	The
O	king

O	audience
O	at
O	strange
O	hours;
O	yet
O	must
O	his

O	be
O	obeyed
O	.
O	'
O	He
O	took
O	the
O	great
O	key
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	prison
O	door
O	.
O	Margaret
O	followed
O	close
O	,
O	her

O	,
O	not
O	wholly
O	in
O	fear
O	,

O	Sir
O	John
O	turned
O	the

O	Thus
O	in

O	of

O	whose

O	of

O	mountains
O	.
O	Farthest
O	away
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	opposite
O	the
O	moon
O	,
O	the
O	wall
O	of
O	the
O	bowl
O	appeared
O	as
O	a
O	giant
O	black
O	precipice
O	,
O	whose
O	top
O	seemed
O	to
O	reach
O	almost
O	to
O	the
O	moon-dimmed
O	stars;
O	and
O	over
O	this
O	precipice
O	a
O	broad
O	river
O	was
O	endlessly
O	pouring
O	,
O	shining
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	like
O	the
O	overflow
O	of
O	an
O	ocean
O	of
O	molten
O	silver
O	.
O	Though
O	now
O	very
O	weak
O	from
O	lack
O	of
O	food
O	,
O	and
O	dizzy
O	with
O	the
O	roaring
O	of
O	the
O	cataract
O	,
O	the
O	Prince
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	the
O	foaming
O	and
O	eddying
O	lake
O	into
O	which
O	the
O	water
O	was
O	falling
O	.
O	Great
O	was
O	his
O	surprise
O	to
O	discover
O	that
O	the
O	overflow
O	of
O	this
O	lake
O	disappeared
O	into
O	the
O	earth
O	through
O	a
O	long
O	,
O	low
O	opening
O	in
O	the
O	cliff
O	behind
O	the
O	fall
O	.
O	Greater
O	still
O	was
O	his
O	surprise
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	strange
O	many-colored
O	light
O	burning
O	within
O	the
O	cave
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	toward
O	the
O	light
O	,
O	along
O	a
O	narrow
O	beach
O	of
O	white
O	sand
O	lying
O	between
O	the
O	wall
O	of
O	the
O	cavern
O	and
O	the
O	racing
O	waters
O	of
O	the
O	mysterious
O	river
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	glow
O	came
O	from
O	a
O	magnificent
O	lantern
O	studded
O	with
O	emeralds
O	,
O	topazes
O	,
O	amethysts
O	,
O	and
O	rubies
O	,
O	which
O	hung
O	by
O	a
O	chain
O	from
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	the
O	grotto
O	.
O	Directly
O	under
O	this
O	lantern
O	,
O	drawn
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	sand
O	,
O	lay
O	a
O	little
O	boat
O	with
O	a
O	lantern
O	fastened
O	to
O	the
O	bow
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	pushed
O	the
O	boat
O	into
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	swift
O	current
O	seized
O	him
O	and
O	hurried
O	him
O	away
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	the
O	cavern
O	grew
O	higher
O	and
O	wider;
O	then
O	it
O	shrank
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	borne
O	along
O	with
O	incredible
O	speed
O	,
O	shot
O	down
O	a
O	rocky
O	passageway
O	into
O	the
O	very
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	The
O	passageway
O	broadened
O	once
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boat
O	rode
O	gently
O	through
O	monstrous
O	caves
O	whose
O	roofs
O	were
O	upheld
O	by
O	twisted
O	columns
O	taller
O	than
O	the
O	tallest
O	tree
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	times
O	when
O	all
O	was
O	so
O	still
O	that
O	the
O	Prince
O	could
O	easily
O	have
O	imagined
O	himself
O	back
O	in
O	the
O	solitude
O	of
O	the
O	mountains;
O	there
O	were
O	times
O	when
O	the
O	foaming
O	and
O	roaring
O	of
O	the
O	underground
O	river
O	grew
O	so
O	deafening
O	that
O	the
O	Prince
O	feared
O	lest
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	approaching
O	the
O	brink
O	of
O	a
O	subterranean
O	cataract
O	.
O	Many
O	hours
O	passed
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	whether
O	it
O	was
O	night
O	or
O	day
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	boat
O	was
O	gliding
O	through
O	a
O	vast
O	hall
O	,
O	he
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	awoke
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	boat
O	was
O	floating
O	on
O	the
O	black
O	,
O	glassy
O	surface
O	of
O	an
O	immense
O	underground
O	ocean
O	.
O	All
O	signs
O	of
O	the
O	cavern
O	had
O	disappeared
O	.
O	Far
O	away
O	,
O	over
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	this
O	ocean
O	,
O	a
O	strange
O	,
O	beautiful
O	glow
O	mounted
O	into
O	the
O	starless
O	sky
O	of
O	the
O	underworld
O	.
O	And
O	while
O	the
O	Prince
O	was
O	gazing
O	at
O	the
O	glow
O	,
O	the
O	boat
O	swung
O	into
O	a
O	new
O	current
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	borne
O	swiftly
O	toward
O	the
O	light
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	the
O	light
O	grew
O	so
O	wide
O	and
O	bright
O	that
O	one
O	would
O	have
O	believed
O	that
O	a
O	strange
O	,
O	golden
O	sun
O	had
O	risen
O	.
O	The
O	boat
O	passed
O	between
O	two
O	giant
O	marble
O	pillars
O	supporting
O	enormous
O	crystal
O	globes
O	filled
O	with
O	a
O	golden
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Prince
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	harbor
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	.
O	A
O	city
O	lay
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	a
O	strange
O	golden
O	city
O	edging
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	a
O	vast
O	,
O	semi-circular
O	bay
O	.
O	Because
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	there
O	is
O	neither
O	sun
O	nor
O	moon
O	,
O	the
O	people
O	have
O	to
O	be
O	continually
O	burning
O	lights;
O	and
O	so
O	many
O	and
O	so
O	great
O	were
O	the
O	lanterns
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	that
O	the
O	town
O	was
O	as
O	bright
O	as
O	day
O	.
O	The
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	harbor
O	was
O	marked
O	with
O	a
O	row
O	of
O	golden
O	lanterns;
O	there
O	were
O	immense
O	lanterns
O	at
O	every
O	six
O	paces
O	along
O	the
O	streets;
O	a
O	lantern
O	hung
O	from
O	every
O	house;
O	and
O	the
O	church-towers
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	having
O	bells
O	in
O	them
O	,
O	had
O	great
O	golden
O	lamps
O	which
O	illumined
O	everything
O	for
O	some
O	distance
O	about
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	every
O	inhabitant
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	carried
O	a
O	lantern
O	with
O	him
O	wherever
O	he
O	went
O	,
O	the
O	rich
O	carrying
O	golden
O	lanterns
O	set
O	with
O	transparent
O	precious
O	stones
O	,
O	the
O	poor
O	carrying
O	lights
O	of
O	ordinary
O	glass
O	.
O	Soon
O	the
O	Prince
O	saw
O	a
O	magnificent
O	ship
O	coming
O	out
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	prow
O	was
O	carved
O	in
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	a
O	dragon
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	beautiful
O	lantern
O	hung
O	from
O	its
O	jaws
O	.
O	Overcome
O	by
O	hunger
O	and
O	fatigue
O	,
O	the
O	poor
O	Prince
O	fell
O	insensible
O	to
O	the
O	floor
O	of
O	his
O	little
O	boat
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	senses
O	again
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	lying
O	between
O	sheets
O	of
O	the
O	whitest
O	,
O	most
O	delicate
O	linen
O	in
O	a

O	four-poster

O	,
O	in
O	a

O	in

O	.
O	Thanks
O	to
O	his
O	kind
O	hosts
O	,
O	the
O	Prince
O	soon
O	recovered
O	his
O	strength
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	was
O	completely
O	himself
O	again
O	,
O	he
O	was

O	to
O	an
O	audience

O	On

O	side
O	by
O	side
O	and
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	remember
O	just
O	which
O	one
O	was
O	the
O	talisman
O	and
O	which
O	one
O	the
O	false
O	hand
O	.
O	So
O	because
O	she
O	had
O	to
O	act
O	quickly
O	,
O	she
O	put
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	hands
O	under
O	the
O	pillow
O	,
O	brought
O	the
O	other
O	to
O	the
O	Prince
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	her
O	story
O	.
O	But
O	so
O	well
O	matched
O	were
O	the
O	little
O	hands
O	,
O	that
O	even
O	the
O	Prince
O	was
O	far
O	from
O	certain
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	got
O	his
O	own
O	hand
O	back
O	again
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	came
O	the
O	seventh
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	day
O	on
O	which
O	Dragondel
O	,
O	the
O	blue
O	dog
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	wicked
O	Enchanter
O	'
O	s
O	friends
O	were
O	to
O	sail
O	to
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	for
O	the
O	marriage
O	ceremony
O	.
O	The
O	iron
O	ship
O	,
O	made
O	gay
O	with
O	a
O	thousand
O	small
O	scarlet
O	lanterns
O	,
O	stood
O	ready
O	to
O	carry
O	them
O	over
O	.
O	The
O	Enchanter
O	and
O	his
O	company
O	got
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	vessel
O	left
O	the
O	island
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	stood
O	watching
O	the
O	ship
O	from
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	cliffs
O	.
O	What
O	anxiety
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	!
O	If
O	Dragondel
O	still
O	possessed
O	the
O	true
O	talisman
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	cross
O	the
O	whirlpool
O	safely
O	,
O	and
O	marry
O	the
O	beautiful
O	Queen
O	of
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	.
O	The
O	vessel
O	sped
O	on
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	now
O	at
O	some
O	distance
O	from
O	the
O	island
O	.
O	""""
O	All
O	is
O	lost
O	,
O	""""
O	thought
O	the
O	Prince
O	with
O	a
O	sinking
O	heart;
O	""""
O	Dragondel
O	has
O	the
O	true
O	talisman
O	.
O	""""
O	And
O	in
O	his
O	bitterness
O	he
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	throw
O	the
O	little
O	golden
O	hand
O	which
O	lay
O	in
O	his
O	pocket
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	the
O	air
O	became
O	filled
O	with
O	a
O	terrible
O	moaning;
O	the
O	sea
O	became
O	troubled;
O	the
O	whirlpool
O	awoke
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Prince
O	saw
O	the
O	red
O	lights
O	of
O	the
O	Enchanter
O	'
O	s
O	ship
O	whirled
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	,
O	faster
O	and
O	faster
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	disappeared
O	forever
O	in
O	the
O	waters
O	of
O	the
O	sunless
O	sea
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	Prince
O	,
O	he
O	soon
O	found
O	another
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	with
O	him
O	the
O	talisman
O	,
O	his
O	fellow
O	servants
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	black
O	cat
O	and
O	her
O	kittens
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	Lantern
O	Land
O	,
O	married
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	happily
O	ever
O	after
O	.
