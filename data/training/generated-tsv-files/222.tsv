O	the
O	venerable
O	dormouse
O	himself
O	undertook
O	it
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	very
O	good
O	reason
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	else
O	would
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	dormouse
O	was
O	the
O	largest
O	animal
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	stood
O	up
O	he
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	mountain
O	.
O	It
O	made
O	haste
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	sun
O	lay
O	ensnared
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	it
O	came
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	,
O	its
O	back
O	began
O	to
O	smoke
O	and
O	burn
O	with
O	the
O	heat
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	whole
O	top
O	of
O	his
O	huge
O	bulk
O	was
O	turned
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	short
O	time
O	to
O	enormous
O	heaps
O	of
O	ashes
O	.
O	It
O	succeeded
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	in
O	cutting
O	the
O	cord
O	with
O	its
O	teeth
O	and
O	freeing
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	which
O	rolled
O	up
O	again
O	,
O	as
O	round
O	and
O	beautiful
O	as
O	ever
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	wide
O	blue
O	sky
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	dormouse--or
O	blind
O	woman
O	as
O	it
O	is
O	called--was
O	shrunk
O	away
O	to
O	a
O	very
O	small
O	size;
O	and
O	that
O	is
O	the
O	reason
O	why
O	it
O	is
O	now
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	tiniest
O	creatures
O	upon
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	boy
O	returned
O	home
O	when
O	he
O	discovered
O	that
O	the
O	sun
O	had
O	escaped
O	his
O	snare
O	,
O	and
O	devoted
O	himself
O	entirely
O	to
O	hunting
O	.
