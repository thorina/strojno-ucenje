O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	a
O	hunter
O	was
O	roaming
O	through
O	the
O	wildwood
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	voice
O	crying
O	piteously
O	for
O	aid
O	.
O	Following
O	the
O	sound
O	,
O	the
O	hunter
O	plunged
O	ahead
O	,
O	and
O	discovered
O	a
O	dwarf
O	caught
O	in
O	a
O	pit
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	dug
O	to
O	trap
O	wild
O	animals
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	hunter
O	had
O	rescued
O	the
O	dwarf
O	from
O	his
O	prison
O	,
O	the
O	little
O	man
O	said
O	to
O	him:
O	""""
O	Go
O	ten
O	leagues
O	to
O	the
O	north
O	till
O	you
O	arrive
O	at
O	a
O	gigantic
O	pine;
O	then
O	turn
O	to
O	the
O	east
O	,
O	and
O	go
O	ten
O	leagues
O	more
O	till
O	you
O	come
O	to
O	a
O	black
O	castle
O	.
O	Enter
O	the
O	castle
O	without
O	fear
O	,
O	and
O	you
O	will
O	discover
O	a
O	round
O	room
O	in
O	which
O	stands
O	a
O	round
O	ebony
O	table
O	laden
O	with

O	.
O	Help

O	""""
O	So
O	the
O	hunter
O	thanked
O	the
O	dwarf
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	making
O	sure
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	plenty
O	of
O	bread
O	and
O	cheese
O	in
O	his
O	knapsack
O	,
O	hurried
O	northwards
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	his
O	legs
O	could
O	carry
O	him
O	.
O	Through
O	bramble
O	and
O	brier
O	,
O	through
O	valley
O	and
O	wooded
O	dale
O	went
O	he
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	dusk
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	gigantic
O	pine
O	standing
O	solitary
O	in
O	a
O	rocky
O	field
O	.
O	Wearied
O	with
O	his
O	long
O	journey
O	,
O	the
O	hunter
O	lay
O	down
O	beneath
O	the
O	pine
O	and
O	slept
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	dawn
O	he
O	woke
O	refreshed
O	,
O	and
O	turning
O	his
O	eyes
O	toward
O	the
O	level
O	rays
O	of
O	the
O	rising
O	sun
O	,
O	began
O	his
O	journey
O	to
O	the
O	east
O	.
O	Presently
O	he
O	reached
O	a
O	height
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	this
O	height
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	,
O	not
O	very
O	far
O	away
O	,
O	a
O	black
O	turret
O	rising
O	over
O	the
O	ocean
O	of
O	bright
O	leaves
O	.
O	At
O	high
O	noon
O	he
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	ruinous
O	and
O	quite
O	deserted;
O	grass
O	grew
O	in
O	the
O	courtyard
O	and
O	between
O	the
O	bricks
O	of
O	the
O	terrace
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	oaken
O	door
O	was
O	as
O	soft
O	and
O	rotten
O	as
O	a
O	log
O	that
O	has
O	long
O	been
O	buried
O	in
O	mire
O	.
O	Entering
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	the
O	hunter
O	soon
O	discovered
O	the
O	round
O	room
O	.
O	A
O	table
O	laden
O	with
O	wonderful
O	treasures
O	stood
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	of
O	the
O	chamber
O	,
O	directly
O	under
O	a
O	shower
O	of
O	sunlight
O	pouring
O	through
O	a
O	half-ruined
O	window
O	in
O	the
O	mildewed
O	wall
O	.
O	How
O	the
O	diamonds
O	and
O	precious
O	stones
O	sparkled
O	and
O	gleamed
O	!
O	Now
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	hunter
O	was
O	filling
O	his
O	pockets
O	,
O	the
O	flash
O	of
O	a
O	jewel
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	happened
O	to
O	catch
O	his
O	eye
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	down
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	trail
O	of
O	jewels
O	lay
O	along
O	the
O	floor
O	leading
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	Following
O	the
O	scattered
O	gems
O	,
O	--which
O	had
O	the
O	appearance
O	of
O	having
O	been
O	spilled
O	from
O	some
O	treasure-casket
O	heaped
O	too
O	high
O	,
O	--the
O	hunter
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	low
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	opening
O	this
O	door
O	,
O	he
O	discovered
O	a
O	flight
O	of
O	stone
O	steps
O	leading
O	to
O	the
O	turret
O	.
O	The
O	steps
O	were
O	strewn
O	carelessly
O	with
O	the
O	finest
O	emeralds
O	,
O	topazes
O	,
O	beryls
O	,
O	moonstones
O	,
O	rubies
O	,
O	and
O	crystal
O	diamonds
O	.
O	Remembering
O	the
O	counsel
O	of
O	his
O	friend
O	the
O	dwarf
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	hunter
O	did
O	not
O	go
O	up
O	the
O	stairs
O	,
O	but
O	hurried
O	home
O	with
O	his
O	treasure
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	hunter
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	country
O	,
O	the
O	wonderful
O	treasures
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	from
O	the
O	castle
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	made
O	him
O	a
O	very
O	rich
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	the
O	news
O	of
O	his
O	prosperity
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	ears
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	This
O	King
O	was
O	the
O	wickedest
O	of
O	rogues
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	two
O	best
O	friends
O	,
O	the
O	Chamberlain
O	and
O	the
O	Chancellor
O	,
O	were
O	every
O	bit
O	as
O	unscrupulous
O	as
O	he
O	.
O	They
O	oppressed
O	the
O	people
O	with
O	taxes
O	,
O	they
O	stole
O	from
O	the
O	poor
O	,
O	they
O	robbed
O	the
O	churches;
O	indeed
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	injustice
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	ready
O	to
O	commit
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	Chamberlain
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	hunter
O	'
O	s
O	wealth
O	,
O	he--being
O	a
O	direct
O	,
O	straightforward
O	rascal--declared
O	that
O	the
O	simplest
O	thing
O	to
O	do
O	would
O	be
O	to
O	kill
O	the
O	hunter
O	and
O	take
O	his
O	money
O	.
O	The
O	Chancellor
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	somewhat
O	more
O	cunning
O	and
O	worldly
O	,
O	declared
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	better
O	to
O	throw
O	the
O	hunter
O	into
O	a
O	foul
O	,
O	dark
O	dungeon
O	till
O	he
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	buy
O	his
O	freedom
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	wealth
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	wickedest
O	and
O	wisest
O	of
O	the
O	precious
O	three
O	,
O	declared
O	that
O	the
O	best
O	thing
O	to
O	do
O	was
O	to
O	find
O	out
O	whence
O	the
O	hunter
O	had
O	got
O	his
O	treasure
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	there
O	happened
O	to
O	be
O	any
O	left
O	,
O	they
O	could
O	go
O	and
O	get
O	it
O	.
O	Then
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	they
O	could
O	kill
O	the
O	hunter
O	and
O	take
O	his
O	treasure
O	too
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	by
O	a
O	royal
O	order
O	the
O	hunter
O	was
O	thrown
O	into
O	a
O	horrible
O	prison
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	that
O	his
O	only
O	hope
O	of
O	release
O	lay
O	in
O	revealing
O	the
O	origin
O	of
O	his
O	riches
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	slowly
O	starved
O	and
O	cruelly
O	beaten
O	,
O	he
O	told
O	of
O	the
O	treasure
O	castle
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	following
O	morning
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	the
O	Chamberlain
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Chancellor
O	,
O	taking
O	with
O	them
O	some
O	strong
O	linen
O	bags
O	and
O	some
O	pack
O	mules
O	,
O	rode
O	forth
O	in
O	quest
O	of
O	the
O	treasure
O	.
O	Great
O	was
O	their
O	joy
O	when
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	treasure
O	castle
O	and
O	the
O	treasure
O	room
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	hunter
O	had
O	described
O	.
O	The
O	Chancellor
O	poured
O	the
O	shining
O	gems
O	through
O	his
O	claw-like
O	fingers
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	the
O	Chamberlain
O	threw
O	their
O	arms
O	around
O	each
O	others
O	'
O	shoulders
O	and
O	danced
O	a
O	jig
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	their
O	age
O	and
O	dignity
O	would
O	permit
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	fine
O	careless
O	rapture
O	over
O	,
O	they
O	began
O	pouring
O	the
O	treasure
O	into
O	the
O	linen
O	sacks
O	they
O	had
O	brought
O	with

O	to
O	the
O	brim
O	,
O	they
O	carried
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	door
O	.
O	Soon
O	not
O	the
O	tiniest
O	gem
O	was
O	left
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	.
O	Suddenly
