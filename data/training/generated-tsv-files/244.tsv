O	Bokwewa
O	and
O	his
O	brother
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	far-off
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	By
O	such
O	as
O	had
O	knowledge
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	Bokwewa
O	,
O	the
O	elder
O	,
O	although
O	deformed
O	and
O	feeble
O	of
O	person
O	,
O	was
O	considered
O	a
O	manito
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	assumed
O	the
O	mortal
O	shape;
O	while
O	his
O	younger
O	brother
O	,
O	Kwasynd
O	,
O	manly
O	in
O	appearance
O	,
O	active
O	,
O	and
O	strong
O	,
O	partook
O	of
O	the
O	nature
O	of
O	the
O	present
O	race
O	of
O	beings
O	.
O	They
O	lived
O	off
O	the
O	path
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	wild
O	,
O	lonesome
O	place
O	,
O	far
O	retired
O	from
O	neighbors
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	undisturbed
O	by
O	cares
O	,
O	they
O	passed
O	their
O	time
O	,
O	content
O	and
O	happy
O	.
O	The
O	days
O	glided
O	by
O	serenely
O	as
O	the
O	river
O	that
O	flowed
O	by
O	their
O	lodge
O	.
O	Owing
O	to
O	his
O	lack
O	of
O	strength
O	,
O	Bokwewa
O	never
O	engaged
O	in
O	the
O	chase
O	,
O	but
O	gave
O	his
O	attention
O	entirely
O	to
O	the
O	affairs
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	long
O	winter
O	evenings
O	he
O	passed
O	the
O	time
O	in
O	telling
O	his
O	brother
O	stories
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	,
O	spirits
O	,
O	weendigoes
O	,
O	and
O	fairies
O	of
O	the
O	elder
O	age
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	the
O	exclusive
O	charge
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	He
O	also
O	at
O	times
O	taught
O	his
O	brother
O	the
O	manner
O	in
O	which
O	game
O	should
O	be
O	pursued
O	,
O	pointed
O	out
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	ways
O	of
O	the
O	different
O	beasts
O	and
O	birds
O	of
O	the
O	chase
O	,
O	and
O	assigned
O	the
O	seasons
O	at
O	which
O	they
O	could
O	be
O	hunted
O	with
O	most
O	success
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	while
O	the
O	brother
O	was
O	eager
O	to
O	learn
O	,
O	and
O	keenly
O	attended
O	to
O	his
O	duties
O	as
O	the
O	provider
O	of
O	the
O	lodge;
O	but
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	grew
O	weary
O	of
O	their
O	tranquil
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	desire
O	to
O	show
O	himself
O	among
O	men
O	.
O	He
O	became
O	restive
O	in
O	their
O	retirement
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	seized
O	with
O	a
O	longing
O	to
O	visit
O	remote
O	places
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	Kwasynd
O	told
O	his
O	brother
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	leave
O	him;
O	that
O	he
O	wished
O	to

O	the
O	habitations

O	to

O	a

O	.
O	Bokwewa
O	objected;
O	but
O	his
O	brother
O	overruled
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	every
O	remonstrance
O	,

O	departed
O	on

O	traveled

O	Bokwewa

O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	sought
O	to
O	render
O	his

O	He
O	was
O	ever

O	But
O	the

O	greatly

O	,
O	when
O	the

O	passed
O	,
O	payed
O	little
O	heed

O	discourse;
O	he
O	was
O	engrossed

O	and
O	chose
O	rather

O	As

O	met

O	One
O	man
O	stopped
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	complained
O	of
O	the
O	weary
O	load
O	he
O	was
O	carrying
O	.
O	Another
O	offered
O	him
O	a
O	kettle;
O	another
O	his
O	bow
O	and
O	arrows;
O	but
O	he
O	declined
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	free
O	of
O	foot
O	,
O	hastened
O	on
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	he
O	met
O	women
O	who
O	were
O	carrying
O	their
O	basket-work
O	,
O	and
O	painted
O	paddles

O	.
O	With
O	this

O	throng
O	,
O	Bokwewa
O	was
O	borne
O	along
O	for
O	two
O	days
O	and
O	nights
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	arrived
O	at
