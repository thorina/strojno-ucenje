O	While

O	designs
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	first
O	,
O	by

O	the

O	make
O	a
O	waft

O	all

O	proved
O	fruitless
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	boat
O	did
O	not

O	After
O	they
O	had
O	mused
O	a
O	while
O	upon
O	this

O	set
O	up
O	two

O	all
O	was
O	to
O	no

O	Then
O	they
O	came
O	all
O	close

O	the
O	echoes
O	made
O	the
O	woods
O	ring
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	one;
O	those
O	in

O	heard
O	it
O	well
O	enough
O	,
O	yet
O	durst
O	give
O	no
O	answer
O	to

O	.
O	They
O	were

O	this
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	told
O	us
O	afterwards
O	,
O	they
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	all
O	on
O	board
O	again
O	to
O	their
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	let

O	were
O	all
O	murdered
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	long-
O	boat
O	staved;
O	accordingly
O	,
O	they
O	immediately
O	launched
O	their
O	boat
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	all
O	of
O	them
O	on
O	board
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	was
O	terribly
O	amazed
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	confounded
O	,
O	at
O	this
O	,
O	believing
O	they
O	would
O	go
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	ship
O	again
O	and
O	set
O	sail
O	,
O	giving
O	their
O	comrades
O	over
O	for
O	lost
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	he
O	should
O	still
O	lose
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	hopes

O	he
O	was
O	quickly
O	as
O	much
O	frightened
O	the
O	other
O	way
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	long
O	put
O	off
O	the

O	measure
O	in
O	their
O	conduct
O	,
O	which
O	it
O	seems
O	they
O	consulted
O	together
O	upon
O	,
O	viz
O	.
O	,
O	to
O	leave
O	three
O	men
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rest
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	go
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	country
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	their
O	fellows
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	disappointment
O	to
O	us
O	,
O	for
O	now
O	we
O	were
O	at
O	a
O	loss
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	as
O	our
O	seizing
O	those
O	seven
O	men
O	on
O	shore
O	would
O	be
O	no
O	advantage
O	to
O	us
O	if
O	we
O	let
O	the
O	boat
O	escape;
O	because
O	they
O	would
O	row
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	them
O	would
O	be
O	sure
O	to
O	weigh
O	and
O	set
O	sail
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	our
O	recovering
O	the
O	ship
O	would
O	be
O	lost
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	we
O	had
O	no
O	remedy
O	but
O	to
O	wait
O	and
O	see
O	what
O	the
O	issue
O	of
O	things
O	might
O	present
O	.
O	The
O	seven
O	men
O	came
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	three
O	who
O	remained
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	put
O	her
O	off
O	to
O	a
O	good
O	distance
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	an
O	anchor
O	to
O	wait
O	for
O	them;
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	impossible
O	for
O	us
O	to
O	come
O	at
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	.
O	Those
O	that
O	came
O	on
O	shore
O	kept
O	close
O	together
O	,
O	marching
O	towards
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	hill
O	under
O	which
O	my
O	habitation
O	lay;
O	and
O	we
O	could
O	see
O	them
O	plainly
O	,
O	though
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	perceive
O	us
O	.
O	We
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	very
O	glad
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	come
O	nearer
O	us
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	we
O	might
O	have
O	fired
O	at
O	them
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	gone
O	farther
O	off
O	,
O	that
O	we
O	might
O	come
O	abroad
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	brow
O	of
O	the
O	hill
O	where
O	they
O	could
O	see
O	a
O	great
O	way
O	into
O	the
O	valleys
O	and
O	woods
O	,
O	which
O	lay
O	towards
O	the
O	northeast
O	part
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	the
O	island
O	lay
O	lowest
O	,
O	they
O	shouted
O	and
O	hallooed
O	till
O	they
O	were
O	weary;
O	and
O	not
O	caring
O	,
O	it
O	seems
O	,
O	to
O	venture
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	nor
O	far
O	from
O	one
O	another
O	,
O	they
O	sat
O	down
O	together
O	under
O	a
O	tree
O	to
O	consider
O	it
O	.
O	Had
O	they
O	thought
O	fit
O	to
O	have
O	gone
O	to
O	sleep
O	there
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	other
O	part
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	done
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	done
O	the
O	job
O	for
O	us;
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	too
O	full
O	of
O	apprehensions
O	of
O	danger
O	to
O	venture
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	sleep
O	,
O	though
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	what
O	the
O	danger
O	was
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	fear
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	made
O	a
O	very
O	just
O	proposal
O	to
O	me
O	upon
O	this
O	consultation
O	of
O	theirs
O	,
O	viz
O	.
O	,
O	that
O	perhaps
O	they
O	would
O	all
O	fire
O	a
O	volley
O	again
O	,
O	to
O	endeavor
O	to
O	make
O	their
O	fellows
O	hear
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	we
O	should
O	all
O	sally
O	upon
O	them
O	just
O	at
O	the
O	juncture
O	when
O	their
O	pieces
O	were
O	all
O	discharged
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	would
O	certainly
O	yield
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	should
O	have
O	them
O	without
O	bloodshed
O	.
O	I
O	liked
O	this
O	proposal
O	,
O	provided
O	it
O	was
O	done
O	while
O	we
O	were
O	near
O	enough
O	to
O	come
O	up
O	to
O	them
O	before
O	they
O	could
O	load
O	their
O	pieces
O	again
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	event
O	did
O	not
O	happen;
O	and
O	we
O	lay
O	still
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	,
O	very
O	irresolute
O	what
O	course
O	to
O	take
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	I
O	told
O	them
O	there
O	would
O	be
O	nothing
O	done
O	,
O	in
O	my
O	opinion
O	,
O	till
O	night;
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	perhaps
O	we
O	might
O	find
O	a
O	way
O	to
O	get
O	between
O	them
O	and
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	might
O	use
O	some
O	stratagem
O	with
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	to
O	get
O	them
O	on
O	shore
O	.
O	We
O	waited
O	a
O	great
O	while
O	,
O	though
O	very
O	impatient
O	for
O	their
O	removing;
O	and
O	were
O	very
O	uneasy
O	when
O	,
O	after
O	long
O	consultation
O	,
O	we
O	saw
O	them
O	all
O	start
O	up
O	and
O	march
O	down
O	towards
O	the
O	sea;
O	it
O	seems
O	they
O	had
O	such
O	dreadful
O	apprehension
O	of
O	the
O	danger
O	of
O	the
O	place
O	that
O	they
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	,
O	ship
O	again
O	,
O	give
O	their
O	companions
O	over
O	for
O	lost
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	go
O	on
O	with
O	their
O	intended
O	voyage
O	with
O	the
O	ship
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	I
O	perceived
O	them
O	go
O	towards
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	I
O	imagined
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	as
O	it
O	really
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	given
O	over
O	their
O	search
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	going
O	back
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	I
O	told
O	him
O	my
O	thoughts
O	,
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	sink
O	at
O	the
O	apprehensions
O	of
O	it;
O	but
O	I
O	presently
O	thought
O	of
O	a
O	stratagem
O	to
O	fetch
O	them
O	back
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	answered
O	my
O	end
O	to
O	a
O	title
O	.
O	I
O	ordered
O	Friday
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	'
O	s
O	mate
O	to
O	go
O	over
O	the
O	little
O	creek
O	westward
O	,
O	towards
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	savages
O	came
O	on
O	shore
O	when
O	Friday
O	was
O	rescued
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	rising
O	ground
O	,
O	at
O	about
O	half
O	a
O	mile
O	distant
O	,
O	I
O	bid
O	them
O	halloo
O	out
O	,
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	wait
O	till
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	seamen
O	heard
O	them;
O	that
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	ever
O	they
O	heard
O	the
O	seamen
O	answer
O	them
O	,
O	they
O	should
O	return
O	it
O	again;
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	keeping
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	,
O	take
O	a
O	round
O	,
O	always
O	answering
O	when
O	the
O	others
O	hallooed
O	,
O	to
O	draw
O	them
O	as
O	far
O	into
O	the
O	island
O	and
O	among
O	the
O	woods
O	as
O	possible
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	wheel
O	about
O	again
O	to
O	me
O	by
O	such
O	ways
O	as
O	I
O	directed
O	them
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	just
O	going
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	when
O	Friday
O	and
O	the
O	mate
O	hallooed;
O	and
O	they
O	presently
O	heard
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	answering
O	ran
O	along
O	the
O	shore
O	westward
O	,
O	towards
O	the
O	voice
O	they
O	heard
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	stopped
O	by
O	the
O	creek
O	,
O	where
O	,
O	the
O	water
O	being
O	up
O	,
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	over
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	for
O	the
O	boat
O	to
O	come
O	up
O	and
O	set
O	them
O	over;
O	as
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	I
O	expected
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	set
O	themselves
O	over
O	,
O	I
O	observed
O	that
O	the
O	boat
O	being
O	gone
O	a
O	good
O	way
O	into
O	the
O	creek
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	harbor
O	within
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	they
O	took
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	three
O	men
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	,
O	to
O	go
O	along
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	only
O	two
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	having
O	fastened
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	stump
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	tree
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	what
O	I
O	wished
O	for
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	immediately
O	leaving
O	Friday
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	'
O	s
O	mate
O	to
O	their
O	business
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	the
O	rest
O	with
O	me;
O	and
O	,
O	crossing
O	the
O	creek
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	sight
O	,
O	we
O	surprised
O	the
O	two
O	men
O	before
O	they
O	were
O	aware--one
O	of
O	them
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	being
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	.
O	The
O	fellow
O	on
O	shore
O	was
O	between
O	sleeping
O	and
O	waking
O	,
O	and
O	going
O	to
O	start
O	up;
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	foremost
O	,
O	ran
O	in
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	knocked
O	him
O	down;
O	and
O	then
O	called
O	out
O	to
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	to
O	yield
O	,
O	or
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	dead
O	man
O	.
O	They
O	needed
O	very
O	few
O	arguments
O	to
O	persuade
O	a
O	single
O	man
O	to
O	yield
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	five
O	men
O	upon
O	him
O	and
O	his
O	comrade
O	knocked
O	down;
O	besides
O	,
O	this
O	was
O	,
O	it
O	seems
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	three
O	who
O	were
O	not
O	so
O	hearty
O	in
O	the
O	mutiny
O	as
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	crew
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	was
O	easily
O	persuaded
O	not
O	only
O	to
O	yield
O	,
O	but
O	afterwards
O	to
O	join
O	very
O	sincerely
O	with
O	us
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	,
O	Friday
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	'
O	s
O	mate
O	so
O	well
O	managed
O	their
O	business
O	with
O	the
O	rest
O	that
O	they
O	drew
O	them
O	,
O	by
O	hallooing
O	and
O	answering
O	from
O	one
O	hill
O	to
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	one
O	wood
O	to
O	another
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	not
O	only
O	heartily
O	tired
O	them
O	,
O	but
O	left
O	them
O	where
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	very
O	sure
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	reach
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	boat
O	before
O	it
O	was
O	dark;
O	and
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	heartily
O	tired
O	themselves
O	also
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	time
O	they
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	us
O	.
O	We
O	had
O	nothing
O	now
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	to
O	watch
O	for
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	fall
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	make
O	sure
O	work
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	several
O	hours
O	after
O	Friday
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	me
O	before
O	they
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	their
O	boat;
O	and
O	we
O	could
O	hear
O	the
O	foremost
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	long
O	before
O	they
O	came
O	quite
O	up
O	,
O	calling
O	to
O	those
O	behind
O	to
O	come
O	along
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	also
O	hear
O	them
O	answer
O	,
O	and
O	complain
O	how
O	lame
O	and
O	tired
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	come
O	any
O	faster
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	very
O	welcome
O	news
O	to
O	us
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	they
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	boat;
O	but
O	it
O	is
O	impossible
O	to
O	express
O	their
O	confusion
O	when
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	boat
O	fast
O	aground
O	in
O	the
O	creek
O	,
O	the
O	tide
O	ebbed
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	two
O	men
O	gone
O	.
O	We
O	could
O	hear
O	them
O	call
O	one
O	to
O	another
O	in
O	a
O	most
O	lamentable
O	manner
O	,
O	telling
O	one
O	another
O	they
O	were
O	got
O	into
O	an
O	enchanted
O	island;
O	that
O	either
O	there
O	were
O	inhabitants
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	should
O	all
O	be
O	murdered
O	,
O	or
O	else
O	there
O	were
O	devils
O	and
O	spirits
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	should
O	be
O	all
O	carried
O	away
O	and
O	devoured
O	.
O	They
O	hallooed
O	,
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	their
O	two
O	comrades
O	by
O	their
O	names
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	times;
O	but
O	no
O	answer
O	.
O	After
O	some
O	time
O	we
O	could
O	see
O	them
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	little
O	light
O	there
O	was
O	,
O	run
O	about
O	,
O	wringing
O	their
O	hands
O	like
O	men
O	in
O	despair
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	they
O	would
O	go
O	and
O	sit
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	to
O	rest
O	themselves
O	,
O	then
O	come
O	ashore
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	walk
O	about
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	the
O	same
O	thing
O	over
O	again
O	.
O	My
O	men
O	would
O	fain
O	have
O	had
O	me
O	give
O	them
O	leave
O	to
O	fall
O	upon
O	them
O	at
O	once
O	in
O	the
O	dark;
O	but
O	I
O	was
O	willing
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	at
O	some
O	advantage
O	,
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	spare
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	kill
O	as
O	few
O	of
O	them
O	as
O	I
O	could;
O	and
O	especially
O	I
O	was
O	unwilling
O	to
O	hazard
O	the
O	killing
O	of
O	any
O	of
O	our
O	men
O	,
O	knowing
O	the
O	others
O	were
O	very
O	well
O	armed
O	.
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	wait
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	separate;
O	and
O	therefore
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	sure
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	I
O	drew
O	my
O	ambuscade
O	nearer
O	,
O	and
O	ordered
O	Friday
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	to
O	creep
O	upon
O	their
O	hands
O	and
O	feet
O	,
O	as
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	discovered
O	,
O	and
O	get
O	as
O	near
O	them
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	possibly
O	before
O	they
O	offered
O	to
O	fire
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	long
O	in
O	that
O	posture
O	when
O	the
O	boatswain
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	principal
O	ringleader
O	of
O	the
O	mutiny
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	now
O	shown
O	himself
O	the
O	most
O	dejected
O	and
O	dispirited
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	came
O	walking
O	towards
O	them
O	,
O	with
O	two
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	crew;
O	the
O	captain
O	was
O	so
O	eager
O	at
O	having
O	this
O	principal
O	rogue
O	so
O	much
O	in
O	his
O	power
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	hardly
O	have
O	patience
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	come
O	so
O	near
O	as
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	only
O	heard
O	his
O	tongue
O	before;
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	came
O	nearer
O	,
O	the
O	captain
O	and
O	Friday
O	,
O	starting
O	up
O	on
O	their
O	feet
O	,
O	let
O	fly
O	at
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	boatswain
O	was
O	killed
O	upon
O	the
O	spot;
O	the
O	next
O	man
O	was
O	shot
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	body
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	just
O	by
O	him
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	die
O	till
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	two
O	after;
O	and
O	the
O	third
O	ran
O	for
O	it
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	the
O	fire
O	I
O	immediately
O	advanced
O	with
O	my
O	whole
O	army
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	now
O	eight
O	men
O	,
O	viz
O	.
O	,
O	myself
O	,
O	generalissimo;
O	Friday
O	,
O	my
O	lieutenant-general;
O	the
O	captain
O	and
O	his
O	two
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	three
O	prisoners
O	of
O	war
O	whom
O	we
O	had
O	trusted
O	with
O	arms
O	.
O	We
O	came
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	our
O	number;
O	and
O	I
O	made
O	the
O	man
O	they
O	had
O	left
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	now
O	one
O	of
O	us
O	,
O	to
O	call
O	them
O	by
O	name
O	,
O	to
O	try
O	if
O	I
O	could
O	bring
O	them
O	to
O	a
O	parley
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	perhaps
O	might
O	reduce
O	them
O	to
O	terms;
O	which
O	fell
O	out
O	just
O	as
O	we
O	desired
O	,
O	for
O	indeed
O	it
O	was
O	easy

O	This

O	that
O	he
O	should

O	two

O	who
O	came
O	on

O	They
O	conveyed
O	them
O	to
O	the

O	as
O	to
O	a
O	prison:
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	a
O	dismal
O	place
O	,
O	especially
O	to
O	men
O	in

O	To
O	these

O	This
O	looked
O	severe
O	,
O	and
O	convinced
O	them
O	that
O	the
O	governor
O	was
O	in
O	earnest;
O	however
O	,
O	they
O	had

O	As

O	five
O	in
O	the
O	cave

O	I
O	resolved
O	to

O	fast

O	Friday
O	went
O	in
O	twice
O	a
O	day
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	to
O	supply

O	to
O	a
O	certain
O	distance

O	I

O	I

O	I

O	as
O	a
O	man
O	sent

O	Heaven
O	to
O	deliver
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the

O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	chain
O	of
O	wonders;
O	that
O	such
O	things
O	as
O	these
O	were
O	the

O	and
O	an
O	evidence

O	could
O	search
O	into
O	the
O	remotest
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	send
O	help
O	to
O	the
O	miserable
O	whenever
O	He
O	pleased
O	.
O	I
O	forgot
O	not
O	to
O	lift
O	up
O	my
O	heart
O	in
O	thankfulness
O	to
O	Heaven;
O	and
O	what

O	could
O	forbear

O	Him
O	who
O	had
O	not
O	only
O	in
O	a
O	miraculous
O	manner
O	provided
O	for

O	,
O	but
O	from
O	whom
O	every
O	deliverance
O	must
O	always
O	be
O	acknowledged
O	to
O	proceed
O	.
O	When
O	we
O	had
O	talked
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	the

O	told
O	me

O	brought
O	me
O	some
O	little
O	refreshment
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	such
O	as
O	the
O	wretches
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	long
O	his
O	masters
O	had
O	not
O	plundered

O	of
O	.
O	Upon
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	called
O	aloud
O	to
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	his
O	men
O	bring
O	the
O	things
O	ashore
O	that
O	were
O	for
O	the
O	governor;
O	and
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	present
O	as
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	one
O	that
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	carried
O	away
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	to
O	dwell
O	upon
O	the
O	island
O	still
O	.
O	First
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	me
O	a
O	case
O	of
O	bottles
O	full
O	of
O	excellent
O	cordial
O	waters
O	,
O	six
O	large
O	bottles
O	of
O	Madeira
O	wine
O	(
O	the
O	bottles
O	held
O	two
O	quarts
O	each
O	)
O	,
O	two
O	pounds
O	of
O	excellent
O	good
O	tobacco
O	,
O	twelve
O	good
O	pieces
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	'
O	s
O	beef
O	,
O	and
O	six
O	pieces
O	of
O	pork
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	bag
O	of
O	peas
O	,
O	and
O	about
O	a
O	hundred-weight
O	of
O	biscuit;
O	he
O	also
O	brought
O	me
O	a
O	box
O	of
O	sugar
O	,
O	a
O	box
O	of
O	flour
O	,
O	a
O	bag
O	full
O	of
O	lemons
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	bottles
O	of
O	lime-juice
O	,
O	and
O	abundance
O	of
O	other
O	things
O	.
O	But
O	besides
O	these
O	,
O	and
O	what
O	was
O	a
O	thousand
O	times
O	more
O	useful
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	he
O	brought
O	me
O	six
O	new
O	clean
O	shirts
O	,
O	six
O	very
O	good
O	neckcloths
O	,
O	two

O	one
O	pair
O	of

O	,
O	a
O	hat
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	pair
O	of
O	stockings
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	suit
O	of
O	clothes
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	worn
O	but
O	very
O	little:
O	in
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	he
O	clothed
O	me
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	kind
O	and
O	agreeable
O	present
O	,
O	as
O	any
O	one
O	may
O	imagine
O	,
O	to
O	one
O	in
O	my
O	circumstances
O	,
O	but
O	never
O	was
O	anything
O	in
O	the

O	of
O	that
O	kind
O	so
O	unpleasant
O	,
O	awkward
O	,
O	and
O	uneasy

O	it
O	was
O	to
O	me
O	to
O	wear
O	such
O	clothes
O	at
O	first
O	.
O	After
O	these
O	ceremonies
O	were
O	past
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	all
O	his
O	good
O	things
O	were
O	brought
O	into
O	my
O	little
O	apartment
O	,
O	we
O	began
O	to
O	consult
O	what
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	with
O	the
O	prisoners
O	we
O	had;
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	worth
O	considering
O	whether
O	we
O	might
O	venture
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	with
O	us
O	or
O	no
O	,
O	especially
O	two
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	knew
O	to
O	be
O	incorrigible
O	and
O	refractory
O	to
O	the
O	last
O	degree;
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	said
O	he
O	knew
O	they
O	were
O	such
O	rogues
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	obliging
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	carry
O	them
O	away
O	,
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	in
O	irons
O	,
O	as
O	malefactors
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	delivered
O	over
O	to
O	justice
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	English
O	colony
O	he
O	could
O	come

O	and
O	I
O	found
O	that

O	very
O	anxious
O	about

O	Upon

O	and
O	how
O	they
O	had
O	run
O	away
O	with
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	preparing
O	to
O	commit
O	further
O	robberies
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	Providence
O	had
O	ensnared
O	them
O	in
O	their
O	own
O	ways
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	fallen
O	into
O	the
O	pit
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	dug
O	for
O	others
O	.
O	I
O	let
O	them
O	know
O	that
O	by
O	my
O	direction
O	the
O	ship
O	had
O	been
O	seized;
O	that
O	she
O	lay
O	now
O	in
O	the
O	road;
O	and
O	they
O	might
O	see
O	by
O	and
O	by
O	that
O	their
O	new
O	captain
O	had
O	received
O	the
O	reward
O	of
O	his
O	villany
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	see
O	him
O	hanging
O	at
O	the
O	yard-arm;
O	that
O	,
O	as
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	I
O	wanted
O	to
O	know
O	what
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	say
O	why
O	I
O	should
O	not
O	execute
O	them
O	as
O	pirates
O	taken
O	in
O	the
O	fact
O	,
O	as
O	by
O	my
O	commission
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	doubt
O	but
O	I
O	had
O	authority
O	so
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	answered
O	in
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	say
O	but
O	this
O	,
O	that
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	taken
O	the
O	captain
O	promised
O	them
O	their
O	lives
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	humbly
O	implored
O	my
O	mercy
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	told
O	them
O	I
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	mercy
O	to
O	show
O	them;
O	for
O	as
O	for
O	myself
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	resolved
O	to
O	quit
O	the
O	island
O	with
O	all
O	my
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	taken
O	passage
O	with
O	the
O	captain
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	England;
O	and
O	as
O	for
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	carry
O	them
O	to
O	England
O	other
O	than
O	as
O	prisoners
O	in
O	irons
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	tried
O	for
O	mutiny
O	and
O	running
O	away
O	with
O	the
O	ship;
O	the
O	consequence
O	of
O	which
O	,
O	they
O	must
O	needs
O	know
O	,
O	would
O	be
O	the
O	gallows;
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	what
O	was
O	best
O	for
O	them
O	,
O	unless
O	they
O	had
O	a
O	mind
O	to
O	take
O	their
O	fate
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	.
O	If
O	they
O	desired
O	that
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	liberty
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	some
O	inclination
O	to
O	give
O	them
O	their
O	lives
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	thought
O	they
O	could
O	shift
O	on
O	shore
O	.
O	They
O	seemed
O	very
O	thankful
O	for
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	they
O	would
O	much
O	rather
O	venture
O	to
O	stay
O	there
O	than
O	be
O	carried
O	to
O	England
O	to
O	be
O	hanged
O	.
O	So
O	I
O	left
O	it
O	on
O	that
O	issue
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	the
O	captain
O	seemed
O	to
O	make
O	some
O	difficulty
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	durst
O	not
O	leave
O	them
O	there
O	.
O	Upon
O	this
O	I
O	seemed
O	a
O	little
O	angry
O	with
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	my
O	prisoners
O	,
O	not
O	his;
O	and
O	that
O	seeing
O	I
O	had
O	offered
O	them
O	so
O	much
O	favor
O	,
O	I
O	would
O	be
O	as
O	good
O	as
O	my
O	word;
O	and
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	think
O	fit
O	to
O	consent
O	to
O	it
O	I
O	would
O	set
O	them
O	at
O	liberty
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	found
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	like
O	it
O	he
O	might
O	take
O	them
O	again
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	catch
O	them
O	.
O	Upon
O	this
O	they
O	appeared
O	very
O	thankful
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	accordingly
O	set
O	them
O	at
O	liberty
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	them
O	retire
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	whence
O	they
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	would
O	leave
O	them
O	some
O	fire-arms
O	,
O	some
O	ammunition
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	directions
O	how
O	they
O	should
O	live
O	very
O	well
O	if
O	they
O	thought
O	fit
O	.
O	Upon
O	this
O	I
O	prepared
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	ship;
O	but
O	told
O	the
O	captain
O	I
O	would
O	stay
O	that
O	night
O	to
O	prepare
O	my
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	desired
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	board
O	in
O	the
O	meantime
O	,
O	and
O	keep
O	all
O	right
O	in
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	send
O	the
O	boat
O	on
O	shore
O	next
O	day
O	for
O	me;
O	ordering
O	him
O	,
O	at
O	all
O	events
O	,
O	to
O	cause
O	the
O	new
O	captain
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	killed
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	hanged
O	at
O	the
O	yard-arm
O	,
O	that
O	these
O	men
O	might
O	see
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	captain
O	was
O	gone
O	,
O	I
O	sent
O	for
O	the
O	men
O	up
O	to
O	me
O	to
O	my
O	apartment
O	,
O	and
O	entered
O	seriously
O	into
O	discourse
O	with
O	them
O	on
O	their
O	circumstances
O	.
O	I
O	told
O	them
O	I
O	thought
O	they
O	had
O	made
O	a
O	right
O	choice;
O	that
O	if
O	the
O	captain
O	had
O	carried
O	them
O	away
O	they
O	would
O	certainly
O	be
O	hanged
O	.
O	I
O	showed
O	them
O	the
O	new
O	captain
O	hanging
O	at
O	the
O	yard-arm
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	they
O	had
O	nothing
O	less
O	to
O	expect
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	bad
O	all
O	declared
O	their
O	willingness
O	to
O	stay
O	,
O	I
O	then
O	told
O	them
O	I
O	would
O	let
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	my
O	living
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	way
O	of
O	making
O	it
O	easy
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	I
O	gave
O	them
O	the
O	whole
O	history
O	of
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	my
O	coming
O	to
O	it;
O	showed
O	them
O	my
O	fortifications
O	,
O	the
O	way
O	I
O	made
O	my
O	bread
O	,
O	planted
O	my
O	corn
O	,
O	cured
O	my
O	grapes;
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	all
O	that
O	was
O	necessary
O	to
O	make
O	them
O	easy
O	.
O	I
O	told
O	them
O	the
O	story
O	also
O	of
O	the
O	seventeen
O	Spaniards
O	that
O	were
O	to
O	be
O	expected
O	,
O	for
O	whom
O	I
O	left
O	a
O	letter
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	them
O	promise
O	to
O	treat
O	them
O	in
O	common
O	with
O	themselves
O	.
O	Here
O	it
O	may
O	be
O	noted
O	that
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	ink
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	was
O	greatly
O	surprised
O	that
O	I
O	never
O	hit
O	upon
O	a
O	way
O	of
O	making
O	ink
O	of
O	charcoal
O	and
O	water
O	,
O	or
O	of
O	something
O	else
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	done
O	things
O	much
O	more
O	difficult
O	.
O	I
O	left
O	them
O	my
O	fire-arms;
O	viz
O	.
O	,
O	five
O	muskets
O	,
O	three
O	fowling-
O	pieces
O	,
O	and
O	three
O	swords
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	above
O	a
O	barrel
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	of
O	powder
O	left;
O	for
O	after
O	the
O	first
O	year
O	or
O	two
O	I
O	used
O	but
O	little
O	,
O	and
O	wasted
O	none
O	.
O	I
O	gave
O	them
O	a
O	description
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	I
O	managed
O	the
O	goats
O	,
O	and
O	directions
O	to
O	milk
O	and
O	fatten
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	make
O	both
O	butter
O	and
O	cheese
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	I
O	gave
O	them
O	every
O	part
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	story;
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	I
O	should
O	prevail
O	with
O	the
O	captain
O	to
O	leave
O	them
O	two
O	barrels
O	of
O	gunpowder
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	garden-seeds
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	told
O	them
O	I
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	very
O	glad
O	of
O	.
O	Also
O	,
O	I
O	gave
O	them
O	the
O	bag
O	of
O	peas
O	which
O	the
O	captain
O	had
O	brought
O	me
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	them
O	be
O	sure
O	to
O	sow
O	and
O	increase
O	them
O	.
O	Having
O	done
O	all
O	this
O	I
O	left
O	them
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	ship
O	.
O	We
O	prepared
O	immediately
O	to
O	sail
O	,
O	but
O	did
O	not
O	weigh
O	that
O	night
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	early
O	,
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	five
O	men
O	came
O	swimming
O	to
O	the
O	ship
O	'
O	s
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	making
O	the
O	most
O	lamentable
O	complaint
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	three
O	,
O	begged
O	to
O	be
O	taken
O	into
O	the
O	ship
O	for
O	God
O	'
O	s
O	sake
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	should
O	be
O	murdered
O	,
O	and
O	begged
O	the
O	captain
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	hanged
O	them
O	immediately
O	.
O	Upon
O	this
O	the
O	captain
O	pretended
O	to
O	have
O	no
O	power
O	without
O	me;
O	but
O	after
O	some
O	difficulty
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	their
O	solemn
O	promises
O	of
O	amendment
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	taken
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	,
O	some
O	time
O	after
O	,
O	soundly
O	whipped
O	and
O	pickled;
O	after
O	which
O	they
O	proved
O	very
O	honest
O	and
O	quiet
O	fellows
O	.
O	Some
O	time
O	after
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	boat
O	was
O	ordered
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	the
O	tide
O	being
O	up
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	things
O	promised
O	to
O	the
O	men;
O	to
O	which
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	at
O	my
O	intercession
O	,
O	caused
O	their
O	chests
O	and
O	clothes
O	to
O	be
O	added
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	took
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	very
O	thankful
O	for
O	.
O	I
O	also
O	encouraged
O	them
O	,
O	by
O	telling
O	them
O	that
O	if
O	it
O	lay
O	in
O	my
O	power
O	to
O	send
O	any
O	vessel
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	in
O	,
O	I
O	would
O	not
O	forget
O	them
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	took
O	leave
O	of
O	this
O	island
O	,
O	I
O	carried
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	for
O	relics
O	,
O	the
O	great
O	goat-skin
O	cap
O	I
O	had
O	made
O	,
O	my
O	umbrella
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	parrots;
O	also
O	,
O	I
O	forgot
O	not
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	money
O	I
O	formerly
O	mentioned
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	lain
O	by
O	me
O	so
O	long
O	useless
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	grown
O	rusty
O	or
O	tarnished
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	hardly
O	pass
O	for
O	silver
O	till
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	little
O	rubbed
O	and
O	handled
O	,
O	as
O	also
O	the
O	money
O	I
O	found
O	in
O	the
O	wreck
O	of
O	the
O	Spanish
O	ship
O	.
O	And
O	thus
O	I
O	left
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	the
O	19th
O	of
O	December
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	found
O	by
O	the
O	ship
O	'
O	s
O	account
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	year
O	1686
O	,
O	after
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	upon
O	it
O	eight-and-twenty
O	years
O	,
O	two
O	months
O	,
O	and
O	nineteen
O	days;
O	being
O	delivered
O	from
O	this
O	second
O	captivity
O	the
O	same
