O	Flowers

O	The

O	,
O	and
O	redolent
O	with
O	the
O	songs
O	of

O	that

O	There

O	than

O	at

O	worthily
O	its

O	,

O	They

O	the
O	sport

O	At

O	the

O	beneath
O	the
O	heavenly

O	They
O	watched
O	the

O	,
O	who
O	had

O	One

O	they
O	saw
O	one
O	star
O	that
O	shone
O	brighter
O	than
O	all

O	.
O	Its
O	location
O	was
O	far
O	away
O	in
O	the

O	,
O	near
O	a

O	.
O	For
O	many
O	nights
O	it
O	was
O	seen
O	,
O	till

O	it

O	This
O	doubt
O	led
O	to
O	an
O	examination
O	,
O	which
O	proved
O	the

O	a
O	short

O	A

O	and
O	shipped
O	to
O	New
O	York
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	as
O	droll
O	and
O	roguish-looking
O	a
O	grizzly
O	cub
O	as
O	ever
O	stepped
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	grizzly-gray
O	full
O	moon
O	of
O	fluffy
O	hair
O	,
O	two
O	big
O	black
O	eyes
O	sparkled
O	like
O	jet
O	beads
O	,
O	behind
O	a
O	pudgy
O	little
O	nose
O	,
O	absurdly
O	short
O	for
O	a
O	bear
O	.
O	Excepting
O	for
O	his
O	high
O	shoulders
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	little
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	big
O	bale
O	of
O	gray
O	fur
O	set
O	up
O	on
O	four
O	posts
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	material
O	.
O	But
O	his
O	claws
O	were
O	formidable
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	the
O	true
O	grizzly
O	spirit
O	.
O	The
O	Bears
O	'
O	Nursery
O	at
O	the
O	New
O	York
O	Zoological
O	Park
O	is
O	a
O	big
O	yard
O	with
O	a
O	shade
O	tree
O	,
O	a
O	tree
O	to
O	climb
O	,
O	a
O	swimming
O	pool
O	,
O	three
O	sleeping
O	dens
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	rock
O	cliff
O	.
O	It
O	never
O	contains
O	fewer
O	than
O	six
O	cubs
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	eight
O	.
O	Naturally
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	a
O	good
O	test
O	of
O	courage
O	and
O	temper
O	to
O	turn
O	a
O	new
O	bear
O	into
O	that
O	roystering
O	crowd
O	.
O	Usually
O	a
O	newcomer
O	is
O	badly
O	scared
O	during
O	his
O	first
O	day
O	in
O	the
O	Nursery
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	timid
O	during
O	the
O	next
O	.
O	But
O	grizzlies
O	are
O	different
O	.
O	They
O	are
O	born
O	full
O	of
O	courage
O	and
O	devoid
O	of
O	all

O	of

O	the

O	,
O	halted
O	,

O	On
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	voyages
O	from
O	China
O	,
O	the
O	Pitt
O	,
O	East
O	Indiaman
O	,
O	had
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	among
O	her
O	passengers
O	,
O	a
O	young
O	tiger
O	.
O	He
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	as
O	harmless
O	and
O	playful
O	as
O	a
O	kitten
O	,
O	and
O	allowed
O	the
O	utmost
O	familiarity
O	from
O	every
O	one
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	especially
O	fond
O	of
O	creeping
O	into
O	the
O	sailors
O	'
O	hammocks;
O	and
O	while
O	he
O	lay
O	stretched
O	on
O	the
O	deck
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	suffer
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	of
O	them
O	to
O	place
O	their
O	heads
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	as
O	upon
O	a
O	pillow
O	.
O	Now
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	at
O	dinner-time
O	run
O	off
O	with
O	pieces
O	of
O	their
O	meat;
O	and
O	though
O	sometimes
O	severely
O	punished
O	for
O	the
O	theft
O	,
O	he
O	bore
O	the
O	chastisement
O	he
O	received
O	with
O	the
O	patience
O	of
O	a
O	dog
O	.
O	His
O	chief
O	companion
O	was
O	a
O	terrier
O	,
O	with
O	whom
O	he
O	would
O	play
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	tricks--tumbling
O	and
O	rolling
O	over
O	the
O	animal
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	amusing
O	manner
O	,
O	without
O	hurting
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	also
O	frequently
O	run
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	bowsprit
O	,
O	and
O	climb
O	about
O	the
O	rigging
O	with
O	the
O	agility
O	of
O	a
O	cat
O	.
O	On
O	his
O	arrival
O	in
O	England
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	sent
O	to
O	the
O	menagerie
O	at
O	the
O	Tower
O	.
O	While
O	there
O	,
O	another
O	terrier
O	was
O	introduced
O	into
O	his
O	den
O	.
O	Possibly
O	he
O	may
O	have
O	mistaken
O	it
O	for
O	his
O	old
O	friend
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	immediately
O	became
O	attached
O	to
O	the
O	dog
O	,
O	and
O	appeared
O	uneasy
O	whenever
O	it
O	was
O	taken
O	away
O	.
O	Now
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	dangerous
O	experiment
O	was
O	tried
O	of
O	allowing
O	the
O	terrier
O	to
O	remain
O	while
O	the
O	tiger
O	was
O	fed
O	.
O	Presuming
O	on
O	their
O	friendship
O	,
O	the
O	dog
O	occasionally
O	ventured
O	to
O	approach
O	him;
O	but
O	the
O	tiger
O	showed
O	his
O	true
O	nature
O	on
O	such
O	occasions
O	by
O	snarling
O	in
O	a
O	way
O	which
O	made
O	the
O	little
O	animal
O	quickly
O	retreat
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	in
O	England
O	two
O	years
O	,
O	when
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	seamen
O	of
O	the
O	_Pitt_
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	Tower
O	.
O	The
O	animal
O	at
O	once
O	recognized
O	his
O	old
O	friend
O	,
O	and
O	appeared
O	so
O	delighted
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	sailor
O	begged
O	to
O	be
O	allowed
O	to
O	go
O	into
O	the
O	den
O	.
O	The
O	tiger
O	,
O	on
O	this
O	,
O	rubbed
O	himself
O	against
O	him
O	,
O	licked
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	fawned
O	on
O	him
O	as
O	a
O	cat
O	would
O	have
O	done
O	.
O	The
O	sailor
O	remained
O	in
O	the
O	den
O	for
O	a
O	couple
O	of
O	hours
O	or
O	more
O	,
O	during
O	which
O	time
O	the
O	tiger
O	kept
O	so
O	close
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	evident
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	some
O	difficulty
O	in
O	getting
O	out
O	again
O	,
O	without
O	the
O	animal
O	making
O	his
O	escape
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	.
O	The
O	den
O	consisted
O	of
O	two
O	compartments
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	keeper
O	contrived
O	to
O	entice
O	the
O	tiger
O	to
O	the
O	inner
O	one
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	closed
O	the
O	slide
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	seaman
O	was
O	liberated
O	.
O	Even
O	a
O	wolf
O	,
O	savage
O	as
O	that
O	animal
O	is
O	,
O	may
O	,
O	if
O	caught
O	young
O	,
O	and
O	treated
O	kindly
O	,
O	become
O	tame
O	.
O	A
O	story
O	is
O	told
O	of
O	a
O	wolf
O	which
O	showed
O	a
O	considerable
O	amount
O	of
O	affection
O	for
O	its
O	master
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	brought
O	it
O	up
O	from
O	a
O	puppy
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	became
O	as
O	tame
O	as
O	the
O	best-trained
O	dog
O	,
O	obeying
O	him
O	in
O	everything
O	.
O	Having
O	frequently
O	to
O	leave
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	being
O	able
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	wolf
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	sent
O	it
O	to
O	a
O	menagerie
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	knew
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	carefully
O	looked
O	after
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	the
O	wolf
O	was
O	very
O	unhappy
O	,
O	and
O	evidently
O	pined
O	for
O	its
O	absent
O	master
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	resigning
O	itself
O	to
O	its
O	fate
O	,
O	it
O	made
O	friends
O	with
O	its
O	keepers
O	,
O	and
O	recovered
O	its
O	spirits
O	.
O	Fully
O	eighteen
O	months
O	had
O	passed
O	by
O	,
O	when
O	its
O	old
O	master
O	,
O	returning
O	home
O	,
O	paid
O	a
O	visit
O	to
O	the
O	menagerie
O	.
O	Immediately
O	he
O	spoke
O	,
O	the
O	wolf
O	recognized
O	his
O	voice
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	strenuous
O	efforts
O	to
O	get
O	free
O	.
O	On
O	being
O	set
O	at
O	liberty
O	it
O	sprang
O	forward
O	,
O	and
O	leaped
O	up
O	and
O	caressed
O	him
O	like
O	a
O	dog
O	.
O	Its
O	master
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	left
O	it
O	with
O	its
O	keepers
O	,
O	and
O	three
O	years
O	passed
O	away
O	before
O	he
O	paid
O	another
O	visit
O	to
O	the
O	menagerie
O	.
O	Notwithstanding
O	this
O	lapse
O	of
O	time
O	,
O	the
O	wolf
O	again
O	recognized
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	exhibited
O	the
O	same
O	marks
O	of
O	affection
O	.
O	On
O	its
O	master
O	again
O	going
O	away
O	,
O	the
O	wolf
O	became
O	gloomy
O	and
O	desponding
O	,
O	and
O	refused
O	its
O	food
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	fears
O	were
O	entertained
O	for
O	its
O	life
O	.
O	It
O	recovered
O	its
O	health
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	it
O	suffered
O	its
O	keepers
O	to
O	approach
O	,
O	exhibited
O	the
O	savage
O	disposition
O	of
O	its
O	tribe
O	towards
O	all
O	strangers
O	.
O	The
O	history
O	of
O	this
O	wolf
O	shows
O	you
O	that
O	the
O	fiercest
O	tempers
O	may
O	be
O	calmed
O	by
O	gentleness
O	.
O	Arrant
O	thieves
O	as
O	foxes
O	are
O	,
O	with
O	regard
O	to
O	their
O	domestic
O	virtues
O	they
O	eminently
O	shine
O	.
O	Both
O	parents
O	take
O	the
O	greatest
O	interest
O	in
O	rearing
O	and
O	educating
O	their
O	offspring
O	.
O	They
O	provide
O	,
O	in
O	their
O	burrow
O	,
O	a
O	comfortable
O	nest
O	,
O	lined
O	with
O	feathers
O	,
O	for
O	their
O	new-born
O	cubs
O	.
O	Should
O	either
O	parent
O	perceive
O	in
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	of
O	their
O	abode
O	the
O	slightest
O	sign
O	of
O	human
O	approach
O	,
O	they
O	immediately
O	carry
O	their
O	young
O	to
O	a
O	spot
O	of
O	greater
O	safety
O	,
O	sometimes
O	many
O	miles
O	away
O	.
O	They
O	usually
O	set
O	off
O	in
O	the
O	twilight
O	of
O	a
O	fine
O	evening
O	.
O	The
O	papa
O	fox
O	having
O	taken
O	a
O	survey
O	all
O	round
O	,
O	marches
O	first
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	ones
O	march
O	singly
O	,
O	and
O	mamma
O	brings
O	up
O	the
O	rear
O	.
O	On
O	reaching
O	a
O	wall
O	or
O	bank
O	,
O	papa
O	always
O	mounts
O	first
O	,
O	and
O	looks
O	carefully
O	around
O	,
O	rearing
O	himself
O	on
O	his
O	haunches
O	to
O	command
O	a
O	wider
O	view
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	utters
O	a
O	short
O	cry
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	young
O	ones
O	,
O	understanding
O	as
O	""""
O	Come
O	along
O	!
O	""""
O	instantly
O	obey
O	.
O	All
O	being
O	safely
O	over
O	,
O	mamma
O	follows
O	,
O	pausing
O	in
O	her
O	turn
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	fence
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	makes
O	a
O	careful
O	survey
O	,
O	especially
O	rearward
O	.
O	She
O	then
O	gives
O	a
O	responsive
O	cry
O	,
O	answering
O	to
O	""""
O	All
O	right
O	!
O	""""
O	and
O	follows
O	the
O	track
O	of
O	the
O	others
O	.
O	Thus
O	the
O	party
O	proceed
O	on
O	their
O	march
O	,
O	repeating
O	the
O	same
O	precautions
O	at
O	each
O	fresh
O	barrier
O	.
O	When
O	peril
O	approaches
O	,
O	the
O	wary
O	old
O	fox
O	instructs
O	his
O	young
O	ones
O	to
O	escape
O	with
O	turns
O	and
O	doublings
O	on
O	their
O	path
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	himself
O	will
O	stand
O	still
O	on
O	some
O	brow
O	or
O	knoll
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	can
O	both
O	see
O	and
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	Having
O	thus
O	drawn
O	attention
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	he
O	will
O	take
O	to
O	flight
O	in
O	a
O	different
O	direction
O	.
O	Occasionally
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	young
O	family
O	are
O	disporting
O	themselves
O	near
O	their
O	home
O	,
O	if
O	peril
O	approach
O	,
O	the
O	parents
O	utter
O	a
O	quick
O	,
O	peculiar
O	cry
O	,
O	commanding
O	the
O	young
O	ones
O	to
O	hurry
O	to
O	earth;
O	knowing
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	case
O	of
O	pursuit
O	,
O	they
O	have
O	neither
O	strength
O	nor
O	speed
O	to
O	secure
O	their
O	escape
O	.
O	They
O	themselves
O	will
O	then
O	take
O	to
O	flight
O	,
O	and
O	seek
O	some
O	distant
O	place
O	of
O	security
O	.
O	The
O	instruction
O	they
O	afford
O	their
O	young
O	is
O	varied
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	the
O	parents
O	toss
O	bones
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	for
O	the
O	young
O	foxes
O	to
O	catch
O	.
O	If
O	the
O	little
O	one
O	fails
O	to
O	seize
O	it
O	before
O	it
O	falls
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	the
O	parent
O	will
O	snap
O	at
O	him
O	in
O	reproof
O	.
O	If
O	he
O	catches
O	it
O	cleverly
O	,
O	papa
O	growls
O	his
O	approval
O	,
O	and
O	tosses
O	it
O	up
O	again
O	.
O	This
O	sport
O	continues
O	for
O	a
O	considerable
O	time
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	have
O	said
O	,
O	no
O	other
O	animals
O	so
O	carefully
O	educate
O	their
O	young
O	in
O	the
O	way
O	they
O	should
O	go
O	,
O	as
O	does
O	the
O	fox
O	.
O	He
O	is
O	a
O	good
O	husband
O	,
O	an
O	excellent
O	father
O	,
O	capable
O	of
O	friendship
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	very
O	intelligent
O	member
O	of
O	society;
O	but
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	,
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	confessed
O	,
O	an
O	incorrigible
O	rogue
O	and
O	thief
O	.
O	A
O	gentleman
O	was
O	lying
O	one
O	summer
O	'
O	s
O	day
O	under
O	the
O	shelter
O	of
O	some
O	shrubs
O	on
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	Tweed
O	,
O	when
O	his
O	attention
O	was
O	attracted
O	by
O	the
O	cries
O	of
O	wild-fowl
O	,
O	accompanied
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	fluttering
O	and
O	splashing
O	.
O	On
O	looking
O	round
O	,
O	he
O	perceived
O	a
O	large
O	brood
O	of
O	ducks
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	disturbed
O	by
O	the
O	drifting
O	of
O	a
O	fir
O	branch
O	among
O	them
O	.
O	After
O	circling
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	for
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	,
O	they
O	again
O	settled
O	down
O	on
O	their
O	feeding-ground
O	.
O	Two
O	or
O	three
O	minutes
O	elapsed
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	same
O	event
O	again
O	occurred
O	.
O	A
O	branch
O	drifted
O	down
O	with
O	the
O	stream
O	into
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	ducks
O	,
O	and
O	startled
O	them
O	from
O	their
O	repast
O	.
O	Once
O	more
O	they
O	rose
O	upon
O	the
O	wing
O	,
O	clamouring
O	loudly
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	harmless
O	bough
O	had
O	drifted
O	by
O	,
O	settled
O	themselves
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	water
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	This
O	occurred
O	so
O	frequently
O	,
O	that
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	scarcely
O	troubled
O	themselves
O	to
O	flutter
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	even
O	when
O	about
O	to
O	be
O	touched
O	by
O	the
O	drifting
O	bough
O	.
O	The
O	gentleman
O	,
O	meantime
O	,
O	marking
O	the
O	regular
O	intervals
O	at
O	which
O	the
O	fir
O	branches
O	succeeded
O	each
O	other
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	track
O	,
O	looked
O	for
O	a
O	cause
O	,
O	and
O	perceived
O	,
O	at
O	length
O	,
O	higher
O	up
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	the
O	stream
O	,
O	a
O	fox
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	having
O	evidently
O	sent
O	them
O	adrift
O	,
O	was
O	eagerly
O	watching
O	their
O	progress
O	and
O	the
O	effect
O	they
O	produced
O	.
O	Satisfied
O	with
O	the
O	result
O	,
O	cunning
O	Reynard
O	at
O	last
O	selected
O	a
O	larger
O	branch
O	of
O	spruce-fir
O	than
O	usual
O	,
O	and
O	couching
O	himself
O	down
O	on
O	it
O	,
O	set
O	it
O	adrift
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	the
O	others
O	.
O	The
O	birds
O	,
O	now
O	well
O	trained
O	to
O	indifference
O	,
O	scarcely
O	moved
O	till
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	making
O	rapid
O	snaps
O	right
O	and
O	left
O	,
O	he
O	secured
O	two
O	fine
O	young
O	ducks
O	as
O	his
O	prey
O	,
O	and
O	floated
O	forward
O	triumphantly
O	on
O	his
O	raft;
O	while
O	the
O	surviving
O	fowls
O	,
O	clamouring
O	in
O	terror
O	,
O	took
O	to
O	flight
O	,
O	and
O	returned
O	no
O	more
O	to
O	the
O	spot
O	.
O	A
O	labourer
O	going
O	to
O	his
O	work
O	one
O	morning
O	sight
O	of
O	a
O	fox
O	stretched
O	out
O	at
O	full
O	length
O	under
O	a
O	bush
O	.
O	Believing
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	dead
O	,
O	the
O	man
O	drew
O	it
O	out
O	by
O	the
O	tail
O	,
O	and
O	swung
O	it
O	about
O	to
O	assure
O	himself
O	of
O	the
O	fact
O	.
O	Perceiving
O	no
O	symptoms
O	of
O	life
O	,
O	he
O	then
O	threw
O	it
O	over
O	his
O	shoulder
O	,
O	intending
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	cap
O	of
O	the
O	skin
O	,
O	and
O	ornament
O	his
O	cottage
O	wall
O	with
O	the
O	brush
O	.
O	While
O	the
O	fox
O	hung
O	over
O	one
O	shoulder
O	,
O	his
O	mattock
O	balanced
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	The
O	point
O	of
O	the
O	instrument
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	walked
O	along
O	,
O	every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	struck
O	against
O	the
O	ribs
O	of
O	the
O	fox
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	not
O	so
O	dead
O	as
O	the
O	man
O	supposed
O	,
O	objected
O	to
O	this
O	proceeding
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	mind
O	being
O	carried
O	along
O	with
O	his
O	head
O	downward
O	.
O	Losing
O	patience
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	a
O	sharp
O	snap
O	at
O	that
O	portion
O	of
O	the
O	labourer
O	'
O	s
O	body
O	near
O	which
O	his
O	head
O	hung
O	.
O	The
O	man
O	,
O	startled
O	by
O	this
O	sudden
O	attack
O	,
O	threw
O	fox
O	and
O	mattock
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	turning
O	round
O	,
O	he
O	espied
O	the
O	live
O	animal
O	making
O	off
O	at
O	full
O	speed
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	still
O	another
O	story
O	to
O	tell
O	about
O	cunning
O	Reynard
O	.
O	Daylight
O	had
O	just
O	broke
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	well-known
O	naturalist
O	,
O	gun
O	in
O	hand
O	,
O	wandering
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	specimens
O	,
O	observed
O	a
O	large
O	fox
O	making
O	his
O	way
O	along
O	the
O	skirts
O	of
O	a
O	plantation
O	.
O	Reynard
O	looked
O	cautiously
O	over
O	the
O	turf-wall
O	into
O	the
O	neighbouring
O	field
O	,
O	longing
O	evidently
O	to
O	get
O	hold
O	of
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	hares
O	feeding
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	well
O	aware
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	little
O	chance
O	of
O	catching
O	one
O	by
O	dint
O	of
O	running
O	.
O	After
O	examining
O	the
O	different
O	gaps
O	in
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	he
O	fixed
O	on
O	one
O	which
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	most
O	frequented
O	,
O	and
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	close
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	attitude
O	of
O	a
O	cat
O	watching
O	a
O	mouse-hole
O	.
O	He
O	next
O	scraped
O	small
O	hollow
O	in
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	to
O	form
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	screen
O	.
O	Now
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	stopped
O	to
O	listen
O	,
O	or
O	take
O	a
O	cautious
O	peep
O	into
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	This
O	done
O	,
O	he
O	again
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	remained
O	motionless
O	,
O	except
O	when
O	occasionally
O	his
O	eagerness
O	induced
O	him
O	to
O	reconnoitre
O	the
O	feeding
O	hares
O	.
O	One
O	by
O	one
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	sun
O	rose
O	,
O	they
O	made
O	their
O	way
O	from
O	the
O	field
O	to
O	the
O	plantation
O	.
O	Several
O	passed
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	moved
O	not
O	,
O	except
O	to
O	crouch
O	still
O	closer
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	two
O	came
O	directly
O	towards
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	involuntary
O	motion
O	of
O	his
O	ears
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	venture
O	to
O	look
O	up
O	,
O	showed
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	aware
O	of
O	their
O	approach
O	.
O	Like
O	lightning
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	leaping
O	through
O	the
O	gap
O	,
O	Reynard
O	was
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	catching
O	one
O	,
O	killed
O	her
O	immediately
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	decamping
O	with
O	his
O	booty
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	rifle-ball
O	put
O	an
O	end
O	to
O	his
O	career
O	.
O	I
O	must
O	tell
O	you
O	one
O	more
O	story
O	about
O	a
O	fox
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	very
O	interesting
O	little
O	animal
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	though
O	not
O	less
O	cunning
O	than
O	its
O	relatives
O	in
O	warmer
O	regions
O	.
O	Mr
O	.
O	Hayes
O	,
O	the
O	Arctic
O	explorer
O	,
O	had
O	a
O	beautiful
O	little
O	snow-white
O	fox
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	his
O	companion
O	in
O	his
O	cabin
O	when
O	his
O	vessel
O	was
O	frozen
O	up
O	during
O	the
O	winter
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	been
O	caught
O	in
O	a
O	trap
O	,
O	but
O	soon
O	became
O	tame
O	,
O	and
O	used
O	to
O	sit
O	in
O	his
O	lap
O	during
O	meals
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	delicate
O	paws
O	on
O	the
O	cloth
O	.
O	A
O	plate
O	and
O	fork
O	were
O	provided
O	for
O	her
O	,
O	though
O	she
O	was
O	unable
O	to
O	handle
O	the
O	fork
O	herself;
O	and
O	little
O	bits
O	of
O	raw
O	venison
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	preferred
O	to
O	seasoned
O	food
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	took
O	the
O	morsels
O	into
O	her
O	mouth
O	,
O	her
O	eyes
O	sparkled
O	with
O	delight
O	.
O	She
O	used
O	to
O	wipe
O	her
O	lips
O	,
O	and
O	look
O	up
O	at
O	her
O	master
O	with
O	a
O	_coquetterie_
O	perfectly
O	irresistible
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	she
O	exhibited
O	much
O	impatience;
O	but
O	a
O	gentle
O	rebuke
O	with
O	a
O	fork
O	on
O	the
O	tip
O	of
O	the
O	nose
O	was
O	sufficient
O	to
O	restore
O	her
O	patience
O	.
O	When
O	sufficiently
O	tame
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	allowed
O	to
O	run
O	loose
O	in
O	the
O	cabin;
O	but
O	she
O	got
O	into
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	bounding
O	over
O	the
O	shelves
O	,
O	without
O	much
O	regard
O	for
O	the
O	valuable
O	and
O	perishable
O	articles
O	lying
O	on
O	them
O	.
O	She
O	soon
O	also
O	found
O	out
O	the
O	bull
O	'
O	s-eye
O	overhead
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	cracks
O	round
O	which
O	she
O	could
O	sniff
O	the
O	cool
O	air
O	.
O	Close
O	beneath
O	it
O	she
O	accordingly
O	took
O	up
O	her
O	abode;
O	and
O	thence
O	she
O	used
O	to
O	crawl
O	down
O	when
O	dinner
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	,
O	getting
O	into
O	her
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	lap
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	up
O	longingly
O	and
O	lovingly
O	into
O	his
O	face
O	,
O	sometimes
O	putting
O	out
O	her
O	little
O	tongue
O	with
O	impatience
O	,
O	and
O	barking
O	,
O	if
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	the
O	repast
O	was
O	too
O	long
O	delayed
O	.
O	To
O	prevent
O	her
O	climbing
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	secured
O	by
O	a
O	slight
O	chain
O	.
O	This
O	she
O	soon
O	managed
O	to
O	break
O	,
O	and
O	once
O	having
O	performed
O	the
O	operation
O	,
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	fail
O	to
O	attempt
O	it
O	again
O	.
O	To
O	do
O	this
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	first
O	draw
O	herself
O	back
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	she
O	could
O	get
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	suddenly
O	dart
O	forward
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	snapping
O	it
O	by
O	the
O	jerk;
O	and
O	though
O	she
O	was
O	thus
O	sent
O	reeling
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	again
O	pick
O	herself
O	up
O	,
O	panting
O	as
O	if
O	her
O	little
O	heart
O	would
O	break
O	,
O	shake
O	out
O	her
O	disarranged
O	coat
O	,
O	and
O	try
O	once
O	more
O	.
O	When
O	observed
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	sit
O	quietly
O	down
O	,
O	cock
O	her
O	head
O	cunningly
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	follow
O	the
O	chain
O	with
O	her
O	eye
O	along
O	its
O	whole
O	length
O	to
O	its
O	fastening
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	walk
O	leisurely
O	to
O	that
O	point
O	,
O	hesitating
O	a
O	moment
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	make
O	another
O	plunge
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	time
O	she
O	would
O	eye
O	her
O	master
O	sharply
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	he
O	moved
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	fall
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	pretend
O	to
O	be
O	asleep
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	neat
O	and
O	cleanly
O	creature
O	,
O	everlastingly
O	brushing
O	her
O	clothes
O	,
O	and
O	bathing
O	regularly
O	in
O	a
O	bath
O	of
O	snow
O	provided
O	for
O	her
O	in
O	the
O	cabin
O	.
O	This
O	last
O	operation
O	was
O	her
O	great
O	delight
O	.
O	She
O	would
O	throw
O	up
O	the
O	white
O	flakes
O	with
O	her
O	diminutive
O	nose
O	,
O	rolling
O	about
O	and
O	burying
O	herself
O	in
O	them
O	,
O	wipe
O	her
O	face
O	with
O	her
O	soft
O	paws
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	mount
O	to
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	tub
O	,
O	looking
O	round
O	her
O	knowingly
O	,
O	and
O	barking
O	the
O	prettiest
O	bark
O	that
O	ever
O	was
O	heard
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	her
O	way
O	of
O	enforcing
O	admiration;
O	and
O	being
O	now
O	satisfied
O	with
O	her
O	performance
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	give
O	a
O	goodly
O	number
O	of
O	shakes
O	to
O	her
O	sparkling
O	coat
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	happy
O	and
O	refreshed
O	,
O	crawl
O	into
O	her
O	airy
O	bed
O	in
O	the
O	bull
O	'
O	s-eye
O	,
O	and
O	go
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	The
O	Indian
O	believes
O	the
O	bear
O	to
O	be
O	possessed
O	not
O	only
O	of
O	a
O	wonderful
O	amount
O	of
O	sagacity
O	,
O	but
O	of
O	feelings
O	akin
O	to
O	those
O	of
O	human
O	beings
O	.
O	Though
O	most
O	species
O	are
O	savage
O	when
O	irritated
O	,
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	occasionally
O	exhibit
O	good
O	humour
O	and
O	kindness
O	.
O	A
O	story
O	is
O	told
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	in
O	Russia
O	,
O	who
O	on
O	an
O	expedition
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	honey
O	,
O	climbed
O	into
O	a
O	high
O	tree
O	.
O	The
O	trunk
O	was
O	hollow
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	discovered
O	a
O	large
O	cone
O	within
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	descending
O	to
O	obtain
O	it
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	stuck
O	fast
O	.
O	Unable
O	to
O	extricate
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	too
O	far
O	from
O	home
O	to
O	make
O	his
O	voice
O	heard
O	,
O	he
O	remained
O	in
O	that
O	uncomfortable
O	position
O	for
O	two
O	days
O	,
O	sustaining
O	his
O	life
O	by
O	eating
O	the
O	honey
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	become
O	silent
O	from
O	despair
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	looking
O	up
O	,
O	what
O	was
O	his
O	horror
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	huge
O	bear
O	above
O	him
O	,
O	tempted
O	by
O	the
O	same
O	object
O	which
O	had
O	led
O	him
O	into
O	his
O	dangerous
O	predicament
O	,
O	and
O	about
O	to
O	descend
O	into
O	the
O	interior
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	!
O	Bears--very
O	wisely--when
O	getting
O	into
O	hollows
O	of
O	rocks
O	or
O	trees
O	,
O	go
O	tail-end
O	first
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	may
O	be
O	in
O	a
O	position
O	to
O	move
O	out
O	again
O	when
O	necessary
O	.
O	No
O	sooner
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	his
O	dismay
O	,
O	did
O	the
O	tail
O	of
O	the
O	bear
O	reach
O	him
O	,
O	than
O	the
O	man
O	caught
O	hold
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	animal
O	,
O	astonished
O	at
O	finding
O	some
O	big
O	creature
O	below
O	him
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	only
O	expected
O	to
O	meet
O	with
O	a
O	family
O	of
O	bees
O	,
O	against
O	whose
O	stings
O	his
O	thick
O	hide
O	was
O	impervious
O	,
O	quickly
O	scrambled
O	out
O	again
O	,
O	dragging
O	up
O	the
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	probably
O	shouted
O	right
O	lustily
O	.
O	Be
O	that
O	as
O	it
O	may
O	,
O	the
O	bear
O	waddled
O	off
O	at
O	a
O	quick
O	rate
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	honey-seeker
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	homeward
O	,
O	to
O	relate
O	his
O	adventure
O	,
O	and
O	relieve
O	the
O	anxiety
O	of
O	his
O	family
O	.
O	The
O	brown
O	bear
O	,
O	which
O	lives
O	in
O	Siberia
O	,
O	may
O	be
O	considered
O	among
O	the
O	most
O	good-natured
O	of
O	his
O	tribe
O	.
O	Mr
O	.
O	Atkinson
O	,
O	who
O	travelled
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	,
O	tells
O	us
O	that
O	some
O	peasants--a
O	father
O	and
O	mother--had
O	one
O	day
O	lost
O	two
O	of
O	their
O	children
O	,
O	between
O	four
O	and
O	six
O	years
O	of
O	age
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	soon
O	evident
O	that
O	their
O	young
O	ones
O	had
O	wandered
O	away
O	to
O	a
O	distance
O	from
O	their
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	this
O	discovery
O	was
O	made
O	they
O	set
O	off
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	Having
O	proceeded
O	some
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	wilds
O	,
O	they
O	caught
O	sight
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	of
O	a
O	large
O	animal
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	got
O	nearer
O	,
O	they
O	discovered
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	brown
O	bear;
O	and
O	what
O	was
O	their
O	horror
O	to
O	see
O	within
O	its
O	clutches
O	their
O	lost
O	young
O	ones
O	!
O	Their
O	sensations
O	of
O	dismay
O	were
O	exchanged
O	for
O	astonishment
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	children
O	running
O	about
O	,
O	laughing
O	,
O	round
O	the
O	bear
O	,
O	sometimes
O	taking
O	it
O	by
O	the
O	paws
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	pulling
O	it
O	by
O	the
O	tail
O	.
O	The
O	monster
O	,
O	evidently
O	amused
O	with
O	their
O	behaviour
O	,
O	treated
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	affectionate
O	manner
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	the
O	children
O	now
O	produced
O	some
O	fruit
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	it
O	fed
O	its
O	shaggy
O	playfellow
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	other
O	climbed
O	up
O	on
O	its
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	there
O	,
O	fearlessly
O	urging
O	its
O	strange
O	steed
O	to
O	move
O	on
O	.
O	The
O	parents
O	gave
O	way
O	to
O	cries
O	of
O	terror
O	at
O	seeing
O	the
O	apparent
O	danger
O	to
O	which
O	their
O	offspring
O	were
O	exposed
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	boy
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	having
O	slipped
O	off
O	the
O	bear
O	'
O	s
O	back
O	,
O	the
O	animal
O	,
O	hearing
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	other
O	voices
O	,
O	left
O	the
O	children
O	,
O	and
O	retreated
O	quietly
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	.
