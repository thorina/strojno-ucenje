O	that
O	the
O	wedding
O	could
O	not
O	take
O	place
O	as
O	soon
O	as

O	and
O	wondering
O	where

O	first
O	said
O	the
O	prince
O	as
O	he
O	stepped
O	into
O	the
O	silver
O	boat
O	which
O	floated
O	away
O	so
O	quickly
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	soon
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	of
O	land
O	The
O	day
O	passed
O	and
O	the
O	night
O	fell
O	and
O	the
O	stars
O	shone
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	waters
O	but
O	the
O	boat
O	never
O	stopped
O	On
O	she
O	went
O	for
O	two
O	whole
O	days
O	and
O	nights
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	third
O	morning
O	the
O	prince
O	saw
O	an
O	island
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	and
O	very
O	glad
O	he
O	was
O	for
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	his
O	journey
O	s
O	end
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	almost
O	fainting
O	with
O	thirst
O	and
O	hunger
O	But
O	the
O	day
O	passed
O	and
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	still
O	before
O	him
O	At
O	long
O	last
O	on
O	the
O	following
O	day
O	he
O	saw
O	by
O	the
O	first
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	morning
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	close
O	to
O	it
O	and
O	that
O	trees
O	laden
O	with
O	fruit
O	of
O	every
O	kind
O	were
O	bending
O	down
O	over
O	the
O	water
O	The
O	boat
O	sailed
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	the
O	island
O	going
O	closer
O	and
O	closer
O	every
O	round
O	until
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	drooping
O	branches
O	almost
O	touched
O	it
O	The
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	fruit
O	within
O	his
O	reach
O	made
O	the
O	prince
O	hungrier
O	and
O	thirstier
O	than
O	he
O	was
O	before
O	and
O	forgetting
O	his
O	promise
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	cat
O	not
O	to
O	eat
O	anything
O	until
O	he
O	entered
O	the
O	palace
O	in
O	the
O	unknown
O	seas
O	he
O	caught
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	branches
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	eating
O	the
O	delicious
O	fruit
O	While
O	he
O	was
O	doing
O	so
O	the
O	boat
O	floated
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	and
O	soon
O	was
O	lost
O	to
O	sight
O	but
O	the
O	prince
O	having
O	eaten
O	forgot
O	all
O	about
O	it
O	and
O	worse
O	still
O	forgot
O	all
O	about
O	the
O	princess
O	in
O	the
O	giant
O	s
O	castle
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	eaten
O	enough
O	he
O	descended
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	turning
O	his
O	back
O	on
O	the
O	sea
O	set
O	out
O	straight
O	before
O	him

O	had
O	not
O	gone
O	far
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	music
O	and
O	soon
O	after
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	maidens
O	playing
O	on
O	silver
O	harps
O	coming
O	towards

O	When

O	saw
O	you
O	coming
O	over

O	sent
O	us
O	to
O	bring

O	were
O	fixed
O	on
O	the
O	Princess
O	Kathleen
O	who
O	looked
O	more
O	beautiful
O	than
O	a
O	flower
O	He
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	anyone
O	so
O	lovely
O	for
O	of
O	course
O	he

O	and
O	looking
O	down
O	who

O	cat
O	At
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	him
O	the

O	sad
O	and
O	sorry
O	he
O	was
O	when

O	thought
O	of

O	the
O	days

O	he
O	was
O	very
O	fond
O	of

O	so
O	he
O	did
O	not

O	You

O	when

O	or
O	the
O	left
O	and
O	let
O	no

O	the
O	second
O	ball
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	as
O	you
O	did
O	the
O	first
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	boat
O	comes
O	step
O	in
O	at
O	once
O	Then
O	you
O	may
O	look
O	behind
O	you
O	and
O	you
O	shall
O	see
O	what
O	you

O	which
O	you
O	love
O	best
O	the
O	Princess
O	Eileen
O	or
O	the
O	Princess
O	Kathleen
O	and
O	you
O	can
O	either
O	go
O	or
O	stay
O	The
O	prince
O	didn
O	t
O	sleep
O	a
O	wink
O	that
O	night
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	glimpse
O	of
O	the
O	morning
O	he
O	stole
O	from
O	the
O	palace
O	When
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	sea
O	he
O	threw
O	out
O	the
O	ball
O	and
O	when
O	it
O	had
O	floated
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	little
O	boat
O	sparkling
O	on
O	the
O	horizon
O	like
O	a
O	newly
O	risen
O	star
O	The
O	prince
O	had
O	scarcely
O	passed
O	through
O	the
O	palace
O	doors
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	missed
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	and
O	the
O	princess
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	lords
O	and
O	ladies
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	went
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	him
O	taking
O	the
O	quickest
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	sea
O	While
O	the
O	maidens
O	with
O	the
O	silver
O	harps
O	played
O	sweetest
O	music
O	the
O	princess
O	whose
O	voice
O	was
O	sweeter
O	than
O	any
O	music
O	called
O	on
O	the
O	prince
O	by
O	his
O	name
O	and
O	so
O	moved
O	his
O	heart
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	look
O	behind
O	when
O	he
O	remembered
O	how
O	the
O	cat
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	he
O	should
O	not
O	do
O	so
O	until
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	Just
O	as
O	it
O	touched
O	the
O	shore
O	the
O	princess
O	put
O	out
O	her
O	hand
O	and
O	almost
O	caught
O	the
O	prince
O	s
O	arm
O	but
O	he
O	stepped
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	in
O	time
O	to
O	save
O	himself
O	and
O	it
O	sped
O	away
O	like
O	a
O	receding
O	wave
O	A
O	loud
O	scream
O	caused
O	the
O	prince
O	to
O	look
O	round
O	suddenly
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	did
O	he
O	saw
O	no
O	sign
O	of
O	king
O	or
O	queen
O	or
O	princess
O	or
O	lords
O	or
O	ladies
O	but
O	only
O	big
O	green
O	serpents
O	with
O	red
O	eyes
O	and
O	tongues
O	that
O	hissed
O	out
O	fire
O	and
O	poison
O	as
O	they
O	writhed
O	in
O	a
O	hundred
O	horrible
O	coils
O	The
O	prince
O	having
O	escaped
O	from
O	the
O	enchanted
O	island
O	sailed
O	away
O	for
O	three
O	days
O	and
O	three
O	nights
O	and
O	every
O	night
O	he
O	hoped
O	the
O	coming
O	morning
O	would
O	show
O	him
O	the
O	island
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	He
O	was
O	faint
O	with
O	hunger
O	and
O	beginning
O	to
O	despair
O	when
O	on
O	the
O	fourth
O	morning
O	he
O	saw
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	an
O	island
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	rays
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	gleamed
O	like
O	fire
O	On
O	coming
O	closer
O	to
O	it
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	clad
O	with
O	trees
O	so
O	covered
O	with
O	bright
O	red
O	berries
O	that
O	hardly
O	a
O	leaf
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	Soon
O	the
O	boat
O	was
O	almost
O	within
O	a
O	stone
O	s
O	cast
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	and
O	it
O	began
O	to
O	sail
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	until
O	it
O	was
O	well
O	under
O	the
O	bending
O	branches
O	The
O	scent
O	of
O	the
O	berries
O	was
O	so
O	sweet
O	that
O	it
O	sharpened
O	the
O	prince
O	s
O	hunger
O	and
O	he
O	longed
O	to
O	pluck
O	them
O	but
O	remembering
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	to
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	enchanted
O	island
O	he
O	was
O	afraid
O	to
O	touch
O	them
O	But
O	the
O	boat
O	kept
O	on
O	sailing
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	a
O	great
O	wind
O	rose
O	from
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	shook
O	the
O	branches
O	and
O	the
O	bright
O	sweet
O	berries
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	until
O	it
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	them
O	and
O	they
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	prince
O	s
O	hands
O	and
O	he
O	took
O	up
O	some
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	them
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	looked
O	the
O	desire
O	to
O	eat
O	them
O	grew
O	stronger
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	himself
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	no
O	harm
O	to
O	taste
O	one
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	tasted
O	it
O	the
O	flavor
O	was
O	so
O	delicious
O	he
O	swallowed
O	it
O	and
O	of
O	course
O	at
O	once
O	he
O	forgot
O	all
O	about
O	Eileen
O	and
O	the
O	boat
O	drifted
O	away
O	from
O	him
O	and
O	left
O	him
O	standing
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	He
O	climbed
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	island
O	and
O	having
O	eaten
O	enough
O	of
O	the
O	berries
O	he
O	set
O	out
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	might
O	be
O	before
O	him
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	until
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	and
O	a
O	huge
O	iron
O	ball
O	knocked
O	down
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	trees
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	him
O	and
O	before
O	he
O	knew
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	hundred
O	giants
O	came
O	running
O	after
O	it
O	When
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	prince
O	they
O	turned
O	towards
O	him
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	caught
O	him
O	up
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	held
O	him
O	up
O	that
O	all
O	might
O	see
O	him
O	The
O	prince
O	was
O	nearly
O	squeezed
O	to
O	death
O	and
O	seeing
O	this
O	the
O	giant
O	put
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	again
O	Who
O	are
O	you
O	my
O	little
O	man
O	asked
O	the
O	giant
O	I
O	am
O	a
O	prince
O	replied
O	the
O	prince
O	Oh
O	you
O	are
O	a
O	prince
O	are
O	you
O	said
O	the
O	giant
O	And
O	what
O	are
O	you
O	good
O	for
O	said
O	he
O	The
O	prince
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	for
O	nobody
O	had
O	asked
O	him
O	that
O	question
O	before
O	I
O	know
O	what
O	he
O	s
O	good
O	for
O	said
O	an
O	old
O	giantess
O	with
O	one
O	eye
O	in
O	her
O	forehead
O	and
O	one
O	in
O	her
O	chin
O	I
O	know
O	what
O	he
O	s
O	good
O	for
O	He
O	s
O	good
O	to
O	eat
O	When
O	the
O	giants
O	heard
O	this
O	they
O	laughed
O	so
O	loud
O	that
O	the
O	prince
O	was
O	frightened
O	almost
O	to
O	death
O	Why
O	said
O	one
O	he
O	wouldn
O	t
O	make
O	a
O	mouthful
O	Oh
O	leave
O	him
O	to
O	me
O	said
O	the
O	giantess
O	and
O	I
O	ll
O	fatten
O	him
O	up
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	is
O	cooked
O	and
O	dressed
O	he
O	will
O	be
O	a
O	nice
O	dainty
O	dish
O	for
O	the
O	king
O	The
O	giants
O	on
O	this
O	gave
O	the
O	prince
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	giantess
O	She
O	took
O	him
O	home
O	with
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	kitchen
O	and
O	fed
O	him
O	on
O	sugar
O	and
O	spice
O	and
O	all
O	things
O	nice
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	a
O	sweet
O	morsel
O	for
O	the
O	king
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	when
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	island
O	The
O	poor
O	prince
O	would
O	not
O	eat
O	anything
O	at
O	first
O	but
O	the
O	giantess
O	held
O	him
O	over
O	the
O	fire
O	until
O	his
O	feet
O	were
O	scorched
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	himself
O	it
O	was
O	better
O	to
O	eat
O	than
O	to
O	be
O	burnt
O	alive
O	Well
O	day
O	after
O	day
O	passed
O	and
O	the
O	prince
O	grew
O	sadder
O	and
O	sadder
O	thinking
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	soon
O	be
O	cooked
O	and
O	dressed
O	for
O	the
O	king
O	but
O	sad
O	as
O	the
O	prince
O	was
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	half
O	as
O	sad
O	as
O	the
O	Princess
O	Eileen
O	in
O	the
O	giant
O	s
O	castle
O	watching
O	and
O	waiting
O	for
O	the
O	prince
O	to
O	return
O	and
O	save
O	her
O	And
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	had
O	wound
O	two
O	balls
O	and
O	were
O	winding
O	a
O	third
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	prince
O	heard
O	from
O	the
O	old
O	giantess
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	was
O	to
O	return
O	on
O	the
O	following
O	day
O	and
O	she
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	As
O	this
O	is
O	the
O	last
O	night
O	you
O	have
O	to
O	live
O	tell
O	me
O	if

O	entered
O	a
O	pleasant
O	valley
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of

O	white
O	as
O	snow
O	As

O	approached
O	the
O	central
O	door

O	but
O	when
O	he
O	reached

O	three
O	rows
O	of
O	precious
O	jewels
O	The
O	first
O	was
O	a
O	row
O	of

O	pillar
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	he

O	so
O	when
