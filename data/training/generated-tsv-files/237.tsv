O	,
O	but
O	the

O	to

O	She
O	carefully

O	they

O	for

O	.
O	After

O	acquired
O	more
O	courage
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	venture
O	some

O	from
O	home
O	.
O	His
O	skill
O	and
O	success
O	as
O	a
O	hunter
O	daily
O	increased
O	,
O	and
O	he

O	,
O	moose
O	,

O	At

O	became
O	a
O	great
O	hunter
O	,

O	all
O	that
O	he
O	shot

O	brought

O	with

O	,
O	but

O	.
O	Comparing
O	himself
O	with
O	this
O	great
O	man
O	,
O	he
O	felt
O	that
O	he
O	was

O	He
O	seated
