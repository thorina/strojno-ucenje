O	When
O	I
O	waked
O	it
O	was
O	broad
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	weather
O	clear
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	storm
O	abated
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	sea
O	did
O	not
O	rage
O	and
O	swell
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	But
O	that
O	which
O	surprised
O	me
O	most
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	lifted
O	off
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	from
O	the
O	sand
O	where
O	she
O	lay
O	by
O	the
O	swelling
O	of
O	the
O	tide
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	driven
O	up
O	almost
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	the
O	rock
O	which
O	I
O	at
O	first
O	mentioned
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	bruised
O	by
O	the
O	wave
O	dashing
O	me
O	against
O	it
O	.
O	This
O	being
O	within
O	about
O	a
O	mile
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	where
O	I
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	ship
O	seeming
O	to
O	stand
O	upright
O	still
O	,
O	I
O	wished
O	myself
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	that
O	at
O	least
O	I
O	might
O	save
O	some
O	necessary
O	things
O	for
O	my
O	use
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	came
O	down
O	from
O	my
O	apartment
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	I
O	looked
O	about
O	me
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	first
O	thing
O	I
O	found
O	was
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	which
O	lay
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	wind
O	and
O	the
O	sea
O	had
O	tossed
O	her
O	up
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	about
O	two
O	miles
O	on
O	my
O	right
O	hand
O	.
O	I
O	walked
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	upon
O	the
O	shore
O	to
O	have
O	got
O	to
O	her;
O	but
O	found
O	a
O	neck
O	or
O	inlet
O	of
O	water
O	between
O	me
O	and
O	the
O	boat
O	which
O	was
O	about
O	half
O	a
O	mile
O	broad;
O	so
O	I
O	came
O	back
O	for
O	the
O	present
O	,
O	being
O	more
O	intent
O	upon
O	getting
O	at
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	hoped
O	to
O	find
O	something
O	for
O	my
O	present
O	subsistence
O	.
O	A
O	little
O	after
O	noon
O	I
O	found
O	the
O	sea
O	very
O	calm
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	tide
O	ebbed
O	so
O	far
O	out
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	come
O	within
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	a
O	mile
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	.
O	And
O	here
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	fresh
O	renewing
O	of
O	my
O	grief;
O	for
O	I
O	saw
O	evidently
O	that
O	if
O	we
O	had
O	kept
O	on
O	board
O	we
O	had
O	been
O	all
O	safe--
O	that
O	is
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	we
O	had
O	all
O	got
O	safe
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	so
O	miserable
O	as
O	to
O	be
O	left
O	entirely
O	destitute
O	of
O	all
O	comfort
O	and
O	company
O	as
O	I
O	now
O	was
O	.
O	This
O	forced
O	tears
O	to
O	my
O	eyes
O	again;
O	but
O	as
O	there
O	was
O	little
O	relief
O	in
O	that
O	,
O	I
O	resolved
O	,
O	if
O	possible
O	,
O	to
O	get
O	to
O	the
O	ship;
O	so
O	I
O	pulled
O	off
O	my
O	clothes--for
O	the
O	weather
O	was
O	hot
O	to
O	extremity--and
O	took
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	ship
O	my
O	difficulty
O	was
O	still
O	greater
O	to
O	know
O	how
O	to
O	get
O	on
O	board;
O	for
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	lay
O	aground
O	,
O	and
O	high
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	within
O	my
O	reach
O	to
O	lay
O	hold
O	of
O	.
O	I
O	swam
O	round
O	her
O	twice
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	second
O	time
O	I
O	spied
O	a
O	small
O	piece
O	of
O	rope
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	wondered
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	see
O	at
O	first
O	,
O	hung
O	down
O	by
O	the
O	fore-chains
O	so
O	low
O	as
O	that
O	with
O	great
O	difficulty
O	I
O	got
O	hold
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	that
O	rope
O	I
O	got
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	forecastle
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	.
O	Here
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	bulged
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	water
O	in
O	her
O	hold
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	she
O	lay
O	so
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	a
O	bank
O	of
O	hard
O	sand
O	,
O	or
O	rather
O	earth
O	,
O	that
O	her
O	stern
O	lay
O	lifted
O	up
O	upon
O	the
O	bank
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	head
O	low
O	,
O	almost
O	to
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	means
O	all
O	her
O	quarter
O	was
O	free
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	that
O	was
O	in
O	that
O	part
O	was
O	dry;
O	for
O	you
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	my
O	first
O	work
O	was
O	to
O	search
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	was
O	spoiled
O	and
O	what
O	was
O	free
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	first
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	ship
O	'
O	s
O	provisions
O	were
O	dry
O	and
O	untouched
O	by
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	being
O	very
O	well
O	disposed
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	bread-room
O	and
O	filled
O	my
O	pockets
O	with
O	biscuit
O	,
O	and
O	ate
O	it
O	as
O	I
O	went
O	about
O	other
O	things
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	time
O	to
O	lose
O	.
O	I
O	also
O	found
O	some
O	rum
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	cabin
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	took
O	a
O	large
O	dram
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	need
O	enough
O	of
O	to
O	spirit
O	me
O	for
O	what
O	was
O	before
O	me
O	.
O	Now
O	I
O	wanted
O	nothing
O	but
O	a
O	boat
O	to
O	furnish
O	myself
O	with
O	many
O	things
O	which
O	I
O	foresaw
O	would
O	be
O	very
O	necessary
O	to
O	me
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	to
O	sit
O	still
O	and
O	wish
O	for
O	what
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	had;
O	and
O	this
O	extremity
O	roused
O	my
O	application
O	.
O	We
O	had
O	several
O	spare
O	yards
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	large
O	spars
O	of
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	spare
O	topmast
O	or
O	two
O	in
O	the
O	ship;
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	fall
O	to
O	work
O	with
O	these
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	flung
O	as
O	many
O	of
O	them
O	overboard
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	manage
O	for
O	their
O	weight
O	,
O	tying
O	every
O	one
O	with
O	a
O	rope
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	not
O	drive
O	away
O	.
O	When
O	this
O	was
O	done
O	I
O	went
O	down
O	the
O	ship
O	'
O	s
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	pulling
O	them
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	tied
O	four
O	of
O	them
O	together
O	at
O	both
O	ends
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	a
O	raft
O	,
O	and
O	laying
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	short
O	pieces
O	of
O	plank
O	upon
O	them
O	crossways
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	I
O	could
O	walk
O	upon
O	it
O	very
O	well
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	bear
O	any
O	great
O	weight
O	,
O	the
O	pieces
O	being
O	too
O	light
O	.
O	So
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	work
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	carpenter
O	'
O	s
O	saw
O	I
O	cut
O	a
O	spare
O	topmast
O	into
O	three
O	lengths
O	,
O	and
O	added
O	them
O	to
O	my
O	raft
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	labor
O	and
O	pains
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	furnishing
O	myself
O	with
O	necessaries
O	encouraged
O	me
O	to
O	go
O	beyond
O	what
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	have
O	done
O	upon
O	another
O	occasion
O	.
O	My
O	raft
O	was
O	now
O	strong
O	enough
O	to
O	bear
O	any
O	reasonable
O	weight
O	.
O	My
O	next
O	care
O	was
O	what
O	to
O	load
O	it
O	with
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	to
O	preserve
O	what
O	I
O	laid
O	upon
O	it
O	from
O	the
O	surf
O	of
O	the
O	sea;
O	but
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	considering
O	this
O	.
O	I
O	first
O	laid
O	all
O	the
O	planks
O	or
O	boards
O	upon
O	it
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	get
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	considered
O	well
O	what
O	I
O	most
O	wanted
O	,
O	I
O	got
O	three
O	of
O	the
O	seamen
O	'
O	s
O	chests
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	broken
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	emptied
O	,
O	and
O	lowered
O	them
O	down
O	upon
O	my
O	raft;
O	the
O	first
O	of
O	these
O	I
O	filled
O	with
O	provisions;
O	viz
O	.
O	,
O	bread
O	,
O	rice
O	,
O	three
O	Dutch
O	cheeses
O	,
O	five
O	pieces
O	of
O	dried
O	goat
O	'
O	s
O	flesh
O	(
O	which
O	we
O	lived
O	much
O	upon
O	)
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	little
O	remainder
O	of
O	European
O	corn
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	laid
O	by
O	for
O	some
O	fowls
O	which
O	we
O	brought
O	to
O	sea
O	with
O	us
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	fowls
O	were
O	killed
O	.
O	There
O	had
O	been
O	some
O	barley
O	and
O	wheat
O	together;
O	but
O	,
O	to
O	my
O	great
O	disappointment
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	afterwards
O	that
O	the
O	rats
O	had
O	eaten
O	or
O	spoiled
O	it
O	all
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	liquors
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	several
O	cases
O	of
O	bottles
O	belonging
O	to
O	our
O	skipper
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	were
O	some
O	cordial
O	waters;
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	all
O	,
O	about
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	gallons
O	of
O	rack
O	.
O	These
O	I
O	stowed
O	by
O	themselves
O	,
O	there
O	being
O	no
O	need
O	to
O	put
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	chest
O	,
O	nor
O	any
O	room
O	for
O	them
O	.
O	While
O	I
O	was
O	doing
O	this
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	the
O	tide
O	begin
O	to
O	flow
O	,
O	though
O	very
O	calm;
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	mortification
O	to
O	see
O	my
O	coat
O	,
O	shirt
O	,
O	and
O	waistcoat
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	sand
O	,
O	swim
O	away
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	my
O	breeches
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	only
O	linen
O	,
O	and
O	open-kneed
O	,
O	I
O	swam
O	on
O	board
O	in
O	them
O	and
O	my
O	stockings
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	this
O	set
O	me
O	on
O	rummaging
O	for
O	clothes
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	enough
O	,
O	but
O	took
O	no
O	more
O	than
O	I
O	wanted
O	for
O	present
O	use
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	other
O	things
O	which
O	my
O	eye
O	was
O	more
O	upon--as
O	,
O	first
O	,
O	tools
O	to
O	work
O	with
O	on
O	shore
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	was
O	after
O	long
O	searching
O	that
O	I
O	found
O	out
O	the
O	carpenter
O	'
O	s
O	chest
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	a
O	very
O	useful
O	prize
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	much
O	more
O	valuable
O	than
O	a
O	ship-load
O	of
O	gold
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	.
O	I
O	got
O	it
O	down
O	to
O	my
O	raft
O	,
O	whole
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	without
O	losing
O	time
O	to
O	look
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	knew
O	in
O	general
O	what
O	it
O	contained
O	.
O	My
O	next
O	care
O	was
O	for
O	some
O	ammunition
O	and
O	arms
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	two
O	very
O	good
O	fowling-pieces
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	cabin
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	pistols
O	.
O	These
O	I
O	secured
O	first
O	,
O	with
O	some
O	powder-horns
O	and
O	a
O	small
O	bag
O	of
O	shot
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	old
O	rusty
O	swords
O	.
O	I
O	knew
O	there
O	were
O	three
O	barrels
O	of
O	powder
O	in
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	but
O	knew
O	not
O	where
O	our
O	gunner
O	had
O	stowed
O	them;
O	but
O	with
O	much
O	search
O	I
O	found
O	them
O	,
O	two
O	of
O	them
O	dry
O	and
O	good
O	,
O	the
O	third
O	had
O	taken
O	water
O	.
O	Those
O	two
O	I
O	got
O	to
O	my
O	raft
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	arms
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	I
O	thought
O	myself
O	pretty
O	well
O	freighted
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	how
O	I
O	should
O	get
O	to
O	shore
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	having
O	neither
O	sail
O	,
O	oar
O	,
O	nor
O	rudder;
O	and
O	the
O	least
O	capful
O	of
O	wind
O	would
O	have
O	overset
O	all
O	my
O	navigation
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	three
O	encouragements--1st
O	,
O	a
O	smooth
O	calm
O	sea;
O	2ndly
O	,
O	the
O	tide
O	rising
O	,
O	and
O	setting
O	in
O	to
O	the
O	shore;
O	3dly
O	,
O	what
O	little
O	wind
O	there
O	was
O	blew
O	me
O	towards
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	And
O	thus
O	,
O	having
O	found
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	broken
O	oars
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
O	boat--and
O	,
O	besides
O	the
O	tools
O	which
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	chest
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	two
O	saws
O	,
O	an
O	axe
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	hammer--
O	with
O	this
O	cargo
O	I
O	put
O	to
O	sea
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	mile
O	or
O	thereabouts
O	my
O	raft
O	went
O	very
O	well
O	,
O	only
O	that
O	I
O	found
O	it
O	drive
O	a
O	little
O	distant
O	from
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	landed
O	before;
O	by
O	which
O	I
O	perceived
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	some
O	indraft
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	consequently
O	I
O	hoped
O	to
O	find
O	some
O	creek
O	or
O	river
O	there
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	might
O	make
O	use
O	of
O	as
O	a
O	port
O	to
O	get
O	to
O	land
O	with
O	my
O	cargo
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	imagined
O	,
O	so
O	it
O	was
O	.
O	There
O	appeared
O	before
O	me
O	a
O	little
O	opening
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	strong
O	current
O	of
O	the
O	tide
O	set
O	into
O	it;
O	so
O	I
O	guided
O	my
O	raft
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	to
O	keep
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	stream
O	.
O	But
O	here
O	I
O	had
O	like
O	to
O	have
O	suffered
O	a
O	second
O	shipwreck
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	,
O	I
O	think
O	verily
O	would
O	have
O	broken
O	my
O	heart;
O	for
O	,
O	knowing
O	nothing
O	of
O	the
O	coast
O	,
O	my
O	raft
O	ran
O	aground
O	at
O	one
O	end
O	of
O	it
O	upon
O	a
O	shoal
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	not
O	being
O	aground
O	at
O	the
O	other
O	end
O	,
O	it
O	wanted
O	but
O	a
O	little
O	that
O	all
O	my
O	cargo
O	had
O	slipped
O	off
O	towards
O	the
O	end
O	that
O	was
O	afloat
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	fallen
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	I
O	did
O	my
O	utmost
O	,
O	by
O	setting
O	my
O	back
O	against
O	the
O	chests
O	,
O	to
O	keep
O	them
O	in
O	their
O	places
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	thrust
O	off
O	the
O	raft
O	with
O	all
O	my
O	strength;
O	neither
O	durst
O	I
O	stir
O	from
O	the
O	posture
O	I
O	was
O	in;
O	but
O	,
O	holding
O	up
O	the
O	chests
O	with
O	all
O	my
O	might
O	,
O	I
O	stood
O	in
O	that
O	manner
O	near
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	time
O	the
O	rising
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	brought
O	me
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	upon
O	a
O	level;
O	and
O	a
O	little
O	after
O	,
O	the
O	water
O	still
O	rising
O	,
O	my
O	raft
O	floated
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	thrust
O	her
O	off
O	with
O	the
O	oar
O	I
O	had
O	into
O	the
O	channel
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	driving
O	up
O	higher
O	I
O	at
O	length
O	found
O	myself
O	in
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	river
O	,
O	with
O	land
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	strong
O	current
O	of
O	tide
O	running
O	up
O	.
O	I
O	looked
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	for
O	a
O	proper
O	place
O	to
O	get
O	to
O	shore
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	willing
O	to
O	be
O	driven
O	too
O	high
O	up
O	the
O	river:
O	hoping
O	in
O	time
O	to
O	see
O	some
O	ships
O	at
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	resolved
O	to
O	place
O	myself
O	as
O	near
O	the
O	coast
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	I
O	spied
O	a
O	little
O	cove
O	on
O	the
O	right
O	shore
O	of
O	the
O	creek
O	,
O	to
O	which
O	with
O	great
O	pain
O	and
O	difficulty
O	I
O	guided
O	my
O	raft
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	got
O	so
O	near
O	that
O	,
O	reaching
O	ground
O	with
O	my
O	oar
O	,
O	I
O	could
O	thrust
O	her
O	directly
O	in
O	.
O	But
O	here
O	I
O	had
O	like
O	to
O	have
O	dipped
O	all
O	my
O	cargo
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	again;
O	for
O	that
O	shore
O	lying
O	pretty
O	steep--that
O	is
O	to
O	say
O	sloping--there
O	was
O	no
O	place
O	to
O	land
O	,
O	but
O	where
O	one
O	end
O	of
O	my
O	float
O	,
O	if
O	it
O	ran
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	would
O	lie
O	so
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	sink
O	lower
O	,
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	endanger
O	my
O	cargo
O	again
O	.
O	All
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	do
O	was
O	to
O	wait
O	till
O	the
O	tide
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	highest
O	,
O	keeping
O	the
O	raft
O	with
O	my
O	oar
O	like
O	an
O	anchor
O	,
O	to
O	hold
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	it
O	fast
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	near
O	a
O	flat
O	piece
O	of
O	ground
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	expected
O	the
O	water
O	would
O	flow
O	over;
O	and
O	so
O	it
O	did
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	I
O	found
O	water
O	enough--for
O	my
O	raft
O	drew
O	about
O	a
O	foot
O	of
O	water--I
O	thrust
O	her
O	upon
O	that
O	flat
O	piece
O	of
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	fastened
O	or
O	moored
O	her
O	,
O	by
O	sticking
O	my
O	two
O	broken
O	oars
O	into
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	one
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	near
O	one
O	end
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	near
O	the
O	other
O	end;
O	and
O	thus
O	I
O	lay
O	till
O	the
O	water
O	ebbed
O	away
O	and
O	left
O	my
O	raft
O	and
O	all
O	my
O	cargo
O	safe
O	on
O	shore
O	.
O	My
O	next
O	work
O	was
O	to
O	view
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	seek
O	a
O	proper
O	place
O	for
O	my
O	habitation
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	to
O	stow
O	my
O	goods
O	to
O	secure
O	them
O	from
O	whatever
O	might
O	happen
O	.
O	Where
O	I
O	was
O	,
O	I
O	yet
O	knew
O	not;
O	whether
O	on
O	the
O	continent
O	or
O	on
O	an
O	island;
O	whether
O	inhabited
O	or
O	not
O	inhabited;
O	whether
O	in
O	danger
O	of
O	wild
O	beasts
O	or
O	not
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	hill
O	not
O	above
O	a
O	mile
O	from
O	me
O	,
O	which
O	rose
O	up
O	very
O	steep
O	and
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	seemed
O	to
O	overtop
O	some
O	other
O	hills
O	,
O	which
O	lay
O	as
O	in
O	a
O	ridge
O	from
O	it
O	northward
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	out
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	fowling-pieces
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	pistols
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	horn
O	of
O	powder;
O	and
O	thus
O	armed
O	I
O	travelled
O	for
O	discovery
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	that
O	hill
O	,
O	where
O	,
O	after
O	I
O	had
O	with
O	great
O	labor
O	and
O	difficulty
O	got
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	my
O	fate
O	,
O	to
O	my
O	great
O	affliction--viz
O	.
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	an
O	island
O	environed
O	every
O	way
O	with
O	the
O	sea:
O	no
O	land
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	except
O	some
O	rocks
O	,
O	which
O	lay
O	a
O	great
O	way
O	off;
O	and
O	two
O	small
O	islands
O	,
O	less
O	than
O	this
O	,
O	which
O	lay
O	about
O	three
O	leagues
O	to
O	the
O	west
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	also
O	that
O	the
O	island
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	was
O	barren
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	saw
O	good
O	reason
O	to
O	believe
O	,
O	uninhabited
O	except
O	by
O	wild
O	beasts
O	,
O	of
O	whom
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	none
O	.
O	Yet
O	I
O	saw
O	abundance
O	of
O	fowls
O	,
O	but
O	knew
O	not
O	their
O	kinds;
O	neither
O	when
O	I
O	killed
O	them
O	could
O	I
O	tell
O	what
O	was
O	fit
O	for
O	food
O	,
O	and
O	what
O	not
O	.
O	At
O	my
O	coming
O	back
O	,
O	I
O	shot
O	at
O	a
O	great
O	bird
O	which
O	I
O	saw
O	sitting
O	upon
O	a
O	tree
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	wood
O	.
O	I
O	believe
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	gun
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	fired
O	there
O	since
O	the
O	creation
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	fired
O	than
O	from
O	all
O	parts
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	there
O	arose
O	an
O	innumerable
O	number
O	of
O	fowls
O	,
O	of
O	many
O	sorts
O	,
O	making
O	a
O	confused
O	screaming
O	and
O	crying
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	one
O	according
O	to
O	his
O	usual
O	note
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	of
O	any
O	kind
O	that
O	I
O	knew
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	creature
O	I
O	killed
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	hawk
O	,
O	its
O	color
O	and
O	beak
O	resembling
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	had
O	no
O	talons
O	or
O	claws
O	more
O	than
O	common
O	.
O	Its
O	flesh
O	was
O	carrion
O	,
O	and
O	fit
O	for
O	nothing
O	.
O	Contented
O	with
O	this
O	discovery
O	,
O	I
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	my
O	raft
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	to
O	work
O	to
O	bring
O	my
O	cargo
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	which
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	that
O	day
O	.
O	What
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	myself
O	at
O	night
O	I
O	knew
O	not
O	,
O	nor
O	indeed
O	where
O	to
O	rest
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	was
O	afraid
O	to
O	lie
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	not
O	knowing
O	but
O	some
O	wild
O	beast
O	might
O	devour
O	me
O	,
O	though
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	afterwards
O	found
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	really
O	no
O	need
O	for
O	those
O	fears
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	I
O	barricaded
O	myself
O	round
O	with
O	the
O	chests
O	and
O	boards
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	brought
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	hut
O	for
O	that
O	night
O	'
O	s
O	lodging
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	food
O	,
O	I
O	yet
O	saw
O	not
O	which
O	way
O	to
O	supply
O	myself
O	,
O	except
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	seen
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	creatures
O	like
O	hares
O	run
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	where
O	I
O	shot
O	the
O	fowl
O	.
O	I
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	consider
O	that
O	I
O	might
O	yet
O	get
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	things
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	which
O	would
O	be
O	useful
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	particularly
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	rigging
O	and
O	sails
O	,
O	and
O	such
O	other
O	things
O	as
O	might
O	come
O	to
O	land;
O	and
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	make
O	another
O	voyage
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	vessel
O	,
O	if
O	possible
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	I
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	first
O	storm
O	that
O	blew
O	must
O	necessarily
O	break
O	her
O	all
O	in
O	pieces
O	,
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	set
O	all
O	other
O	things
O	apart
O	till
O	I
O	had
O	got
O	everything
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	get
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	called
O	a
O	council--that
O	is
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	in
O	my
O	thoughts--whether
O	I
O	should
O	take
O	back
O	the
O	raft;
O	but
O	this
O	appeared
O	impracticable;
O	so
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	tide
O	was
O	down;
O	and
O	I
O	did
O	so
O	,
O	only
O	that
O	I
O	stripped
O	before
O	I
O	went
O	from
O	my
O	hut
O	,
O	having
O	nothing
O	on
O	but
O	my
O	chequered
O	shirt
O	,
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	linen
O	drawers
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	pumps
O	on
O	my
O	feet
O	.
O	I
O	got
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	ship
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	prepared
O	a
O	second
O	raft;
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	had
O	experience
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	,
O	I
O	neither
O	made
O	this
O	so
O	unwieldy
O	nor
O	loaded
O	it
O	so
O	hard
O	,
O	but
O	yet
O	I
O	brought
O	away
O	several
O	things
O	very
O	useful
O	to
O	me;
O	as
O	first
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	carpenter
O	'
O	s
O	stores
O	I
O	found
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	bags
O	full
O	of
O	nails
O	and
O	spikes
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	screwjack
O	,
O	a
O	dozen
O	or
O	two
O	of
O	hatchets
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	above
O	all
O	,
O	that
O	most
O	useful
O	thing
O	called
O	a
O	grindstone
O	.
O	All
O	these
O	I
O	secured
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	several
O	things
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
O	gunner
O	,
O	particularly
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	iron
O	crows
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	barrels
O	of
O	musket
O	bullets
O	,
O	seven
O	muskets
O	,
O	another
O	fowling-piece
O	,
O	with
O	some
O	small
O	quantity
O	of
O	powder
O	more;
O	a
O	large
O	bagful
O	of
O	small
O	shot
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	roll
O	of
O	sheet-
O	lead;
O	but
O	this
O	last
O	was
O	so
O	heavy
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	hoist
O	it
O	up
O	to
O	get
O	it
O	over
O	the
O	ship
O	'
O	s
O	side
O	.
O	Besides
O	these
O	things
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	all
O	the
O	men
O	'
O	s
O	clothes
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	find
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	spare
O	fore-topsail
O	,
O	a
O	hammock
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	bedding
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	this
O	I
O	loaded
O	my
O	second
O	raft
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	them
O	all
O	safe
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	to
O	my
O	very
O	great
O	comfort
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	under
O	some
O	apprehension
O	,
O	during
O	my
O	absence
O	from
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	that
O	at
O	least
O	my
O	provisions
O	might
O	be
O	devoured
O	on
O	shore:
O	but
O	when
O	I
O	came
O	back
O	I
O	found
O	no
O	sign
O	of
O	any
O	visitor;
O	only
O	there
O	sat
O	a
O	creature
O	like
O	a
O	wild
O	cat
O	upon
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	chests
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	came
O	towards
O	it
O	,
O	ran
O	away
O	a
O	little
O	distance
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	stood
O	still
O	.
O	She
O	sat
O	very
O	composed
O	and
O	unconcerned
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	full
O	in
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	mind
O	to
O	be
O	acquainted
O	with
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	presented
O	my
O	gun
O	at
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	understand
O	it
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	perfectly
O	unconcerned
O	at
O	it
O	,
O	nor
O	did
O	she
O	offer
O	to
O	stir
O	away;
O	upon
O	which
O	I
O	tossed
O	her
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	biscuit
O	,
O	though
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	very
O	free
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	for
O	my
O	store
O	was
O	not
O	great:
O	however
O	,
O	I
O	spared
O	her
O	a
O	bit
O	,
O	I
O	say
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	smelled
O	at
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	ate
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	(
O	as
O	if
O	pleased
O	)
O	for
O	more;
O	but
O	I
O	thanked
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	spare
O	no
O	more
O	,
O	so
O	she
O	marched
O	off
O	.
O	Having
O	got
O	my
O	second
O	cargo
O	on
O	shore--though
O	I
O	was
O	fain
O	to
O	open
O	the
O	barrels
O	of
O	powder
O	,
O	and
O	bring
O	them
O	by
O	parcels
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	too
O	heavy
O	,
O	being
O	large
O	casks--I
O	went
O	to
O	work
O	to
O	make
O	me
O	a
O	little
O	tent
O	with
O	the
O	sail
O	and
O	some
O	poles
O	which
O	I
O	cut
O	for
O	that
O	purpose
O	,
O	and
O	into
O	this
O	tent
O	I
O	brought
O	everything
O	that
O	I
O	knew
O	would
O	spoil
O	either
O	with
O	rain
O	or
O	sun;
O	and
O	I
O	piled
O	all
O	the
O	empty
O	chests
O	and
O	casks
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	circle
O	round
O	the
O	tent
O	,
O	to
O	fortify
O	it
O	from
O	any
O	sudden
O	attempt
O	,
O	either
O	from
O	man
O	or
O	beast
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	done
O	this
O	,
O	I
O	blocked
O	up
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	tent
O	with
O	some
O	boards
O	within
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	empty
O	chest
O	set
O	up
O	on
O	end
O	without;
O	and
O	spreading
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	beds
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	laying
O	my
O	two
O	pistols
O	just
O	at
O	my
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	gun
O	at
O	length
O	by
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	bed
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	slept
O	very
O	quietly
O	all
O	night
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	was
O	very
O	weary
O	and
O	heavy;
O	for
O	the
O	night
O	before
O	I
O	had
O	slept
O	little
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	labored
O	very
O	hard
O	all
O	day
O	to
O	fetch
O	all
O	those
O	things
O	from
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	get
O	them
O	on
O	shore
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	biggest
O	magazine
O	of
O	all
O	kinds
O	now
O	that
O	ever
O	was
O	laid
O	up
O	,
O	I
O	believe
O	,
O	for
O	one
O	man;
O	but
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	satisfied
O	still
O	,
O	for
O	while
O	the
O	ship
O	sat
O	upright
O	in
O	that
O	posture
O	I
O	thought
O	I
O	ought
O	to
O	get
O	everything
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	that
O	I
O	could:
O	so
O	every
O	day
O	at
O	low
O	water
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	away
O	something
O	or
O	other;
O	but
O	particularly
O	the
O	third
O	time
O	I
O	went
O	I
O	brought
O	away
O	as
O	much
O	of
O	the
O	rigging
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	as
O	also
O	all
O	the
O	small
O	ropes
O	and
O	rope-twines
O	I
O	could
O	get
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	spare
O	canvas
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	to
O	mend
O	the
O	sails
O	upon
O	occasion
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	barrel
O	of
O	wet
O	gunpowder
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	I
O	brought
O	away
O	all
O	the
O	sails
O	,
O	first
O	and
O	last;
O	only
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	fain
O	to
O	cut
O	them
O	in
O	pieces
O	,
O	and
O	bring
O	as
O	much
O	at
O	a
O	time
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	no
O	more
O	useful
O	to
O	be
O	sails
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	mere
O	canvas
O	only
O	.
O	But
O	that
O	which
O	comforted
O	me
O	more
O	still
O	was
O	that
O	last
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	after
O	I
O	had
O	made
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	such
O	voyages
O	as
O	these
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	I
O	had
O	nothing
O	more
O	to
O	expect
O	from
O	the
O	ship
O	that
O	was
O	worth
O	my
O	meddling
O	with--I
O	say
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	this
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	great
O	hogshead
O	of
O	bread
O	,
O	three
O	large
O	runlets
O	of
O	rum
O	,
O	or
O	spirits
O	,
O	a
O	box
O	of
O	sugar
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	barrel
O	of
O	fine
O	flour;
O	this
O	was
O	surprising
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	because
O	I
O	had
O	given
O	over
O	expecting
O	any
O	more
O	provisions
O	,
O	except
O	what
O	was
O	spoiled
O	by
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	I
O	soon
O	emptied
O	the
O	hogshead
O	of
O	the
O	bread
O	,
O	and
O	wrapped
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	parcel
O	by
O	parcel
O	,
O	in
O	pieces
O	of
O	the
O	sails
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	cut
O	out;
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	I
O	got
O	all
O	this
O	safe
O	on
O	shore
O	also
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	I
O	made
O	another
O	voyage
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	,
O	having
O	plundered
O	the
O	ship
O	of
O	what
O	was
O	portable
O	and
O	fit
O	to
O	hand
O	out
O	,
O	I
O	began
O	with
O	the
O	cables
O	.
O	Cutting
O	the
O	great
O	cable
O	into
O	pieces
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	move
O	,
O	I
O	got
O	two
O	cables
O	and
O	a
O	hawser
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	ironwork
O	I
O	could
O	get;
O	and
O	having
O	cut
O	down
O	the
O	spritsail-yard
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	mizzen-
O	yard
O	,
O	and
O	everything
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	large
O	raft
O	,
O	I
O	loaded
O	it
O	with
O	all
O	these
O	heavy
O	goods
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	away
O	.
O	But
O	my
O	good
O	luck
O	began
O	now
O	to
O	leave
O	me;
O	for
O	this
O	raft
O	was
O	so
O	unwieldy
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	overladen
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	after
O	I
O	had
O	entered
O	the
O	little
O	cove
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	landed
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	my
O	goods
O	,
O	not
O	being
O	able
O	to
O	guide
O	it
O	so
O	handily
O	as
O	I
O	did
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	it
O	overset
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	me
O	and
O	all
O	my
O	cargo
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	myself
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	great
O	harm
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	was
O	near
O	the
O	shore;
O	but
O	as
O	to
O	my
O	cargo
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	part
O	of
O	it
O	lost
O	,
O	especially
O	the
O	iron
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	expected
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	of
O	great
O	use
O	to
O	me;
O	however
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	tide
O	was
O	out
O	,
O	I
O	got
O	most
O	of
O	the
O	pieces
O	of
O	the
O	cable
O	ashore
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	iron
O	,
O	though
O	with
O	infinite
O	labor;
O	for
O	I
O	was
O	fain
O	to
O	dip
O	for
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	a
O	work
O	which
O	fatigued
O	me
O	very
O	much
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	every
O	day
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	away
O	what
O	I
O	could
O	get
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	now
O	thirteen
O	days
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	been
O	eleven
O	times
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	time
O	I
O	had
O	brought
O	away
O	all
O	that
O	one
O	pair
O	of
O	hands
O	could
O	well
O	be
O	supposed
O	capable
O	to
O	bring;
O	though
O	I
O	believe
O	verily
O	,
O	had
O	the
O	calm
O	weather
O	held
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	brought
O	away
O	the
O	whole
O	ship
O	,
O	piece
O	by
O	piece
O	.
O	But
O	preparing
O	the
O	twelfth
O	time
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	the
O	wind
O	began
O	to
O	rise;
O	however
O	,
O	at
O	low
O	water
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	though
O	I
O	thought
O	I
O	had
O	rummaged
O	the
O	cabin
O	so
O	effectually
O	that
O	nothing
O	more
O	could
O	be
O	found
O	,
O	yet
O	I
O	discovered
O	a
O	locker
O	with
O	drawers
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	razors
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	pair
O	of
O	large
O	scissors
O	,
O	with
O	some
O	ten
O	or
O	a
O	dozen
O	of
O	good
O	knives
O	and
O	forks:
O	in
O	another
O	I
O	found
O	about
O	thirty-six
O	pounds
O	value
O	in
O	money--some
O	European
O	coin
O	,
O	some
O	Brazil
O	,
O	some
O	pieces
O	of
O	eight
O	,
O	some
O	gold
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	silver
O	.
O	I
O	smiled
O	to
O	myself
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	this
O	money:

O	However
O	,
O	upon
O	second
O	thoughts
O	I
O	took
O	it
O	away;
O	and
O	,
O	wrapping
O	all
O	this
O	in
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	canvas
O	,
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	making
O	another
O	raft;
O	but
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	preparing
O	this
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	the
O	sky
O	overcast
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wind
O	began
O	to
O	rise
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	it
O	blew
O	a
O	fresh
O	gale
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	It
O	presently
O	occurred
O	to
O	me
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	to
O	pretend
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	raft
O	with
O	the
O	wind
O	off
O	shore;
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	my
O	business
O	to
O	be
O	gone
O	before
O	the
O	tide
O	of
O	flood
O	began
O	,
O	otherwise
O	I
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	reach
O	the
O	shore
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	I
O	let
O	myself
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	swam
O	across
O	the
O	channel
O	which
O	lay
O	between
O	the
O	ship
O	and
O	the
O	sands
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	that
O	with
O	difficulty
O	enough
O	,
O	partly
O	with
O	the
O	weight
O	of
O	the
O	things
O	I
O	had
O	about
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	partly
O	the
O	roughness
O	of
O	the
O	water;
O	for
O	the
O	wind
O	rose
O	very
O	hastily
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	high
O	water
O	it
O	blew
O	a
O	storm
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	had
O	got
O	home
O	to
O	my
O	little
O	tent
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	lay
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	my
O	wealth
O	about
O	me
O	,
O	very
O	secure
O	.
O	It
O	blew
O	very
O	hard
O	all
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	looked
O	out
O	,
O	behold
O	,
O	no
O	more
O	ship
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	!
O	I
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	surprised
O	,
O	but
O	recovered
O	myself
O	with
O	the
O	satisfactory
O	reflection
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	lost
O	no
O	time
O	,
O	nor
O	abated
O	any
O	diligence
O	,
O	to
O	get
O	everything
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	that
O	could
O	be
O	useful
O	to
O	me;
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	little
O	left
O	in
O	her
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	bring
O	away
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	had
O	more
O	time
O	.
