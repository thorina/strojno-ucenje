O	There
O	were
O	once
O	three
O	bears
O	who
O	lived
O	together
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	house
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	a
O	wood
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	was
O	a
O	Little
O	,
O	Small
O	,
O	Wee
O	Bear;
O	one
O	was
O	a
O	Middle-Sized
O	Bear;
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	was
O	a
O	Great
O	,
O	Huge
O	Bear
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	each
O	had
O	a
O	pot
O	to
O	eat
O	their
O	porridge
O	from:
O	a
O	little
O	pot
O	for
O	the
O	Little
O	,
O	Small
O	,
O	Wee
O	Bear;
O	a
O	middle-sized
O	pot
O	for

O	and
O	a
O	great
O	big
O	pot
O	for
O	the
O	Great
O	,
O	Huge
O	Bear
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	each
O	had
O	a
O	chair
O	to
O	sit
O	on:
O	a
O	little
O	chair
O	for
O	the
O	Little
O	,
O	Small
O	,
O	Wee
O	Bear;
O	a
O	middle-sized
O	chair
O	for
O	the
O	Middle-Sized
O	Bear;
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	big
O	chair
O	for
O	the
O	Great
O	,
O	Huge
O	Bear
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	each
O	had
O	a
O	bed
O	to
O	sleep
O	in:
O	a
O	little
O	bed
O	for
O	the
O	Little
O	,

O	a
O	great
O	big
O	bed
O	for
O	the
O	Great
O	,
O	Huge
O	Bear
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	they
O	made
O	the
O	porridge
O	for
O	their
O	breakfast
O	,
O	and
O	poured
O	it
O	into
O	their
O	porridge-pots
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	went
O	out
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	for
O	a
O	walk
O	while
O	the
O	porridge
O	for
O	their
O	breakfast
O	was
O	cooling
O	.
O	And
O	while
O	they
O	were
O	out
O	walking
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	Old
O	Woman
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	house
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	peeped
O	inside
O	.
O	First
O	she
O	peeped
O	through
O	the
O	keyhole;
O	then
O	she
O	peeped
O	through
O	the
O	window
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	lifted
O	the
O	latch
O	and
O	peeped
O	through
O	the
O	doorway;
O	and
O	,
O	seeing
O	nobody
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	she
O	walked
O	in
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	porridge
O	cooling
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	she
O	was
O	very
O	pleased
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	had
O	walked
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	getting
O	hungry
O	.
O	So
O	first
O	she
O	tasted
O	the
O	porridge
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	,
O	Huge
O	Bear
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	was
O	too
O	hot
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	tasted
O	the
O	porridge
O	of
O	the
O	Middle-Sized
O	Bear
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	was
O	too
O	cold
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	she
O	tasted
O	the
O	porridge
O	of
O	the
O	Little
O	,
O	Small
O	,
O	Wee
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	was
O	neither
O	too
O	hot
O	nor
O	too
O	cold
O	,
O	but
O	just
O	right
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	liked
O	it
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	she
O	ate
O	it
O	all
O	up
O	!
O	Then
O	the
O	little
O	Old
O	Woman
O	sat
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	chair
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	,
O	Huge
O	Bear
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	was
O	too
O	hard
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	sat
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	chair
O	of
O	the
O	Middle-Sized
O	Bear
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	was
O	too
O	soft
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	sat
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	chair
O	of
O	the
O	Little
O	,
O	Small
O	,
O	Wee
O	Bear
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	was
O	neither
O	too
O	hard
O	nor
O	too
O	soft
O	,
O	but
O	just
O	right
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	liked
O	it
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	she
O	sat
O	in
O	it
O	until
O	suddenly
O	the
O	bottom
O	came
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	fell
O	down
O	plump
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	little
O	Old
O	Woman
O	went
O	upstairs
O	into
O	the
O	bedroom
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	three
O	Bears
O	slept
O	.
O	And
O	first
O	she
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	bed
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	,
O	Huge
O	Bear
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	was
O	too
O	high
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	bed
O	of
O	the
O	Middle-Sized
O	Bear
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	was
O	too
O	high
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	So
O	then
O	she
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	bed
O	of
O	the
O	Little
O	,

O	nor
O	too
O	high
O	at
O	the

O	,
O	but
O	just
O	right
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	liked
O	it
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	she
O	covered
O	herself
O	up
O	and
O	lay
