O	Thirdly:

O	retired
O	,
O	and
O	through
O	the

O	five
O	knights
O	advanced
O	slowly
O	into
O	the
O	arena
O	.
O	Approaching
O	the
O	challengers
O	,
O	each
O	touched
O	slightly
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the

O	,
O	the

O	of

O	then
O	retreated
O	to
O	the

O	of

O	,
O	where
O	all
O	remained

O	.
O	At
O	the
O	flourish
O	of

O	they
O	started
O	out
O	against

O	,
O	Malvoisin
O	,
O	and
O	Front-de-Boeuf

O	on
O	the

O	.
O	The
O	antagonist
O	of
O	Grantmesnil
O	broke
O	his
O	spear;
O	while
O	the
O	fifth
O	knight
O	alone
O	maintained
O	the
O	honour
O	of
O	his
O	party
O	.
O	A
O	second
O	and
O	third
O	party
O	of
O	knights
O	took
O	the
O	field
O	,

O	although

O	had
O	various

O	,
O	yet
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	whole
O	,
O	the

O	decidedly

O	the
O	challengers
O	,
O	not

O	A

O	here
O	,

O	,
O	the

O	Prince
O	John
O	now

O	to

O	of
O	awarding
O	the
O	prize
O	to
O	Brian
O	de
O	Bois-Guilbert
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	proved

O	to
O	be
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	the
O	Norman
O	knights;
O	but
O	his
O	attention
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	of
O	the

O	,
O	was
O	arrested
O	by
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	a
O	solitary
O	trumpet
O	,
O	which
O	breathed
O	a

O	of
O	defiance
O	from
O	the
O	northern
O	end
O	of
O	the

O	All

O	His

O	inlaid

O	and
O	the

O	was
O	a

O	Riding

O	,

O	struck
O	with

O	which
O	it
O	became
O	his
O	privilege
O	to
O	confer
O	,
O	and
O	Athelstane
O	,
O	confident
O	of
O	his

O	,

O	donned

O	with

O	make
O	his
O	rival
O	feel
O	the

O	of

O	.
O	The
O	combat
O	on
O	the
O	second
O	day
O	of
O	the
O	tournament
O	was
O	on
O	a
O	much
O	more
O	extended
O	scale
O	than
O	that

O	the

O	when

O	at

O	The

O	encountered
O	each

O	with
O	the
O	utmost
O	fury
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	alternate
O	success;
O	the
O	tide
O	of
O	battle
O	seeming
O	to
O	flow
O	now
O	toward
O	the

O	,

O	as
O	the

O	The
O	clang
O	of
O	the
O	blows
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	shouts
O	of
O	the
O	combatants
O	,
O	mixed
O	fearfully
O	with
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	the
O	trumpets
O	,
O	and
O	drowned
O	the
O	groans
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	fell
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	rolling
O	beneath
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	horses
O	.
O	The
O	splendid
O	armour
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	was
O	now
O	defaced
O	with
O	dust
O	and
O	blood
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	way
O	at
O	every
O	stroke
O	of
O	the
O	sword
O	and
O	battle-axe;
O	while
O	the
O	gay
O	plumage
O	,
O	shorn
O	from
O	the
O	crests
O	,
O	drifted
O	upon
O	the
O	breeze
O	like

O	.
O	In
O	the
O	thick
O	of

O	of
O	the
O	fight
O	Bois-Guilbert
O	and
O	the

O	repeatedly
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	single

O	by
O	mutual
O	animosity
O	.
O	Such
O	,

O	the

O	,

O	unavailing
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	field
O	became
O	thin
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	numbers
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	who
O	had
O	yielded
O	themselves
O	vanquished
O	or
O	had
O	been
O	rendered
O	incapable
O	of
O	continuing
O	the
O	strife
O	,
O	the
O	Templar
O	and
O	the
O	unknown
O	knight
O	at
O	length

O	,
O	hand
O	to

O	,

O	all
O	the

O	that
O	mortal
O	animosity
O	,
O	joined
O	to
O	rivalry
O	of
O	honour
O	,
O	could
O	inspire
O	.
O	Such
O	was
O	the
O	skill
O	of
O	each
O	in
O	parrying
O	and
O	striking
O	that
O	the

O	into
O	a
O	unanimous
O	and

O	easily
O	defeated

O	during
O	the

O	accomplished
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	mutterings

O	,
O	and
O	songs
O	of
O	a

O	,
O	strange
O	sound
O	,

O	made
