O	sight
O	was
O	too
O	much
O	even
O	for
O	the
O	superhuman
O	hearts
O	of
O	the
O	gods
O	to
O	endure
O	.
O	They
O	turned
O	the
O	bodies
O	into
O	stone
O	and
O	themselves
O	buried
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	looked
O	on
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	Niobe
O	and
O	saw
O	on
O	it
O	a
O	bleeding
O	anguish
O	that
O	no
O	human
O	hand
O	could
O	stay
O	nor
O	the
O	word
O	of
O	any
O	god

O	,
O	the
O	gods
O	were
O	merciful
O	.
O	Her
O	grief
O	was
O	immortalised
O	,
O	for
O	Niobe
O	,
O	at
O	their
O	will
O	,
O	became
O	a
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	carried
O	by
O	a
O	wailing
O	tempest
O	to
O	the
O	summit
O	of
O	Mount
O	Sipylus
O	,
O	in
O	Lydia
O	,
O	where
O	a
O	spring
O	of
O	Argos
O	bore
O	her

O	.
O	Yet
O	although

O	was
O	Niobe
O	,
O	from

O	blind
O	eyes
O	of

O	the
O	tears
O	still
O	flowed
O	,
O	a
O	clear
O	stream
O	of

O	water
O	,
O	symbol
O	of
O	a
O	mother

O	s
O	anguish
O	and
O	never-ending
