O	As
O	we
O	approached
O	Molokai
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	slow
O	work
O	of
O	centuries
O	had
O	nearly
O	covered
O	its
O	lava
O	with
O	verdure
O	.
O	At
O	dawn
O	we
O	were
O	opposite
O	Kalaupapa
O	.
O	Two
O	little
O	spired
O	churches
O	,
O	looking
O	precisely
O	alike
O	,
O	caught
O	my
O	eye
O	first
O	,
O	and
O	around
O	them
O	were
O	dotted
O	the
O	white
O	cottages
O	of
O	the
O	lepers
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	sea
O	was
O	too
O	rough
O	for
O	us
O	to
O	land
O	.
O	The
O	waves
O	dashed
O	against
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	spray
O	rose
O	fifty
O	feet
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	.
O	We
O	went
O	on
O	to
O	Kalawao
O	,
O	but
O	were
O	again
O	disappointed;
O	it
O	was
O	too
O	dangerous
O	to
O	disembark
O	.
O	Finally
O	it
O	was
O	decided
O	to
O	put
O	off
O	a
O	boat
O	for
O	a
O	rocky
O	point
O	about
O	a
O	mile
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	distant
O	from
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	Climbing
O	down
O	this
O	point
O	we
O	saw
O	about
O	twenty
O	lepers
O	,
O	and
O	""""

O	,

O	I
O	saw
O	a

O	He
O	came
O	rather
O	painfully
O	down
O	,

O	sat
O	near
O	the
O	water-side
O	,

O	we
O	exchanged

O	across

O	was

O	finally
O	chose
O	a

O	His

O	His

O	A

O	had
O	been

O	It
O	was
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	so
O	large
O	that
O	Father

O	said
O	it

O	landed
O	on
O	some

O	.
O	But
O	I
O	could

O	give
O	up
O	the
O	pleasure

O	after

O	The

O	The

O	are
O	justly
O	proud
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	many
O	days
O	I
O	had
O	a

O	ate

O	.
O	On
O	arriving
O	at

O	we
O	speedily

O	church
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	darling
O	of
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	How
O	he
O	enjoyed
O	planning
O	the
O	places
O	where
O	the
O	pictures
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	just
O	brought

O	should
O	be
O	placed
O	!
O	By
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	this
O	church
O	he
O	showed
O	me
O	the
O	palm-
O	tree
O	under
O	which
O	he
O	lived
O	for
O	some
O	weeks

O	of
O	steps
O	which
O	led
O	to
O	Father

O	balcony
O	.
O	This
