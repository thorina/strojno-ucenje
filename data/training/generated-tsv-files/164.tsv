O	,

O	the

O	'
O	s
O	custom
O	,
O	come
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	hole
O	,
O	or
O	shaft
O	,
O	at
O	eleven
O	o

O	for
O	a
O	short
O	half-hour
O	'
O	s
O	rest
O	between
O	breakfast
O	and
O	the
O	midday
O	meal
O	.
O	He
O	threw
O	himself
O	down
O	in
O	a
O	half-sitting
O	posture
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	dreamily
O	smoking
O	his
O	pipe
O	when
O	from
O	beneath
O	a
O	neighboring
O	rock
O	,
O	popped
O	out
O	a
O	little
O	lizard
O	who
O	eyed
O	the
O	stranger
O	with
O	inquisitive
O	interest
O	,
O	as
O	quickly
O	retiring
O	,
O	to
O	return
O	again
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	repeated
O	several
O	times
O	,
O	the
O	lizard
O	'
O	s
O	keen
O	eyes
O	always
O	fixed
O	on
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	intruder
O	.
O	Presently
O	the
O	digger
O	'
O	s
O	foot
O	was
O	approached
O	,
O	and
O	evidently
O	approved
O	of
O	for
O	its
O	warmth
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	retreat
O	to
O	the
O	rock
O	a
O	farther
O	advance
O	was
O	made
O	,
O	this
O	time
O	to
O	the
O	knee
O	of
O	the
O	stranger
O	,
O	to
O	whose
O	face
O	the
O	two
O	brilliant
O	little
O	eyes
O	were
O	still
O	enquiringly
O	directed
O	.
O	Before
O	the
O	half-hour
O	'
O	s
O	rest
O	was
O	over
O	the
O	left
O	arm
O	of
O	the
O	smoker
O	had
O	been
O	mounted
O	,
O	his
O	neck
O	rounded
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	right
O	arm
O	descended
O	,
O	the
O	venturesome
O	journey
O	ended
O	by
O	the
O	lizard
O	squatting
O	contentedly
O	on
O	the
O	back
O	of
O	his
O	new-found
O	friend
O	'
O	s
O	right
O	hand
O	.
O	Confidence
O	had
O	thus
O	been
O	established
O	between
O	the
O	two
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	to
O	the
O	extent
O	of
O	capture
O	,
O	for
O	on
O	the
O	gold-seeker
O	attempting
O	to
O	place
O	his
O	left
O	hand
O	over
O	his
O	new
O	acquaintance
O	,
O	he
O	scuttled
O	away
O	to
O	his
O	rock
O	with
O	almost
O	inconceivable
O	quickness
O	.
O	The
O	digger
O	'
O	s
O	smoke
O	over
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	work
O	in
O	the
O	hole
O	,
O	leaving
O	his
O	blouse
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	sat
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	work
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	was
O	finished
O	the
O	tired
O	gold-seeker
O	mounted
O	to
O	the
O	surface
O	and
O	,
O	taking
O	up
O	his
O	blouse
O	,
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	march
O	to
O	his
O	camp
O	,
O	three
O	miles
O	away
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	surprise
O	,
O	he
O	discovered
O	his
O	little
O	four-footed
O	friend
O	lying
O	hidden
O	in
O	the
O	fold
O	of
O	the
O	garment
O	.
O	He
O	carried
O	him
O	gently
O	in
O	the
O	blouse
O	to
O	the
O	camp
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	usual
O	courage
O	and
O	confidence
O	of
O	his
O	race
O	,
O	the
O	little
O	reptile
O	quickly
O	adapted
O	himself
O	to
O	his
O	new
O	surroundings
O	in
O	the
O	digger
O	'
O	s
O	tent
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	carefully
O	fed
O	,
O	kept
O	warm
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	like
O	his
O	new
O	quarters
O	with
O	the
O	gold-seekers
O	.
O	In
O	return
O	for
O	much
O	affectionate
O	attention
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	,
O	quite
O	at
O	home
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	party
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	walk
O	to
O	camp
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	his
O	home
O	in
O	his
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	serge
O	blouse
O	,
O	running
O	up
O	the
O	arm
O	of
O	the
O	loose
O	garment
O	or
O	round
O	the
O	full
O	front
O	above
O	the
O	tight
O	waistband
O	,
O	as
O	fancy
O	took
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	enjoying
O	the
O	warmth
O	of
O	his
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	body
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	very
O	interesting
O	and
O	amusing
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	poke
O	his
O	little
O	head
O	out
O	between
O	the
O	buttons
O	,
O	or
O	through
O	a
O	buttonhole
O	of
O	the
O	blouse
O	at
O	intervals
O	to
O	ask
O	,
O	with
O	glittering
O	eye
O	and
O	jerky
O	movement
O	,
O	for
O	an
O	occasional
O	fly
O	from
O	his
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	hand
O	caught
O	on
O	the
O	shafts
O	or
O	cover
O	of
O	the
O	cart
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	camp
O	was
O	pitched
O	for
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	Master
O	Lizard
O	would
O	employ
O	himself
O	by
O	making
O	the
O	most
O	inquisitive
O	scrutiny
O	and
O	inspection
O	of
O	the
O	immediate
O	surroundings
O	within
O	and
O	without
O	the
O	tent
O	.
O	He
O	made
O	himself
O	acquainted
O	with
O	every
O	stone
O	,
O	tuft
O	,
O	stump
O	,
O	or
O	hole
O	,
O	within
O	what
O	he
O	considered
O	his
O	domain
O	,
O	eventually
O	retiring
O	with
O	the
O	sun
O	to
O	the
O	blanket
O	on
O	his
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	bed
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	invariably
O	slept
O	.
O	On
O	one
O	occasion
O	,
O	during
O	the
O	darkness
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	he
O	became
O	extremely
O	restless
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	about
O	on
O	the
O	bed
O	,
O	evidently
O	with
O	a
O	view
O	to
O	awakening
O	his
O	protector
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	being
O	a
O	sound
O	sleeper
O	,
O	was
O	not
O	easily
O	disturbed
O	.
O	Failing
O	to
O	attract
O	attention
O	,
O	he
O	proceeded
O	to
O	run
O	rapidly
O	backwards
O	and
O	forwards
O	over
O	the
O	sleeper
O	'
O	s
O	face
O	,
O	making
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	a
O	low
O	spitting
O	noise
O	,
O	like
O	an
O	angry
O	cat
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	means
O	he
O	at
O	length
O	roused
O	his
O	friend
O	,
O	who
O	gently
O	pushed
O	him
O	away
O	several
O	times
O	,
O	speaking
O	soothingly
O	to
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	quieting
O	the
O	excited
O	little
O	animal
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	lizard
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	soothed
O	.
O	Having
O	attracted
O	attention
O	,
O	he
O	continued
O	his
O	inexplicable
O	movements
O	with
O	redoubled
O	energy
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	length
O	his
O	master
O	,
O	convinced
O	that
O	something
O	must
O	be
O	amiss
O	,
O	got
O	up
O	,
O	struck
O	a
O	light
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	round
O	the
O	tent
O	,
O	the
O	sharp
O	eyes
O	of
O	the
O	lizard
O	following
O	every
O	movement
O	with
O	intense
O	interest
O	.
O	As
O	nothing
O	unusual
O	could
O	be
O	seen
O	,
O	the
O	gold-hunter
O	retired
O	once
O	more
O	,
O	after
O	pooh-poohing
O	the
O	lizard
O	for
O	his
O	fears
O	.
O	Scarcely
O	had
O	he
O	dropped
O	off
O	to
O	sleep
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	again
O	disturbed
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	losing
O	patience
O	at
O	these
O	repeated
O	interruptions
O	to
O	his
O	slumbers
O	,
O	he
O	seized
O	the
O	lizard
O	and
O	threw
O	him
O	lightly
O	across
O	the
O	tent
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	involuntary
O	flight
O	the
O	little
O	creature
O	unfortunately
O	struck
O	the
O	tent-pole
O	with
O	considerable
O	force
O	,
O	and
O	half
O	of
O	his
O	tail
O	was
O	broken
O	off--a
O	matter
O	of
O	no
O	very
O	great
O	importance
O	to
O	a
O	lizard
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	but
O	still
O	a
O	discouraging
O	reward
O	for
O	a
O	well-meant
O	warning
O	.
O	Notwithstanding
O	this
O	the
O	little
O	reptile
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	bed
O	,
O	keeping
O	close
O	to
O	his
O	master
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	continued
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	restless
O	and
O	excited
O	for
O	the
O	remainder
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	.
O	When
O	day
O	dawned
O	,
O	preparations
O	were
O	begun
O	for
O	the
O	day
O	'
O	s
O	march
O	.
O	The
O	tents
O	were
O	struck
O	and
O	the
O	bedding
O	was
O	rolled
O	up
O	,
O	ready
O	to
O	be
O	placed
O	on
O	the
O	rough
O	digger
O	'
O	s
O	cart
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	mystery
O	was
O	explained
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	twigs
O	and
O	ferns
O	thrown
O	underneath
O	the
O	scanty
O	bedding
O	,
O	to
O	keep
O	it
O	from
O	the
O	bare
O	ground
O	,
O	a
O	huge
O	tiger
O	snake
O	with
O	several
O	young
O	ones
O	was
O	discovered
O	.
O	This
O	snake
O	is
O	of
O	a
O	deadly
O	description
O	and
O	is
O	much
O	feared
O	by
O	the
O	colonists
O	.
O	Like
O	all
O	snakes
O	,
O	it
O	gives
O	forth
O	a
O	strong
O	odor
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	no
O	doubt
O	,
O	made
O	the
O	lizard
O	aware
O	of
O	his
O	enemy
O	'
O	s
O	presence
O	,
O	unless
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	it
O	creep
O	under
O	the
O	curtain
O	of
O	the
O	tent
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	,
O	the
O	snakes
O	were
O	killed
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	our
O	little
O	friend
O	with
O	half
O	a
O	tail
O	became
O	a
O	greater
O	favorite
O	than
O	ever
O	,
O	because
O	we
O	recognized
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	protector
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	friend
O	.
O	TOBY
O	THE
O	WISE
O	By
O	General
O	Rush
O	C
O	.
O	Hawkins
O	The
O	chief
O	subject
O	of
O	this
O	truthful
O	history
O	is
O	a
O	jet-black
O	,
O	middle-aged
O	bird
O	,
O	commonly
O	known
O	in
O	England
O	as
O	a
O	rook
O	,
O	but
O	nevertheless
O	a
O	notable
O	specimen
O	of
O	the
O	crow
O	family
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	babyhood
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	language
O	of
O	the
O	ancient
O	chroniclers
O	,
O	grievously
O	hurt
O	and
O	wounded
O	full
O	sore
O	,
O	and
O	particularly
O	so
O	in
O	the
O	left
O	wing
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	badly
O	disabled
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	forego
O	the
O	pleasure
O	of
O	flying
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	content
O	himself
O	as
O	best
O	he
O	could
O	with
O	trudging
O	about
O	on
O	the
O	rough
O	surface
O	of
O	mother
O	earth
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	sad
O	plight
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	maimed
O	wing
O	dragging
O	painfully
O	along
O	,
O	he
O	chanced
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	window
O	of
O	a
O	library
O	belonging
O	to
O	and
O	occupied
O	by
O	a
O	charming
O	old
O	English
O	gentleman
O	,
O	a
O	perfect
O	example
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	school
O	,
O	learned
O	,
O	benevolent
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	fond
O	of
O	animals
O	and
O	feathered
O	pets
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	can
O	tell
O	what
O	chance
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	brought
O	the
O	unhappy
O	and
O	wounded
O	young
O	rook
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	of
O	this
O	good
O	man
O	.
O	But
O	possibly
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	real
O	inspiration
O	on
O	the
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	bird
O	.
O	Toby
O	was
O	wet
O	,
O	weary
O	,
O	wounded
O	and
O	hungry
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	looked
O	in
O	upon
O	the
O	cheerful
O	wood
O	fire
O	and
O	the
O	kindly
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	master
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	his
O	longing
O	expression
O	was
O	met
O	by
O	a
O	raising

O	to

O	and

O	.
O	He
O	gazed

O	gazed
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	joys
O	within
O	and
O	still
O	he
O	doubted;
O	but
O	,
O	finally
O	,
O	appetite
O	and
O	curiosity
O	got
O	the
O	better
O	of
O	his
O	discretion
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	walked
O	cautiously
O	in
O	,
O	the
O	window
O	was
O	closed
O	behind
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	wounded
O	bird
O	entered
O	upon
O	a
O	new
O	life
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	shy
O	and
O	cautious
O	and
O	it
O	took
O	considerable
O	time
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	convince
O	himself
O	that
O	his
O	protector
O	was
O	his
O	friend
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	few
O	weeks
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	realized
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	his
O	new
O	position
O	,
O	and
O	consented
O	to
O	the
O	establishment
O	of
O	intimate
O	relations
O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	Toby
O	became
O	so
O	attached
O	to
O	his
O	master
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	happy
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	presence
O	.
O	During
O	the
O	first
O	month
O	of
O	his
O	captivity
O	,
O	his
O	wounded
O	wing
O	was
O	bound
O	close
O	to
O	his
O	body
O	for
O	the
O	purpose
O	of
O	giving
O	the
O	fractured
O	bone
O	an
O	opportunity
O	to
O	unite
O	,
O	and
O	during
O	most
O	of
O	that
O	time
O	he
O	would
O	walk
O	by
O	his
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	side
O	,
O	cawing
O	and
O	looking
O	up
O	into
O	his
O	face
O	as
O	if
O	asking
O	for
O	recognition
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	wing
O	got
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	ability
O	to
O	fly
O	was
O	re-established
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	anticipate
O	the
O	direction
O	of
O	the
O	promenades
O	by
O	flying
O	in
O	advance
O	from
O	shrub
O	to
O	bush
O	,
O	alighting
O	and
O	awaiting
O	the
O	arrival
O	of
O	his
O	master
O	.
O	The
O	most
O	singular
O	part
O	of
O	Toby
O	'
O	s
O	domestication
O	was
O	his
O	exclusive
O	loyalty
O	to
O	a
O	single
O	person
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	but
O	one
O	intimate
O	friend
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	him
O	his
O	loyalty
O	was
O	intense
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	tolerate
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	other
O	members
O	of
O	the
O	household
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	strangers
O	appeared
O	he
O	was
O	decidedly
O	offish
O	,
O	and
O	scolded
O	until
O	they
O	disappeared
O	.
O	Three
O	times
O	a
O	day
O	Toby
O	is
O	decidedly
O	funny
O	,
O	and
O	goes
O	through
O	a
O	comical
O	performance
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	study
O	there
O	is
O	a
O	contrivance
O	which
O	,
O	on
O	a
O	small
O	scale
O	,
O	resembles
O	the
O	old
O	New
O	England
O	well-pole
O	.
O	At
O	one
O	end
O	,
O	which
O	rests
O	upon
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	Toby
O	commences
O	his
O	ascent
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	flapping
O	of
O	wings
O	and
O	uproarious
O	cawing
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	arrives
O	at
O	the
O	upper
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	pole
O	,
O	some
O	eight
O	or
O	nine
O	feet
O	from
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	it
O	falls
O	and
O	lands
O	him
O	upon
O	a
O	platform
O	,
O	beside
O	a
O	plate
O	containing
O	his
O	food
O	.
O	This
O	climbing
O	up
O	the
O	pole
O	precedes
O	each
O	meal
O	,
O	and
O	takes
O	place
O	punctually
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	hour
O	and
O	minute
O	of
O	each
O	day
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	spring
O	of
O	1890
O	Toby
O	was
O	tempted
O	from
O	his
O	loyalty
O	,
O	and
O	flew
O	off
O	with
O	a
O	marauding
O	flock
O	of
O	his
O	kind
O	.
O	He
O	remained
O	away
O	all
O	summer
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	missed
O	but
O	not
O	mourned
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	master
O	felt
O	certain
O	he
O	would
O	return;
O	and
O	,
O	sure
O	enough
O	,
O	one
O	bleak
O	cold
O	morning
O	in
O	November
O	,
O	Toby
O	was
O	found
O	looking
O	longingly
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	first
O	seen
O	his
O	good
O	master
O	.
O	The
O	window
O	was
O	opened
O	,
O	he
O	walked
O	in
O	and
O	mounted
O	his
O	pole
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	him
O	came
O	a
O	meek
O	,
O	modest
O	and
O	timid
O	young
O	rook
O	,
O	more
O	confiding
O	than
O	Toby
O	,
O	and
O	differing
O	from
O	him
O	in
O	many
O	other
O	respects
O	.
O	He
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	was
O	duly
O	adopted
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	christened
O	Jocko
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	easily
O	domesticated
O	and
O	soon
O	became
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	household
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	finest
O	old
O	Bedfordshire
O	manorial
O	homes
O	.
O	With
O	age
O	Toby
O	has
O	taken
O	on
O	quite
O	an
O	amount
O	of
O	dignity
O	.
O	He
O	is
O	neither
O	so
O	noisy
O	nor
O	so
O	companionable
O	as
O	formerly
O	,
O	but
O	is
O	more
O	staid
O	and
O	useful
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	his
O	favorite
O	resting
O	places
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	enjoys
O	his
O	after-breakfast
O	contemplations
O	and
O	his
O	afternoon
O	siestas
O	,
O	is
O	among
O	the
O	branches
O	of
O	a
O	fine
O	old
O	English
O	oak
O	,
O	whose
O	protecting
O	shades
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	far-off
O	past
O	,
O	were
O	the
O	scene
O	of
O	the
O	stolen
O	love
O	meetings
O	of
O	Amy
O	Wentworth
O	and
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Monmouth
O	.
O	Neither
O	of
O	these
O	knowing
O	birds
O	has
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	understand
O	the
O	mystery
O	of
O	a
O	looking-glass
O	.
O	They
O	spend
O	many
O	hours
O	of
O	patient
O	investigation
O	before
O	a
O	mirror
O	in
O	their
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	room
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	to
O	no
O	purpose
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	puzzle
O	seems
O	to
O	remain
O	as
O	great
O	as
O	ever
O	.
O	They
O	usually
O	walk
O	directly
O	up
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	betray
O	great
O	surprise
O	when
O	they
O	find
O	two
O	other
O	rooks
O	advancing
O	to
O	meet
O	them
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	while
O	they
O	remain
O	silent
O	and
O	motionless
O	,
O	looking
O	at
O	the
O	strangers
O	,
O	and
O	waiting
O	,
O	apparently
O	,
O	for
O	some
O	sign
O	of
O	recognition
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	go
O	through
O	a
O	considerable
O	flapping
O	of
O	wings
O	and
O	indulge
O	in
O	numerous
O	caws
O	,
O	but
O	after
O	long
O	waiting
O	for
O	an
O	audible
O	response
O	they
O	give
O	up
O	the
O	useless
O	effort
O	,
O	only
O	to
O	return
O	next
O	day
O	as
O	eager
O	as
O	ever
O	to
O	solve
O	the
O	mystery
O	.
O	The
O	older
O	bird
O	and
O	his
O	admiring
O	junior
O	are
O	perfectly
O	contented
O	with
O	their
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	leave
O	it
O	.
O	They
O	often
O	look
O	out
O	from
O	their
O	perches
O	upon
O	wandering
O	flocks
O	of
O	vagrant
O	rooks
O	,
O	but
O	are
O	never
O	tempted
O	to
O	new
O	adventures
O	.
O	The
O	old

O	is
O	very
O	wise
O	.
O	Like
O	a
O	fat
O	old

O	knows
O	enough
O	to
O	appreciate
O	a

O	in
O	which
O	the
O	rewards
O	are
O	liberal
O	and
O	the
O	service
O	nominal
O	.
O	His
O	devoted

O	never
O	falters
O	in
O	his
O	dutiful
O	imitation

O	Toby

O	that
O	at

O	the

O	and

O	Yet
O	my

O	lamented
O	so
O	openly
O	and
O	said
O	so
O	much
O	at

O	,
O	that
O	their
O	small
O	voices
O	wrought

O	the

O	The

O	a

O	spitefully
O	,
O	on
O	leaving

O	that
O	I
O	had
O	spoiled
O	the

O	for

O	She
O	was
O	a
O	very

O	,

O	one
O	of

O	Blackamoor
O	came
O	to
O	school
O	one
O	morning
O	in
O	July
O	,
O	head
O	downward
O	,
O	in

O	of
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	larger
O	boys
O	,
O	named
O	Wiggan
O	Brown
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	inclined
O	to
O	thoughtless
O	cruelty
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	part
O	of
O	children
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	cruelty
O	is
O	usually
O	thoughtless
O	.
O	They
O	are
O	rarely
O	cruel
O	after
O	they
O	have
O	been
O	taught
O	to
O	think
O	on
O	the
O	subject
O	.
O	Wiggan
O	and
O	his
O	older
O	brother
O	had
O	taken
O	Blackamoor
O	from
O	a
O	nest
O	in
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	hemlock-tree
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	reader
O	will
O	have
O	guessed
O	that
O	Blackamoor
O	was
O	the
O	young
O	crow
O	which
O	became
O	one
O	of
O	our
O	schoolhouse
O	pets
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	we
O	built
O	a
O	pen
O	for
O	him
O	at
O	the
O	farther
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	schoolyard
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	kept
O	him
O	until
O	he
O	could
O	fly
O	.
O	After
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	released
O	,
O	to
O	stay
O	with
O	us
O	or
O	depart
O	.
O	He
O	chose
O	to
O	stay
O	,
O	and
O	during
O	school
O	hours
O	usually
O	sat
O	on
O	the
O	ridge
O	of
O	the
O	schoolhouse
O	roof
O	.
O	At
O	night
O	he
O	often
O	accompanied
O	me
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	lingered
O	about
O	the
O	farmhouse
O	or
O	barns
O	till
O	school-time
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	recesses
O	he
O	swaggered
O	and
O	hopped
O	about
O	with
O	the
O	children
O	at
O	play
O	,
O	often
O	cawing
O	uproariously
O	.
O	If
O	a
O	dog
O	or
O	cat
O	approached
O	during
O	school
O	hours
O	,

O	intruder
O	away
O	.
O	If
O	it
O	was
O	a

O	If
O	another
O	crow
O	or
O	large
O	bird
O	flew
O	past
O	,
O	he
O	turned
O	up
O	an

O	and
O	said
O	_

O	In

O	on
O	all
O	that
O	was
O	going
O	on
O	out-of-doors
O	,

O	we
O	soon
O	came
O	to
O	know
O	most
O	of
O	his
O	signal-cries
O	.
O	The
O	boys
O	would
O	glance
O	up
O	from
O	their
O	books
O	and
O	smile
O	when
O	they
O	heard
O	him
O	.
O	Blackamoor
O	had
O	certain
O	highly
O	reprehensible
O	traits
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	thievish
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	were
O	obliged
O	to
O	keep
O	an
O	eye
O	on
O	him
O	,
O	or
O	he
O	would
O	steal
O	all
O	our
O	lead-pencils
O	,
O	pocket-handkerchiefs
O	and
O	other
O	small
O	objects
O	.
O	What
O	he
O	took
O	he
O	secreted
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	marvelously
O	cunning
O	in
O	doing
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	fell
O	finally
O	into
O	a
O	difficulty
O	with
O	a
O	gang
O	of
O	Italian
O	laborers
O	who
O	were
O	excavating
O	for
O	a
O	new
O	railroad
O	line
O	that
O	passed
O	within
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	a
O	mile
O	of
O	the
O	schoolhouse
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	fifty-five
O	of
O	these
O	Italians
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	their
O	camp
O	in
O	a
O	grove
O	of
O	pines
O	within
O	plain
O	sight
O	of
O	us
O	.
O	My
O	pupils
O	were
O	afraid
O	of
O	these
O	swarthy
O	men
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	jabbered
O	fiercely
O	in
O	an
O	unknown
O	tongue
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	one
O	was
O	armed
O	with
O	a
O	sheath-knife
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	whole
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	it
O	better
O	that
O	my
O	boys
O	should
O	not
O	go
O	to
O	their
O	camp
O	.
O	But
O	Blackamoor
O	went
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	indeed
O	became
O	a
O	constant
O	visitor
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	probably
O	titbits
O	to
O	be
O	secured
O	about
O	their
O	cooking-fires
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	time
O	he
O	nearly
O	deserted
O	the
O	schoolhouse
O	for
O	the
O	Italian
O	camp
O	in
O	the
O	pines
O	,
O	or
O	at
O	least
O	was
O	flying
O	back
O	and
O	forth
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	,
O	""""
O	hawing
O	""""
O	and
O	""""
O	harring
O	.
O	""""
O	All
O	appeared
O	to
O	go
O	well
O	for
O	a
O	while
O	.
O	Then
O	one
O	forenoon
O	I
O	heard
O	loud
O	shouts
O	outside
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	going
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	saw
O	a
O	hatless
O	Italian
O	pursuing
O	Blackamoor
O	across
O	the
O	pasture
O	below
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	active
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	filling
O	the
O	air
O	with
O	stones
O	and
O	cries
O	.
O	Blackamoor
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	was
O	taking
O	it
O	all
O	easily
O	,
O	flying
O	low
O	,
O	but
O	keeping
O	out
O	of
O	reach
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	something
O	in
O	his
O	beak
O	.
O	Catching
O	sight
O	of
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	doorway
O	,
O	the
O	Italian
O	stopped
O	,
O	but
O	gesticulated
O	eagerly
O	,
O	pointing
O	to
O	the
O	crow;
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	much
O	that
O	I
O	failed
O	utterly
O	to
O	comprehend
O	.
O	I
O	conjectured
O	that
O	Blackamoor
O	had
O	purloined
O	something
O	,
O	and
O	felt
O	that
O	I
O	must
O	keep
O	him
O	from
O	going
O	to
O	the
O	camp;
O	but
O	that
O	was
O	not
O	easily
O	accomplished
O	.
O	We
O	tied
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	leg
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	tugged
O	at
O	the
O	string
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	frayed
O	off
O	or
O	came
O	untied
O	,
O	and
O	flew
O	away
O	.
O	But
O	a
O	crisis
O	was
O	at
O	hand
O	.
O	The
O	second
O	morning
O	afterward
O	an
O	alarming
O	commotion
O	began
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	hearing
O	a
O	class
O	in
O	mental
O	arithmetic
O	.
O	The
O	house
O	was
O	surrounded
O	by
O	excited
O	Italians
O	.
O	Stones
O	rattled
O	on
O	the
O	roof
O	.
O	Angry
O	shouts
O	filled
O	the
O	air
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	mob
O	.
O	The
O	children
O	were
O	terrified
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	was
O	sufficiently
O	alarmed
O	myself
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	pane
O	of
O	glass
O	crashed
O	and
O	clubs
O	banged
O	against
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	Hastily
O	locking
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	I
O	peered
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	.
O	Certainly
O	wild
O	Indians
O	could
O	hardly
O	have
O	looked
O	more
O	savage
O	than
O	did
O	those
O	Italians
O	,
O	hurling
O	stones
O	and
O	clubs
O	at
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	Yet
O	through
O	it
O	all
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	suspicion
O	that
O	the
O	demonstration
O	was
O	directed
O	at
O	Blackamoor
O	rather
O	than
O	against
O	us;
O	for
O	I
O	fancied
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	heard
O	our
O	bird
O	say
O	_
O	""""
O	Haw
O	!
O	""""
O	_
O	a
O	moment
O	before
O	the
O	hubbub
O	burst
O	forth
O	.
O	Still
O	it
O	was
O	decidedly
O	alarming
O	while
O	it
O	lasted
O	,
O	and
O	continued
O	for
O	a
O	much
O	longer
O	time
O	than
O	was
O	pleasant
O	.
O	I
O	judged
O	it
O	more
O	prudent
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	door
O	locked
O	than
O	to
O	go
O	forth
O	to
O	remonstrate
O	.
O	Finally
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	great
O	bombardment
O	,
O	the
O	outcries
O	and
O	racket
O	subsided
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	vast
O	sense
O	of
O	relief
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	the
O	Italians
O	retiring
O	across
O	the
O	pasture
O	to
O	their
O	camp
O	.
O	As
O	a
O	matter
O	of
O	course
O	the
O	children
O	carried
O	home
O	terrible
O	accounts
O	of
O	what
O	had
O	occurred
O	,
O	and
O	our
O	small
O	community
O	waxed
O	indignant
O	over
O	what
O	was
O	deemed
O	an
O	outrage
O	by
O	lawless
O	foreigners
O	.
O	The
O	suspicion
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	remained
O	with
O	me
O	that
O	Blackamoor
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	trouble
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	boys
O	catch
O	him
O	and
O	make
O	him
O	fast
O	again
O	,
O	this
O	time
O	with
O	a
O	small
O	dog-chain
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	bite
O	off
O	.
O	He
O	cawed
O	vigorously
O	,
O	but
O	we
O	kept
O	him
O	at
O	anchor
O	for
O	a
O	week
O	or
O	more
O	.
O	And
O	meanwhile
O	the
O	Italian
O	camp
O	was
O	moved
O	to
O	a
O	point
O	six
O	miles
O	farther
O	along
O	the
O	line
O	of
O	the
O	new
O	railway
O	.
O	At
O	a
O	schoolhouse
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	it
O	is
O	often
O	difficult
O	to
O	get
O	small
O	repairs
O	made
O	.
O	Early
O	that
O	season
O	the
O	boys
O	had
O	broken
O	a
O	pane
O	of
O	glass
O	in
O	the
O	low
O	attic
O	window
O	at
O	the
O	front
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	trying
O	to
O	get
O	it
O	replaced
O	for
O	two
O	months;
O	and
O	now
O	we
O	had
O	two
O	panes
O	broken
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	I
O	bought
O	new
O	glass
O	and
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	putty
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	aid
O	of
O	Wiggan
O	and
O	another
O	boy
O	,
O	set
O	the
O	panes
O	myself
O	one
O	night
O	after
O	school
O	.
O	But
O	while
O	setting
O	the
O	attic
O	pane
O	we
O	made
O	a
O	singular
O	discovery
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	low
O	,
O	dark
O	loft
O	,
O	just
O	inside
O	the
O	hole
O	of
O	the
O	broken
O	pane
O	,
O	lay
O	a
O	heap
O	of
O	queer
O	things
O	which
O	caused
O	us
O	first
O	to
O	stare
O	,
O	then
O	to
O	laugh
O	.
O	The
O	like
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	sure
O	,
O	was
O	never
O	found
O	in
O	the
O	loft
O	of
O	a
O	New
O	England
O	sehoolhouse
O	before
O	.
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	list
O	.
O	There
O	were:
O	The
O	much
O	soiled
O	photograph
O	of
O	an
O	Italian
O	baby
O	.
O	Three
O	photographs
O	of
O	pretty

O	THE
O	SANDPIPER
O	'
O	S
O	TRICK
O	By
O	Celia
O	Thaxter
O	One
O	lovely
O	afternoon
O	in
O	May
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	wandering
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	,
O	through
O	rocky
O	gorges
O	,
O	by
O	little
O	swampy
O	bits
O	of
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	tops
O	of
O	windy
O	headlands
O	,
O	looking
O	for
O	flowers
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	found
O	many:
O	--large
O	blue
O	violets
O	,
O	the
O	like
O	of
O	which
O	you
O	never
O	saw;
O	white
O	violets
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	creamy
O	and
O	fragrant;
O	gentle
O	little
O	houstonias;
O	gay
O	and
O	dancing
O	erythroniums
O	,
O	and
O	wind-flowers
O	delicately
O	tinted
O	,
O	blue
O	,
O	straw-color
O	,
O	pink
O	,
O	and
O	purple
O	.
O	I
O	never
O	found
O	such
O	in
O	the
O	mainland
O	valleys;
O	the
O	salt
O	air
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	deepens
O	the
O	colors
O	of
O	all
O	flowers
O	.
O	I
O	stopped
O	by
O	a
O	swamp
O	which
O	the
O	recent
O	rains
O	had
O	filled
O	and
O	turned
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	lake
O	.
O	Light
O	green
O	iris-leaves
O	cut
O	the
O	water
O	like
O	sharp
O	and
O	slender
O	swords
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	low
O	sunshine
O	that
O	streamed
O	across
O	,
O	threw
O	long
O	shadows
O	over
O	the
O	shining
O	surface
O	.
O	Some
O	blackbirds
O	were
O	calling
O	sweetly
O	in
O	a
O	clump
O	of
O	bushes
O	,
O	and
O	song-sparrows
O	sang
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	but
O	one
O	hour
O	in
O	which
O	to
O	crowd
O	the
O	whole
O	raptures
O	of
O	the
O	spring
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	pressed
O	through
O	the
O	budding
O	bayberry
O	bushes
O	to
O	reach
O	some
O	milk-white
O	sprays
O	of
O	shadbush
O	which
O	grew
O	by
O	the
O	water-side
O	,
O	I
O	startled
O	three
O	curfews
O	.
O	They
O	flew
O	away
O	,
O	trailing
O	their
O	long
O	legs
O	,
O	and
O	whistling
O	fine
O	and
O	clear
O	.
O	I
O	stood
O	still
O	to
O	watch
O	them
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	.
O	How
O	full
O	the
O	air
O	was
O	of
O	pleasant
O	sounds
O	!
O	The
O	very
O	waves
O	made
O	a
O	glad
O	noise
O	about
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	whole
O	sea
O	seemed
O	to
O	roar
O	afar
O	off
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	half
O	asleep
O	and
O	murmuring
O	in
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	gentle
O	dream
O	.
O	The
O	flock
O	of
O	sheep
O	was
O	scattered
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	all
O	washed
O	as
O	white
O	as
O	snow
O	by
O	the
O	plenteous
O	rains
O	,
O	and
O	nibbling
O	the
O	new
O	grass
O	eagerly;
O	and
O	from
O	near
O	and
O	far
O	came
O	the
O	tender
O	and
O	plaintive
O	cries
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	lambs
O	.
O	Going
O	on
O	again
O	,
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	beach
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	I
O	was
O	startled
O	by
O	a
O	sound
O	of
O	such
O	terror
O	and
O	distress
O	that
O	it
O	went
O	to
O	my
O	heart
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	moment
O	a
O	poor
O	little
O	sandpiper
O	emerged
O	from
O	the
O	bushes
O	,
O	dragging
O	itself
O	along
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	way
O	that
O	,
O	had
O	you
O	seen
O	it
O	,
O	you
O	would
O	have
O	concluded
O	that
O	every
O	bone
O	in
O	its
O	body
O	had
O	been
O	broken
O	.
O	Such
O	a
O	dilapidated
O	bird
O	!
O	Its
O	wings
O	drooped
O	and
O	its
O	legs
O	hung
O	as
O	if
O	almost
O	lifeless
O	.
O	It
O	uttered
O	continually
O	a
O	shrill
O	cry
O	of
O	pain
O	,
O	and
O	kept
O	just
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	reach
O	of
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	fluttering
O	hither
O	and
O	thither
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	sore
O	wounded
O	and
O	weary
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	I
O	was
O	amazed
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	out
O	,
O	""""
O	Why

O	What

O	""""
O	and
O	then
O	stood
O	watching
O	it
O	in
O	mute
O	dismay
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	it
O	flashed
O	across
O	me
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	only
O	my
O	sandpiper
O	'
O	s
O	way
O	of
O	concealing
O	from
O	me
O	a
O	nest;
O	and
O	I
O	remembered
O	reading
O	about
O	this
O	little
O	trick
O	of
O	hers
O	in
O	a
O	book
O	of
O	natural
O	history
O	.
O	The
O	object
O	was
O	to
O	make
O	me
O	follow
O	her
O	by
O	pretending
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not

O	,
O	and
O	so
O	lead
O	me
O	away
O	from
O	her
O	treasure
O	.
O	So
O	I
O	stood
O	perfectly
O	still
O	,
O	lest
O	I
O	should
O	tread
O	on
O	the
O	precious
O	habitation
O	,
O	and
O	quietly
O	observed
O	my
O	deceitful
O	little
O	friend
O	.
O	Her
O	apparently
O	desperate
O	and
O	hopeless
O	condition
O	grew
O	so
O	comical
O	when
O	I
O	reflected
O	that

O	only
O	affectation

O	that
O	I
O	could

O	HOW
O	DID
O	THE
O	CANARY
O	DO
O	IT
O	?
O	By
O	Celia
O	Thaxter
O	A
O	little
O	friend
O	of
O	mine
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	going
O	away
O	for
O	the
O	winter
O	,
O	asked
O	me
O	to
O	take
O	charge
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	canaries
O	till
O	she
O	returned
O	in
O	the
O	spring
O	.
O	The
O	bird
O	was
O	a
O	foreigner
O	,
O	born
O	and
O	bred
O	in
O	Fayal
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	across
O	the
O	water
O	in
O	his
O	youth
O	,
O	a
O	gray-green
O	and
O	golden
O	little
O	creature
O	,
O	whose
O	name
O	was
O	Willie
O	.
O	I
O	gladly
O	consented
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	day
O	Willie
O	was
O	brought
O	over
O	from
O	Jamaica
O	Plains
O	,
O	a
O	distance
O	of
O	ten
O	miles
O	,
O	and
O	deposited
O	in
O	my
O	parlor
O	.
O	His
O	cage
O	was
O	closely
O	covered
O	with
O	brown
O	paper
O	during
O	the
O	journey
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	came
O	in
O	the
O	cars
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	roundabout
O	way
O	of
O	Boston
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	he
O	seemed
O	somewhat
O	lonely
O	and
O	lost
O	,
O	but
O	soon
O	grew
O	very
O	happy
O	and
O	content
O	in
O	his
O	new
O	home;
O	and
O	well
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	all
O	his
O	wants
O	supplied
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	lack
O	companions
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	two
O	canaries
O	,
O	a
O	robin
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	song-sparrow
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	make
O	beautiful
O	music
O	all
O	together
O	.
O	The
O	sun
O	could
O	not
O	rise
O	without
O	shining
O	into
O	the
O	parlor
O	windows;
O	it
O	lingered
O	there
O	all
O	day
O	,
O	till
O	the
O	last
O	glow
O	of
O	the
O	evening-red
O	faded
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	At
O	two
O	windows
O	the
O	light
O	streamed
O	through
O	green
O	leaves
O	and
O	gay
O	flowers
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	most
O	cheerful
O	atmosphere
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	no
O	bird
O	could
O	possibly
O	help
O	singing
O	.
O	The
O	song-sparrow
O	'
O	s
O	clear
O	,
O	friendly
O	notes
O	seemed
O	to
O	bring
O	May
O	to
O	the
O	very
O	door;
O	and
O	the
O	robin
O	executed
O	,
O	_sotto
O	voce
O	,
O	_
O	all
O	his
O	fine
O	out-of-door
O	melodies
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	one
O	into
O	an
O	April
O	mood
O	with
O	his
O	sweet
O	,
O	melancholy
O	rain-song
O	.
O	Willie
O	could
O	not
O	choose
O	but
O	be
O	happy
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	all
O	sang
O	and
O	chirruped
O	together
O	the
O	whole
O	winter
O	through
O	,
O	and
O	cheered

O	began
O	to
O	beat
O	the
O	water
O	again
O	with
O	its
O	flukes
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boat
O	was
O	going
O	at
O	a
O	faster
O	rate
O	of
O	speed
O	.
O	The
O	sun
O	had
O	now
O	reached
O	the
O	water
O	'
O	s
O	edge
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	any
O	boat
O	coming
O	.
O	What
O	should
O	I
O	do
O	if
O	the
O	whale
O	turned
O	on
O	me
O	?
O	I
O	looked
O	round
O	for
O	a
O	knife
O	to
O	cut
O	the
O	whale-line
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	one
O	.
O	The
O	crew
O	had
O	taken
O	all
O	the
O	knives
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	whale
O	had
O	disappeared
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	line
O	was
O	fast
O	running
O	out
O	of
O	its
O	tub
O	.
O	Faster
O	and
O	faster
O	it
O	ran
O	,
O	until
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	jerk
O	,
O	the
O	end
O	flew
O	from
O	the
O	tub
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	thought
O	I
O	was
O	free
O	.
O	But
O	alas
O	,
O	no
O	!
O	for
O	when
O	the
O	crew
O	were
O	being
O	changed
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	fastened
O	the
O	small
O	tub
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	used
O	for
O	a
O	drag
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	line
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	yanked
O	under
O	the
O	bow
O	thwart
O	and
O	jammed
O	there
O	.
O	The
O	boat
O	now
O	shot
O	ahead
O	with
O	furious
O	speed
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	growing
O	darker
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	could
O	scarcely
O	make
O	out
O	the
O	ship
O	.
O	In
O	vain
O	I
O	looked
O	for
O	the
O	boat
O	.
O	Would
O	it
O	never
O	come
O	!
O	To
O	add
O	to
O	my
O	trouble
O	,
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	whales
O	had
O	joined
O	the
O	old
O	bull
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	hoarsely
O	spouting
O	and
O	leaping
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	all
O	around
O	me
O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	whales
O	everywhere
O	,
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	down
O	beneath
O	it
O	.
O	I
O	could
O	dimly
O	see
O	their
O	greenish-white
O	reflections
O	as
O	they
O	swam
O	just
O	beneath
O	the
O	surface
O	.
O	One
O	old
O	cow
O	whale
O	and
O	her
O	calf
O	were
O	close
O	beside
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	they
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	spout
O	I
O	could
O	feel
O	the
O	water
O	from
O	the
O	splash
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	one
O	'
O	s
O	flukes
O	.
O	As
O	a
O	boy
O	on
O	shipboard
O	I
O	had
O	often
O	longed
O	for
O	a
O	little
O	whale
O	to
O	play
O	with
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	desire
O	had
O	all
O	left
O	me
O	now
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	crouched
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	and
O	covered
O	my
O	face
O	with
O	my
O	hands
O	.
O	Oh
O	,
O	if
O	the
O	captain
O	would
O	only
O	come
O	and
O	take
O	me
O	out
O	of
O	that
O	boat
O	!
O	I
O	would
O	never
O	go
O	to
O	sea
O	again
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	the
O	boat
O	stopped
O	with
O	a
O	jerk
O	,
O	and
O	uncovering
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	sight
O	that
O	made
O	me
O	scream
O	with
O	fright
O	.
O	Right
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	me
O	was
O	a
O	large
O	sperm-whale
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	jaws
O	wide
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	long
O	row
O	of
O	white
O	,
O	glistening
O	teeth
O	shining
O	from
O	the
O	phosphorescent
O	brightness
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	snap
O	its
O	mouth
O	closed
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	sank
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	,
O	while
O	I
O	,
O	falling
O	on
O	my
O	knees
O	,
O	asked
O	God
O	to
O	save
O	me
O	.
O	After
O	that
O	I
O	felt
O	better
O	,
O	and
O	managed
O	to
O	crawl
O	under
O	the
O	stem-sheets
O	for
O	shelter
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	was
O	chilled
O	through
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	quite
O	dark
O	,
O	although
O	the
O	stars
O	shone
O	brightly
O	.
O	The
O	whale
O	seemed
O	to
O	have
O	got
O	free
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	boat
O	was
O	idly
O	rocking
O	on
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	In
O	changing
O	my
O	cramped
O	form
O	to
O	an
O	upright
O	position
O	,
O	my
O	hand
O	came
O	against
O	a
O	hard
O	,
O	round
O	piece
O	of
O	iron
O	.
O	A
O	feeling
O	of
O	security
O	,
O	of
O	advantage
O	,
O	of
O	longing
O	for
O	battle
O	ran
O	through
O	me
O	as
O	my
O	hand
O	rested
O	on
O	the
O	cold
O	steel
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	captain
O	'
O	s
O	bomb-guns
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	so
O	despised
O	by
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	which
O	might
O	be
O	the
O	means
O	of
O	saving
O	me
O	from
O	an
O	awful
O	death
O	.
O	I
O	pulled
O	it
O	from
O	its
O	socket
O	,
O	and
O	fondled
O	it
O	in
O	my
O	excitement
O	and
O	relief
O	at
O	finding
O	some
O	means
O	of
O	defence
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	I
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	lift
O	the
O	gun
O	to
O	my
O	shoulder
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	pulse
O	beat
O	with
O	renewed
O	vigor
O	as
O	I
O	raised
O	the
O	hammer
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	gun
O	was
O	loaded
O	.
O	So
O	great
O	was
O	my
O	joy
O	that
O	I
O	forgot
O	for
O	the
O	moment
O	the
O	terrible
O	uncertainty
O	of
O	my
O	position
O	,
O	and
O	almost
O	wished
O	the
O	whale
O	would
O	come
O	back
O	.
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	feel
O	so
O	long
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	next
O	instant
O	the
O	boat
O	began
O	to
O	move
O	.
O	Again
O	I
O	heard
O	the
O	whales
O	'
O	spouting
O	,
O	and
O	right
O	abreast
O	was
O	a
O	monster
O	swimming
O	straight
O	toward
O	the
O	boat
O	.
O	With
O	an
O	inward
O	prayer
O	to
O	God
O	,
O	I
O	raised
O	the
O	gun
O	to
O	my
O	shoulder
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	instant
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	monster
O	thrust
O	its
O	head
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	I
O	fired
O	.
O	The
O	recoil
O	threw
O	me
O	against
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	lay
O	,
O	partially
O	stunned
O	and
O	unable
O	to
O	move
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	conscious
O	enough
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	to
O	remember
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	silent
O	,
O	stupefied
O	terror
O	I
O	awaited
O	a
O	second
O	onslaught
O	from
O	the
O	enraged
O	animal
O	.
O	I
O	seemed
O	to
O	feel
O	the
O	crunching
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	'
O	s
O	timbers
O	in
O	those
O	awful
O	jaws
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	must
O	have
O	swooned
O	in
O	looking
O	forward
O	to
O	my
O	own
O	terrible
O	fate
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	regained
O	my
O	senses
O	,
O	all
O	was
O	quiet
O	around
O	me
O	.
O	Off
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	at
O	some
O	distance
O	,
O	a
O	whale
O	floated
O	on
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	After
O	waiting
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	,
O	I
O	ventured
O	to
O	crawl
O	forward
O	on
O	the
O	thwarts
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	whale-line
O	was
O	still
O	attached
O	to
O	the
O	bow
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	stern
O	and
O	sat
O	on
O	the
O	after
O	thwart
O	,
O	thinking
O	of
O	the
O	gun
O	.
O	I
O	felt
O	in
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	for
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	must
O	have
O	fallen
O	overboard
O	when
O	I
O	fell
O	down
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	was
O	groping
O	,
O	I
O	felt
O	an
O	object
O	in
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	that
O	I
O	knew
O	at
O	once
O	was
O	the
O	boat
O	'
O	s
O	lantern
O	keg
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	kept
O	in
O	all
O	whale-boats
O	.
O	In
O	it
O	are
O	flint
O	,
O	tinder
O	,
O	a
O	lantern
O	,
O	candles
O	,
O	and
O	packed
O	all
O	around
O	them
O	are
O	ship
O	'
O	s
O	biscuits
O	.
O	Instantly
O	the
O	memory
O	of
O	our
O	officers
O	'
O	instructions
O	in
O	reference
O	to
O	their
O	use
O	came
O	to
O	me
O	.
O	Quickly
O	taking
O	the
O	keg
O	to
O	the
O	stern
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	I
O	struck
O	its
O	end
O	against
O	the
O	loggerhead
O	.
O	It
O	soon
O	yielded
O	to
O	my
O	pounding
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	head
O	fell
O	out
O	.
O	How
O	sweet
O	the
O	hard
O	pilot-bread
O	tasted
O	!
O	It
O	brought
O	to
O	my
O	remembrance
O	the
O	water-keg
O	which
O	is
O	also
O	kept
O	in
O	a
O	whale-boat
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	midship
O	thwart
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	keg
O	there
O	,
O	lashed
O	firmly
O	beneath
O	it
O	.
O	I
O	loosened
O	it
O	and
O	drank
O	heartily
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	took
O	the
O	lantern
O	and
O	tinder
O	from
O	the
O	keg
O	,
O	and
O	striking
O	the
O	flint
O	,
O	I
O	soon
O	had
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	candles
O	lighted
O	.
O	I
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	after
O	thwart
O	and
O	held
O	the
O	light
O	aloft
O	till
O	my
O	arm
O	ached
O	.
O	Everything
O	about
O	me
O	was
O	made
O	more
O	weird
O	by
O	the
O	gleam
O	of
O	the
O	lantern
O	.
O	The
O	swish
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	as
O	it
O	rippled
O	beneath
O	the
O	boat
O	and
O	the
O	screeching
O	of
O	sea-fowls
O	that
O	had
O	now
O	gathered
O	around
O	the
O	floating
O	carcass
O	set
O	me
O	to
O	thinking
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	wondered
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	see
O	the
O	light
O	and
O	come
O	to
O	my
O	rescue
O	.
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	what
O	time
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	but
O	judged
O	it
O	must
O	he
O	near
O	midnight
O	.
O	I
O	tried
O	to
O	call
O	,
O	but
O	my
O	own
O	voice
O	frightened
O	me--it
O	sounded
O	so
O	strange;
O	so
O	once
O	more
O	I
O	relapsed
O	into
O	silence
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	something
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	matter
O	with
O	the
O	whale
O	.
O	I
O	thought
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	sound
O	like
O	some
O	one
O	falling
O	overboard
O	.
O	What
O	could
O	it
O	be
O	?
O	At
O	that
O	moment
O	a
O	black
O	body
O	shot
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	right
O	beside
O	the
O	boat
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	followed
O	by
O	another
O	and
O	another
O	.
O	Soon
O	I
O	learned
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	seen
O	them
O	before
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	sharks
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	attracted
O	by
O	the
O	dead
O	whale
O	,
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	feast
O	on
O	the
O	carcass
O	.
O	It
O	made
O	me
O	shiver
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	rush
O	at
O	the
O	monster
O	,
O	and
O	tear
O	big
O	mouthfuls
O	of
O	flesh
O	from
O	its
O	side
O	.
O	I
O	tied
O	the
O	lantern
O	to
O	the
O	loggerhead
O	and
O	crawled
O	under
O	the
O	stern-sheets
O	so
O	as
O	not
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	.
O	Now
O	I
O	was
O	well-nigh
O	exhausted
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	feel
O	drowsy
O	.
O	Sleep
O	soon
O	overcame
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	testing
O	my
O	head
O	against
O	the
O	boat
O	'
O	s
O	side
O	,
O	I
O	lost
O	consciousness
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	awoke
O	I
O	heard
O	voices
O	and
O	recognized
O	Captain
O	Coffin
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	me
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	boat
O	'
O	s
O	crew
O	were
O	pulling
O	us
O	to
O	the
O	_Nimrod_
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	lantern
O	from
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	Captain
O	Coffin
O	had
O	come
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	to
O	rescue
O	me
O	.
O	My
O	shot
O	from
O	the
O	bomb-gun
O	had
O	killed
O	the
O	bull
O	whale
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	had
O	also
O	taught
O	Captain
O	Coffin
O	two
O	lessons:
O	First
O	,
O	not
O	to
O	leave
O	a
O	whale
O	merely
O	because
O	it
O	is
O	spouting
O	blood
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	is
O	liable
O	,
O	as
O	in
O	the
O	present
O	case
O	,
O	to
O	clear
O	its
O	spouting
O	,
O	as
O	its
O	ruptured
O	blood
O	vessel
O	is
O	drained
O	,
O	and
O	like
O	a
O	wounded
O	animal
O	,
O	to
O	fight
O	with
O	renewed
O	vigor;
O	second
O	,
O	not
O	to
O	despise
O	the
O	bomb-gun
O	.
O	Always
O	use
O	your
O	bomb-gun
O	on
O	a
O	whale
O	,
O	children
O	.
O	We
O	solemnly
O	told
O	Captain
O	Daniel
O	that
O	we
O	would
O	do
O	so
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	we
O	bade
O	him
O	good
O	night
O	and
O	went
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	_Greyhound_
O	with
O	sea-pictures
O	in
O	our
O	minds
O	that
O	can
O	never
O	go
O	out
O	of
O	them
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	we
O	live
O	.
O	SAVED
O	BY
O	A
O	SEAL
O	By
O	Theodore
O	A
O	.
O	Cutting
O	The
O	liveliest
O	seal
O	that
O	father
O	and
O	I
O	ever
O	caught
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	only
O	one
O	that
O	ever
O	got
O	away
O	from
O	us
O	after
O	we
O	had
O	housed
O	it
O	,
O	was
O	Nab
O	.
O	Although
O	father
O	has
O	been
O	catching
O	seals
O	for
O	zoological
O	gardens
O	and
O	circuses
O	almost
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	I
O	can
O	remember
O	,
O	and
O	knows
O	all
O	their
O	tricks
O	both
O	in
O	water
O	and
O	on
O	land
O	,
O	yet
O	Nab
O	was
O	too
O	sharp
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	my
O	vain
O	attempt
O	to
O	recapture
O	him
O	that
O	terminated
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	exciting
O	experience
O	I
O	ever
O	had
O	with
O	a
O	seal
O	.
O	Our
O	seal-shed
O	,
O	which
O	stood
O	at
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	rocks
O	fifteen
O	feet
O	above
O	the
O	surf
O	,
O	held
O	in
O	Nab
O	'
O	s
O	day
O	eight
O	occupants
O	,
O	all
O	nearly
O	full-grown
O	.
O	The
O	circus
O	seals
O	,
O	which
O	are
O	caught
O	and
O	trained
O	while
O	young
O	,
O	had
O	all
O	been
O	sold;
O	and
O	these
O	we
O	expected
O	to
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	zoological
O	gardens
O	at
O	Philadelphia
O	and
O	Cincinnati
O	.
O	Nab
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	in
O	our
O	possession
O	long
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	before
O	he
O	demonstrated
O	his
O	exceptional
O	abilities
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	straightway
O	singled
O	out
O	to
O	be
O	trained
O	,
O	since
O	a
O	clever
O	circus
O	seal
O	is
O	usually
O	worth
O	twice
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	a
O	mere
O	menagerie
O	animal
O	.
O	Father
O	generally
O	takes
O	the
O	training
O	into
O	his
O	own
O	hands
O	and
O	sends
O	me
O	out
O	for
O	the
O	daily
O	supply
O	of
O	fish;
O	but
O	I
O	took
O	such
O	a
O	liking
O	to
O	Nab
O	that
O	I
O	spent
O	every
O	evening
O	teaching
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	first
O	drew
O	attention
O	to
O	himself
O	by
O	his
O	skill
O	in
O	stealing
O	fish
O	from
O	the
O	others
O	.
O	Although
O	I
O	always
O	gave
O	him
O	the
O	first
O	mouthful
O	,
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	quiet
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	swallow
O	it
O	and
O	be
O	ready
O	for
O	the
O	next
O	before
O	I
O	could
O	get
O	a
O	second
O	fish
O	from
O	the
O	sack
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	eye
O	a
O	shad
O	in
O	my
O	hand
O	as
O	closely
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	once
O	watched
O	the
O	young
O	salmon
O	darting
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	waters
O	of
O	Monterey
O	Bay
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	instant
O	I
O	let
O	go
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	intending
O	to
O	drop
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	open
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	next
O	seal
O	,
O	Nab
O	would
O	snap
O	it
O	as
O	it
O	fell
O	.
O	He
O	learned
O	quickly
O	the
O	trick
O	that
O	all
O	trained
O	seals
O	know--that
O	of
O	balancing
O	a
O	ball
O	on
O	the
O	nose
O	.
O	But
O	for
O	a
O	seal
O	that
O	is
O	not
O	much
O	of
O	a
O	feat
O	after
O	the
O	experience
O	of
O	keeping
O	themselves
O	constantly
O	in
O	poise
O	amidst
O	the
O	rolling
O	breakers
O	and
O	surging
O	swells
O	.
O	I
O	taught
O	him
O	to
O	rise
O	on
O	his
O	flippers
O	and
O	march
O	,
O	also
O	to
O	turn
O	to
O	right
O	or
O	left
O	at
O	the
O	word
O	.
O	But
O	his
O	education
O	had
O	not
O	proceeded
O	very
O	far
O	when
O	he
O	picked
O	up
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	account
O	the
O	trick
O	that
O	none
O	of
O	his
O	predecessors
O	had
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	acquire--how
O	to
O	escape
O	from
O	the
O	little
O	shed
O	,
O	where
O	all
O	a
O	seal
O	'
O	s
O	splashing
O	must
O	be
O	in
O	a
O	square
O	tank
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	be
O	free
O	again
O	in
O	the
O	boundless
O	Pacific
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	two
O	rooms
O	in
O	the
O	seal-house
O	,
O	one
O	at
O	the
O	back
O	for
O	the
O	animals
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	in
O	front
O	for
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	fish-lines
O	and
O	crates
O	.
O	The
O	seal
O	quarters
O	had
O	no
O	outside
O	door
O	,
O	the
O	only
O	exit
O	being
O	into
O	the
O	front
O	room
O	.
O	Father
O	,
O	unusually
O	tired
O	one
O	night
O	after
O	we
O	had
O	both
O	been
O	out
O	all
O	day
O	for
O	fish
O	,
O	went
O	down
O	alone
O	to
O	feed
O	the
O	seals
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	nearly
O	dark
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	closed
O	the
O	outside
O	door
O	without
O	catching
O	it
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	opened
O	the
O	inside
O	door
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	distribute
O	the
O	bass
O	,
O	Nab
O	took
O	advantage
O	of
O	the
O	dusk
O	to
O	steal
O	every
O	fish
O	he
O	could
O	get
O	his
O	nose
O	in
O	reach
O	of
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	impossible
O	to
O	get
O	a
O	mouthful
O	to
O	any
O	other
O	seal
O	in
O	the
O	lot;
O	and
O	father
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	quite
O	out
O	of
O	patience
O	,
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	smart
O	cut
O	over
O	his
O	stubby
O	little
O	ears
O	with
O	the
O	training
O	whip
O	.
O	Nab
O	gave
O	a
O	shrill
O	yelp
O	,
O	dived
O	between
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	legs
O	,
O	and
O	slid
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	room
O	,
O	the
O	door
O	to
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	left
O	ajar
O	.
O	A
O	seal
O	presents
O	an
O	awkward
O	appearance
O	hobbling
O	on
O	his
O	queer
O	flippers
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	can
O	make
O	rapid
O	progress
O	.
O	Before
O	father
O	could
O	get
O	his
O	balance
O	and
O	start
O	after
O	him
O	,
O	Nab
O	was
O	well
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	room
O	.
O	Father
O	stopped
O	only
O	to
O	close
O	the
O	door
O	against
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	seals
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	again
O	in
O	pursuit;
O	but
O	Nab
O	in
O	the
O	meantime
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	far
O	end
O	,
O	bumped
O	against
O	the
O	unfastened
O	door
O	and
O	was
O	scuttling
O	across
O	the
O	outer
O	threshold
O	.
O	Father
O	ran
O	after
O	him
O	,
O	only
O	to
O	see
O	his
O	body
O	floundering
O	from
O	one
O	rock
O	to
O	another
O	and
O	to
O	hear
O	its
O	happy
O	splash
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	below
O	.
O	We

O	As
O	it
O	was
O	nearly
O	low
O	tide

O	I
O	soon
O	had
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	abalone
O	on
O	my
O	hook
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	fishing
O	.
O	No
O	seals
O	were
O	in
O	sight
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	kept
O	a
O	sharp
O	lookout
O	for
O	them
O	as
O	I
O	fished
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	just
O	caught
O	a
O	second
O	shad--and
O	it

O	something
O	I
O	had
O	never
O	done
O	before
O	,
O	to
O	catch
O	a
O	shad
O	off
O	the

O	the
O	heads
O	of
O	half
O	a
O	dozen
O	seals
O	appeared
O	on
O	the
O	swells
O	to
O	my
O	left
O	.
O	More
O	heads
O	came
O	in
O	sight
O	as
O	I
O	grabbed
O	up
O	my
O	fishes
O	and
O	hastened
O	to
O	the
O	sandy
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	shore

O	I
O	was
O	in
O	high
O	spirits
O	,
O	for
O	shad
O	would
O	tempt
O	Nab
O	as
O	no
O	other
O	fish
O	could
O	.
O	In
O	less
O	than
O	two
O	minutes
O	I
O	had
O	my
O	clothes
O	off
O	,
O	the
O	lariat
O	knotted
O	round
O	my
O	waist
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	short
O	string
O	that
O	tied
O	the
O	fishes
O	together
O	between
O	my
O	teeth
O	.
O	The
O	seals
O	were
O	still
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	first
O	seen
O	them
O	,
O	out
O	less
O	than
O	two
O	hundred

O	I
O	waded
O	quickly
O	into

O	until

O	began
O	to
O	break
O	over
O	my

O	,
O	and
O	then
O	swam
O	.
O	Before

O	had
O	taken
O	three

O	I
O	held
O	by
O	my

O	about
O	so

O	thought
O	best

O	back

O	up
O	the

O	perched

O	the
O	water
O	churned
O	in

O	at
O	our
O	terrific
O	speed
O	.
O	The
O	rock
O	upon
O	which
O	I
O	hung
O	had
O	been
O	Nab
O	'
O	s
O	birthplace
O	,
O	and
O	the

O	here
O	also
O	he
O	had
O	fled
O	when
O	he
O	felt
O	my
O	line
O	round
O	his
O	flipper
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	clear
O	the
O	salt
O	water
O	from
O	my
O	mouth
O	and
O	lungs
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	work
O	my
O	way
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	rock
O	.
O	Exhausted
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	benumbed
O	with
O	cold
O	,
O	this
O	was
O	no
O	easy
O	matter;
O	and
O	once
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	fragment
O	of
O	rock
O	gave
O	way
O	beneath
O	my
O	fingers
O	,
O	I
O	nearly
O	slipped
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	last
O	I
O	crawled
O	up
O	far
O	enough
O	to
O	send
O	off
O	the
O	pelicans
O	in
O	fright
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	get
O	where
O	the
O	sun
O	would
O	strike
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	expected
O	to
O	blister
O	my
O	back
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	thought
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	welcome
O	change
O	from
O	the
O	freezing
O	process
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	blood
O	had
O	begun
O	to
O	warm
O	up
O	a
O	little
O	in
O	my
O	veins
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	getting
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	mainland
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	distance
O	of
O	only
O	a
O	hundred
O	yards
O	from
O	the
O	rock
O	across
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	I
O	looked
O	down
O	into
O	that
O	green
O	water
O	and
O	recalled
O	my
O	recent
O	experiences
O	I
O	shrank
O	from
O	sliding
O	in
O	as
O	from
O	death
O	itself
O	.
O	I
O	measured
O	the
O	distance
O	twenty
O	times
O	with
O	my
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	same
O	number
O	of
O	times
O	assured
O	myself
O	that
O	there
O	would
O	be
O	no

O	here
O	with
O	the
O	tide
O	coming

O	could
O	not
O	bring
O	myself
O	to
O	let
O	go
O	the
O	rocks
O	that
O	felt
O	so
O	firm
O	and
O	good
O	.

O	to
O	swim
O	against

O	tide

O	I
O	waited
O	much
O	longer

O	I
O	climbed
O	down
O	without

O	struck
O	back

O	Both

O	on
O	the

O	It
O	was

O	of
O	the
O	most

O	of
O	all
O	the

O	fastened
O	with

O	into
O	the

O	a

O	Reeling

O	the

O	Lee
O	had
O	learned
O	that
O	hooking
O	the
O	big
O	fish
O	was
O	the
O	easiest
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	work
O	of
O	capturing
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	decided
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	provide
O	by
O	every
O	possible
O	means
O	against
O	the
O	entanglement
O	of
O	his
O	casting-bait
O	.
O	With
O	this
O	in
O	view
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	wooden
O	casting-minnow
O	himself
O	.
O	He
O	took
O	a
O	spinner
O	and
O	the
O	glass
O	eyes
O	from
O	an
O	old
O	one

O	used
O	,

O	from
O	a

O	whittled
O	out
O	the
O	shape
O	for
O	the

O	.
O	He
O	had
O	bought
O	a
O	very

O	,
O	although
O	not
O	a
O	very
O	large
O	,
O	hand-forged
O	treble
O	hook
O	.
O	He
O	took
O	a

O	,
O	spring-steel

O	had
O	the
O	old

O	put
O	on

O	,
O	and
O	passed
O	the
O	wire
O	through
O	the
O	wooden
O	minnow
O	.
O	He
O	used
O	no
O	front
O	spinner
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	might
O	catch
O	in
O	the
O	rushes
O	.
O	The
O	front
O	eye
O	he
O	made
O	in
O	the
O	wire
O	himself
O	by
O	bending
O	and
O	twisting
O	till
O	he
O	was
O	sure
O	beyond
O	all
O	question
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	safe
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	fastened
O	his
O	copper
O	leader
O	into
O	this
O	eye
O	,
O	put
O	the
O	glass
O	eyes
O	into
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	minnow
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	careful
O	painting
O	his

O	was

O	.

O	depth
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	,
O	I
O	tied
O	a
O	bait
O	at
O	intervals
O	upon
O	the

O	the

O	,
O	seized
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	rang
O	the
O	bell
O	.
O	Generally
O	the
O	ringing
O	was
O	done
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	grave
O	and
O	proper
O	way
O	,
O	although
O	sometimes
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	bait
O	was
O	too
O	tightly
O	tied
O	,
O	the
O	quick
O	peals
O	sounded
O	like
O	a
O	call
O	to
O	a
O	fire
O	.
O	I
O	kept
O	up
O	this
O	system
O	of
O	baiting
O	the
O	string
O	for
O	about
O	a
O	week
O	,
O	until
O	I
O	thought
O	they
O	understood
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	replaced
O	the
O	worms
O	by
O	bits
O	of
O	stone
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	expected
O	,
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	looked
O	through
O	the
O	grass
O	and
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	tinkle

O	tinkle

O	rang
O	the
O	bell
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	knew
O	my
O	little

O	were
O	saying
O	,
O	""""
O	Good-morning

O	and
O	expected
O	a
O	breakfast
O	.
O	You
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	they
O	got
O	it
O	.
O	I
O	put
O	my
O	hand
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	up
O	they
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	one
O	worm
O	apiece;
O	and
O	as
O	I
O	raised
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	down
O	they
O	rushed
O	,
O	and
O	away
O	went
O	the
O	bell
O	,
O	in
O	an
O	uproarious
O	peal
O	,
O	that
O	must
O	have
O	startled
O	the
O	whole
O	neighborhood
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	quick
O	to
O	respond
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	soon
O	learned
O	to
O	ring
O	the
O	bell
O	before
O	coming
O	to
O	the
O	surface;
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	saw
O	me
O	pass
O	,
O	I
O	always
O	heard
O	their
O	welcome
O	greeting
O	.
O	But
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	minnows
O	.
O	I
O	generally
O	fed
O	them
O	first
O	,
O	about
O	twenty
O	feet
O	up
O	the
O	bank;
O	but
O	one
O	morning
O	I
O	found
O	one
O	or
O	two
O	had
O	followed
O	me
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	residence
O	of
O	the
O	stickleback
O	family
O	.
O	They
O	met
O	with
O	a
O	rude
O	reception
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	to
O	avoid
O	making
O	trouble
O	,
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	willow
O	first
O	.
O	But
O	no
O	sooner
O	had
O	the
O	bell
O	begun
O	to
O	ring
O	,
O	than
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	lot
O	of
O	ripples
O	coming
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	second
O	the
O	two
O	factions
O	were
O	in
O	mortal
O	combat
O	.
O	The
O	sticklebacks
O	were
O	fighting
O	not
O	only
O	for
O	breakfast
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	their
O	nests
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	near
O	by;
O	and
O	they
O	made
O	sad
O	work
O	of
O	the
O	poor
O	minnows
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	though
O	smart
O	in
O	some
O	things
O	,
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	whipped
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	kept
O	up
O	the
O	fight
O	,
O	though
O	losing
O	one
O	of
O	their
O	number
O	nearly
O	every
O	morning
O	.
O	The
O	bell
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	rang
O	violently
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	fear
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	sounding
O	an
O	appeal
O	from
O	a
O	voracious
O	stickleback
O	whose
O	appetite
O	had
O	got
O	the
O	better
O	of
O	his
O	rage
O	.
O	So
O	it
O	went
O	on
O	every
O	morning
O	.
O	The
O	minnows
O	had
O	learned
O	what
O	the
O	bell
O	meant
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	usually
O	defeated
O	in
O	the
O	fight
O	,
O	they
O	in
O	reality
O	had
O	their
O	betters
O	as
O	servants
O	to
O	ring
O	the
O	bell
O	and
O	call
O	them
O	to
O	meals
O	.
O	Finally
O	,
O	they
O	succeeded
O	,
O	by
O	force
O	of
O	great
O	numbers
O	,
O	in
O	driving
O	away
O	their
O	pugnacious
O	little
O	rivals
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bell
O	hung
O	silent;
O	for
O	,
O	strange
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	they
O	knew
O	what
O	the
O	sound
O	meant
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	could
O	never
O	teach
O	them
O	to
O	ring
O	it
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	could
O	rise
O	and
O	steal
O	the
O	worm
O	from
O	my
O	hand
O	without
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	am
O	inclined
O	to
O	think
O	it
O	was
O	more
O	laziness
O	than
O	inability
O	to
O	learn
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	afterward
O	picked
O	up
O	readily
O	some
O	much
O	more
O	difficult
O	tricks
O	.
O	I
O	taught
O	them
O	to
O	leap
O	from
O	the
O	water
O	into
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	lie
O	as
O	if
O	dead;
O	and
O	having
O	arranged
O	a
O	slide
O	of
O	polished
O	wood
O	upon
O	the
O	bank
O	,
O	by
O	placing
O	worms
O	upon
O	it
O	I
O	soon
O	had
O	them
O	leaping
O	out
O	and
O	sliding
O	down
O	like
O	so
O	many
O	boys
O	coasting
O	in
O	the
O	winter
O	.
O	That
O	they
O	afterward
O	did
O	it
O	for
O	amusement
O	I
O	know
O	,

O	I
O	often

O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	to
O	attract
O	but
O	the
O	fun
O	of
O	sliding
O	.
O	This

O	is
O	not

O	reached

O	crossed
O	the

O	a

O	Several

O	held
O	just
O	through

O	will
O	float
O	up
O	to
O	the

O	Willis
O	was
O	afraid
O	that
O	this
O	would
O	burst
O	his
O	gun
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	trout
O	looked
O	so
O	alluring
O	that
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	ventured
O	the
O	experiment
O	.
O	John
O	cut
O	a
O	small

O	with
O	the
O	axe
O	,

O	then
O	Willis
O	,
O	lying
O	down
O	,

O	the

O	of
O	the
O	gun
O	about
O	six
O	inches
O	beneath
O	the
O	ice
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	edged
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	stretching
O	out
O	his
O	arm
O	at
O	full

O	recoiled
O	,

O	done
O	.

O	had
O	but
O	to
O	cut
O	through

O	out

O	John
O	was
O	so
O	slow
O	with
O	his
O	axe
O	that
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	trout
O	recovered
O	and
O	darted
O	away
O	.
O	We
O	had
O	four
O	fine
O	fish
O	to
O	show
O	for
O	the
O	charge
O	of
O	powder
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	searched
O	for
O	another
O	pool
O	.
O	We
O	soon
O	came
O	to
O	one
O	much
O	deeper
O	and
O	better
O	stocked
O	with
O	trout
O	,
O	and
O	Willis
O	fired
O	under
O	the
O	ice
O	again
O	.
O	Eight
O	fish
O	were
O	secured
O	here;
O	and
O	going
O	on
O	up

O	thrust

O	gun
O	deeper
O	into

O	,
O	with
O	the
O	result
O	that
O	about

O	for
O	Willis
O	,
O	much
O	chapfallen
O	over
O	the
O	mishap
O	,
O	blamed
O	me

O	declared
O	that

O	ought
O	to
O	buy
O	him
O	a
O	new

O	.
O	As

O	,
O	no

O	In
O	this

O	(

O	)
O	we
O	have
O	rather
O	more
O	than
O	thirty
O	,
O	most
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	have
O	kept
O	in
O	confinement
O	.
O	Their
O	life
O	is
O	comparatively
O	long:
O	I
O	have
O	had
O	working
O	ants
O	which
O	were
O	seven
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	queen
O	ant
O	lived
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	nests
O	for
O	fifteen
O	years
O	.
O	The
O	community
O	consists
O	,
O	in
O	addition
O	to
O	the
O	young
O	,
O	of
O	males
O	,
O	which
O	do
O	no

O	,
O	however
O	,
O	after
O	one
O	marriage
O	flight
O	,
O	they
O	throw
O	off
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	never
O	leave
O	the
O	nest
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	it
O	wings
O	would
O	of
O	course
O	be

O	of
O	a

O	desert

O	,
O	or
O	draw

O	out
O	as
O	they
O	do
O	dead
O	workers
O	,
O	but
O	on
O	the

O	carried
O	her
O	into

O	new
O	nest
O	,
O	and
O	subsequently
O	into
O	a
O	larger
O	one
O	with
O	which
O	I
O	supplied
O	them
O	,
O	congregating
O	round
O	her
O	for
O	weeks
O	just
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	alive
O	.
O	One
O	could
O	hardly
O	help
O	fancying
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	mourning
O	her
O	loss
O	,
O	or
O	hoping
O	anxiously
O	for
O	her
O	recovery
O	.
O	The
O	communities
O	of
O	ants
O	are
O	sometimes
O	very
O	large
O	,
O	numbering
O	even
O	up
O	to
O	500
O	,
O	000
O	individuals;
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	a
O	lesson
O	to
O	us
O	,
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	has
O	ever
O	yet
O	seen
O	a
O	quarrel
O	between
O	any
O	two
O	ants
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
O	same
O	community
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	other
O	hand
O	,
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	admitted
O	that
O	they
O	are
O	in
O	hostility
O	,
O	not
O	only
O	with
O	most
O	other
O	insects
O	,
O	including
O	ants
O	of
O	different
O	species
O	,
O	but
O	even
O	with
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	species
O	if
O	belonging
O	to
O	different
O	communities
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	over
O	and
O	over
O	again
O	introduced
O	ants
O	from
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	nests
O	into
O	another
O	nest
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	species
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	invariably
O	attacked
O	,
O	seized
O	by
O	a
O	leg
O	or
O	an
O	antenna
O	,
O	and
O	dragged
O	out
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	evident
O	therefore
O	that
O	the
O	ants
O	of
O	each
O	community
O	all
O	recognize
O	one
O	another
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	very
O	remarkable
O	.
O	But
O	more
O	than
O	this
O	,
O	I
O	several
O	times
O	divided
O	a
O	nest
O	into
O	two
O	halves
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	that
O	even
O	after
O	a
O	separation
O	of
O	a
O	year
O	and
O	nine
O	months
O	they
O	recognized
O	one
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	perfectly
O	friendly;
O	while
O	they
O	at
O	once
O	attacked
O	ants
O	from
O	a
O	different
O	nest
O	,
O	although
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	species
O	.
O	It
O	has
O	been
O	suggested
O	that
O	the
O	ants
O	of
O	each
O	nest
O	have
O	some
O	sign
O	or
O	password
O	by
O	which
O	they
O	recognize
O	one
O	another
O	.
O	To
O	test
O	this
O	I
O	made
O	some
O	insensible
O	.
O	First
O	I
O	tried
O	chloroform
O	,
O	but
O	this
O	was
O	fatal
O	to
O	them;
O	and
O	as
O	therefore
O	they
O	were
O	practically
O	dead
O	,
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	consider
O	the
O	test
O	satisfactory
O	.
O	I
O	decided
O	therefore
O	to
O	intoxicate
O	them
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	less
O	easy
O	than
O	I
O	had
O	expected
O	.
O	None
O	of
O	my
O	ants
O	would
O	voluntarily
O	degrade
O	themselves
O	by
O	getting
O	drunk
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	I
O	got
O	over
O	the
O	difficulty
O	by
O	putting
O	them
O	into
O	whisky
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	fifty
O	specimens
O	,
O	twenty-five
O	from
O	one
O	nest
O	and
O	twenty-five
O	from
O	another
O	,
O	made
O	them
O	dead
O	drunk
O	,
O	marked
O	each
O	with
O	a
O	spot
O	of
O	paint
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	them
O	on
O	a
O	table
O	close
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	other
O	ants
O	from
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	nests
O	were
O	feeding
O	.
O	The
O	table
O	was
O	surrounded
O	as
O	usual
O	with
O	a
O	moat
O	of
O	water
O	to
O	prevent
O	them
O	from
O	straying
O	.
O	The
O	ants
O	which
O	were
O	feeding
O	soon
O	noticed
O	those
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	made
O	drunk
O	.
O	They
O	seemed
O	quite
O	astonished
O	to
O	find
O	their
O	comrades
O	in
O	such
O	disgraceful
O	condition
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	much
O	at
O	a
O	loss
O	to
O	know
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	their
O	drunkards
O	as
O	we
O	are
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	to
O	cut
O	my
O	story
O	short
O	,
O	they
O	carried
O	them
O	all
O	away:
O	the
O	strangers
O	they
O	took
O	to
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	moat
O	and
O	dropped
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	while
O	they
O	bore
O	their
O	friends
O	home
O	into
O	the
O	nest
O	,
O	where
O	by
O	degrees
O	they
O	slept
O	off
O	the
O	effects
O	of
O	the
O	spirit
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	is
O	evident
O	that
O	they
O	know
O	their
O	friends
O	even
O	when
O	incapable
O	of
O	giving
O	any
O	sign
O	or
O	password
O	.
O	This
O	little
O	experiment
O	also
O	shows
O	that
O	they
O	help
O	comrades
O	in
O	distress
O	.
O	If
O	a
O	wolf
O	or
O	a
O	rook
O	be
O	ill
O	or
O	injured
O	,
O	we
O	are
O	told
O	that
O	it
O	is
O	driven
O	away
O	or
O	even
O	killed
O	by
O	its
O	comrades
O	.
O	Not
O	so
O	with
O	ants
O	.
O	For
O	instance
O	,
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	nests
O	an
O	unfortunate
O	ant
O	,
O	in
O	emerging
O	from
O	the
O	chrysalis
O	skin
O	,
O	injured
O	her
O	legs
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	she
O	lay
O	on
O	her
O	back
O	quite
O	helpless
O	.
O	For
O	three
O	months
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	carefully
O	fed
O	and
O	tended
O	by
O	the
O	other
O	ants
O	.
O	In
O	another
O	case
O	an
O	ant
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	had
O	injured
O	her
O	antennae
O	.
O	I
O	watched
O	her
O	also
O	carefully
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	would
O	happen
O	.
O	For
O	some
O	days
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	leave
O	the
O	nest
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	one
O	day
O	she
O	ventured
O	outside
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	while
O	met
O	a
O	stranger
O	ant
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	species
O	,
O	but
O	belonging
O	to
O	another
O	nest
O	,
O	by
O	whom
O	she
O	was
O	at
O	once
O	attacked
O	.
O	I
O	tried
O	to
O	separate
O	them
O	,
O	but
O	whether
O	by
O	her
O	enemy
O	,
O	or
O	perhaps
O	by
O	my
O	well-meant
O	but
O	clumsy
O	kindness
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	evidently
O	much
O	hurt
O	and
O	lay
O	helplessly
O	on
O	her
O	side
O	.
O	Several
O	others
O	passed
O	her
O	without
O	taking
O	any
O	notice
O	,
O	but
O	soon
O	one
O	came
O	up
O	,
O	examined
O	her
O	carefully
O	with
O	her
O	antennae
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	her
O	off
O	tenderly
O	to
O	the
O	nest
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	,
O	I
O	think
O	,
O	who
O	saw
O	it
O	could
O	have
O	denied
O	to
O	that
O	ant
O	one
O	attribute
O	of
O	humanity
O	,
O	the
O	quality
O	of
O	kindness
O	.
O	The
O	existence
O	of
O	such
O	communities
O	as
O	those
O	of
O	ants
O	or
O	bees
O	implies
O	,
O	no
O	doubt
O	,
O	some
O	power
O	of
O	communication
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	amount
O	is
O	still
O	a
O	matter
O	of
O	doubt
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	well
O	known
O	that
O	if
O	one
O	bee
O	or
O	ant
O	discovers
O	a
O	store
O	of
O	food
O	,
O	others
O	soon
O	find
O	their
O	way
O	to
O	it
O	.
O	This
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	does
O	not
O	prove
O	much
O	.
O	It
O	makes
O	all
O	the
O	difference
O	whether
O	they
O	are
O	brought
O	or
O	sent
O	.
O	If
O	they
O	merely
O	accompany
O	on
O	her
O	return
O	a
O	companion
O	who
O	has
O	brought
O	a
O	store
O	of
O	food
O	,
O	it
O	does
O	not
O	imply
O	much
O	.
O	To
O	test
O	this
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	I
O	made
O	several
O	experiments
O	.
O	For
O	instance
O	,
O	one
O	cold
O	day
O	my
O	ants
O	were
O	almost
O	all
O	in
O	their
O	nests
O	.
O	One
O	only
O	was
O	out
O	hunting
O	and
O	about
O	six
O	feet
O	from
O	home
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	a
O	dead
O	bluebottle
O	fly
O	,
O	pinned
O	it
O	on
O	to
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	cork
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	down
O	just
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	her
O	.
O	She
O	at
O	once
O	tried
O	to
O	carry
O	off
O	the
O	fly
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	her
O	surprise
O	found
O	it
O	immovable
O	.
O	She
O	tugged
O	and
O	tugged
O	,
O	first
O	one
O	way
O	and
O	then
O	another
O	for
O	about
O	twenty
O	minutes
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	went
O	straight
O	off
O	to
O	the
O	nest
O	.
O	During
O	that
O	time
O	not
O	a
O	single
O	ant
O	had
O	come
O	out;
O	in
O	fact
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	ant
O	of
O	that
O	nest
O	out
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	.
O	She
O	went
O	straight
O	in
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	seconds--less
O	than
O	half
O	a
O	minute--came
O	out
O	again
O	with
O	no
O	less
O	than
O	twelve
O	friends
O	,
O	who
O	trooped
O	off
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	eventually
O	tore
O	up
O	the
O	dead
O	fly
O	,
O	carrying
O	it
O	off
O	in
O	triumph
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	first
O	ant
O	took
O	nothing
O	home
O	with
O	her;
O	she
O	must
O	therefore
O	somehow
O	have
O	made
O	her
O	friends
O	understand
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	found
O	some
O	food
O	,
O	and
O	wanted
O	them
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	help
O	her
O	to
O	secure
O	it
O	.
O	In
O	all
O	such
O	cases
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	my
O	experience
O	goes
O	,
O	the
O	ants
O	brought
O	their
O	friends
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	my
O	experiments
O	indicated
O	that
O	they
O	are
O	unable
O	to
O	send
O	them
O	.
O	Certain
O	species
O	of
O	ants
O	,
O	again
O	,
O	make
O	slaves
O	of
O	others
O	,
O	as
O	Huber
O	first
O	observed
O	.
O	If
O	a
O	colony
O	of
O	the
O	slave-making
O	ants
O	is
O	changing
O	the
O	nest
O	,
O	a
O	matter
O	which
O	is
O	left
O	to
O	the
O	discretion
O	of
O	the
O	slaves
O	,
O	the
O	latter
O	carry
O	their
O	mistresses
O	to
O	their
O	new
O	home
O	.
O	Again
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	uncovered
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	nests
O	of
O	the
O	Fuscous
O	ant
O	(
O	Formica
O	fusca
O	)
O	,
O	they
O	all
O	began
O	running
O	about
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	some
O	place
O	of
O	refuge
O	.
O	If
O	now
O	I
O	covered
O	over
O	one
O	small
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	nest
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	while
O	some
O	ant
O	discovered
O	it
O	.
O	In
O	such
O	a
O	case
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	brave
O	little
O	insect
O	never
O	remained
O	there
O	,
O	she
O	came
O	out
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	her
O	friends
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	first
O	one
O	she
O	met
O	she
O	took
O	up
O	in
O	her
O	jaws
O	,
O	threw
O	over
O	her
O	shoulder
O	(
O	their
O	way
O	of
O	carrying
O	friends
O	)
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	into
O	the
O	covered
O	part;
O	then
O	both
O	came
O	out
O	again
O	,
O	found
O	two
O	more
O	friends
O	and
O	brought
O	them
O	in
O	,
O	the
O	same
O	manoeuvre
O	being
O	repeated
O	until
O	the
O	whole
O	community
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	place
O	of
O	safety
O	.
O	This
O	I
O	think
O	says
O	much
O	for
O	their
O	public
O	spirit
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	seems
O	to
O	prove
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	F
O	.
O	fusca
O	at
O	least
O	,
O	the
O	powers
O	of
O	communication
O	are
O	but
O	limited
O	.
O	One
O	kind
O	of
O	slave-making
O	ant
O	has
O	become
O	so
O	completely
O	dependent
O	on
O	their
O	slaves
O	that
O	even
O	if
O	provided
O	with
O	food
O	they
O	will
O	die
O	of
O	hunger
O	,
O	unless
O	there
O	is
O	a
O	slave
O	to
O	put
O	it
O	into
O	their
O	mouths
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	thrive
O	very
O	well
O	if
O	supplied
O	with
O	a
O	slave
O	for
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	so
O	once
O	a
O	week
O	to
O	clean
O	and
O	feed
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	many
O	cases
O	the
O	community
O	does
O	not
O	consist
O	of
O	ants
O	only
O	.
O	They
O	have
O	domestic
O	animals
O	,
O	and
O	indeed
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	going
O	too
O	far
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	they
O	have
O	domesticated
O	more
O	animals
O	than
O	we
O	have
O	.
O	Of
O	these
O	the
O	most
O	important
O	are
O	Aphides
O	on
O	trees
O	and
O	bushes;
O	others
O	collect
O	root-feeding
O	Aphides
O	into
O	their
O	nests
O	.
O	They
O	serve
O	as
O	cows
O	to
O	the
O	ants
O	,
O	which
O	feed
O	on
O	the
O	honey-dew
O	secreted
O	by
O	the
O	Aphides
O	.
O	Not
O	only
O	,
O	moreover
O	,
O	do
O	the
O	ants
O	protect
O	the
O	Aphides
O	themselves
O	,
O	but
O	collect
O	their
O	eggs
O	in
O	autumn
O	,
O	and
O	tend
O	them
O	carefully
O	through
O	the
O	winter
O	,
O	ready
O	for
O	the
O	next
O	spring
O	.
O	Many
O	other
O	insects
O	are
O	also
O	domesticated
O	by
O	ants
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	from
O	living
O	constantly
O	underground
O	,
O	have
O	completely
O	lost
O	their
O	eyes
O	and
O	become
O	quite
O	blind
O	.
O	When
O	we
O	see
O	a
O	community
O	of
O	ants
O	working
O	together
O	in
O	perfect
O	harmony
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	impossible
O	not
O	to
O	ask
O	ourselves
O	how
O	far
O	they
O	are
O	mere
O	exquisite
O	automatons;
O	how
O	far
O	they
O	are
O	conscious
O	beings
O	.
O	When
O	we
O	watch
O	an
O	ant-hill
O	tenanted
O	by
O	thousands
O	of
O	industrious
O	inhabitants
O	,
O	excavating
O	chambers
O	,
O	forming
O	tunnels
O	,
O	making
O	roads
O	,
O	guarding
O	their
O	home
O	,
O	gathering
O	food
O	,
O	feeding
O	the
O	young
O	,
O	tending
O	their
O	domestic
O	animals--each
O	one
O	fulfilling
O	its
O	duties
O	industriously
O	,
O	and
O	without
O	confusion--it
O	is
O	difficult;
O	altogether
O	to
O	deny
O	to
O	them
O	the
O	gift
O	of
O	reason;
O	and
O	all
O	our
O	recent
O	observations
O	tend
O	to
O	confirm
O	the
O	opinion
O	that
O	their
O	mental
O	powers
O	differ
O	from
O	those
O	of
O	men
O	,
O	not
O	so
O	much
O	in
O	kind
O	as
O	in

O	Miss

O	him
O	,
O	and
O	smaller
O	ones
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	kind
O	that
O	looked
O	like
O	lobsters
O	in
O	a
O	dinner-horn
O	.
O	But
O	none
O	of
O	these
O	got
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	,
O	else
O	I
O	should
O	not
O	have
O	any
O	story
O	to
O	tell
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	having
O	paddled
O	about
O	long
O	enough
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	settling
O	in
O	life
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	looked
O	around
O	until
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	flat
O	bit
O	of
O	shell
O	that
O	just
O	suited
O	him
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	sat
O	down
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	grew
O	fast
O	,
O	like
O	old
O	Holger
O	Danske
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	Danish
O	myth
O	.
O	Only
O	,
O	unlike
O	Holger
O	,
O	he
O	didn
O	'
O	t
O	go
O	to
O	sleep
O	,
O	but
O	proceeded
O	to
O	make
O	himself
O	at
O	home
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	made
O	an
O	opening
O	in
O	his
O	upper
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	rigged
O	for
O	himself
O	a
O	mouth
O	and
O	a
O	stomach
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	a
O	whole
O	row
O	of
O	feelers
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	catching
O	little
O	worms
O	and
O	floating
O	eggs
O	and
O	bits
O	of
O	jelly
O	and
O	bits
O	of
O	lime
O	,
O	--everything
O	he
O	could
O	get
O	,
O	--and
O	cramming
O	them
O	into
O	his
O	little
O	stomach
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	curious
O	ways
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	funniest
O	of
O	all
O	was
O	what
O	he
O	did
O	with
O	the
O	bits
O	of
O	lime
O	.
O	He
O	kept
O	taking
O	them
O	in
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	wall
O	himself
O	up
O	inside
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	person
O	would
O	stone
O	a
O	well
O	or
O	as
O	though
O	a
O	man
O	should
O	swallow
O	pebbles
O	and
O	stow
O	them
O	away
O	in
O	his
O	feet
O	and
O	all
O	around
O	under
O	the
O	skin
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	filled
O	himself
O	full
O	.
O	But
O	little
O	Favosites
O	became
O	lonesome
O	all
O	alone
O	on
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	that
O	old
O	ocean
O	,
O	among
O	so
O	many
O	outlandish
O	neighbors;
O	and
O	so
O	,
O	one
O	night
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	fast
O	asleep
O	,
O	and
O	dreaming
O	as
O	only
O	a
O	coral
O	animal
O	can
O	dream
O	,
O	there
O	sprouted
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	side
O	,
O	where
O	his
O	sixth
O	rib
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	had
O	so
O	many
O	,
O	another
O	little
O	Favosites
O	,
O	who
O	very
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	eat
O	worms
O	and
O	wall
O	himself
O	up
O	as
O	if
O	for
O	dear
O	life
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	from
O	these
O	two
O	another
O	and
O	another
O	little
O	bud
O	came
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	another
O	and
O	another
O	little
O	Favosites
O	was
O	formed
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	all
O	kept
O	growing
O	up
O	higher
O	and
O	higher
O	,
O	and
O	cramming
O	themselves
O	fuller
O	and
O	fuller
O	of
O	limestone
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	there
O	were
O	so
O	many
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	so
O	crowded
O	together
O	,
O	that
O	there
O	wasn
O	'
O	t
O	room
O	for
O	them
O	to
O	grow
O	round;
O	so
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	grow
O	six-sided
O	,
O	like
O	the
O	cells
O	in
O	a
O	honeycomb
O	.
O	Once
O	in
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	some
O	one
O	in
O	the
O	company
O	would
O	get
O	mad
O	because
O	the
O	others
O	got
O	all
O	of
O	the
O	lime
O	,
O	or
O	would
O	feel
O	uneasy
O	at
O	sitting
O	still
O	so
O	long
O	and
O	swallowing
O	stones
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	secede
O	from
O	the
O	little
O	union
O	,
O	without
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	saying
O	""""
O	Good-bye
O	,
O	""""
O	and
O	would
O	sail
O	around
O	like
O	the
O	old
O	Medusa
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	lay
O	more
O	eggs
O	,
O	which
O	would
O	hatch
O	out
O	into
O	more
O	Favosites
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	ones
O	died
O	or
O	swam
O	away
O	or
O	were
O	walled
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	new
O	ones
O	filled
O	their
O	places
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	colony
O	thrived
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	accumulated
O	quite
O	a
O	stock
O	of
O	lime
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	freshet
O	in
O	the
O	Menomonee
O	River
O	,
O	and
O	piles
O	of
O	dirt
O	and
O	sand
O	and
O	ground-up
O	iron
O	ore
O	were
O	brought
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	little
O	Favosites
O	'
O	mouths
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	it
O	.
O	They
O	didn
O	'
O	t
O	like
O	the
O	taste
O	of
O	iron
O	,
O	so
O	they
O	all
O	died;
O	but
O	we
O	know
O	that
O	their
O	house
O	was
O	not
O	spoiled
O	,
O	for
O	we
O	have
O	it
O	here
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	rock-house
O	they
O	were
O	making
O	was
O	tumbled
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	dirt
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rolling
O	pebbles
O	knocked
O	the
O	corners
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	mud
O	worked
O	its
O	way
O	into
O	the
O	cracks
O	and
O	destroyed
O	its
O	beautiful
O	whiteness
O	.
O	There
O	it
O	lay
O	for
O	ages
O	,
O	till
O	the
O	earth
O	gave
O	a
O	great
O	,
O	long
O	heave
O	,
O	that
O	raised
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	Wisconsin
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	ocean
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	mud
O	around
O	our
O	Favosites
O	'
O	house
O	packed
O	and
O	dried
O	into
O	hard
O	rock
O	and
O	closed
O	it
O	in;
O	and
O	so
O	it
O	became
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	dry
O	land
O	.
O	There
O	it
O	lay
O	,
O	imbedded
O	in
O	the
O	rock
O	for
O	centuries
O	and
O	centuries
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	fishes
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	animals
O	looked
O	on
O	them
O	in
O	awe
O	and
O	wonder
O	as
O	the
O	Indians
O	eyed
O	Columbus
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	like
O	the
O	gar-pike
O	in
O	our
O	Western
O	rivers
O	,
O	only
O	much
O	larger
O	,
O	--as
O	big
O	as
O	a
O	stove-pipe
O	,
O	--and
O	with
O	a
O	crust
O	as
O	hard
O	as
O	a
O	turtle
O	'
O	s
O	shell
O	.
O	Then
O	there
O	came
O	sharks
O	,
O	of
O	strange
O	forms
O	,
O	savage
O	and
O	ferocious
O	,
O	with
O	teeth
O	like
O	bowie-knives
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	fishes
O	came
O	and
O	went
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	more
O	times
O	came
O	and
O	went
O	,
O	but
O	still
O	Favosites
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Then
O	came
O	the
O	long
O	,
O	hot
O	,
O	wet
O	summer
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	mists
O	hung
O	over
O	the
O	earth
O	so
O	thick
O	that
O	you
O	might
O	almost
O	have
O	cut
O	them
O	into
O	chunks
O	with
O	a
O	knife
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	loaf
O	of
O	gingerbread;
O	and
O	great
O	ferns
O	and
O	rushes
O	,
O	big
O	as
O	an
O	oak
O	and
O	tall
O	as
O	a
O	steeple
O	,
O	grew
O	over
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	Huge
O	reptiles
O	with
O	jaws
O	like
O	a
O	front
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	teeth
O	like
O	cross-cut
O	saws
O	,
O	and
O	little
O	reptiles
O	with
O	wings
O	like
O	bats
O	,
O	crawled
O	and
O	swam
O	and
O	flew
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	ferns
O	died
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	reptiles
O	died
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rush-trees
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	swamps
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Mississippi
O	,
O	now
O	become
O	quite
O	a
O	river
O	,
O	covered
O	them
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	packed
O	away
O	under
O	great
O	layers
O	of
O	clay
O	and
O	sand
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	were
O	turned
O	into
O	coal
O	,
O	and
O	wept
O	bitter
O	tears
O	of
O	petroleum
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	Favosites
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	rock
O	at
O	Oconto
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	mists
O	cleared
O	up
O	and
O	the
O	sun
O	shone
O	and
O	the
O	grass
O	began
O	to
O	grow
O	,
O	and
O	strange
O	animals
O	began
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	feed
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	funny
O	little
O	zebra
O	horses
O	,
O	no
O	bigger
O	than
O	a
O	Newfoundland
O	dog
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	hairy
O	elephants
O	,
O	and
O	hogs
O	with
O	noses
O	so
O	long
O	they
O	could
O	sit
O	on
O	their
O	hind
O	legs
O	and
O	root
O	,
O	and
O	lots
O	of
O	still
O	stranger
O	creatures
O	that
O	no
O	man
O	ever
O	saw
O	alive
O	.
O	But
O	still
O	Favosites
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	long
O	,
O	long
O	summer
O	passed
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	autumn
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Indian
O	summer;
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	great
O	winter
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	snowed
O	and
O	snowed
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	cold
O	that
O	the
O	snow
O	wasn
O	'
O	t
O	off
O	by
O	the
O	Fourth
O	of
O	July;
O	and
O	then
O	it
O	snowed
O	and
O	snowed
O	till
O	the
O	snow
O	never
O	went
O	off
O	at
O	all;
O	and
O	then
O	it
O	got
O	so
O	cold
O	that
O	it
O	snowed
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	,
O	till
O	the
O	snow
O	covered
O	all
O	the
O	animals
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	mountains
O	.
O	Then
O	it
O	would
O	thaw
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	and
O	streams
O	of
O	water
O	would
O	run
O	over
O	the
O	snow;
O	then
O	it
O	would
O	freeze
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	pack
O	it
O	into
O	solid
O	ice
O	.
O	Still
O	it
O	went
O	on
O	,
O	snowing
O	and
O	thawing
O	and
O	freezing
O	till
O	the
O	ice
O	was
O	a
O	mile
O	deep
O	over
O	Wisconsin
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	whole
O	United
O	States
O	was
O	one
O	great
O	skating
O	rink
O	.
O	So
O	it
O	kept
O	on
O	for
O	about
O	a
O	million
O	years
O	,
O	until
O	once
O	when
O	the
O	spring
O	came
O	and
O	the
O	south
O	winds
O	blew
O	,
O	it
O	began
O	to
O	thaw
O	up
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	ice
O	came
O	sliding
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	mountains
O	and
O	hills
O	,
O	tearing
O	up
O	rocks
O	little
O	and
O	big
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	a
O	chip
O	to
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	a
O	meeting
O	house
O	,
O	crushing
O	forests
O	as
O	you
O	would
O	crush
O	an
O	egg-shell
O	,
O	and
O	wiping
O	out
O	rivers
O	as
O	you
O	would
O	wipe
O	out
O	a
O	chalk-mark
O	.
O	So
O	it
O	came
O	pushing
O	,
O	thundering
O	,
O	grinding
O	along
O	slowly
O	enough
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	tremendous
O	force
O	,
O	this
O	mile-deep
O	glacier
O	,
O	like
O	an
O	immense
O	plow
O	drawn
O	by
O	a
O	million
O	oxen
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	ice
O	plowed
O	across
O	Oconto
O	County
O	,
O	and
O	little
O	Favosites
O	was
O	rooted
O	out
O	from
O	the
O	quiet
O	place
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	lain
O	so
O	long;
O	but
O	,
O	by
O	good
O	fortune
O	,
O	he
O	happened
O	to
O	slip
O	into
O	a
O	crevice
O	in
O	the
O	ice
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	wasn
O	'
O	t
O	much
O	crowded

O	HOW
O	THE
O	STONE-AGE
O	CHILDREN
O	PLAYED
O	By
O	Charles

O	Abbott
O	Not
O	long
O	since
O	I
O	wandered
O	along
O	a
O	pretty
O	brook
O	that
O	rippled
O	through
O	a

O	that

O	So
O	,
O	to
O	while
O	away

O	,
O	I
O	commenced
O	geologizing;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	plodded
O	along
O	my
O	lonely
O	way
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	everywhere
O	traces
O	of
O	an

O	time
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	sparkling

O	I
O	turned
O	over
O	the

O	earth
O	by
O	the
O	brook-side
O	,
O	and
O	gathered
O	here

O	a

O	fatigue
O	,
O	and
O	filled
O	me
O	with
O	the
O	interest
O	of
O	eager
O	search;
O	and
O	I
O	dug
O	and
O	sifted

O	washed
O	the
O	sandy
O	soil
O	for

O	made

O	,
O	the

O	Hooks
O	of
O	exactly
O	the

O	as

O	been

O	within

O	mile
O	of

O	I
O	worked
O	in
O	that

O	.
O	The
O	fish-hooks
O	found
O	in
O	Norway
O	have
O	been
O	thought
O	to
O	be
O	best

O	really
O	used

O	in
O	salt
O	water
O	and
O	perch
O	and
O	pike
O	in
O	inland
O	lakes
O	.
O	The
O	broken
O	hooks
O	I
O	found
O	were
O	fully
O	as
O	large;
O	and
O	so
O	the
O	little
O	brook
O	that
O	now
O	ripples
O	down
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	large
O	stream
O	,
O	must
O	have
O	had
O	a
O	good
O	many
O	big
O	fishes
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	stone-age
O	fishermen
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	brought
O	their
O	fishing-hooks
O	,
O	and
O	have
O	lost
O	them
O	,
O	along
O	this
O	remnant
O	of
O	a
O	larger
O	stream
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	must
O	not
O	be
O	supposed
O	that
O	only
O	children
O	in
O	this
O	by-gone
O	era
O	did
O	the
O	fishing
O	for
O	their
O	tribe
O	.
O	Just
O	as
O	the
O	men
O	captured
O	the
O	larger
O	game
O	,
O	so
O	they
O	took
O	the
O	bigger
O	fishes;
O	but
O	it
O	is
O	scarcely
O	probable
O	that
O	the
O	boys
O	who
O	waded
O	the
O	little
O	brooks
O	with
O	bows
O	and
O	arrows
O	would
O	remain
O	content
O	with
O	that
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	long
O	before
O	they
O	were
O	men
O	,
O	doubtless
O	they
O	were
O	adepts
O	in
O	catching
O	the
O	more
O	valuable
O	fishes
O	that
O	abounded
O	,
O	in
O	Indian
O	times
O	,
O	in
O	all
O	our
O	rivers
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	fishing
O	,
O	I
O	think
O	,
O	was
O	another
O	way
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	stone-age

O	played
O	.

O	a
O	long
O	way
O	off
O	,
O	called

O	I

O	quite
O	grown
O	up
O	now
O	and
O	shall
O	not
O	get
O	any
O	bigger
O	.
O	Don

O	t
O	you
O	think

O	no
O	other
O	animal
O	which
O	is

O	I

O	than
O	the
O	Elephant
O	or
O	the
O	Camel
O	,
O	but
O	of
O	course
O	I
O	am
O	not

O	You

O	afraid

O	No
O	,

O	,
O	I
O	do
O	not

O	you
O	up

O	all;
O	I
O	should
O	not
O	like
O	to
O	eat
O	little
O	boys
O	and
O	girls;
O	indeed
O	,
O	I

O	think
O	I
O	could

O	sure
O	I
O	do

O	I

O	leaves
O	and

O	like
O	that;
O	I
O	can
O	reach
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	trees
O	because
O	I
O	have
O	such
O	a
O	long
O	neck
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	a
O	lady
O	came
O	to
O	see
O	me
O	here
O	and
O	she
O	had
O	some
O	very
O	nice-looking
O	green
O	things
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	thought
O	that
O	I
O	would
O	like
O	to
O	eat
O	them
O	as
O	they
O	looked
O	so
O	nice;
O	so
O	I
O	just
O	bent
O	my
O	head
O	over
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	bars
O	of
O	my
O	cage
O	and
O	took
O	a
O	bite
O	at
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	at
O	all
O	nice
O	,
O	really
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	lady
O	made
O	such
O	a
O	fuss
O	!
O	She
O	thought
O	I
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	eat
O	her
O	up
O	,
O	I
O	believe
O	.
O	I
O	heard
O	afterwards
O	that
O	the
O	things
O	I
O	had
O	eaten
O	were
O	the
O	flowers
O	on
O	her
O	hat
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	real
O	flowers
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	I
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	think
O	people
O	ought
O	to
O	have
O	such
O	things
O	in
O	their
O	hats
O	if
O	they
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	want
O	us
O	to
O	eat
O	them
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	the
O	lady
O	had
O	brought
O	them
O	on
O	purpose
O	for
O	me
O	,
O	so
O	I
O	didn
O	'
O	t
O	see
O	why
O	I
O	shouldn
O	'
O	t
O	eat
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	think
O	that
O	lady
O	will
O	come
O	quite
O	close
O	to
O	my
O	cage
O	again
O	.
O	I
O	lived
O	here
O	alone
O	for
O	quite
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	get
O	a
O	playmate
O	for
O	me
O	.
O	You
O	see
O	,
O	there
O	are
O	not
O	nearly
O	so
O	many
O	of
O	my
O	family
O	now
O	as
O	there
O	used
O	to
O	be
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	we
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	like
O	traveling
O	over
O	the
O	sea
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	I
O	have
O	a
O	playmate
O	and
O	he
O	is
O	a
O	very
O	nice
O	little
O	chap;
O	of
O	course
O	he
O	is
O	not
O	as
O	fine
O	and
O	big
O	as
O	I
O	am
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	will
O	grow
O	up
O	in
O	time
O	and
O	I
O	shall
O	be
O	very
O	glad
O	to
O	have
O	some
O	company
O	.
O	I
O	can
O	really
O	run
O	quite
O	fast
O	when
O	I
O	have
O	room
O	,
O	but
O	here
O	there
O	isn
O	'
O	t
O	room
O	enough;
O	and
O	I
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	very
O	much
O	mind
O	,
O	because
O	I
O	'
O	m
O	quite
O	content
O	to
O	walk
O	about
O	gently
O	,
O	thank
O	you
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	I
O	have
O	to
O	take
O	great
O	care
O	of
O	my
O	health
O	,
O	you
O	know
O	,
O	because
O	I
O	'
O	m
O	rather
O	delicate
O	and
O	not
O	like
O	the
O	Ostrich
O	,
O	who
O	seems
O	to
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	eat
O	almost
O	anything
O	.
O	Why
O	,
O	he
O	tells
O	me
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	very
O	fond
O	of
O	rusty
O	nails
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	for
O	pennies
O	he
O	considers
O	them
O	most
O	delicious
O	.
O	It
O	'
O	s
O	a
O	very
O	funny
O	sort
O	of
O	taste
O	,
O	I
O	think
O	.
O	No
O	,
O	it
O	'
O	s
O	no
O	good
O	for
O	you
O	to
O	offer
O	me
O	nuts
O	,
O	thank
O	you
O	,
O	because
O	I
O	couldn
O	'
O	t
O	crack
O	them
O	.
O	My
O	horns
O	,
O	were
O	you
O	asking
O	about
O	?
O	We
O	all
O	have
O	horns
O	,
O	both
O	gentlemen
O	and
O	lady
O	Giraffes
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	are
O	always
O	quite
O	small
O	,
O	like
O	mine
O	.
O	They
O	'
O	re
O	not
O	much
O	use
O	to
O	us
O	,
O	you
O	know
O	,
O	for
O	when
O	we
O	want
O	to
O	fight
O	any
O	one
O	we
O	use
O	our
O	feet--we
O	can
O	give
O	very
O	strong
O	kicks
O	with
O	our
O	fore-feet
O	,
O	if
O	we
O	like
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	whole
O	,
O	we
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	like
O	fighting;
O	we
O	find
O	that
O	it
O	'
O	s
O	much
O	safer
O	to
O	run
O	away--you
O	see
O	,
O	we
O	can
O	run
O	so
O	fast
O	that
O	there
O	are
O	not
O	many
O	creatures
O	who
O	can
O	catch
O	us
O	.
O	I
O	am
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	said
O	,
O	very
O	particular
O	about
O	my
O	food
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	like
O	thorns
O	or
O	thistles
O	,
O	so
O	when
O	I
O	come
O	across
O	a
O	plant
O	with
O	prickly
O	thorns
O	on
O	it
O	,
O	I
O	carefully
O	pick
O	off
O	the
O	leaves
O	with
O	my
O	tongue
O	and
O	leave
O	the
O	thorns
O	behind
O	.
O	I
O	don
O	'
O	t
O	believe
O	you
O	could
O	do
O	that
O	with
O	your
O	tongue
O	,
O	but
O	mine
O	is
O	a
O	very
O	useful
O	tongue
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	shouldn
O	'
O	t
O	like
O	to
O	change
O	it
O	with
O	anybody
O	.
O	I
O	sometimes
O	find
O	it
O	rather
O	awkward
O	to
O	get
O	anything
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	just
O	between
O	my
O	front
O	feet;
O	I
O	have
O	to
O	put
O	my
O	legs
O	very
O	wide
O	apart
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	bend
O	down
O	my
O	neck
O	,
O	like
O	this
O	.
O	I
O	suppose
O	it
O	does
O	look
O	rather
O	funny
O	,
O	so
O	I
O	don
O	'

O	mind
O	if
O	you
O	do
O	laugh
O	at
O	me
O	.
O	But
O	then
O	,
O	you
O	know
O	,
O	you
O	look
O	just
O	as
O	funny
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	with
O	your
O	very
O	small
O	legs
O	and
O	no
O	neck

O	all
O	to

O	and
O	no

O	sometimes
O	wonder

O	on
O	at

O	.
O	I
O	come

O	PARROTS
O	Anonymous
O	Outside
O	the
O	Parrot-house
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	terrible
O	noise;
O	a
O	screaming
O	,
O	squawking
O	,
O	shouting
O	,
O	and
O	crying
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	whole
O	place
O	were
O	on
O	fire
O	,
O	or
O	every
O	Parrot
O	were
O	being
O	killed
O	.
O	The
O	Macaws
O	were
O	sitting
O	on
O	their
O	little
O	perches
O	out
O	in
O	the
O	open
O	air
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	very
O	proud
O	of
O	themselves
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	greatly
O	enjoyed
O	being
O	outside
O	on
O	a
O	sunny
O	,
O	warm
O	day;
O	it
O	was
O	much
O	better
O	than
O	being
O	in
O	a
O	cage
O	,
O	inside
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	all
O	very
O	fine
O	birds;
O	some
O	had
O	blue
O	heads
O	and
O	yellow
O	bodies
O	and
O	green
O	tails;
O	others
O	had
O	red
O	heads
O	and
O	yellow
O	tails;
O	there
O	were
O	one
O	or
O	two
O	who
O	were
O	quite
O	white
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	each
O	one
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	fine
O	fellow
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	all
O	shouted
O	and
O	screamed
O	and
O	squawked
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	their
O	voices
O	.
O	And
O	what
O	was
O	it
O	all
O	about
O	?
O	The
O	greatest
O	noise
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	going
O	on
O	round
O	one
O	perch
O	,
O	where
O	a
O	big
O	Macaw
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	blue
O	and
O	green
O	head
O	,
O	was
O	talking
O	very
O	loud
O	and
O	very
O	fast
O	to
O	a
O	group
O	of
O	other
O	birds
O	close
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	angry
O	about
O	something
O	.
O	In
O	one
O	claw
O	he
O	held
O	a
O	large
O	apple
O	,
O	and
O	if

O	would

O	bite
O	out

O	,
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	put
O	Jess
O	up
O	,
O	would
O	return
O	with
O	Rab
O	and
O	shut

O	James
O	buried
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	neighbors
O	mourning
O	,
O	Rab
O	inspecting
O	the
O	solemnity
O	from
O	a
O	distance
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	snow
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	black
O	ragged
O	hole
O	would
O	look
O	strange
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	swelling
O	spotless
O	cushion
O	of
O	white
O	.
O	James
O	looked
O	after
O	everything;
O	then
O	rather
O	suddenly
O	fell
O	ill
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	to
O	bed;
O	was
O	insensible
O	when
O	the
O	doctor
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	died
O	.
O	A
O	sort
O	of
O	low
O	fever
O	was
O	prevailing
O	in
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	want
O	of
O	sleep
O	,
O	his
O	exhaustion
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	misery
O	,
O	made
O	him
O	apt

O	take
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	grave
O	was
O	not
O	difficult
O	to

O	.
O	A

O	fall
O	of
O	snow
O	had
O	again

O	all

O	must

O	.
O	I
O	was

O	serving
O	as
O	Major
O	in
O	the
O	--th
O	Massachusetts
O	Regiment--the

O	a
O	bloody
O	time
O	the

O	had
O	of
O	it
O	too
O	.
O	About
O	2
O	P
O	.
O	M
O	.
O	we
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	out
O	to
O	skirmish
O	along
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	in
O	which
O	,
O	as
O	our
O	generals
O	suspected
O	,
O	the
O	Rebs
O	lay
O	massing
O	for
O	a
O	charge
O	across
O	the
O	slope
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	crest
O	of
O	which
O	our
O	army
O	was
O	posted
O	.
O	We
O	had
O	barely
O	entered
O	the
O	underbrush
O	when
O	we
O	met
O	the
O	heavy
O	formations
O	of
O	Magruder
O	in
O	the
O	very
O	act
O	of
O	charging
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	,
O	our
O	thin
O	line
O	of
O	skirmishers
O	was
O	no
O	impediment
O	to
O	those
O	onrushing
O	masses
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	on
O	us
O	and
O	over
O	us
O	before
O	we
O	could
O	get
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	.
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	think
O	that
O	half
O	of
O	those
O	running
O	,
O	screaming
O	masses
O	of
O	men
O	ever
O	knew
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	passed
O	over
O	the
O	remnants

O	as
O	plucky
O	a

O	as
O	ever
O	came
O	out

O	the
O	old
O	Bay
O	State
O	.
O	But
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	boys
O	had
O	good
O	reason
O	to
O	remember
O	that
O	afternoon
O	at
O	the
O	base
O	of
O	Malvern
O	Hill
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	among
O	the
O	number:
O	for
O	when
O	the
O	last
O	line
O	of
O	Rebs
O	had
O	passed
O	over
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	left
O	among
O	the
O	bushes
O	with
O	the
O	breath
O	nearly
O	trampled
O	out
O	of
O	me
O	and
O	an
O	ugly
O	bayonet-gash
O	through
O	my
O	thigh;
O	and
O	mighty
O	little
O	consolation
O	it
O	for
O	me
O	at
O	that
O	moment
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	fellow
O	who
O	ran
O	me
O	through
O	lying
O	stark
O	dead
O	at
O	my
O	side
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	bullet-hole
O	in
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	his
O	shock
O	of
O	coarse
O	black
O	hair
O	matted
O	with
O	blood
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	stony
O	eyes
O	looking
O	into
O	mine
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	I
O	bandaged
O	up
O	my
O	limb
O	the
O	best
O	I
O	might
O	and
O	started
O	to
O	crawl
O	away
O	,
O	for
O	our
O	batteries
O	had
O	opened
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	grape
O	and
O	canister
O	that
O	came
O	hurtling
O	down
O	the
O	slope
O	passed
O	but
O	a
O	few
O	feet
O	over
O	my
O	head
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	slow
O	and
O	painful
O	work
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	can
O	imagine
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	by
O	dint
O	of
O	perseverance
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	dragged
O	myself
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	left
O	of
O	the
O	direct
O	range
O	of
O	the
O	batteries
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	creeping
O	to
O	the
O	verge
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	looked
O	off
O	over
O	the
O	green
O	slope
O	.
O	I
O	understood
O	by
O	the
O	crash
O	and
O	roar
O	of
O	the
O	guns
O	,
O	the
O	yells
O	and
O	cheers
O	of
O	the
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	hoarse
O	murmur
O	which
O	those
O	who
O	have
O	been
O	in
O	battle
O	know
O	,
O	but
O	which
O	I
O	cannot
O	describe
O	in
O	words
O	,
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	hot
O	work
O	going
O	on
O	out
O	there;
O	but
O	never
O	have
O	I
O	seen
O	,
O	no
O	,
O	not
O	in
O	that
O	three
O	days
O	'
O	desperate
O	_melee_
O	at
O	the
O	Wilderness
O	,
O	nor
O	at
O	that
O	terrific
O	repulse
O	we
O	had
O	at
O	Cold
O	Harbor
O	,
O	such
O	absolute
O	slaughter
O	as
O	I
O	saw
O	that
O	afternoon
O	on
O	the
O	green
O	slope
O	of
O	Malvern
O	Hill
O	.
O	The
O	guns
O	of
O	the
O	entire
O	army
O	were
O	massed
O	on
O	the
O	crest
O	,
O	and
O	thirty
O	thousand
O	of
O	our
O	infantry
O	lay
O	,
O	musket
O	in
O	hand
O	,
O	in
O	front
O	.
O	For
O	eight
O	hundred
O	yards
O	the
O	hill
O	sank
O	in
O	easy
O	declension
O	to
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	across
O	this
O	smooth
O	expanse
O	the
O	Rebs
O	must
O	charge
O	to
O	reach
O	our
O	lines
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	nothing
O	short
O	of
O	downright
O	insanity
O	to
O	order
O	men
O	to
O	charge
O	that
O	hill;
O	and
O	so
O	his
O	generals
O	told
O	Lee
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	listen
O	to
O	reason
O	that
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	he
O	sent
O	regiment
O	after
O	regiment
O	,
O	and
O	brigade
O	after
O	brigade
O	,
O	and
O	division
O	after
O	division
O	,
O	to
O	certain
O	death
O	.
O	Talk
O	about
O	Grant

O	s
O	disregard
O	of
O	human
O	life
O	,
O	his

O	I
O	ought

O	,
O	for
O	I
O	got
O	a
O	Minie
O	in
O	my
O	shoulder
O	that
O	day--was
O	hopeful
O	and
O	easy

O	what
O	Lee
O	laid
O	on
O	Hill
O	'
O	s
O	and
O	Magruder
O	'
O	s
O	divisions
O	at
O	Malvern
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	close
O	of
O	the
O	second
O	charge
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	yelling
O	mass
O	reeled
O	back
O	from
O	before
O	the
O	blaze
O	of
O	those
O	sixty
O	guns
O	and
O	thirty
O	thousand
O	rifles
O	,
O	even
O	as
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	break
O	and
O	fly
O	backward
O	toward
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	saw
O	from
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	I
O	lay
O	a
O	riderless
O	horse
O	break
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	confused
O	and
O	flying
O	mass
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	mane
O	and
O	tail
O	erect
O	and
O	spreading
O	nostril
O	,
O	come
O	dashing
O	obliquely
O	down
O	the
O	slope
O	.
O	Over
O	fallen
O	steeds
O	and
O	heaps
O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	she
O	leaped
O	with
O	a
O	motion
O	as
O	airy
O	as
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	flying
O	fox
O	when
O	,
O	fresh
O	and
O	unjaded
O	,
O	he
O	leads
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	hounds
O	,
O	whose
O	sudden
O	cry
O	has
O	broken
O	him
O	off
O	from
O	hunting
O	mice
O	amid
O	the
O	bogs
O	of
O	the
O	meadow
O	.
O	So
O	this
O	riderless
O	horse
O	came
O	vaulting
O	along
O	.
O	Now
O	from
O	my
O	earliest
O	boyhood
O	I
O	have
O	had
O	what
O	horsemen
O	call
O	a
O	'
O	weakness
O	'
O	for
O	horses
O	.
O	Only
O	give

O	a
O	colt
O	of
O	wild
O	,
O	irregular
O	temper
O	and
O	fierce
O	blood
O	to
O	tame
O	,
O	and
O	I

O	,

O	fall
O	on
O	such
O	a
O	colt

O	s
O	soft
O	hide
O	.
O	Never
O	did
O	yell
O	or
O	kick
O	send

O	hot
O	blood
O	from

O	to
O	head
O	deluging

O	,
O	driving
O	him
O	into
O	frenzy

O	blinding
O	him
O	with

O	for

O	,
O	so
O	tender
O	and

O	'
O	And
O	I
O	patted
O	her
O	moist
O	neck
O	and
O	foam-flecked
O	shoulders
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	grooms
O	were
O	busy
O	with
O	head
O	and
O	loins
O	.
O	""""
O	That
O	night
O	our
O	brigade
O	made
O	its
O	bivouac
O	just
O	over
O	Long
O	Bridge
O	,
O	almost
O	on
O	the
O	identical
O	spot
O	where
O	four
O	years
O	before
O	I
O	had
O	camped
O	my
O	company
O	of
O	three
O	months
O	'
O	volunteers
O	.
O	With
O	what
O	experiences
O	of
O	march
O	and
O	battle
O	were
O	those
O	four
O	years
O	filled
O	!
O	For
O	three
O	of
O	these
O	years
O	Gulnare
O	had
O	been
O	my
O	constant
O	companion
O	.
O	With
O	me
O	she
O	had
O	shared
O	my
O	tent
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	rarely
O	my
O	rations
O	,
O	for
O	in
O	appetite
O	she
O	was
O	truly
O	human
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	steward
O	always
O	counted
O	her
O	as
O	one
O	of
O	our
O	'
O	mess
O	.
O	'
O	Twice
O	had
O	she
O	been
O	wounded--once
O	at
O	Fredericksburg
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	thigh;
O	and
O	once
O	at
O	Cold
O	Harbor
O	,
O	where
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	shell
O	tore
O	away
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	her
O	scalp
O	.
O	So
O	completely
O	did
O	it
O	stun
O	her
O	,
O	that
O	for
O	some
O	moments
O	I
O	thought
O	her
O	dead
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	my
O	great
O	joy
O	she
O	shortly
O	recovered
O	her
O	senses
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	wound
O	carefully
O	dressed
O	by
O	our
O	brigade
O	surgeon
O	,
O	from
O	whose
O	care
O	she
O	came
O	in
O	a
O	month
O	with
O	the
O	edges
O	of
O	the
O	wound
O	so
O	nicely
O	united
O	that
O	the
O	eye
O	could
O	with
O	difficulty
O	detect
O	the
O	scar
O	.
O	This
O	night
O	,
O	as
O	usual
O	,
O	she
O	lay
O	at
O	my
O	side
O	,
O	her
O	head
O	almost
O	touching
O	mine
O	.
O	Never
O	before
O	,
O	unless
O	when
O	on
O	a
O	raid
O	and
O	in
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	enemy
O	,
O	had
O	I
O	seen
O	her
O	so
O	uneasy
O	.
O	Her
O	movements
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	compelled
O	wakefulness
O	on
O	my
O	part
O	.
O	The
O	sky
O	was
O	cloudless
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	dim
O	light
O	I
O	lay
O	and
O	watched
O	her
O	.
O	Now
O	she
O	would
O	stretch
O	herself
O	at
O	full
O	length
O	,
O	and
O	rub
O	her
O	head
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	would
O	start
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	sitting
O	on
O	her
O	haunches
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	dog
O	,
O	lift
O	one
O	foreleg
O	and
O	paw
O	her
O	neck
O	and
O	ears
O	.
O	Anon
O	she
O	would
O	rise
O	to
O	her
O	feet
O	and
O	shake
O	herself
O	,
O	walk
O	off
O	a
O	few
O	rods
O	,
O	return
O	and
O	lie
O	down
O	again
O	by
O	my
O	side
O	.
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	what
O	to
O	make
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	unless
O	the
O	excitement
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	had
O	been
O	too
O	much
O	for
O	her
O	sensitive
O	nerves
O	.
O	I
O	spoke
O	to
O	her
O	kindly
O	and
O	petted
O	her
O	.
O	In
O	response
O	she
O	would
O	rub
O	her
O	nose
O	against
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	lick
O	my
O	hand
O	with
O	her
O	tongue--a
O	peculiar
O	habit
O	of
O	hers--like
O	a
O	dog
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	was
O	passing
O	my
O	hand
O	over
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	I
O	discovered
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	hot
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	wound
O	flashed
O	into
O	my
O	mind
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	momentary
O	fear
O	that
O	something
O	might
O	be
O	wrong
O	about
O	her
O	brain
O	,
O	but
O	after
O	thinking
O	it
O	over
O	I
O	dismissed
O	it
O	as
O	incredible
O	.
O	Still
O	I
O	was
O	alarmed
O	.
O	I
O	knew
O	that
O	something
O	was
O	amiss
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	rejoiced
O	at
O	the
O	thought
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	soon
O	be
O	at
O	home
O	where
O	she
O	could
O	have
O	quiet
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	if
O	need
O	be
O	,
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	nursing
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	the
O	morning
O	dawned
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	mare
O	and
O	I
O	took
O	our
O	last
O	meal
O	together
O	on
O	Southern
O	soil--the
O	last
O	we
O	ever
O	took
O	together
O	.
O	The
O	brigade
O	was
O	formed
O	in
O	line
O	for
O	the
O	last
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	I
O	rode
O	down
O	the
O	front
O	to
O	review
O	the
O	boys
O	she
O	moved
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	old
O	battle
O	grace
O	and
O	power
O	.
O	Only
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	by
O	a
O	shake
O	of
O	the
O	head
O	,
O	was
O	I
O	reminded
O	of
O	her
O	actions
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	.
O	I
O	said
O	a
O	few
O	words
O	of
O	farewell
O	to
O	the
O	men
O	whom
O	I
O	had
O	led
O	so
O	often
O	to
O	battle
O	,
O	with
O	whom
O	I
O	had
O	shared
O	perils
O	not
O	a
O	few
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	whom
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	reason
O	to
O	think
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	loved
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	gave
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	voice
O	slightly
O	unsteady
O	,
O	the
O	last
O	order
O	they
O	would
O	ever
O	receive
O	from
O	me:
O	'
O	Brigade
O	,
O	Attention
O	,
O	Ready
O	to
O	break
O	ranks
O	,
O	_Break
O	Ranks_
O	.
O	'
O	The
O	order
O	was
O	obeyed
O	.
O	But
O	ere
O	they
O	scattered
O	,
O	moved
O	by
O	a
O	common
O	impulse
O	,
O	they
O	gave
O	first
O	three
O	cheers
O	for
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	heartiness
O	and
O	even
O	more
O	power
O	,
O	three
O	cheers
O	for
O	Gulnare
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	,
O	standing
O	there
O	,
O	looking
O	with
O	her
O	bright
O	,
O	cheerful
O	countenance
O	full
O	at
O	the
O	men
O	,
O	pawing
O	with
O	her
O	forefeet
O	,
O	alternately
O	,
O	the

O	seemed
O	to
O	understand
O	the
O	compliment;

O	no
O	sooner
O	had
O	the
O	cheering
O	died
O	away

O	she
O	arched
O	her
O	neck
O	to
O	its
O	proudest
O	curve

O	lifted
O	her
O	thin
O	,
O	delicate
O	head
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	a
O	short
O	,
O	joyful
O	neigh
O	.
O	""""
O	My
O	arrangements
O	for
O	transporting
O	her
O	had
O	been
O	made
O	by
O	a
O	friend
O	the
O	day
O	before
O	.
O	A
O	large
O	,
O	roomy
O	car
O	had
O	been
O	secured
O	,
O	its
O	floor
O	strewn
O	with
O	bright
O	clean
O	straw
O	,
O	a
O	bucket
O	and
O	a
O	bag
O	of
O	oats
O	provided
O	,
O	and
O	everything
O	done
O	for
O	her
O	comfort
O	.
O	The
O	car
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	attached
O	to
O	the
O	through
O	express
O	,
O	in
O	consideration
O	of
O	fifty
O	dollars
O	extra
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	gladly
O	paid
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	greater
O	rapidity
O	with
O	which
O	it
O	enabled
O	me
O	to
O	make
O	my
O	journey
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	brigade
O	broke
O	up
O	into
O	groups
O	,
O	I
O	glanced
O	at
O	my
O	watch
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	barely
O	time
O	to
O	reach
O	the
O	cars
O	before
O	they
O	started
O	.
O	I
O	shook
O	the
O	reins
O	upon
O	her
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	plunge
O	,
O	startled
O	at
O	the
O	energy
O	of
O	my
O	signal
O	,
O	away
O	she
O	flew
O	.
O	What
O	a
O	stride
O	she
O	had
O	!
O	What
O	an
O	elastic
O	spring
O	!
O	She
O	touched
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	earth
O	as
O	if
O	her
O	limbs
O	were
O	of
O	spiral
O	wire
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	reached
O	the
O	car
O	my
O	friend
O	was
O	standing
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	the
O	gang-plank
O	was
O	ready
O	,
O	I
O	leaped
O	from
O	the
O	saddle
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	running
O	up
O	the
O	plank
O	into
O	the
O	car
O	,
O	whistled
O	to
O	her;
O	and
O	she
O	,
O	timid
O	and
O	hesitating
O	,
O	yet
O	unwilling
O	to
O	be
O	separated
O	from
O	me
O	,
O	crept
O	slowly
O	and
O	cautiously
O	up
O	the
O	steep
O	incline
O	and
O	stood
O	beside
O	me
O	.
O	Inside
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	complete
O	suit
O	of
O	flannel
O	clothes
O	with
O	a
O	blanket
O	and
O	,
O	better
O	than
O	all
O	,
O	a
O	lunch-basket
O	.
O	My
O	friend
O	explained
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	bought
O	the
O	clothes
O	as
O	he
O	came
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	depot
O	,
O	thinking
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	be
O	much
O	better
O	than
O	your
O	regimentals
O	,
O	'
O	and
O	suggested
O	that
O	I
O	doff
O	the
O	one
O	and
O	don
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	To
O	this
O	I
O	assented
O	the
O	more
O	readily
O	as
O	I
O	reflected
O	that
O	I
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	pass
O	one
O	night
O	at
O	least
O	in
O	the
O	car
O	,
O	with
O	no
O	better
O	bed
O	than
O	the
O	straw
O	under
O	my
O	feet
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	barely
O	time
O	to
O	undress
O	before
O	the
O	cars
O	were
O	coupled
O	and
O	started
O	.
O	I
O	tossed
O	the
O	clothes
O	to
O	my
O	friend
O	with
O	the
O	injunction
O	to
O	pack
O	them
O	in
O	my
O	trunk
O	and
O	express
O	them
O	on
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	waved
O	him
O	my
O	adieu
O	.
O	I
O	arrayed
O	myself
O	in
O	the
O	nice
O	,
O	cool
O	flannel
O	and
O	looked
O	around
O	.
O	The
O	thoughtfulness
O	of
O	my
O	friend
O	had
O	anticipated
O	every
O	want
O	.
O	An
O	old
O	cane-seated
O	chair
O	stood
O	in
O	one
O	corner
O	.
O	The
O	lunch-basket
O	was
O	large
O	and
O	well
O	supplied
O	.
O	Amid
O	the
O	oats
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	dozen
O	oranges
O	,
O	some
O	bananas
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	package
O	of
O	real
O	Havana
O	cigars
O	.
O	How
O	I
O	called
O	down
O	blessings
O	on
O	his
O	thoughtful
O	head
O	as
O	I
O	took
O	the
O	chair
O	and
O	,
O	lighting
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	fine-flavored
O	_figaros_
O	,
O	gazed
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	fields
O	past
O	which
O	we
O	were
O	gliding
O	,
O	yet
O	wet
O	with
O	morning
O	dew
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	sat
O	dreamily
O	admiring
O	the
O	beauty
O	before
O	me
O	,
O	Gulnare
O	came
O	and
O	,
O	resting
O	her
O	head
O	upon
O	my
O	shoulder
O	,
O	seemed
O	to
O	share
O	my
O	mood
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	stroked
O	her
O	fine-haired
O	,
O	satin-like
O	nose
O	,
O	recollection
O	quickened
O	and
O	memories
O	of
O	our
O	companionship
O	in
O	perils
O	thronged
O	into
O	my
O	mind
O	.
O	I
O	rode
O	again
O	that
O	midnight
O	ride
O	to
O	Knoxville
O	,
O	when
O	Burnside
O	lay
O	intrenched
O	,

O	holding
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	waiting
O	for
O	news
O	from
O	Chattanooga
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	the
O	bearer
O	,
O	chosen
O	by
O	Grant
O	himself
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	reputation

O	they
O	would
O	admire

O	started
O	up

O	were
O	dull

O	Never
O	before

O	I

O	I
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	skin

O	Each
O	breath
O	was
O	drawn

O	The

O	gradually
O	dilated
O	until
O	it
O	seemed
O	about
O	to
O	burst
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	socket
O	.
O	The
O	nostrils
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	sunken
O	and
O	motionless
O	,
O	quivered
O	,
O	swelled
O	,
O	and
O	glowed
O	.
O	The
O	respiration
O	became
O	short
O	,
O	quick
O	and
O	gasping
O	.
O	The
O	limp
O	and
O	dripping
O	ears
O	stiffened
O	and
O	stood
O	erect
O	,
O	pricked
O	sharply
O	forward
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	to
O	catch
O	the
O	slightest
O	sound
O	.
O	Spasms
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	car
O	swerved
O	and
O	vibrated
O	,
O	ran
O	along
O	her
O	frame
O	.
O	More
O	horrid
O	than
O	all
O	,
O	the
O	lips
O	slowly
O	contracted
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	white
O	,
O	sharp-edged
O	teeth
O	stood
O	uncovered
O	,
O	giving
O	an
O	indescribable
O	look
O	of
O	ferocity
O	to
O	the
O	partially
O	opened
O	mouth
O	.
O	The
O	car
O	suddenly
O	reeled
O	as
O	it
O	dashed
O	around
O	a
O	curve
O	,
O	swaying
O	her
O	almost
O	off
O	her
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	a
O	contortion
O	shook
O	her
O	,
O	she
O	recovered
O	herself
O	,
O	and
O	rearing
O	upward
O	as
O	high
O	as
O	the
O	car
O	permitted
O	,
O	plunged
O	directly
O	at
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	expecting
O	the
O	movement
O	,
O	and
O	dodged
O	.
O	Then
O	followed
O	exhibitions
O	of
O	pain
O	which
O	I
O	pray
O	God
O	I
O	may
O	never
O	see
O	again
O	.
O	Time
O	and
O	again
O	did
O	she
O	dash
O	herself
O	upon
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	and
O	roll
O	over
O	and
O	over
O	,
O	lashing
O	out
O	with
O	her
O	feet
O	in
O	all
O	directions
O	.
O	Pausing
O	a
O	moment
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	stretch
O	her
O	body
O	to
O	its
O	extreme
O	length
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	lying
O	upon
O	her
O	side
O	,
O	pound
O	the
O	floor
O	with
O	her
O	head
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	a
O	maul
O	.
O	Then
O	like
O	a
O	flash
O	she
O	would
O	leap
O	to
O	her
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	whirl
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	until
O	from
O	very
O	giddiness
O	she
O	would
O	stagger
O	and
O	fall
O	.
O	She
O	would
O	lay
O	hold
O	of
O	the
O	straw
O	with
O	her
O	teeth
O	,
O	and
O	shake
O	it
O	as
O	a
O	dog
O	shakes
O	a
O	struggling
O	woodchuck;
O	then
O	dashing
O	it
O	from
O	her
O	mouth
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	seize
O	hold
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	sides
O	,
O	and
O	rend
O	herself
O	.
O	Springing
O	up
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	rush
O	against
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	car
O	,
O	falling
O	all
O	in
O	a
O	heap
O	from
O	the
O	violence
O	of
O	the
O	concussion
O	.
O	For
O	some
O	fifteen
O	minutes
O	without
O	intermission
O	the
O	frenzy
O	lasted
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	nearly
O	exhausted
O	.
O	My
O	efforts
O	to
O	avoid
O	her
O	mad
O	rushes
O	,
O	the
O	terrible
O	tension
O	of
O	my
O	nervous
O	system
O	produced
O	by
O	the
O	spectacle
O	of
O	such
O	exquisite
O	and
O	prolonged
O	suffering
O	,
O	were
O	weakening
O	me
O	beyond
O	what
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	thought
O	it
O	possible
O	an
O	hour
O	before
O	for
O	anything
O	to
O	weaken
O	me
O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	I
O	felt
O	my
O	strength
O	leaving
O	me
O	.
O	A
O	terror
O	such
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	never
O	yet
O	felt
O	was
O	taking
O	possession
O	of
O	my
O	mind
O	.
O	I
O	sickened
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	before
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	agonies
O	yet
O	to
O	come
O	.
O	'
O	My
O	God
O	I
O	exclaimed
O	,
O	'
O	must
O	I
O	be
O	killed
O	by
O	my

O	Even
O	as

O	spoke

O	.
O	The
O	mare
O	raised
O	herself
O	until
O	her
O	shoulders
O	touched
O	the
O	roof
O	,
O	then
O	dashed
O	her
O	body
O	upon
O	the
O	floor
O	with
O	a
O	violence
O	which
O	threatened
O	the
O	stout
O	frame
O	beneath
O	her
O	.
O	I
O	leaned
O	,
O	panting
O	and
O	exhausted
O	,
O	against
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	car
O	.
O	Gulnare
O	did
O	not
O	stir
O	.
O	She
O	lay
O	motionless
O	,
O	her
O	breath
O	coming
O	and
O	going
O	in
O	lessening
O	respirations
O	.
O	I
O	tottered
O	toward
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	I
O	stood
O	above
O	her
O	,
O	my
O	ear
O	detected
O	a
O	low
O	gurgling
O	sound
O	.
O	I
O	cannot
O	describe
O	the
O	feeling
O	that
O	followed
O	.
O	Joy
O	and
O	grief
O	contended
O	within
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	knew
O	the
O	meaning
O	of
O	that
O	sound
O	.
O	Gulnare
O	,
O	in
O	her
O	frenzied
O	violence
O	,
O	had
O	broken
O	a
O	blood-vessel
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	bleeding
O	internally
O	.
O	Pain
O	and
O	life
O	were
O	passing
O	away
O	together
O	.
O	I
O	knelt
O	down
O	by
O	her
O	side
O	.
O	I
O	laid
O	my
O	head
O	upon
O	her
O	shoulders
O	,
O	and
O	sobbed
O	aloud
O	.
O	Her
O	body
O	moved
O	a
O	little
O	beneath
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	crawled
O	forward
O	,
O	and
O	lifted
O	her
O	beautiful
O	head
O	into
O	my
O	lap
O	.
O	O
O	,
O	for
O	one
O	more
O	sign
O	of
O	recognition
O	before
O	she
O	died
O	!
O	I
O	smoothed
O	the
O	tangled
O	masses
O	of
O	her
O	mane
O	.
O	I
O	wiped
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	fragment
O	of
O	my
O	coat
O	,
O	torn
O	in
O	the
O	struggle
O	,
O	the
O	blood
O	which
O	oozed
O	from
O	her
O	nostril
O	.
O	I
O	called
O	her
O	by
O	name
O	.
O	My
O	desire
O	was
O	granted
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	moment
O	Gulnare
O	opened
O	her
O	eyes
O	.
O	The
O	redness
O	of
O	frenzy
O	had
O	passed
O	out
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	She
O	saw
O	and
O	recognized
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	spoke
O	again
O	.
O	Her
O	eye
O	lighted
O	a
O	moment
O	with
O	the
O	old
O	and
O	intelligent
O	look
O	of
O	love
O	.
O	Her
O	ear
O	moved
O	.
O	Her
O	nostril
O	quivered
O	slightly
O	as
O	she
O	strove
O	to
O	neigh
O	.
O	The
O	effort
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	Her
O	love
O	was
O	greater
O	than
O	her
O	strength
O	.
O	She
O	moved
O	her
O	head
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	nearer

O	looked
O	once

O	with

O	,
O	holding
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	my
O	dead
O	mare
O	in
O	my
O	lap

O	warm
O	tears

O	A-HUNTING

O	,
O	1877

O	The

O	at
O	the
O	sky
O	and
O	the

O	The

O	lifted
O	her
O	head
O	a
O	little
O	with
O	a
O	quick
O	motion
O	,
O	and
O	turned
O	her
O	ear
O	to
O	the
O	south
O	.
O	Had
O	she
O	heard
O	something
O	?
O	Probably
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	the
O	south
O	wind
O	in
O	the
O	balsams
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	silence
O	all
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	If
O	the
O	doe
O	had
O	heard
O	anything
O	it
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	distant
O	noises
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	There
O	are
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	occasional
O	moanings
O	,
O	premonitions
O	of
O	change
O	,
O	which
O	are
O	inaudible
O	to
O	the
O	dull
O	ears
O	of
O	men
O	,
O	but
O	which
O	,
O	I
O	have
O	no
O	doubt
O	,
O	the
O	forest-folk
O	hear
O	and
O	understand
O	.
O	If
O	the
O	doe
O	'
O	s

O	were
O	excited
O	for
O	an
O	instant
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	gone
O	as
O	soon
O	.
O	But
O	suddenly
O	she
O	started
O	,
O	head
O	erect
O	,
O	eyes
O	dilated
O	,
O	a
O	tremor
O	in
O	her
O	limbs
O	.
O	She
O	took
O	a
O	step;
O	she
O	turned
O	her
O	head
O	to
O	the
O	south;
O	she
O	listened
O	intently
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	sound--a
O	distant
O	,
O	prolonged
O	note
O	,
O	bell-toned
O	,
O	pervading
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	shaking
O	the
O	air
O	in
O	smooth
O	vibrations
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	repeated
O	.
O	The
O	doe
O	had
O	no
O	doubt
O	now
O	.
O	She
O	shook
O	like
O	the
O	sensitive
O	mimosa
O	when
O	a
O	footstep
O	approaches
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	baying
O	of
O	a
O	hound
O	!
O	It
O	was
O	far
O	off--at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	.
O	Time
O	enough
O	to

O	time
O	enough
O	to
O	put
O	miles
O	between
O	her
O	and
O	the
O	hound
O	,
O	before
O	he
O	should
O	come
O	upon
O	her
O	fresh
O	trail;
O	time
O	enough
O	to

O	away
O	through

O	dense
O	forest
O	and
O	hide
O	in
O	the
O	recesses
O	of
O	Panther
O	Gorge;
O	yes
O	,
O	time
O	enough
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	the
O	fawn
O	.
O	The
O	cry
O	of
O	the
O	hound
O	was
O	repeated
O	,
O	more

O	this
O	time
O	.
O	The
O	mother
O	instinctively
O	bounded
O	away
O	a
O	few
O	paces
O	.
O	The
O	fawn

O	up
O	with

O	She

O	She
O	walked
O	away

O	,
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	thing
O	skipped
O	after
O	her
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	slow
O	going
O	for

O	over
O	the

O	The

O	fawn
O	scrambled

O	Shortly
O	came
O	a
O	sound
O	that
O	threw
O	the
O	doe
O	into
O	a
O	panic
O	of
O	terror--a
O	short
O	,
O	sharp
O	yelp
O	,
O	followed
O	by
O	a
O	prolonged

O	up
O	and
O	re-echoed
O	by

O	along
O	the
O	mountain-side

O	The
O	doe
O	knew
O	what
O	that

O	.
O	One
O	hound
O	had
O	caught

O	and
O	the

O	The

O	not

O	,
O	now
O	emphasized
O	by
O	the

O	,
O	came

O	Flight
O	with

O	Perhaps

O	,
O	and
O	the

O	According

O	So
O	she
O	was:
O	all
O	human

O	are
O	selfish
O	.
O	She
O	kept
O	straight
O	on
O	,
O	hearing
O	the

O	every

O	more
O	distinctly
O	.
O	She
O	descended
O	the
O	slope

O	the

O	until
O	she
O	reached
O	the
O	more
O	open

O	the

O	a

O	In
O	five
O	minutes
O	more
O	she
O	heard
O	the
O	sharp
O	,
O	exultant
O	yelp
O	of
O	discovery
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	deep-mouthed
O	howl
O	of
O	pursuit
O	.
O	The
O	hounds
O	had
O	struck
O	her
O	trail
O	where
O	she
O	turned
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fawn
O	was
O	safe
O	.
O	The

O	was
O	in
O	good
O	running
O	condition
O	,
O	the
O	ground
O	was
O	not
O	bad
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	felt
O	the
O	exhilaration
O	of
O	the
O	chase
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	moment
O	,
O	fear
O	left
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	bounded
O	on
O	with
O	the
O	exaltation
O	of
O	triumph
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	she
O	went
O	on
O	at
O	a
O	slapping
O	pace
O	,
O	clearing
O	the
O	moose-bushes
O	with
O	bound
O	after
O	bound
O	,
O	flying
O	over
O	the
O	fallen
O	logs
O	,
O	pausing
O	neither
O	for
O	brook
O	nor
O	ravine
O	.
O	The
O	baying
O	of
O	the
O	hounds
O	grew
O	fainter
O	behind
O	her
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	struck
O	a
O	bad
O	piece
O	of
O	going
O	,
O	a
O	dead-wood
O	slash
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	marvellous
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	skim
O	over
O	it
O	,
O	leaping
O	among
O	its
O	intricacies
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	breaking
O	her
O	slender
O	legs
O	.
O	No
O	other
O	living
O	animal
O	could
O	do
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	killing
O	work
O	.
O	She
O	began
O	to
O	pant
O	fearfully;
O	she
O	lost
O	ground
O	.
O	The
O	baying
O	of
O	the
O	hounds
O	was
O	nearer
O	.
O	She
O	climbed
O	the
O	hard-wood
O	hill
O	at
O	a
O	slower
O	gait:
O	but
O	,
O	once
O	on
O	more
O	level
O	,
O	free
O	ground
O	,
O	her
O	breath
O	came
O	back
O	to

O	and
O	she
O	stretched
O	away
O	with
O	new
O	courage
O	,
O	and
O	maybe
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	contempt
O	for
O	her
O	heavy
O	pursuers
O	.
O	After
O	running
O	at
O	a
O	high
O	speed
O	perhaps
O	half
O	a
O	mile
O	further
O	it
O	occurred

O	,
O	by
O	a

O	,
O	seek
O	her
O	fawn
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	moment
O	,
O	she
O	heard
O	a
O	sound
O	that
O	chilled
O	her
O	heart
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	cry
O	of
O	a
O	hound
O	to
O	the
O	west
O	of
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	crafty

O	had
O	made
O	the
O	circuit
O	of
O	the
O	slash
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	off
O	her
O	retreat
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	to
O	keep
O	on;
O	and
O	on
O	she
O	went
O	,
O	still
O	to
O	the
O	north
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	the

O	behind
O	her
O	.
O	In
O	five
O	minutes
O	more
O	she
O	had
O	passed
O	into
O	a
O	hillside
O	clearing
O	.
O	Cows
O	and
O	young
O	steers
O	were
O	grazing
O	there
O	.
O	She
O	heard
O	a
O	tinkle
O	of
O	bells
O	.
O	Below
O	her
O	,
O	down
O	the
O	mountain-slope

O	That

O	Not

O	must
O	cross

O	consider

O	the

O	just

O	told
O	on

O	Her

O	The
O	fording
O	of

O	threw
O	the

O	off
O	for
O	a

O	This

O	of
O	.
O	This
O	Greedy
O	nation
O	,
O	though
O	carried
O	away
O	by
O	love
O	of
O	good
O	eating
O	,
O	was
O	strictly
O	honest
O	.
O	It
O	must
O	be
O	said
O	that
O	where
O	nations
O	are
O	patriotic
O	,
O	desire
O	for
O	the
O	common
O	good
O	makes
O	them
O	unselfish
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	'
O	s
O	tart
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	glory
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	one
O	was
O	proud
O	to
O	contribute
O	to
O	such
O	a
O	great
O	work
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	the
O	milkmaids
O	with
O	their
O	pots
O	and
O	pails
O	of
O	milk
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	buttermakers
O	with
O	their
O	baskets
O	filled
O	with
O	the
O	rich
O	yellow
O	pats
O	of
O	butter
O	,
O	filed
O	in
O	long
O	procession
O	to
O	the
O	right
O	and
O	left
O	of
O	the
O	cabin
O	of
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	need
O	for
O	her
O	to
O	examine
O	so
O	carefully
O	the
O	butter
O	and
O	the
O	milk
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	such
O	a
O	delicate
O	nose
O	that
O	if
O	there
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	single
O	pat
O	of
O	ancient
O	butter
O	or
O	a
O	pail
O	of
O	sour
O	milk
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	pounced
O	upon
O	it
O	instantly
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	was
O	perfectly
O	fresh
O	.
O	In
O	that
O	golden
O	age
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	understand
O	the
O	art
O	,
O	now
O	so
O	well
O	known
O	,
O	of
O	making
O	milk
O	out
O	of
O	flour
O	and
O	water
O	.
O	Real
O	milk
O	was
O	necessary
O	to
O	make
O	cheesecakes
O	and
O	ice
O	cream
O	and
O	other
O	delicious
O	confections
O	much
O	adored
O	in
O	the
O	Greedy
O	Kingdom
O	.
O	If
O	any
O	one
O	had
O	made
O	such
O	a
O	despicable
O	discovery
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	chased
O	from
O	the
O	country
O	as
O	a
O	public
O	nuisance
O	.
O	Then
O	came
O	the
O	grocers
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	aprons
O	of
O	coffee
O	bags
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	jolly
O	,
O	mischievous
O	faces
O	the
O	rogues
O	always
O	have
O	.
O	Each
O	one
O	clasped
O	to
O	his
O	heart
O	a
O	sugar
O	loaf
O	nearly
O	as
O	large
O	as
O	himself
O	,
O	whose
O	summit
O	,
O	without
O	its
O	paper
O	cap
O	,
O	looked
O	like
O	new-fallen
O	snow
O	upon
O	a
O	pyramid
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	crutch
O	for
O	a
O	baton
O	,
O	saw
O	them
O	all
O	placed
O	in
O	her
O	storerooms
O	upon
O	shelves
O	put
O	up
O	for
O	the
O	purpose
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	strict
O	,
O	for
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	fellows
O	could
O	hardly
O	part
O	from
O	their
O	merchandise
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	were
O	indiscreet
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	tongues
O	behind
O	their
O	great
O	mountains
O	of
O	sugar
O	.
O	If
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	let
O	alone
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	never
O	have
O	stopped
O	till
O	the
O	sugar
O	was
O	all
O	gone
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	implacable
O	eye
O	of
O	old
O	Fanfreluche
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	posted
O	upon
O	a
O	water
O	spout
O	,
O	took
O	note
O	of
O	all
O	their
O	misdeeds
O	.
O	From
O	another
O	quarter
O	came
O	a
O	whole
O	army
O	of
O	country
O	people
O	,
O	rolling
O	wheelbarrows
O	and
O	carrying
O	huge
O	baskets
O	,
O	all
O	filled
O	with
O	cherries
O	,
O	plums
O	,
O	peaches
O	,
O	apples
O	,
O	and
O	pears
O	.
O	All
O	these
O	fruits
O	were
O	so
O	fresh
O	,
O	in
O	such
O	perfect
O	condition
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	fair
O	shining
O	skins
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	looked
O	like
O	wax
O	or
O	painted
O	marble
O	,
O	but
O	their
O	delicious
O	perfume
O	proved
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	real
O	.
O	Some
O	little
O	people
O	,
O	hidden
O	in
O	the
O	corners
O	,
O	took
O	pains
O	to
O	find
O	this
O	out
O	.
O	Between
O	ourselves
O	,
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	made
O	believe
O	not
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	precaution
O	of
O	holding
O	Fanfreluche
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	spring
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	fruits
O	were
O	all
O	put
O	into
O	bins
O	,
O	each
O	kind
O	by
O	itself
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	the
O	preparations
O	were
O	finished
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	time
O	to
O	lose
O	before
O	setting
O	to
O	work
O	.
O	The
O	spot
O	which
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	had
O	chosen
O	for
O	her
O	great
O	edifice
O	was
O	a
O	pretty
O	hill
O	on
O	which
O	a
O	plateau
O	formed
O	a
O	splendid
O	site
O	.
O	This
O	hill
O	commanded
O	the
O	capital
O	city
O	,
O	built
O	upon
O	the
O	slope
O	of
O	another
O	hill
O	close
O	by
O	.
O	After
O	having
O	beaten
O	down
O	the
O	earth
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	smooth
O	as
O	a
O	floor
O	,
O	they
O	spread
O	over
O	it
O	loads
O	of
O	bread
O	crumbs
O	,
O	brought
O	from
O	the
O	baker
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	and
O	levelled
O	it
O	with
O	rake
O	and
O	spade
O	,
O	as
O	we
O	do
O	gravel
O	in
O	our
O	garden
O	walks
O	.
O	Little
O	birds
O	,
O	as
O	greedy
O	as
O	themselves
O	,
O	came
O	in
O	flocks
O	to
O	the
O	feast
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	might
O	eat
O	as
O	they
O	liked
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	never
O	be
O	missed
O	,
O	so
O	thick
O	was
O	the
O	carpet
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	chance
O	for
O	the
O	bold
O	little
O	things
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	ingredients
O	for
O	the
O	tart
O	were
O	now
O	ready
O	.
O	Upon
O	order
O	of
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	peel
O	the
O	apples
O	and
O	pears
O	and
O	to
O	take
O	out
O	the
O	pips
O	.
O	The
O	weather
O	was
O	so
O	pleasant
O	that
O	the
O	girls
O	sat
O	out
O	of
O	doors
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	in
O	long
O	rows
O	.
O	The
O	sun
O	looked
O	down
O	upon
O	them
O	with
O	a
O	merry
O	face
O	.
O	Each
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	workers
O	had
O	a
O	big
O	earthen
O	pan
O	,
O	and
O	peeled
O	incessantly
O	the
O	apples
O	which
O	the
O	boys
O	brought
O	them
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	pans
O	were
O	full
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	carried
O	away
O	and
O	others
O	were
O	brought
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	also
O	to
O	carry
O	away
O	the
O	peels
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	girls
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	buried
O	in
O	them
O	.
O	Never
O	was
O	there
O	such
O	a
O	peeling
O	before
O	.
O	Not
O	far
O	away
O	,
O	the
O	children
O	were
O	stoning
O	the
O	plums
O	,
O	cherries
O	,
O	and
O	peaches
O	.
O	This
O	work
O	,
O	being
O	the
O	easiest
O	,
O	was
O	given
O	to
O	the
O	youngest
O	and
O	most
O	inexperienced
O	hands
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	all
O	first
O	carefully
O	washed
O	,
O	for
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	though
O	not
O	very
O	particular
O	about
O	her
O	own
O	toilet
O	,
O	was
O	very
O	neat
O	in
O	her
O	cooking
O	.
O	The
O	schoolhouse
O	,
O	long
O	unused
O	(
O	for
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	of
O	the
O	Greedy
O	they
O	had
O	forgotten
O	everything
O	)
O	,
O	was
O	arranged
O	for
O	this
O	second
O	class
O	of
O	workers
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	cat
O	was
O	their
O	inspector
O	.
O	He
O	walked
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	,
O	growling
O	if
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	fruit
O	popping
O	into
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	mouths
O	.
O	If
O	they
O	had
O	dared
O	,
O	how
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	pelted
O	him
O	with
O	plum
O	stones
O	!
O	But
O	no
O	one
O	risked
O	it
O	.
O	Fanfreluche
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	trifled
O	with
O	.
O	In
O	those
O	days
O	powdered
O	sugar
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	invented
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	grate
O	it
O	all
O	was
O	no
O	small
O	affair
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	work
O	that
O	the
O	grocers
O	used
O	to
O	dislike
O	the
O	most;
O	both
O	lungs
O	and
O	arms
O	were
O	soon
O	tired
O	.
O	But
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	was
O	there
O	to
O	sustain
O	them
O	with
O	her
O	unequalled
O	energy
O	.
O	She
O	chose
O	the
O	labourers
O	from
O	the
O	most
O	robust
O	of
O	the
O	boys
O	.
O	With
O	mallet
O	and
O	knife
O	she
O	broke
O	the
O	cones
O	into
O	round
O	pieces
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	grated
O	them
O	till
O	they
O	were
O	too
O	small
O	to
O	hold
O	.
O	The
O	bits
O	were
O	put
O	into
O	baskets
O	to
O	be
O	pounded
O	.
O	One
O	would
O	never
O	have
O	expected
O	to
O	find
O	all
O	the
O	thousand
O	pounds
O	of
O	sugar
O	again
O	.
O	But
O	a
O	new
O	miracle
O	was
O	wrought
O	by
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	all
O	there
O	!
O	It
O	was
O	then
O	the
O	turn
O	of
O	the
O	ambitious
O	scullions
O	to
O	enter
O	the
O	lists
O	and
O	break
O	the
O	seven
O	thousand
O	eggs
O	for
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	hard
O	to
O	break
O	them--any
O	fool
O	could
O	do
O	that;
O	but
O	to
O	separate
O	adroitly
O	the
O	yolks
O	and
O	the
O	whites
O	demands
O	some
O	talent
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	above
O	all
O	,
O	great
O	care
O	.
O	We
O	dare
O	not
O	say
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	accidents
O	here
O	,
O	no
O	eggs
O	too
O	well
O	scrambled
O	,
O	no
O	baskets
O	upset
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	experience
O	of
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	had
O	counted
O	upon
O	such
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	may
O	truly
O	be
O	said
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	never
O	so
O	many
O	eggs
O	broken
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	or
O	ever
O	could
O	be
O	again
O	.
O	To
O	make
O	an
O	omelette
O	of
O	them
O	would
O	have
O	taken
O	a
O	saucepan
O	as
O	large
O	as
O	a
O	skating
O	pond
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fattest
O	cook
O	that
O	ever
O	lived
O	could
O	not
O	hold
O	the
O	handle
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	saucepan
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	was
O	not
O	all
O	.
O	Now
O	that
O	the
O	yolks
O	and
O	whites
O	were
O	once
O	divided
O	,
O	they
O	must
O	each
O	be
O	beaten
O	separately
O	in
O	wooden
O	bowls
O	,
O	to
O	give
O	them
O	the
O	necessary
O	lightness
O	.
O	The
O	egg
O	beaters
O	were
O	marshalled
O	into
O	two
O	brigades
O	,
O	the
O	yellow
O	and
O	the
O	white
O	.
O	Every
O	one
O	preferred
O	the
O	white
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	much
O	more
O	amusing
O	to
O	make
O	those
O	snowy
O	masses
O	that
O	rose
O	up
O	so
O	high
O	than
O	to
O	beat
O	the
O	yolks
O	,
O	which
O	knew
O	no
O	better
O	than
O	to
O	mix
O	together
O	like
O	so
O	much
O	sauce
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	usual
O	wisdom
O	,
O	had
O	avoided
O	this
O	difficulty
O	by
O	casting
O	lots
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	not
O	on
O	the
O	white
O	side
O	had
O	no
O	reason
O	to
O	complain
O	of
O	oppression
O	.
O	And
O	truly
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	was
O	done
O	,
O	the
O	whites
O	and
O	the
O	yellows
O	were
O	equally
O	tired
O	.
O	All
O	had
O	cramps
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	.
O	Now
O	began
O	the
O	real
O	labour
O	of
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	.
O	Till
O	now
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	commander-in-chief--the
O	head
O	only;
O	now
O	she
O	put
O	her
O	own
O	finger
O	in
O	the
O	pie
O	.
O	First
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	to
O	make
O	sweetmeats
O	and
O	jam
O	out
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	immense
O	quantity
O	of
O	fruit
O	she
O	had
O	stored
O	.
O	For
O	this
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	could
O	only
O	do
O	one
O	kind
O	at
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	ten
O	kettles
O	,
O	each
O	as
O	big
O	as
O	a
O	dinner
O	table
O	.
O	During
O	forty-eight
O	hours
O	the
O	cooking
O	went
O	on;
O	a
O	dozen
O	scullions
O	blew
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	put
O	on
O	the
O	fuel
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	spoon
O	that
O	four
O	modern
O	cooks
O	could
O	hardly
O	lift
O	,
O	never
O	ceased
O	stirring
O	and
O	trying
O	the
O	boiling
O	fruit
O	.
O	Three
O	expert
O	tasters
O	,
O	chosen
O	from
O	the
O	most
O	dainty
O	,
O	had
O	orders
O	to
O	report
O	progress
O	every
O	half
O	hour
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	unnecessary
O	to
O	state
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	sweetmeats
O	were
O	perfectly
O	successful
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	of
O	exquisite
O	consistency
O	,
O	colour
O	,
O	and
O	perfume
O	.
O	With
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	such
O	word
O	as
O	_fail_
O	.
O	When
O	each
O	kind
O	of
O	sweetmeat
O	was
O	finished
O	,
O	she
O	skimmed
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	away
O	to
O	cool
O	in
O	enormous
O	bowls
O	before
O	potting
O	.
O	She
O	did
O	not
O	use
O	for
O	this
O	the
O	usual
O	little
O	glass
O	or
O	earthen
O	jars
O	,
O	but
O	great
O	stone
O	ones
O	,
O	like

O	the
O	""""
O	Forty

O	Not
O	only
O	did
O	these
O	take

O	to
O	fill
O	,

O	they
O	were
O	safe
O	from
O	the

O	The

O	and
O	the

O	were
O	something
O	,
O	to
O	be

O	But
O	there
O	was
O	little

O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	who

O	two

O	The

O	cries

O	that

O	the

O	that
O	the

O	of
O	tarts
O	and

O	had
O	rules
O	of
O	its
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	therefore
O	the
O	experience
O	of
O	Mother

O	was
O	worth
O	all
O	the
O	scientific
O	theories
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	The
O	inside
O	of
O	the
O	monument
O	was
O	divided
O	into
O	as
O	many
O	compartments
O	as
O	there
O	were
O	kinds
O	of
O	fruits
O	.
O	The
O	walls
O	were
O	no
O	less

O	four
O	feet
O	thick
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	were
O	finished
O	,
O	twenty-four
O	ladders
O	were
O	set
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	twenty-four
O	experienced
O	cooks
O	ascended
O	them
O	.
O	These
O	first-class
O	artists
O	were
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	armed
O	with
O	an
O	enormous
O	cooking
O	spoon
O	.
O	Behind
O	them
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	lower
O	rounds
O	of
O	the
O	ladders
O	,
O	followed
O	the
O	kitchen
O	boys
O	,
O	carrying
O	on
O	their
O	heads
O	pots
O	and
O	pans
O	filled
O	to
O	the
O	brim
O	with
O	jam

O	,
O	each
O	sort
O	ready

O	be
O	poured
O	into
O	its
O	destined
O	compartment
O	.
O	This
O	colossal
O	labour
O	was
O	accomplished
O	in
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	wonderful
O	exactness
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	sweetmeats
O	were
O	used
O	to
O	the
O	last
O	drop
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	great
O	spoons
O	had
O	done
O	all
O	their
O	work
O	,
O	the
O	twenty-four
O	cooks
O	descended
O	to
O	earth
O	again
O	.
O	The
O	intrepid
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	never
O	quitted
O	the
O	spot
O	,
O	now
O	ascended
O	,
O	followed
O	by
O	the
O	noble
O	Fanfreluche
O	,
O	and
O	dipped
O	her
O	finger
O	into
O	each
O	of
O	the
O	compartments
O	,
O	to
O	assure
O	herself
O	that
O	everything
O	was
O	right
O	.
O	This
O	part
O	of
O	her
O	duty
O	was
O	not
O	disagreeable
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	scullions
O	would
O	have
O	liked
O	to
O	perform
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	might
O	have
O	lingered
O	too
O	long
O	over
O	the
O	enchanting
O	task
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	too
O	well
O	used
O	to
O	sweets
O	to
O	be
O	excited
O	now
O	.
O	She
O	only
O	wished
O	to
O	do
O	her
O	duty
O	and
O	to
O	insure
O	success
O	.
O	All
O	went
O	on
O	well
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	approbation
O	.
O	Nothing
O	was
O	needed
O	now
O	but
O	to
O	crown
O	the
O	sublime
O	and
O	delicious
O	edifice
O	by
O	placing
O	upon
O	it
O	the
O	crust--that
O	is
O	,
O	the
O	roof
O	,
O	or
O	dome
O	.
O	This
O	delicate
O	operation
O	was
O	confided
O	to
O	the
O	engineer-in-chief
O	who
O	now
O	showed
O	his
O	superior
O	genius
O	.
O	The
O	dome
O	,
O	made
O	beforehand
O	of
O	a
O	single
O	piece
O	,
O	was
O	raised
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	twelve
O	balloons
O	,
O	whose
O	force
O	of
O	ascension
O	had
O	been
O	carefully
O	calculated
O	.
O	First
O	it
O	was
O	directed
O	,
O	by
O	ropes
O	,
O	exactly
O	over
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	tart;
O	then
O	at
O	the
O	word
O	of
O	command
O	it
O	gently
O	descended
O	upon
O	the
O	right
O	spot
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	inch
O	out
O	of
O	place
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	triumph
O	for
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	and
O	her
O	able
O	assistant
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	was
O	not
O	over
O	.
O	How
O	should
O	this
O	colossal
O	tart
O	be
O	cooked
O	?
O	That
O	was
O	the
O	question
O	that
O	agitated
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	Greedy
O	country
O	,
O	who
O	came
O	in
O	crowds--lords
O	and
O	commons--to
O	gaze
O	at
O	the
O	wonderful
O	spectacle
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	envious
O	or
O	ill-tempered
O	declared
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	impossible
O	to
O	cook
O	the
O	edifice
O	which
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	had
O	built;
O	and
O	the
O	doctors
O	were
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	knows
O	why
O	,
O	the
O	saddest
O	of
O	all
O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	,
O	smiling
O	at
O	the
O	general
O	bewilderment
O	,
O	mounted
O	the
O	summit
O	of
O	the
O	tart;
O	she
O	waved
O	her
O	crutch
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	while
O	her
O	cat
O	miaowed
O	in
O	his
O	sweetest
O	voice
O	,
O	suddenly
O	there
O	issued
O	from
O	the
O	woods
O	a
O	vast
O	number
O	of
O	masons
O	,
O	drawing
O	wagons
O	of
O	well-baked
O	bricks
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	prepared
O	in
O	secret
O	.
O	This
O	sight
O	silenced
O	the
O	ill-wishers
O	and
O	filled
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	the
O	Greedy
O	with
O	hope
O	.
O	In
O	two
O	days
O	an
O	enormous
O	furnace
O	was
O	built
O	around
O	and
O	above
O	the
O	colossal
O	tart
O	,
O	which
O	found
O	itself
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	an
O	immense
O	earthen
O	pot
O	.
O	Thirty
O	huge
O	mouths
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	connected
O	with
O	thousands
O	of
O	winding
O	pipes
O	for
O	conducting
O	heat
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	building
O	,
O	were
O	soon
O	choked
O	with
O	fuel
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	two
O	hundred
O	charcoal
O	burners
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	obeying
O	a
O	private
O	signal
O	,
O	came
O	forth
O	in
O	long
O	array
O	from
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	each
O	carrying
O	his
O	sack
O	of
O	coal
O	.
O	Behind
O	them
O	stood
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	with
O	a
O	box
O	of
O	matches
O	,
O	ready
O	to
O	fire
O	each
O	oven
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	filled
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	the
O	kindlings
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	forgotten
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	all
O	soon
O	in
O	a
O	blaze
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	fire
O	was
O	lighted
O	in
O	the
O	thirty
O	ovens
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	clouds
O	of
O	smoke
O	rolling
O	above
O	the
O	dome
O	,
O	that
O	announced
O	that
O	the
O	cooking
O	had
O	begun
O	,
O	the
O	joy
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	was
O	boundless
O	.
O	Poets
O	improvised
O	odes
O	,
O	and
O	musicians
O	sung
O	verses
O	without
O	end
O	,
O	in
O	honour
O	of
O	the
O	superb
O	prince
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	inspired
O	to
O	feed
O	his
O	people
O	in
O	so
O	dainty
O	a
O	manner
O	,
O	when
O	other
O	rulers
O	could
O	not
O	give
O	them
O	enough
O	even
O	of
O	dry
O	bread
O	.
O	The
O	names
O	of
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	illustrious
O	engineer
O	were
O	not
O	forgotten
O	in
O	this
O	great
O	glorification
O	.
O	Next
O	to
O	His
O	Majesty
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	certainly
O	the
O	first
O	of
O	mankind
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	names
O	were
O	worthy
O	of
O	going
O	down
O	with
O	his
O	to
O	the
O	remotest
O	posterity
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	envious
O	ones
O	were
O	thunderstruck
O	.
O	They
O	tried
O	to
O	console
O	themselves
O	by
O	saying
O	that
O	the
O	work
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	finished
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	an
O	accident
O	might
O	happen
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	moment
O	.

O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	discovered
O	that

O	to

O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	country
O	was
O	perfumed
O	with
O	its

O	.
O	Nothing
O	more
O	remained
O	but
O	to
O	take
O	down
O	the

O	.
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	made
O	her
O	official
O	announcement
O	to
O	His
O	Majesty
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	delighted
O	,
O	and
O	complimented
O	her
O	upon
O	her
O	punctuality
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	was
O	still
O	wanting
O	to
O	complete
O	the
O	month
O	.
O	During
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	people
O	gave
O	their
O	eager
O	help
O	to
O	the
O	engineer
O	in
O	the
O	demolition
O	,
O	wishing
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	hand
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	national
O	work
O	and
O	to
O	hasten
O	the
O	blessed
O	moment
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	twinkling
O	of
O	an
O	eye
O	the
O	thing
O	was
O	done
O	.
O	The
O	bricks
O	were
O	taken
O	down
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	,
O	counted
O	carefully
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	again
O	,
O	to
O	serve
O	for
O	another
O	occasion
O	.
O	The
O	TART
O	,
O	unveiled
O	,
O	appeared
O	at
O	last
O	in
O	all
O	its
O	majesty
O	and
O	splendour
O	.
O	The
O	dome
O	was
O	gilded
O	,
O	and
O	reflected
O	the
O	rays
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	in
O	the
O	most

O	.
O	The

O	and
O	rapture
O	ran
O	through
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	Greedy
O	.
O	Each
O	one
O	sniffed
O	with
O	open
O	nostrils
O	the
O	appetizing
O	perfume
O	.
O	Their
O	mouths
O	watered
O	,
O	their
O	eyes
O	filled
O	with
O	tears
O	,
O	they
O	embraced
O	,
O	pressed
O	each
O	other
O	'
O	s
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	indulged
O	in
O	touching
O	pantomimes
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	town
O	and
O	country
O	,
O	united
O	by
O	one
O	rapturous
O	feeling
O	,
O	joined
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	danced
O	in
O	a
O	ring
O	around
O	the
O	grand
O	confection
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	dared
O	to
O	touch
O	the
O	tart
O	before
O	the
O	arrival
O	of
O	His
O	Majesty
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	something
O	must
O	be
O	done
O	to
O	allay
O	the
O	universal
O	impatience
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	resolved
O	to
O	show
O	Mother
O	Mitchel
O	the
O	gratitude
O	with
O	which
O	all
O	hearts
O	were
O	filled
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	crowned
O	with
O	the
O	laurel
O	of
O	_conquerors_
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	also
O	the
O	laurel
O	of
O	_sauce_
O	,
O	thus
O	serving
O	a
O	double
O	purpose
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	placed
O	her
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	crutch
O	and
O	her
O	cat
O	,
O	upon
O	a

O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	her
O	all
O	round
O	her
O	vast

O	.
O	Before
O	her
O	marched
O	all
O	the

O	of
O	the

O	,

O	while
O	behind

O	,
O	who
O	rent
O	the

O	plaudits
O	and
O	filled
O	it
O	with
O	a

O	Her

O	complete
O	,
O	and
O	a

O	pride
O	shone
O	on
