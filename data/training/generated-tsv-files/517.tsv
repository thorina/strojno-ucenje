O	and
O	often
O	and
O	often
O	his

O	was
O	heavy
O	and
O	sad
O	as
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	her
O	pining
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	lonely
O	moor
O	It
O	chanced
O	that

O	one
O	day
O	and

O	did
O	not

O	him
O	away
O	but
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	leaving
O	he
O	caught
O	a
O	glimpse
O	of
O	Finola
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	hut
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	crying
O	This
O	sight
O	made
O	him
O	so
O	very
O	miserable
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	think
O	of
O	nothing
O	else
O	but
O	her
O	sad
O	face
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	always
O	seen
O	so
O	bright
O	and
O	he
O	allowed
O	the

O	horse
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	without
O	minding
O	where
O	he
O	was

O	I
O	was

O	even
O	if
O	I
O	could

O	I
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	him
O	what
O	he
O	wanted
O	to
O	know
O	for
O	I
O	remembered
O	nothing
O	of

O	before
O	that
O	day
O	Then
O	the

O	asked
O	the

O	but
O	they
O	knew
O	nothing
O	about
O	me
O	and

O	and
O	then
O	the
O	king
O	said
O	he
O	would
O	take
O	me
O	into
O	his

O	in
O	love
O	with
O	the
O	little
O	princess
O	said
O	the

O	winking
O	at

O	dwarf
O	blushed
O	twice
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	he
O	had

O	said
O	the

O	And
O	now
O	tell
O	me
O	truly
O	do
O	you
O	love
O	the
O	princess
O	and
O	what
O	would
O	you
O	give
O	to
O	free
O	her
O	from
O	the
O	spell
O	of
O	enchantment
O	that
O	is
O	over
O	her
O	I
O	would
O	give
O	my
O	life
O	said
O	the
O	dwarf
O	Well
O	then
O	listen
O	to
O	me
O	said
O	the
O	fairy
O	The
O	Princess
O	Finola
O	was
O	banished
O	to
O	the
O	lonely
O	moor
O	by
O	the
O	king
O	your
O	master
O	He
O	killed
O	her
O	father
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	rightful
O	king
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	killed
O	Finola
O	only
O	he
O	was
O	told
O	by
O	an
O	old
O	sorceress
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	killed
O	her
O	he
O	would
O	die
O	himself
O	on
O	the
O	same
O	day
O	and
O	she
O	advised
O	him
O	to
O	banish
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	lonely
O	moor
O	and
O	she
O	said
O	she
O	would
O	fling
O	a
O	spell
O	of
O	enchantment
O	over
O	it
O	and
O	that
O	until
O	the
O	spell
O	was
O	broken
O	Finola
O	could
O	not
O	leave
O	the
O	moor
O	And
O	the
O	sorceress
O	also
O	promised
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	send
O	an
O	old
O	woman
O	to
O	watch
O	over
O	the
O	princess
O	by
O	night
O	and
O	by
O	day
O	so
O	that
O	no
O	harm
O	should
O	come
O	to
O	her
O	but
O	she
O	told
O	the
O	king
O	that
O	he
O	himself
O	should
O	select
O	a
O	messenger
O	to
O	take
O	food
O	to
O	the
O	hut
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	look
O	out
O	for
O	someone
O	who
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	or
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	princess
O	and
O	whom
O	he
O	could
O	trust
O	never
O	to
O	tell
O	anyone
O	anything
O	about
O	her
O	and
O	that
O	is
O	the
O	reason
O	he
O	selected
O	you
O	Since
O	you
O	know
O	so
O	much
O	said

O	you
O	back
O	your

O	back
O	your

O	toiling
O	up
O	by
O	steep
O	crags
O	and
O	heathery
O	passes
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	top
O	as
O	the

O	was
O	setting
O	in
O	the

O	out
O	in

O	but
O	long
O	before

O	reached
O	it
O	the

O	sank
O	beneath

O	so
O	tired
O	that

O	rolled
O	off
O	his
O	back
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	by

O	side
O	He
O	awoke
O	at
O	the
O	breaking
O	of
O	the
O	morning
O	and
O	saw
O	that

O	was
O	almost
O	at
O	the
O	water
O	s
O	edge
O	He
O	looked
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	and

O	nowhere
O	could
O	he
O	see
O	the

O	steeds
O	and
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	fear
O	he
O	must
O	have
O	taken
O	a
O	wrong
O	course
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	and
O	that

O	in
O	search
O	of
O	But
O	even
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	thinking
O	he
O	heard
O	fierce
O	and
O	angry
O	snortings
O	and
O	coming
O	swiftly
O	from
O	the
O	island
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	swimming
O	and
O	prancing
O	steeds
O	Sometimes
O	their
O	heads
O	and
O	manes
O	only
O	were
O	visible
O	and
O	sometimes
O	rearing
O	they
O	rose
O	half
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	and
O	striking
O	it
O	with
O	their
O	hoofs
O	churned
O	it
O	into
O	foam
O	and
O	tossed
O	the
O	white
O	spray
O	to
O	the
O	skies
O	As
O	they
O	approached
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	their
O	snortings
O	became
O	more
O	terrible
O	and
O	their
O	nostrils
O	shot
O	forth
O	clouds
O	of
O	vapor
O	The
O	dwarf
O	trembled
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	and
O	sound
O	and
O	his
O	old
O	horse
O	quivering
O	in
O	every
O	limb
O	moaned
O	piteously
O	as
O	if
O	in
O	pain
O	On
O	came
O	the
O	steeds
O	until
O	they
O	almost
O	touched
O	the
O	shore
O	then
O	rearing

O	seemed
O	about
O	to
O	spring
O	on

O	dwarf
O	turned
O	his
O	head
O	to
O	fly
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	so
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	twang
O	of
O	a
O	golden
O	harp
O	and
O	right
O	before
O	him
O	who

O	of
O	the
O	hills
O	holding
O	a

O	asked
O	the

O	the

O	water
O	steeds
O	snorted
O	more

O	of
O	spray
O	tossed
O	on

O	sent
O	a
O	cold
O	shiver
O	to

O	and
O	turned
O	to
O	depart
O	When
O	the

O	going
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	the

O	princess
O	in
O	the
O	lonely
O	moor
O	and
O	his
O	courage
O	came
O	back
O	and
O	he
O	answered
O	bravely
O	Yes
O	I

O	pounding
O	hoofs
O	Back
O	to
O	your
O	waves
O	cried
O	the
O	little
O	harper
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	ran
O	his
O	fingers
O	across
O	his
O	lyre
O	the
O	frightened
O	steeds
O	drew
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	waters
O	What
O	is
O	the
O	price
O	asked
O	the
O	dwarf
O	Your
O	right
O	eye
O	said
O	the
O	fairy
O	and
O	before
O	the
O	dwarf
O	could
O	say
O	a
O	word
O	the
O	fairy
O	scooped
O	out
O	the
O	eye
O	with
O	his
O	finger
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	into
O	his
O	pocket
O	The
O	dwarf
O	suffered
O	most
O	terrible
O	agony
O	but
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	bear
O	it
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	princess
O	Then
O	the
O	fairy
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	a
O	rock
O	at
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	after
O	striking
O	a
O	few
O	notes
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	play
O	the
O	Strains
O	of
O	Slumber
O	The
O	sound
O	crept
O	along
O	the
O	waters
O	and
O	the
O	steeds
O	so
O	ferocious
O	a
O	moment
O	before
O	became
O	perfectly
O	still
O	They
O	had
O	no
O	longer
O	any
O	motion
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	and
O	they
O	floated
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	tide
O	like
O	foam
O	before
O	a
O	breeze
O	Now
O	said
O	the
O	fairy
O	as
O	he
O	led
O	the
O	dwarf
O	s
O	horse
O	to
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	tide
O	The
O	dwarf
O	urged
O	the
O	horse
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	and
O	once
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	depth
O	the
O	old
O	horse
O	struck
O	out
O	boldly
O	for
O	the
O	island
O	The
O	sleeping
O	water
O	steeds
O	drifted
O	helplessly
O	against
O	him
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	island
O	safely
O	and
O	he
O	neighed
O	joyously
O	as
O	his
O	hoofs
O	touched
O	solid
O	ground
O	The
O	dwarf
O	rode
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	until
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	bridle
O	path
O	and
O	following
O	this
O	it
O	led
O	him
O	up
O	through
O	winding
O	lanes
O	bordered
O	with
O	golden
O	furze
O	that
O	filled
O	the
O	air
O	with
O	fragrance
O	and
O	brought
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	summit
O	of
O	the
O	green
O	hills
O	that
O	girdled
O	and
O	looked
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	Mystic
O	Lake
O	Here
O	the
O	horse
O	stopped
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	accord
O	and
O	the
O	dwarf
O	s
O	heart
O	beat
O	quickly
O	as
O	his
O	eye
O	rested
O	on
O	the
O	lake
O	that
O	clipped
O	round
O	by
O	the
O	ring
O	of
O	hills
O	seemed
O	in
O	the
O	breezeless
O	and
O	sunlit
O	air
O	As
O	still
O	as
O	death
O	And
O	as
O	bright
O	as
O	life
O	can
O	be
O	After
O	gazing
O	at
O	it
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	he
O	dismounted
O	and
O	lay
O	at
O	his
O	ease
O	in
O	the
O	pleasant
O	grass
O	Hour
O	after
O	hour
O	passed
O	but
O	no
O	change
O	came
O	over
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	waters
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	night
O	fell
O	sleep
O	closed
O	the
O	eyelids
O	of
O	the
O	dwarf
O	The
O	song
O	of
O	the
O	lark
O	awoke
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	early
O	morning
O	and
O	starting
O	up
O	he
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	lake
O	but
O	its
O	waters
O	were
O	as
O	bright
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	day
O	before
O	Towards
O	midday
O	he
O	beheld
O	what
O	he
O	thought
O	was
O	a
O	black
O	cloud
O	sailing
O	across
O	the
O	sky
O	from
O	east
O	to
O	west
O	It
O	seemed
O	to
O	grow
O	larger
O	as
O	it
O	came
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	and
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	high
O	above
O	the
O	lake
O	he
O	saw
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	huge
O	bird
O	the
O	shadow
O	of
O	whose
O	outstretched
O	wings
O	darkened
O	the
O	waters
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	and
O	the
O	dwarf
O	knew
O	it
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	Cormorants
O	of
O	the
O	Western
O	Seas
O	As
O	it
O	descended
O	slowly
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	held
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	its
O	claws
O	a
O	branch
O	of
O	a
O	tree
O	larger
O	than
O	a
O	full
O	grown
O	oak
O	and
O	laden
O	with
O	clusters
O	of
O	ripe
O	red
O	berries
O	It
O	alighted
O	at
O	some
O	distance
O	from
O	the
O	dwarf
O	and
O	after
O	resting
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	it
O	began
O	to
O	eat
O	the
O	berries
O	and
O	to
O	throw
O	the
O	stones
O	into
O	the
O	lake
O	and
O	wherever
O	a
O	stone
O	fell
O	a
O	bright
O	red
O	stain
O	appeared
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	As
O	he
O	looked
O	more
O	closely
O	at
O	the
O	bird
O	the
O	dwarf
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	all
O	the
O	signs
O	of
O	old
O	age
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	wondering
O	how
O	it
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	carry
O	such
O	a
O	heavy
O	tree
O	Later
O	in
O	the
O	day
O	two
O	other
O	birds
O	as
O	large
O	as
O	the
O	first
O	but
O	younger
O	came
O	up
O	from
O	the
O	west
O	and
O	settled
O	down
O	beside
O	him
O	They
O	also
O	ate
O	the
O	berries
O	and
O	throwing
O	the
O	stones
O	into
O	the
O	lake
O	it
O	was
O	soon
O	as
O	red
O	as
O	wine
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	eaten
O	all
O	the
O	berries
O	the
O	young
O	birds
O	began
O	to
O	pick
O	the
O	decayed
O	feathers
O	off
O	the
O	old
O	bird
O	and
O	to
O	smooth
O	his
O	plumage
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	completed
O	their
O	task
O	he
O	rose
O	slowly
O	from
O	the
O	hill
O	and
O	sailed
O	out
O	over
O	the
O	lake
O	and
O	dropping
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	waters
O	dived
O	beneath
O	them
O	In
O	a
O	moment
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	surface
O	and
O	shot
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	with
O	a
O	joyous
O	cry
O	and
O	flew
O	off
O	to
O	the
O	west
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	vigor
O	of
O	renewed
O	youth
O	followed
O	by
O	the
O	other
O	birds
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	gone
O	so
O	far
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	like
O	specks
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	the
O	dwarf
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	descended
O	towards
O	the
O	lake
O	He
O	was
O	almost
O	at
O	the
O	margin
O	and
O	in
O	another
O	minute
O	would
O	have
O	plunged
O	in
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	fierce
O	screaming
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	and
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	time
O	to
O	look
O	up
O	the
O	three
O	birds
O	were
O	hovering
O	over
O	the
O	lake
O	The
O	dwarf
O	drew
O	back
O	frightened
O	The
O	birds
O	wheeled
O	over
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	then
O	swooping
O	down
O	they
O	flew
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	water
O	covering
O	it
O	with
O	their
O	wings
O	and
O	uttering
O	harsh
O	cries
O	Then
O	rising
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	height
O	they
O	folded
O	their
O	wings
O	and
O	dropped
O	headlong
O	like
O	three
O	rocks
O	on
O	the
O	lake
O	crashing
O	its
O	surface
O	and
O	scattering
O	a
O	wine
O	red
O	shower
O	upon
O	the
O	hills
O	12
O	Then
O	the
O	dwarf
O	remembered
O	what
O	the
O	fairy
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	attempted
O	to
O	swim
O	the
O	lake
O	without
O	paying
O	the
O	price
O	the
O	three
O	Cormorants
O	of
O	the
O	Western
O	Seas
O	would
O	pick
O	the
O	flesh
O	off
O	his
O	bones
O	He
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	and
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	turn
O	away
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	once
O	more
O	the
O	twang
O	of
O	the
O	golden
O	harp
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	fairy
O	of
O	the
O	hills
O	stood
O	before
O	him
O	Faint
O	heart
O	never
O	won
O	fair
O	lady
O	said
O	the
O	little
O	harper
O	Are
O	you
O	ready
O	to
O	pay
O	the
O	price
O	The
O	spear
O	and

O	are
O	on
O	the

O	and
O	the
O	Princess
O	Finola
O	is
O	crying
O	this
O	moment
O	in
O	the
O	lonely
O	moor
O	At
O	the
O	mention
O	of
O	Finola
O	s
O	name
O	the
O	dwarf
O	s
O	heart
O	grew
O	strong
O	Yes
O	he
O	said
O	I
O	am
O	ready
O	win
O	or
O	die
O	What
O	is
O	the
O	price
O	Your
O	left
O	eye
O	said
O	the
O	fairy
O	And
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	said
O	he
O	scooped
O	out
O	the
O	eye
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	in
O	his
O	pocket
O	The
O	poor
O	blind
O	dwarf
O	almost
O	fainted
O	with
O	pain
O	It
O	s
O	your
O	last
O	trial
O	said
O	the
O	fairy
O	and
O	now
O	do
O	what
O	I
O	tell
O	you
O	Twist
O	your
O	horse
O	s
O	mane
O	round
O	your
O	right
O	hand
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	lead
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	water
O	Plunge
O	in
O	and
O	fear
O	not
O	I
O	gave
O	you
O	back
O	your
O	speech
O	When
O	you
O	reach
O	the
O	opposite
O	bank
O	you
O	will

O	memory
O	and
O	you
O	will
O	know
O	who
O	and
O	what
O	you
O	are
O	Then
O	the
O	fairy
O	led
O	the
O	horse
O	to
O	the
O	margin
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	In
O	with
O	you
O	now
O	and
O	good
O	luck
O	go

O	said
O	the

O	The

O	urged
O	the

O	He
O	plunged
O	into
O	the

O	and
O	went
O	down
O	and
O	down
O	until
O	his
O	feet
O	struck
O	the
O	bottom
O	Then
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	ascend
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	came
O	near
O	the
O	surface
O	of
O	the

O	the
O	dwarf
O	thought
O	he

O	glimmering
O	light
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	rose
O	above

O	the
O	green
O	hills
O	before
O	him
O	and
O	he
O	shouted
O	with
O	joy
O	at
O	finding
O	his
O	sight
O	restored
O	But
O	he
O	saw
O	more
O	Instead
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	horse
O	he
O	had
O	ridden
O	into
O	the

O	he
O	was

O	a

O	as
O	the
O	steed
O	swam
O	to
O	the
O	bank
O	the
O	dwarf
O	felt
O	a
O	change
O	coming
O	over
O	himself
O	and
O	an
O	unknown
O	vigor
O	in
O	his
O	limbs
O	When
O	the
O	steed
O	touched
O	the
O	shore
O	he
O	galloped
O	up
O	the
O	hillside
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	hill
O	was
O	a
O	silver
O	shield
O	bright
O	as
O	the
O	sun
O	resting
O	against
O	a
O	spear
O	standing
O	upright
O	in
O	the

O	The
O	dwarf
O	jumped
O	off
O	and
O	running
O	towards
O	the
O	shield
O	he
O	saw
O	himself
O	as
O	in
O	a
O	looking
O	glass
O	He
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	a

O	a
O	gallant
O	knight
O	At
O	that

O	came
O	back
O	to

O	was
O	Conal
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	Knights
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Branch
O	and
O	he
O	remembered
O	now
O	that
O	the
O	spell
O	of
O	dumbness
O	and
O	deformity
O	had
O	been
O	cast
O	upon

O	Slinging

O	he
O	plucked
O	the

O	Wherever
