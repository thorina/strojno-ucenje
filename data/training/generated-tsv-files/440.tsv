O	SURPRISE
O	AFTER
O	wandering
O	about
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	Edward
O	came
O	unexpectedly
O	upon
O	a
O	hamlet
O	.
O	Lights
O	gleamed
O	down
O	the
O	street
O	,
O	and
O	Edward
O	could
O	hear
O	loud
O	voices
O	and
O	the
O	tramp
O	of
O	horses
O	.
O	The
O	sound
O	of
O	shouted
O	orders
O	and
O	soldiers
O	'
O	oaths
O	soon
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	great
O	danger
O	.
O	For
O	these
O	were
O	English
O	troops
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	they
O	caught
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	Mac-Ivor
O	tartan
O	,
O	would
O	assuredly
O	give
O	him
O	short
O	shrift
O	and
O	a
O	swift
O	bullet
O	.
O	Lingering
O	a
O	moment
O	uncertainly
O	near
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	a
O	small
O	garden
O	enclosure
O	,
O	he
O	felt
O	himself
O	caught
O	by
O	gentle
O	hands

O	drawn
O	toward

O	Judging
O	this
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	much
O	to
O	the
O	purpose
O	,
O	Edward
O	followed
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	girl
O	saw
O	the
O	tall
O	figure
O	in
O	tartans
O	instead
O	of
O	the
O	sweetheart
O	she
O	had
O	expected
O	,
O	she
O	dropped
O	the
O	candle
O	she
O	had
O	lighted
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	out
O	for
O	her
O	father
O	.
O	A
O	stout
O	Westmoreland
O	peasant
O	at
O	once
O	appeared
O	,
O	poker
O	in
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	Edward
O	found
O	himself
O	not
O	ill
O	received--by
O	the
O	daughter
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	a
O	likeness
O	to
O	her
O	lover
O	(
O	so
O	she
O	said
O	)
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	father
O	because
O	of
O	a
O	certain
O	weakness
O	for
O	the
O	losing
O	side
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	Farmer
O	Jopson
O	,
O	Edward
O	slept
O	soundly
O	that
O	night
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	dangers
O	which
O	surrounded
O	him
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	the
O	true
O	Edward
O	,
O	whose
O	name
O	turned
O	out
O	to
O	be
O	Ned
O	Williams
O	,
O	was
O	called
O	in
O	to
O	consult
O	with
O	father
O	and
O	daughter
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	impossible
O	for
O	Edward
O	to
O	go
O	north
O	to
O	rejoin
O	the
O	Prince
O	'
O	s
O	forces
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	evacuated
O	Penrith
O	and
O	marched
O	away
O	toward
O	Carlisle
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	intervening
O	country
O	was
O	covered
O	by
O	scouting
O	parties
O	of
O	government
O	horsemen
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	Ned
O	Williams
O	,
O	who
O	wished
O	above
O	all
O	things
O	to
O	rid
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	his
O	handsome
O	namesake
O	,
O	lest
O	his
O	sweetheart
O	Cicely
O	should
O	make
O	other
O	mistakes
O	,
O	offered
O	to
O	get
O	Waverley
O	a
O	change

O	clothes
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	conduct
O	him
O	to
O	his

O	near
O	Ulswater
O	.
O	Neither
O	old
O	Jopson
O	nor
O	his
O	daughter
O	would
O	accept
O	a
O	farthing
O	of
O	money
O	for
O	saving
O	Waverley
O	'
O	s
O	life
O	.
O	A
O	hearty
O	handshake
O	paid
O	one;
O	a
O	kiss
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	Ned
O	Williams
O	was
O	introducing
O	our
O	hero
O	to
O	his
O	family
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	character
O	of
O	a
O	young
O	clergyman
O	who
O	was
O	detained
O	in
O	the
O	north
O	by
O	the
O	unsettled
O	state
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	On
O	their
O	way
O	into
O	Cumberland
O	they
O	passed
O	the
O	field
O	of
O	battle
O	where
O	Edward
O	had
O	lost
O	sight
O	of
O	Fergus
O	.
O	Many
O	bodies
O	still
O	lay
O	upon
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	moorland
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	of
O	Vich
O	Ian
O	Vohr
O	was
O	not
O	among
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	Edward
O	passed
O	on
O	with
O	some
O	hope
O	that
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	_Bodach
O	Glas_
O	,
O	Fergus
O	might
O	have
O	escaped
O	his
O	doom
O	.
O	They
O	found
O	Callum
O	Beg
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	his
O	tough
O	skull
O	cloven
O	at
O	last
O	by
O	a
O	dragoon
O	'
O	s
O	sword
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	sign
O	either
O	of
O	Evan
O	or
O	of
O	his
O	Chieftain
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	secure
O	shelter
O	of
O	good
O	Farmer
O	Williams
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	among
O	the
O	hills
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	Edward
O	'
O	s
O	lot
O	to
O	remain
O	somewhat
O	longer
O	than
O	he
O	intended
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	first
O	place
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	wholly
O	impossible
O	to
O	move
O	for
O	ten
O	days
O	,
O	owing
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	fall
O	of
O	snow
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	heard
O	how
O	that
O	the
O	Prince
O	had
O	retreated
O	farther
O	into
O	Scotland
O	,
O	how
O	Carlisle
O	had
O	been
O	besieged
O	and
O	taken
O	by
O	the
O	English
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	whole
O	north
O	was
O	covered
O	by
O	the
O	hosts
O	of
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Cumberland
O	and
O	General
O	Wade
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	the
O	month
O	of
O	January
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	the
O	clergyman
O	who
O	came
O	to
O	perform
O	the
O	ceremony
O	at
O	the
O	wedding
O	of
O	Ned
O	Williams
O	and
O	Cicely
O	Jopson
O	,
O	brought
O	with
O	him
O	a
O	newspaper
O	which
O	he
O	showed
O	to
O	Edward
O	.
O	In
O	it
O	Waverley
O	read
O	with
O	astonishment
O	a
O	notice
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	death
O	in
O	London
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	approaching
O	trial
O	of
O	Sir
O	Everard
O	for
O	high
O	treason--unless
O	(
O	said
O	the
O	report
O	)
O	Edward
O	Waverley
O	,
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	late
O	Richard
O	Waverley
O	,
O	and
O	heir
O	to
O	the
O	baronet
O	,
O	should
O	in
O	the
O	meantime
O	surrender
O	himself
O	to
O	justice
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	with
O	an
O	aching
O	anxious
O	heart
O	that
O	Waverley
O	set
O	out
O	by
O	the
O	northern
O	diligence
O	for
O	London
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	vehicle
O	opposite
O	to
O	an
O	officer
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	,
O	one
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nosebag
O	,
O	who
O	tormented
O	him
O	all
O	the
O	way
O	with
O	questions
O	,
O	on
O	several
O	occasions
O	almost
O	finding
O	him
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	once
O	at
O	least
O	narrowly
O	escaping
O	giving
O	him
O	an
O	introduction
O	to
O	a
O	recruiting
O	sergeant
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	regiment
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	all
O	risks
O	,
O	he
O	arrived
O	safely
O	under
O	Colonel
O	Talbot
O	'
O	s
O	roof
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	news
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	death
O	was
O	indeed
O	true
O	,
O	yet
O	his
O	own
O	conduct
O	certainly
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	the
O	matter--nor
O	was
O	Sir
O	Everard
O	in
O	the
O	slightest
O	present
O	danger
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	,
O	much
O	relieved
O	as
O	to
O	his
O	family
O	,
O	Edward
O	proclaimed
O	his
O	intention
O	of
O	returning
O	to
O	Scotland
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	possible--not
O	indeed
O	to
O	join
O	with
O	the
O	rebels
O	again
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	the
O	purpose
O	of
O	seeking
O	out
O	Rose
O	Bradwardine
O	and
O	conducting
O	her
O	to
O	a
O	place
O	of
O	safety
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	the
O	wisest
O	course
O	he
O	might
O	have
O	pursued
O	.
O	But
O	during
O	his
O	lonely
O	stay
O	at
O	Farmer
O	Williams
O	'
O	s
O	farm
O	,
O	Edward
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	had
O	turned
O	often
O	and
O	much
O	to
O	Rose
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	her
O	alone
O	and
O	without
O	protection
O	.
O	By
O	means

O	Bean
O	Lean
O	,
O	that

O	might

O	She
O	it
O	was

O	in

O	of

O	lastly

O	.
O	So
O	great
O	kindness
O	certainly
O	required
O	very
O	special

O	.
O	And
O	Edward
O	was
O	not
O	backward

O	some
O	days
O	after
O	they
O	started
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	custom
O	of
O	the
O	time
O	,
O	to
O	spend
O	some
O	time
O	upon
O	an
O	estate
O	which
O	Colonel
O	Talbot
O	had
O	bought
O	,
O	as
O	was
O	reported
O	,
O	a
O	very
O	great
O	bargain
O	.
O	The
O	Baron
O	had
O	been
O	persuaded
O	to
O	accompany
O	them
O	,
O	taking
O	a
O	place
O	of
O	honour
O	in
O	their
O	splendid
O	coach
O	and
O	six
O	,
O	the
O	gift
O	of
O	Sir
O	Everard
O	.
O	The
O	coach
O	of
O	Mr
O	.
O	Rubrick
O	of
O	Duchran
O	came
O	next
O	,
O	full
O	of
O	ladies
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	gentlemen
O	on
O	horseback
O	rode
O	with
O	them
O	as
O	an
O	escort
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	well
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	turning
O	of
O	the
O	road
O	which
O	led
O	to
O	Tully-Veolan
O	,
O	the
O	Bailie
O	met
O	them
O	.
O	He
O	requested
O	the
O	party
O	to
O	turn
O	aside
O	and
O	accept
O	of
O	his
O	hospitality
O	at
O	his
O	house
O	of
O	Little
O	Veolan
O	.
O	The
O	Baron
O	,
O	somewhat
O	put
O	out
O	,
O	replied
O	that
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	son-in-law
O	would
O	ride
O	that
O	way
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	bring
O	upon
O	him
O	the
O	whole
O	matrimonial
O	procession
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	clear
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	Baron
O	rather
O	dreaded
O	visiting
O	the
O	ancient
O	home
O	of
O	his
O	ancestors
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	lately
O	sold
O	by
O	the
O	unworthy
O	Malcolm
O	of
O	Inch-Grabbit
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	a
O	stranger
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	the
O	Bailie
O	insisted
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	party
O	evidently
O	wished
O	to
O	accept
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	hold
O	out
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	Baron
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	avenue
O	,
O	he
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	melancholy
O	meditation
O	,
O	thinking
O	doubtless
O	of
O	the
O	days
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	such
O	pride
O	in
O	the
O	ancient
O	Barony
O	which
O	had
O	passed
O	for
O	ever
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	line
O	of
O	the
O	Bradwardines
O	.
O	From
O	these
O	bitter
O	thoughts
O	he
O	was
O	awakened
O	by
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	huge
O	stone
O	bears
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	replaced
O	over
O	the
O	gate-posts
O	.
O	Then
O	down
O	the
O	avenue
O	came
O	the
O	two
O	great
O	deer-hounds
O	,
O	Ban
O	and
O	Buscar
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	so
O	long
O	kept
O	their
O	master
O	company
O	in
O	his
O	solitude
O	,
O	with
O	Daft
O	Davie
O	Gellatley
O	dancing
O	behind
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	Baron
O	was
O	then
O	informed
O	that
O	the
O	present
O	owner
O	of
O	the
O	Barony
O	was
O	no
O	other
O	than
O	Colonel
O	Talbot
O	himself
O	.
O	But
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	care
O	to
O	visit
O	the
O	new
O	owner
O	of
O	Bradwardine
O	,
O	the
O	party
O	would
O	proceed
O	to
O	Little
O	Veolan
O	,
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	Bailie
O	Macwheeble
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	the
O	Baron
O	had
O	need
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	greatness
O	of
O	mind
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	drew
O	a
O	long
O	breath
O	,
O	took
O	snuff
O	abundantly
O	,
O	and
O	remarked
O	that
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	so
O	far
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	pass
O	the
O	Colonel
O	'
O	s
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	happy
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	new
O	master
O	of
O	his
O	tenants
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	alighted
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	Castle
O	,
O	the
O	Baron
O	was
O	astonished
O	to
O	find
O	how
O	swiftly
O	the
O	marks
O	of
O	spoliation
O	had
O	been
O	removed
O	.
O	Even
O	the
O	roots
O	of
O	the
O	felled
O	trees
O	had
O	disappeared
O	.
O	All
O	was
O	fair
O	and
O	new
O	about
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	Tully-Veolan
O	,
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	bright
O	colours
O	of
O	the
O	garb
O	of
O	Davie
O	Gellatley
O	,
O	who
O	ran
O	first
O	to
O	one
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	of
O	the
O	company
O	,
O	passing
O	his
O	hands
O	over
O	his
O	new
O	clothes
O	and
O	crying
O	,
O	""""
O	Braw
O	,
O	braw
O	Davie
O	!
O	""""
O	The
O	dogs
O	,
O	Bran
O	and
O	Buscar
O	,
O	leaping
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	brought
O	tears
O	into
O	the
O	Baron
O	'
O	s
O	eyes
O	,
O	even
O	more
O	than
O	the
O	kind
O	welcome
O	of
O	Colonel
O	Talbot
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	,
O	the
O	Lady
O	Emily
O	.
O	Still
O	more
O	astonishing
O	appeared
O	the
O	changes
O	in
O	the
O	so
O	lately
O	ruined
O	courtyard
O	.
O	The
O	burned
O	stables
O	had
O	been
O	rebuilt
O	upon
O	a
O	newer
O	and
O	better
O	plan
O	.
O	The
O	pigeon-house
O	was
O	restocked
O	,
O	and
O	populous
O	with
O	fluttering
O	wings
O	.
O	Even
O	the
O	smallest
O	details
O	of
O	the
O	garden
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	multitude
O	of
O	stone
O	bears
O	on
O	the
O	gables
O	,
O	had
O	all
O	been
O	carefully
O	restored
O	as
O	of
O	old
O	.
O	The
O	Baron
O	could
O	hardly
O	believe
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	marvelled
O	aloud
O	that
O	Colonel
O	Talbot
O	had
O	not
O	thought
O	fit
O	to
O	replace
O	the
O	Bradwardine
O	arms
O	by
O	his
O	own
O	.
O	But
O	here
O	the
O	Colonel
O	,
O	suddenly
O	losing
O	patience
O	,
O	declared
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	,
O	even
O	to
O	please
O	these
O	foolish
O	boys
O	,
O	Waverley
O	and
O	Frank
O	Stanley
O	(
O	and
O	his
O	own
O	more
O	foolish
O	wife
O	)
O	,
O	continue
O	to
O	impose
O	upon
O	another
O	old
O	soldier
O	.
O	So
O	without
O	more
O	ado
O	he
O	told
O	the
O	Baron
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	only
O	advanced
O	the
O	money
O	to
O	buy
O	back
O	the
O	Barony
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	leave
O	Bailie
O	Macwheeble
O	to
O	explain
O	to
O	whom
O	the
O	estate
O	really
O	belonged
O	.
O	Trembling
O	with
O	eagerness
O	the
O	Bailie
O	advanced
O	,
O	a
O	formidable
O	roll
O	of
O	papers
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	He
O	began
O	triumphantly
O	to
O	explain
O	that
O	Colonel
O	Talbot
O	had
O	indeed
O	bought
O	Bradwardine
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	immediately
O	exchanged
O	it
O	for
O	Brere-wood
O	Lodge
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	left
O	to
O	Edward
O	under
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	will
O	.
O	Bradwardine
O	had
O	therefore
O	returned
O	to
O	its
O	ancient
O	Lord
O	in
O	full
O	and
O	undisputed
O	possession
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Baron
O	was
O	once
O	more
O	master
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	hereditary
O	powers
O	,
O	subject
O	only
O	to
O	an
O	easy
O	yearly
O	payment
O	to
O	his
O	son-in-law
O	.
O	Tears
O	were
O	actually
O	in
O	the
O	old
O	gentleman
O	'
O	s
O	eyes
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	from
O	room
O	to
O	room
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	scarce
O	speak
O	a
O	word
O	of
O	welcome
O	either
O	to
O	the
O	guests
O	within
O	,
O	or
O	of
O	thanks
O	to
O	the
O	rejoicing
O	farmers
O	and
O	cottars
O	who
O	,
O	hearing
O	of
O	his
O	return
O	,
O	had
O	gathered
O	without
O	.
O	The
O	climax
O	of
O	his
O	joy
O	was
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	reached
O	when
O	the
O	Blessed
O	Bear
O	of
O	Bradwardine
O	itself
O	,
O	the
O	golden
O	cup
O	of
O	his
O	line
O	,
O	mysteriously
O	recovered
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	spoil
O	of
O	the
O	English
O	army
O	by
O	Frank
O	Stanley
O	,
O	was
O	brought
O	to
O	the
O	Baron
O	'
O	s
O	elbow
O	by
O	old
O	Saunders
O	Saunderson
O	.
O	Truth
O	to
O	tell
O	,
O	the
O	recovery
O	of
O	this
O	heirloom
O	afforded
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	almost
O	as
O	much
O	pleasure
O	as
O	the
O	regaining
O	of
O	his
O	Barony
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	is
O	little
O	doubt
O	that
O	a
O	tear
O	mingled
O	with
O	the
O	wine
O	,
O	as
O	,
O	holding
O	the
O	Blessed
O	Bear
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	the
O	Baron
O	solemnly
O	proposed
O	the
O	healths
O	of
O	the
O	united
O	families
O	of
O	Waverley-Honour
O	and
O	Bradwardine
O	.
