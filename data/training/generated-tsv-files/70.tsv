O	a

O	the
O	contest
O	between
O	the
O	gladiators

O	It
O	was
O	a
O	wonderful
O	sight
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	Circus
O	Maximus
O	crowded
O	with

O	No

O	amongst

O	were
O	many

O	none
O	so
O	anxious
O	as
O	that

O	the
O	slave-girl
O	Marcella
O	.
O	She
O	sat
O	behind
O	her
O	little

O	eagerly

O	At

O	a
O	peal
O	of
O	trumpets
O	and
O	a
O	clash
O	of
O	cymbals
O	,
O	accompanied
O	by
O	some
O	wild
O	kind
O	of
O	music
O	,
O	announced
O	that
O	the
O	performance
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	begin
O	.
O	The
O	folding-doors
O	under
O	the

O	were
O	flung
O	open

O	two

O	In
O	all
O	the
O	pride

O	their
O	strength

O	walked
O	once

O	,
O	and
O	then
O	they
O	stepped
O	aside
O	to
O	wait
O	until
O	their
O	turn
O	came
O	.
O	The
O	performance
O	began
O	with

O	at
O	the
O	time
O	of

O	we
O	are
O	speaking
O	the
O	Romans
O	had
O	learned
O	to

O	bloodshed
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	learned
O	to
O	despise
O	the
O	less
O	exciting
O	,
O	if
O	more
O	manly
O	,
O	trials
