O	through
O	the

O	of
O	his
O	reign
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	worked
O	it
O	out
O	resolutely
O	.
O	The
O	lawless
O	nobles
O	would
O	not
O	brook
O	his
O	ruling
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	strong

O	bitter
O	was
O	the
O	hatred
O	that
O	had
O	arisen
O	against

O	.
O	In
O	many
O	of
O	his
O	transactions
O	he
O	was
O	far
O	from
O	blameless:
O	he
O	was
O	sometimes
O	tempted
O	to
O	craft
O	,
O	sometimes
O	to
O	tyranny;
O	but
O	his
O	object
O	was
O	always

O	In
O	the
O	main

O	to
O	enforce
O	the

O	Sir
O	Robert
O	Graham
O	,
O	the

O	off
O	into

O	there
O	formed
O	a
O	conspiracy
O	among

O	who
O	hated
O	the
