O	A
O	hound
O	was
O	chasing
O	a
O	hare
O	through
O	the
O	woods
O	.
O	Some
O	wolves
O	and
O	panthers
O	were
O	chasing
O	a
O	bull
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	feeding
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	near
O	the
O	woods
O	.
O	For
O	some
O	time
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	trying
O	to
O	run
O	him
O	down
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	seem
O	to
O	gain
O	on
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	wolves
O	and
O	panthers
O	saw
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	gaining
O	on
O	the
O	bull
O	,
O	they
O	halted
O	to
O	take
O	counsel
O	.
O	They
O	decided
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	take
O	a
O	whole
O	day
O	of
O	hard
O	running
O	to
O	get
O	the
O	bull
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	hound
O	was
O	near
O	!
O	Why
O	not
O	go
O	for
O	the
O	hound
O	?
O	All
O	agreed
O	.
O	They
O	set
O	off
O	for
O	the
O	hound
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	bull
O	had
O	heard
O	the
O	wolves
O	and
O	panthers
O	take
O	council
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	set
O	off
O	for
O	the
O	woods
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	neared
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	the
O	bull
O	called
O	to
O	the
O	hound
O	and
O	warned
O	him
O	that
O	a
O	pack
O	of
O	wolves
O	and
O	panthers
O	was
O	after
O	him
O	.
O	Just
O	then
O	they
O	came
O	into
O	sight
O	.
O	The
O	hound
O	dared
O	not
O	meet
O	them
O	alone
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	which
O	way
O	to
O	turn
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	bull
O	called
O	,
O	""""
O	Come

O	""""
O	The
O	hound
O	ran
O	and
O	leaped
O	on
O	the
O	back
O	of
O	the
O	bull
O	,
O	and
O	away
O	they
O	went
O	.
O	The
O	bull
O	and
O	the
O	hound
O	talked
O	as
O	they
O	ran
O	.
O	The
O	bull
O	said

O	the
O	wolves
O	would
O	soon
O	grow
O	tired
O	,
O	fall
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	give
O	up
O	the
O	chase
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	was
O	wrong
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	too
O	angry
O	at
O	being
O	outwitted

O	""""
O	The
O	bull
O	saw
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	run
O	for
O	life
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	he
O	ran
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	time
O	it
O	was
O	easy
O	to
O	outrun
O	the
O	wolves
O	and
O	panthers
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	press
O	hard
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	sun
O	dropped
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	the
O	bull
O	felt
O	his
O	knees
O	begin
O	to
O	weaken
O	.
O	The
O	weight
O	of
O	the
O	hound
O	was
O	telling
O	on
O	him
O	.
O	A
O	moment
O	later
O	,
O	he
O	stumbled
O	and
O	fell
O	.
O	In
O	an
O	instant
O	,
O	the
O	pack
O	was
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	with
O	one
O	leap
O	,
O	the
O	hound
O	cleared
O	the
O	pack
O	and
O	was
O	off
O	down
O	the
O	trail
O	.
O	The
O	weaker
O	wolves
O	and
O	panthers
O	leaped
O	upon
O	the
O	bull
O	.
O	The
O	stronger
O	went
O	on
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	them
O	were
O	no
O	match
O	for
O	the
O	hound
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	fresh
O	and
O	strong
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	riding
O	all
O	day
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	tired
O	and
O	worn
O	from
O	the
O	long
O	chase
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	they
O	gave
O	it
O	up
O	.
O	Because
O	the
O	hound
O	is
O	able
O	to
O	save
O	his
O	strength
O	for
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	chase
O	,
O	he
O	can
O	now
O	outrun
O	not
O	only
O	wolves
O	and
O	panthers
O	,
O	but
