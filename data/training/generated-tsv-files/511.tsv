O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	the
O	fairies
O	of
O	the
O	west
O	,
O	going
O	home
O	from
O	a
O	hurling-match
O	with
O	the
O	fairies
O	of
O	the
O	lakes
O	,
O	rested
O	in
O	Dooros
O	Wood
O	for
O	three
O	days
O	and
O	three
O	nights
O	.
O	They
O	spent
O	the
O	days
O	feasting
O	and
O	the
O	nights
O	dancing
O	in
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	moon
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	danced
O	so
O	hard
O	that
O	they
O	wore
O	the
O	shoes
O	off
O	their
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	a
O	whole
O	week
O	after
O	the
O	leprechauns
O	,
O	the
O	fairies
O	'
O	shoemakers
O	,
O	were
O	working
O	night
O	and
O	day
O	making
O	new
O	ones
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rip
O	,
O	rap
O	,
O	tap
O	,
O	tap
O	of
O	their
O	little
O	hammers
O	were
O	heard
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	hedgerows
O	.
O	The
O	food
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	fairies
O	feasted
O	was
O	little
O	red
O	berries
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	so
O	like
O	those
O	that
O	grow
O	on
O	the
O	rowan
O	tree
O	that
O	if
O	you
O	only
O	looked
O	at
O	them
O	you
O	might
O	mistake
O	one
O	for
O	the
O	other;
O	but
O	the
O	fairy
O	berries
O	grow
O	only
O	in
O	fairyland
O	,
O	and
O	are
O	sweeter
O	than
O	any
O	fruit
O	that
O	grows
O	here
O	in
O	this
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	if

O	old
O	man
O	,
O	bent
O	and
O	gray
O	,
O	ate
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	he
O	became
O	young
O	and
O	active
O	and
O	strong
O	again;
O	and
O	if
O	an
O	old
O	woman
O	,
O	withered
O	and
O	wrinkled
O	,
O	ate
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	she
O	became
O	young
O	and
O	bright
O	and
O	fair;
O	and
O	if
O	a
O	little
O	maiden
O	who
O	was
O	not
O	handsome
O	ate
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	she
O	became
O	lovelier
O	than
O	the
O	flower
O	of
O	beauty
O	.
O	The
O	fairies
O	guarded
O	the
O	berries
O	as
O	carefully
O	as
O	a
O	miser
O	guards
O	his
O	gold
O	,
O	and
O	whenever
O	they
O	were
O	about
O	to
O	leave
O	fairyland
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	promise
O	in
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	give
O	a
O	single
O	berry
O	to
O	mortal
O	man
O	,
O	nor
O	allow
O	one
O	to
O	fall
O	upon
O	the
O	earth;
O	for
O	if
O	a
O	single
O	berry
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	earth
O	a
O	slender
O	tree
O	of
O	many
O	branches
O	,
O	bearing
O	clusters
O	of
O	berries
O	,
O	would
O	at
O	once
O	spring
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	mortal
O	men
O	might
O	eat
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
O	this
O	time
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	Dooros
O	Wood
O	they
O	kept
O	up
O	the
O	feasting
O	and
O	dancing
O	so
O	long
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	so
O	full
O	of
O	joy
O	because
O	of
O	their
O	victory
O	over
O	the
O	lake
O	fairies
O	,
O	that
O	one
O	little
O	,
O	weeny
O	fairy
O	,
O	not
O	much
O	bigger
O	than
O	my
O	finger
O	,
O	lost
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	dropped
O	a
O	berry
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	feast
O	was
O	ended
O	the
O	fairies
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	fairyland
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	at
O	home
O	for
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	week
O	before
O	they
O	knew
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	'
O	s
O	fault
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	is
O	how
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	know
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	wedding
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	come
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	of
O	the
O	fairies
O	sent
O	six
O	of
O	her
O	pages
O	to
O	Dooros
O	Wood
O	to
O	catch
O	fifty
O	butterflies
O	with
O	golden
O	spots
O	on
O	their
O	purple
O	wings
O	,
O	and
O	fifty
O	white
O	without
O	speck
O	or
O	spot
O	,
O	and
O	fifty
O	golden
O	,
O	yellow
O	as
O	the
O	cowslip
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	dress
O	for
O	herself
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	hundred
O	white
O	,
O	without
O	speck
O	or
O	spot
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	dresses
O	for
O	the
O	bride
O	and
O	bridesmaids
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	pages
O	came
O	near
O	the
O	wood
O	they
O	heard
O	the
O	most
O	wonderful
O	music
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sky
O	above
O	them
O	became
O	quite
O	dark
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	a
O	cloud
O	had
O	shut
O	out
O	the
O	sun
O	.
O	They
O	looked
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	cloud
O	was
O	formed
O	of
O	bees
O	,
O	who
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	swarm
O	were
O	flying
O	towards
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	humming
O	as
O	they
O	flew
O	.
O	Seeing
O	this
O	they
O	were
O	sore
O	afraid
O	until
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	bees
O	settling
O	on
O	a
O	single
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	looking
O	closely
O	at
O	the
O	tree
O	they
O	saw
O	it
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	fairy
O	berries
O	.
O	The
O	bees
O	took
O	no
O	notice
O	of
O	the
O	fairies
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	they
O	were
O	no
O	longer
O	afraid
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	hunted
O	the
O	butterflies
O	until
O	they
O	had
O	captured
O	the
O	full
O	number
O	of
O	various
O	colors
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	returned
O	to
O	fairyland
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	told
O	the
O	queen
O	about
O	the
O	bees
O	and
O	the
O	berries
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	told
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	was
O	very
O	angry
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	sent
O	his
O	heralds
O	to
O	the
O	four
O	corners
O	of
O	fairyland
O	to
O	summon
O	all
O	his
O	subjects
O	to
O	his
O	presence
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	find
O	out
O	without
O	delay
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	culprit
O	.
O	They
O	all
O	came
O	except
O	the
O	little
O	weeny
O	fellow
O	who
O	dropped
O	the
O	berry
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	course
O	everyone
O	said
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	fear
O	that
O	kept
O	him
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	be
O	guilty
O	.
O	The
O	heralds
O	were
O	at
O	once
O	sent
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	while
O	they
O	found
O	him
O	hiding
O	in
O	a
O	cluster
O	of
O	ferns
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	him
O	before
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	little
O	fellow
O	was
O	so
O	frightened
O	that
O	at
O	first
O	he
O	could
O	scarcely
O	speak
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	but
O	after
O	a
O	time
O	he
O	told
O	how
O	he
O	never
O	missed
O	the
O	berry
O	until
O	he
O	had
O	returned
O	to
O	fairyland
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	afraid
O	to
O	say
O	anything
O	to
O	anyone
O	about
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	,
O	who
O	would
O	hear
O	of
O	no
O	excuse
O	,
O	sentenced
O	the
O	little
O	culprit
O	to
O	be
O	banished
O	into
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	giants
O	beyond
O	the
O	mountains
O	,
O	to
O	stay
O	there
O	for
O	ever
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	unless
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	a
O	giant
O	willing
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	Dooros
O	Wood
O	and
O	guard
O	the
O	fairy
O	tree
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	pronounced
O	sentence
O	everyone
O	was
O	very
O	sorry
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	was
O	a
O	favorite
O	with
O	them
O	all
O	.
O	No
O	fairy
O	harper
O	upon
O	his
O	harp
O	,
O	or
O	piper
O	upon
O	his
O	pipe
O	,
O	or
O	fiddler
O	upon
O	his
O	fiddle
O	,
O	could
O	play
O	half
O	so
O	sweetly
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	play
O	upon
O	an
O	ivy
O	leaf;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	remembered
O	all
O	the
O	pleasant
O	moonlit
O	nights
O	on
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	danced
O	to
O	his
O	music
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	never
O	hear
O	or
O	dance
O	to
O	it
O	any
O	more
O	,
O	their
O	little
O	hearts
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	sorrow
O	.
O	The
O	queen
O	was
O	as
O	sad
O	as
O	any
O	of
O	her
O	subjects
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	word
O	should
O	be
O	obeyed
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	time
O	came
O	for
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	to
O	set
O	out
O	into
O	exile
O	the
O	queen
O	sent
O	her
O	head
O	page
O	to
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	handful
O	of
O	berries
O	.
O	These
O	the
O	queen
O	said
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	offer
O	to
O	the
O	giants
O	,
O	and
O	say
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	that
O	the
O	giant
O	who
O	was
O	willing
O	to
O	guard
O	the
O	tree
O	could
O	feast
O	on
O	berries
O	just
O	as
O	sweet
O	from
O	morn
O	till
O	night
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	went
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	nearly
O	all
O	the
O	fairies
O	followed
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	borders
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	him
O	go
O	up
O	the
O	mountain
O	towards
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	,
O	they
O	all
O	took
O	off
O	their
O	little
O	red
O	caps
O	and
O	waved
O	them
O	until
O	he
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	.
O	On
O	he
O	went
O	walking
O	all
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	sun
O	rose
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	he
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	stretched
O	far
O	below
O	him
O	.
O	Before
O	beginning
O	his
O	descent
O	he
O	turned
O	round
O	for
O	a
O	last
O	glimpse
O	of
O	fairyland;
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	nothing
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	thick
O	,
O	dark
O	cloud
O	shut
O	it
O	out
O	from
O	view
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	very
O	sad
O	,
O	and
O	tired
O	,
O	and
O	footsore
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	struggled
O	down
O	the
O	rough
O	mountain
O	side
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	thinking
O	of
O	the
O	soft
O	,
O	green
O	woods
O	and
O	mossy
O	pathways
O	of
O	the
O	pleasant
O	land
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	behind
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	awoke
O	the
O	ground
O	was
O	trembling
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	noise
O	that
O	sounded
O	like
O	thunder
O	fell
O	on
O	his
O	ears
O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	up
O	and
O	saw
O	coming
O	towards
O	him
O	a
O	terrible
O	giant
O	,
O	with
O	one
O	eye
O	that
O	burned
O	like
O	a
O	live
O	coal
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	his
O	forehead;
O	his
O	mouth
O	stretched
O	from
O	ear
O	to
O	ear
O	,
O	his
O	teeth
O	were
O	long
O	and
O	crooked
O	,
O	the
O	skin
O	of
O	his
O	face
O	was
O	as
O	black
O	as
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	chest
O	were
O	all
O	covered
O	with
O	black
O	,
O	shaggy
O	hair;
O	round
O	his
O	body
O	was
O	an
O	iron
O	band
O	,
O	and
O	hanging
O	from
O	this
O	by
O	a
O	chain
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	club
O	with
O	iron
O	spikes
O	.
O	With
O	one
O	blow
O	of
O	this
O	club
O	he
O	could
O	break
O	a
O	rock
O	into
O	splinters
O	,
O	and
O	fire
O	could
O	not
O	burn
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	water
O	could
O	not
O	drown
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	weapons
O	could
O	not
O	wound
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	there
