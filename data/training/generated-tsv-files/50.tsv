O	My
O	gentleness
O	and
O	good
O	behavior
O	had
O	gained
O	so
O	far
O	on
O	the
O	emperor
O	and
O	his
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	indeed
O	upon
O	the
O	army
O	and
O	people
O	in
O	general
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	conceive
O	hopes
O	of
O	getting
O	my
O	liberty
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	all
O	possible
O	methods
O	to
O	cultivate
O	this
O	favorable
O	disposition
O	.
O	The
O	natives
O	came
O	,
O	by
O	degrees
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	less
O	apprehensive
O	of
O	any
O	danger
O	from
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	would
O	sometimes
O	lie
O	down
O	and
O	let
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	of
O	them
O	dance
O	on
O	my
O	hand;
O	and
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	the
O	boys
O	and
O	girls
O	would
O	venture
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	play
O	at
O	hide-and-seek
O	in
O	my
O	hair
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	now
O	made
O	a
O	good
O	progress
O	in
O	understanding
O	and
O	speaking
O	their
O	language
O	.
O	The
O	emperor
O	had
O	a
O	mind
O	,
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	to
O	entertain
O	me
O	with
O	several
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	shows
O	,
O	wherein
O	they
O	exceed
O	all
O	nations
O	I
O	have
O	known
O	,
O	both
O	for
O	dexterity
O	and
O	magnificence
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	diverted
O	with
O	none
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	rope-dances
O	,
O	performed
O	upon
O	a
O	slender
O	white
O	thread
O	,
O	extended
O	about
O	two
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	twelve
O	inches
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Upon
O	which
O	I
O	shall
O	desire
O	liberty
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	reader
O	'
O	s
O	patience
O	,
O	to
O	enlarge
O	a
O	little
O	.
O	This
O	diversion
O	is
O	only
O	practised
O	by
O	those
O	persons
O	who
O	are
O	candidates
O	for
O	great
O	employments
O	,
O	and
O	high
O	favor
O	at
O	court
O	.
O	They
O	are
O	trained
O	in
O	this
O	art
O	from
O	their
O	youth
O	,
O	and
O	are
O	not
O	always
O	of
O	noble
O	birth
O	,
O	or
O	liberal
O	education
O	.
O	When
O	a
O	great
O	office
O	is
O	vacant
O	,
O	either
O	by
O	death
O	or
O	disgrace
O	(
O	which
O	often
O	happens
O	)
O	,
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	of
O	those
O	candidates
O	petition
O	the
O	emperor
O	to
O	entertain
O	his
O	Majesty
O	and
O	the
O	court
O	with
O	a
O	dance
O	on
O	the
O	rope
O	,
O	and
O	whoever
O	jumps
O	the
O	highest
O	,
O	without
O	falling
O	,
O	succeeds
O	in
O	the
O	office
O	.
O	Very
O	often
O	the
O	chief
O	ministers
O	themselves
O	are
O	commanded
O	to
O	show
O	their
O	skill
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	convince
O	the
O	emperor
O	that
O	they
O	have
O	not
O	lost
O	their
O	faculty
O	.
O	Flimnap
O	,
O	the
O	treasurer
O	,
O	is
O	allowed
O	to
O	cut
O	a
O	caper
O	on
O	the
O	strait
O	rope
O	at
O	least
O	an
O	inch
O	higher
O	than
O	any
O	other
O	lord
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	empire
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	seen
O	him
O	do
O	the
O	somerset
O	several
O	times
O	together
O	,
O	upon
O	a
O	trencher
O	fixed
O	on
O	the
O	rope
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	no
O	thicker
O	than
O	a
O	common
O	packthread
O	in
O	England
O	.
O	My
O	friend
O	Reldresal
O	,
O	principal
O	secretary
O	for
O	private
O	affairs
O	,
O	is
O	,
O	in
O	my
O	opinion
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	partial
O	,
O	the
O	second
O	after
O	the
O	treasurer;
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	officers
O	are
O	much
O	upon
O	a
O	par
O	.
O	These
O	diversions
O	are
O	often
O	attended
O	with
O	fatal
O	accidents
O	,
O	whereof
O	great
O	numbers
O	are
O	on
O	record
O	.
O	I
O	myself
O	have
O	seen
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	candidates
O	break
O	a
O	limb
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	danger
O	is
O	much
O	greater
O	when
O	the
O	ministers
O	themselves
O	are
O	commanded
O	to
O	show
O	their
O	dexterity;
O	for
O	,
O	by
O	contending
O	to
O	excel
O	themselves
O	and
O	their
O	fellows
O	,
O	they
O	strain
O	so
O	far
O	,
O	that
O	there
O	is
O	hardly
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	who
O	has
O	not
O	received
O	a
O	fall
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	assured
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	a
O	year
O	or
O	two
O	before
O	my
O	arrival
O	,
O	Flimnap
O	would
O	have
O	infallibly
O	broke
O	his
O	neck
O	,
O	if
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	cushions
O	,
O	that
O	accidentally
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	weakened
O	the
O	force
O	of
O	his
O	fall
O	.
O	There
O	is
O	likewise
O	another
O	diversion
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	only
O	shown
O	before
O	the
O	emperor
O	and
O	empress
O	,
O	and
O	first
O	minister
O	,
O	upon
O	particular
O	occasions
O	.
O	The
O	emperor
O	lays
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	three
O	fine
O	silken
O	threads
O	of
O	six
O	inches
O	long:
O	one
O	is
O	blue
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	red
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	third
O	green
O	.
O	These
O	threads
O	are
O	proposed
O	as
O	prizes
O	for
O	those
O	persons
O	whom
O	the
O	emperor
O	hath
O	a
O	mind
O	to
O	distinguish
O	by
O	a
O	peculiar
O	mark
O	of
O	his
O	favor
O	.
O	The
O	ceremony
O	is
O	performed
O	in
O	his
O	Majesty
O	'
O	s
O	great
O	chamber
O	of
O	state
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	candidates
O	are
O	to
O	undergo
O	a
O	trial
O	of
O	dexterity
O	very
O	different
O	from
O	the
O	former
O	,
O	and
O	such
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	not
O	observed
O	the
O	least
O	resemblance
O	of
O	in
O	any
O	other
O	country
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	or
O	new
O	world
O	.
O	The
O	emperor
O	holds
O	a
O	stick
O	in
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	both
O	ends
O	parallel
O	to
O	the
O	horizon
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	candidates
O	advancing
O	,
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	,
O	sometimes
O	leap
O	over
O	the
O	stick
O	,
O	sometimes
O	creep
O	under
O	it
O	backwards
O	and
O	forwards
O	several
O	times
O	,
O	according
O	as
O	the
O	stick
O	is
O	advanced
O	or
O	depressed
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	the
O	emperor
O	holds
O	one
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	stick
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	first
O	minister
O	the
O	other;
O	sometimes
O	the
O	minister
O	has
O	it
O	entirely
O	to
O	himself
O	.
O	Whoever
O	performs
O	his
O	part
O	with
O	most
O	agility
O	,
O	and
O	holds
O	out
O	the
O	longest
O	in
O	leaping
O	and
O	creeping
O	,
O	is
O	rewarded
O	with
O	the
O	blue-colored
O	silk
O	,
O	the
O	red
O	is
O	given
O	to
O	the
O	next
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	green
O	to
O	the
O	third
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	all
O	wear
O	girt
O	twice
O	round
O	about
O	the
O	middle
O	,
O	and
O	you
O	see
O	few
O	great
O	persons
O	about
O	this
O	court
O	who
O	are
O	not
O	adorned
O	with
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	girdles
O	.
O	The
O	horses
O	of
O	the
O	army
O	,
O	and
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	royal
O	stables
O	,
O	having
O	been
O	daily
O	led
O	before
O	me
O	,
O	were
O	no
O	longer
O	shy
O	,
O	but
O	would
O	come
O	up
O	to
O	my
O	very
O	feet
O	without
O	starting
O	,
O	The
O	riders
O	would
O	leap
O	them
O	over
O	my
O	hand
O	as
O	I
O	held
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	emperor
O	'
O	s
O	huntsmen
O	,
O	upon
O	a
O	large
O	courser
O	,
O	took
O	my
O	foot
O	,
O	shoe
O	and
O	all;
O	which
O	was
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	a
O	prodigious
O	leap
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	fortune
O	to
O	divert
O	the
O	emperor
O	,
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	very
O	extraordinary
O	manner:
O	I
O	desired
O	he
O	would
O	order
O	several
O	sticks
O	of
O	two
O	feet
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	thickness
O	of
O	an
O	ordinary
O	cane
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	brought
O	me;
O	whereupon
O	his
O	Majesty
O	commanded
O	the
O	master
O	of
O	his
O	woods
O	to
O	give
O	directions
O	accordingly
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	six
O	woodmen
O	arrived
O	with
O	as
O	many
O	carriages
O	,
O	drawn
O	by
O	eight
O	horses
O	to
O	each
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	nine
O	of
O	these
O	sticks
O	,
O	and
O	fixing
O	them
O	firmly
O	in
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	quadrangular
O	figure
O	,
O	two
O	feet
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	square
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	four
O	other
O	sticks
O	,
O	and
O	tied
O	them
O	parallel
O	at
O	each
O	corner
O	,
O	about
O	two
O	feet
O	from
O	the
O	ground;
O	then
O	I
O	fastened
O	my
O	handkerchief
O	to
O	the
O	nine
O	sticks
O	that
O	stood
O	erect
O	,
O	and
O	extended
O	it
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	tight
O	as
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	drum;
O	and
O	the
O	four
O	parallel
O	sticks
O	,
O	rising
O	about
O	five
O	inches
O	higher
O	than
O	the
O	handkerchief
O	,
O	served
O	as
O	ledges
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	finished
O	my
O	work
O	,
O	I
O	desired
O	the
O	emperor
O	to
O	let
O	a
O	troop
O	of
O	his
O	best
O	horse
O	,
O	twenty-four
O	in
O	number
O	,
O	come
O	and
O	exercise
O	upon
O	this
O	plain
O	.
O	His
O	Majesty
O	approved
O	of
O	the
O	proposal
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	took
O	them
O	up
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	in
O	my
O	hands
O	,
O	ready
O	mounted
O	and
O	armed
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	proper
O	officers
O	to
O	exercise
O	them
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	got
O	in
O	order
O	,
O	they
O	divided
O	into
O	two
O	parties
O	,
O	performed
O	mock
O	skirmishes
O	,
O	discharged
O	blunt
O	arrows
O	,
O	drew
O	their
O	swords
O	,
O	fled
O	and
O	pursued
O	,
O	attacked
O	and
O	retired
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	short
O	discovered
O	the
O	best
O	military
O	discipline
O	I
O	ever
O	beheld
O	.
O	The
O	parallel
O	sticks
O	secured
O	them
O	and
O	their
O	horses
O	from
O	falling
O	over
O	the
O	stage;
O	and
O	the
O	emperor
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	delighted
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	ordered
O	this
O	entertainment
O	to
O	be
O	repeated
O	several
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	once
O	was
O	pleased
O	to
O	be
O	lifted
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	give
O	the
O	word
O	of
O	command;
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	great
O	difficulty
O	,
O	persuaded
O	even
O	the
O	empress
O	herself
O	to
O	let
O	me
O	hold
O	her
O	in
O	her
O	close
O	chair
O	within
O	two
O	yards
O	of
O	the
O	stage
O	,
O	from
O	whence
O	she
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	full
O	view
O	of
O	the
O	whole
O	performance
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	by
O	good
O	fortune
O	that
O	no
O	ill
O	accident
O	happened
O	in
O	these
O	entertainments
O	,
O	only
O	once
O	a
O	fiery
O	horse
O	,
O	that
O	belonged
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	captains
O	,
O	pawing
O	with
O	his
O	hoof
O	,
O	struck
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	my
O	handkerchief
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	foot
O	slipping
O	,
O	he
O	overthrew
O	his
O	rider
O	and
O	himself;
O	but
O	I
O	immediately
O	relieved
O	them
O	both
O	,
O	and
O	covering
O	the
O	hole
O	with
O	one
O	hand
O	,
O	I
O	set
O	down
O	the
O	troop
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	as
O	I
O	took
O	them
O	up
O	.
O	The
O	horse
O	that
O	fell
O	was
O	strained
O	in
O	the
O	left
O	shoulder
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	rider
O	got
O	no
O	hurt
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	repaired
O	my
O	handkerchief
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	I
O	could;
O	however
O	,
O	I
O	would
O	not
O	trust
O	to
O	the
O	strength
O	of
O	it
O	any
O	more
O	in
O	such
O	dangerous
O	enterprises
O	.
O	About
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	days
O	before
O	I
O	was
O	set
O	at
O	liberty
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	entertaining
O	the
O	court
O	with
O	this
O	kind
O	of
O	feats
O	,
O	there
O	arrived
O	an
O	express
O	to
O	inform
O	his
O	Majesty
O	that
O	some
O	of
O	his
O	subjects
O	,
O	riding
O	near
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	was
O	first
O	taken
O	up
O	,
O	had
O	seen
O	a
O	great
O	black
O	substance
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	very
O	oddly
O	shaped
O	,
O	extending
O	its
O	edges
O	round
O	as
O	wide
O	as
O	his
O	Majesty
O	'
O	s
O	bed-chamber
O	,
O	and
O	rising
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	as
O	high
O	as
O	a
O	man;
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	living
O	creature
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	at
O	first
O	apprehended
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	grass
O	without
O	motion;
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	walked
O	round
O	it
O	several
O	times;
O	that
O	,
O	by
O	mounting
O	upon
O	each
O	other
O	'
O	s
O	shoulders
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	got
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	flat
O	and
O	even
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	stamping
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	they
O	found
O	it
O	was
O	hollow
O	within;
O	that
O	they
O	humbly
O	conceived
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	something
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
O	Man-Mountain;
O	and
O	if
O	his
O	Majesty
O	pleased
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	undertake
O	to
O	bring
O	it
O	with
O	only
O	five
O	horses
O	.
O	I
O	presently
O	knew
O	what
O	they
O	meant
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	glad
O	at
O	heart
O	to
O	receive
O	this
O	intelligence
O	.
O	It
O	seems
O	upon
O	my
O	first
O	reaching
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	after
O	our
O	shipwreck
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	such
O	confusion
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	before
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	,
O	my
O	hat
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	fastened
O	with
O	a
O	string
O	to
O	my
O	head
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	rowing
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	stuck
O	on
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	I
O	was
O	swimming
O	,
O	fell
O	off
O	after
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	land;
O	the
O	string
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	conjecture
O	,
O	breaking
O	by
O	some
O	accident
O	which
O	I
O	never
O	observed
O	,
O	but
O	thought
O	my
O	hat
O	had
O	been
O	lost
O	at
O	sea
O	.
O	I
O	intreated
O	his
O	Imperial
O	Majesty
O	to
O	give
O	orders
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	brought
O	to
O	me
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	possible
O	,
O	describing
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	use
O	and
O	the
O	nature
O	of
O	it;
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	the
O	wagoners
O	arrived
O	with
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	condition;
O	they
O	had
O	bored
O	two
O	holes
O	in
O	the
O	brim
O	,
O	within
O	an
O	inch
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	of
O	the
O	edge
O	,
O	and
O	fastened
O	two
O	hooks
O	in
O	the
O	holes;
O	these
O	hooks
O	were
O	tied
O	by
O	a
O	long
O	cord
O	to
O	the
O	harness
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	my
O	hat
O	was
O	dragged
O	along
O	for
O	above
O	half
O	an
O	English
O	mile;
O	but
O	,
O	the
O	ground
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	being
O	extremely
O	smooth
O	and
O	level
O	,
O	it
O	received
O	less
O	damage
O	than
O	I
O	expected
O	.
O	Two
O	days
O	after
O	this
O	adventure
O	,
O	the
O	emperor
O	having
O	ordered
O	that
O	part
O	of
O	his
O	army
O	,
O	which
O	quarters
O	in
O	and
O	about
O	his
O	metropolis
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	in
O	readiness
O	,
O	took
O	a
O	fancy
O	of
O	diverting
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	singular
O	manner;
O	he
O	desired
O	I
O	would
O	stand
O	like
O	a
O	colossus
O	,
O	with
O	my
O	legs
O	as
O	far
O	asunder
O	as
O	I
O	conveniently
O	could;
O	he
O	then
O	commanded
O	his
O	general
O	(
O	who
O	was
O	an
O	old
O	experienced
O	leader
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	patron
O	of
O	mine
O	)
O	to
O	draw
O	up
O	the
O	troops
O	in
O	close
O	order
O	,
O	and
O	march
O	them
O	under
O	me;
O	the
O	foot
O	by
O	twenty-four
O	in
O	a-breast
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	horse
O	by
O	sixteen
O	,
O	with
O	drums
O	beating
O	,
O	colors
O	flying
O	,
O	and
O	pikes
O	advanced
O	.
O	This
O	body
O	consisted
O	of
O	three
O	thousand
O	foot
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	thousand
O	horse
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	sent
O	so
O	many
O	memorials
O	and
O	petitions
O	for
O	my
O	liberty
O	,
O	that
O	his
O	Majesty
O	at
O	length
O	mentioned
O	the
O	matter
O	first
O	in
O	the
O	cabinet
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	in
O	a
O	full
O	council;
O	where
O	it
O	was
O	opposed
O	by
O	none
O	,
O	except
O	Skyresh
O	Bolgolam
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	pleased
O	,
O	without
O	any
O	provocation
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	my
O	mortal
O	enemy
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	carried
O	against
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	whole
O	board
O	,
O	and
O	confirmed
O	by
O	the
O	emperor
O	.
O	That
O	minister
O	was
O	_galbet
O	,
O	_
O	or
O	admiral
O	of
O	the
O	realm
O	,
O	very
O	much
O	in
O	his
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	confidence
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	person
O	well
O	versed
O	in
O	affairs
O	,
O	but
O	of
O	a
O	morose
O	and
O	sour
O	complexion
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	at
O	length
O	persuaded
O	to
O	comply;
O	but
O	prevailed
O	that
O	the
O	articles
O	and
O	conditions
O	upon
O	which
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	set
O	free
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	which
O	I
O	must
O	swear
O	,
O	should
O	be
O	drawn
O	up
O	by
O	himself
O	.
O	These
O	articles
O	were
O	brought
O	to
O	me
O	by
O	Skyresh
O	Bolgolam
O	in
O	person
O	,
O	attended
O	by
O	two
O	under-secretaries
O	,
O	and
O	several
O	persons
O	of
O	distinction
O	.
O	After
O	they
O	were
O	read
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	demanded
O	to
O	swear
O	to
O	the
O	performance
O	of
O	them;
O	first
O	in
O	the
O	manner
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	afterwards
O	in
O	the
O	method
O	prescribed
O	by
O	their
O	laws
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	to
O	hold
O	my
O	right
O	foot
O	in
O	my
O	left
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	place
O	the
O	middle
O	finger
O	of
O	my
O	right
O	hand
O	on
O	the
O	crown
O	of
O	my
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	thumb
O	on
O	the
O	tip
O	of
O	my
O	right
O	ear
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	reader
O	may
O	be
O	curious
O	to
O	have
O	some
O	idea
O	of
O	the
O	style
O	and
O	manner
O	of
O	expression
O	peculiar
O	to
O	that

O	to
O	know
O	the
O	articles
O	upon
O	which
O	I
O	recovered
O	my
O	liberty
O	,
O	I
O	have
O	made

O	I

O	subscribed
O	to

O	with
O	great
O	cheerfulness
O	and

O	were
O	not
O	so
O	honorable
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	have
O	wished;
O	which
O	proceeded
O	wholly
O	from
O	the
O	malice
O	of
O	Skyresh
O	Bolgolam
O	,
O	the
O	high
O	admiral;
O	whereupon
O	my
O	chains
O	were
O	immediately
O	unlocked
O	,

O	I
O	was
O	at

O	the

O	did
O	me
O	the
O	honor
O	to
O	be
O	by
O	at
O	the

O	.
O	I

O	,
O	by
O	prostrating
O	myself
O	at
O	his
O	Majesty
O	'
O	s
O	feet
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	commanded

O	after
O	many
O	gracious
O	expressions
O	,

O	,
O	to
O	avoid
O	the
O	censure
O	of
O	vanity
O	,
O	I
O	shall
O	not
O	repeat
O	,
O	he
O	added
O	that
O	he
O	hoped
O	I
O	should
O	prove
O	a
O	useful
O	servant
O	,
O	and
O	well
O	deserve
O	all
O	the
O	favors
O	he
O	had
O	already
O	conferred
O	upon

O	The
O	reader
O	may
O	please
O	to
O	observe
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	last
O	article
O	for
O	the
O	recovery
O	of
O	my
O	liberty
O	,
O	the
O	emperor
O	stipulates
O	to
O	allow
O	me
O	a
O	quantity
O	of
O	meat
O	and
O	drink
O	sufficient
O	for
O	the
O	support
O	of
O	1724
O	Lilliputians
O	.
O	Some
O	time
O	after
O	,
O	asking
O	a
O	friend
O	at
O	court
O	how
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	fix
O	on
O	that
O	determinate
O	number;
O	he
O	told
O	me
O	that
O	his
O	Majesty
O	'
O	s
O	mathematicians
O	,
O	having
O	taken
O	the
O	height
O	of
O	my
O	body
O	by
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	a
O	quadrant
O	,
O	and
O	finding
O	it
O	to
O	exceed
O	theirs
O	in
O	the
O	proportion
O	of
O	twelve
O	to
O	one
O	,
O	they
O	concluded
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	similarity
O	of
O	their
O	bodies
O	,
O	that
O	mine
O	must
O	contain
O	,
O	at
O	least
O	,
O	1724
O	of
O	theirs
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	consequently
O	,
O	would
O	require
O	as
O	much
O	food
O	as
O	was
O	necessary
O	to
O	support
O	that
O	number
O	of
O	Lilliputians
O	.
O	By
O	which
O	,
O	the
O	reader
O	may
O	conceive
O	an
O	idea
O	of
O	the
O	ingenuity
O	of
O	that
O	people
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	prudent
O	and
O	exact
O	economy
O	of
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	prince
O	.
