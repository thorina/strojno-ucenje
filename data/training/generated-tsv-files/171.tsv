O	THE

O	CAME
O	TO

O	'
O	S
O	COTTAGE
O	Once--it
O	may
O	be
O	some
O	hundreds
O	of
O	years
O	ago--there
O	lived
O	a
O	good
O	old
O	Fisherman
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	on
O	a
O	fine
O	summer
O	'
O	s
O	evening
O	,
O	was
O	sitting
O	before
O	the
O	door
O	mending
O	his
O	nets
O	.
O	He
O	dwelt
O	in
O	a
O	land
O	of
O	exceeding
O	beauty
O	.
O	The
O	green
O	slope
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	built
O	his
O	hut
O	,
O	stretched
O	far
O	out
O	into
O	a
O	great
O	lake;
O	and
O	it
O	seemed
O	either
O	that
O	the
O	cape
O	,
O	enamoured
O	of
O	the
O	glassy
O	blue
O	waters
O	,
O	had
O	pressed
O	forward
O	into
O	their
O	bosom
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	the
O	lake
O	had
O	lovingly
O	folded
O	in
O	its
O	arms
O	the
O	blooming
O	promontory
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	waving
O	grass
O	and
O	flowers
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	refreshing
O	shade
O	of
O	her
O	tall
O	trees
O	.
O	Each
O	bade
O	the
O	other
O	welcome
O	,
O	and
O	increased
O	its
O	own
O	beauty
O	by
O	so
O	doing
O	.
O	This
O	lovely
O	nook
O	was
O	scarcely
O	ever
O	visited
O	by
O	mankind
O	,
O	except
O	by
O	the
O	Fisherman
O	and
O	his
O	family
O	.
O	For
O	behind
O	the
O	promontory
O	lay
O	a
O	very
O	wild
O	forest
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	beside
O	being
O	gloomy
O	and
O	pathless
O	,
O	had
O	too
O	bad
O	a
O	name
O	as
O	the
O	resort
O	of
O	wondrous
O	spirits
O	and
O	goblins
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	crossed
O	by
O	anyone
O	who
O	could
O	help
O	it
O	.
O	Yet
O	the
O	pious
O	old
O	Fisherman
O	went
O	through
O	it
O	without
O	being
O	molested
O	,
O	whenever
O	he
O	walked
O	to
O	a
O	large
O	city
O	beyond
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	to
O	dispose
O	of
O	the
O	costly
O	fish
O	that
O	he
O	caught
O	in
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	For
O	him
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	little
O	danger
O	,
O	even
O	in
O	that
O	forest;
O	for
O	his
O	thoughts
O	were
O	almost
O	all
O	thoughts
O	of
O	devotion
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	custom
O	was
O	to
O	carol
O	forth
O	to
O	Heaven
O	a
O	loud
O	and
O	heartfelt
O	hymn
O	,
O	on
O	first
O	setting
O	foot
O	within
O	the
O	treacherous
O	shades
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	sat
O	this
O	evening
O	most
O	peacefully
O	over
O	his
O	nets
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	startled
O	in
O	an
O	unwonted
O	manner
O	by
O	a
O	rustling
O	sound
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	like
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	and
O	horse;
O	and
O	the
O	noise
O	came
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	.
O	The
O	dreams
O	he
O	had
O	had
O	in
O	many
O	a
O	stormy
O	night
O	of
O	the
O	spirits
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	started
O	up
O	before
O	his
O	mind
O	,
O	particularly
O	the
O	image
O	of
O	a
O	gigantic
O	long
O	snow-white
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	kept
O	nodding
O	his
O	head
O	mysteriously
O	.
O	Nay
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	raised
O	his
O	eyes
O	and
O	looked
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	fancy
O	he
O	saw
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	thick
O	screen
O	of
O	leaves
O	,
O	the
O	nodding
O	creature
O	advance
O	toward
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	soon
O	composed
O	himself
O	,
O	recollecting
O	that
O	even
O	in
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	woods
O	nothing
O	had
O	ever
O	befallen
O	him;
O	much
O	less
O	here
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	open
O	air
O	,
O	could
O	the
O	bad
O	spirits
O	have
O	power
O	to
O	touch
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	moreover
O	repeated
O	a
O	text
O	from
O	the
O	Bible
O	aloud
O	and
O	earnestly
O	,
O	which
O	quite
O	restored
O	his
O	courage
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	almost
O	laughed
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	his
O	fancy
O	had
O	misled
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	white
O	nodding
O	man
O	suddenly
O	resolved
O	himself
O	into
O	a
O	little
O	brook
O	he
O	knew
O	of
O	old
O	,
O	which
O	gushed
O	bubbling
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	emptied
O	itself
O	into
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	rustling
O	had
O	been
O	caused
O	by
O	a
O	horseman
O	in
O	gorgeous
O	attire
O	,
O	who
O	now
O	came
O	forward
O	toward
O	the
O	hut
O	from
O	beneath
O	the
O	trees
O	.
O	He
O	wore
O	a
O	scarlet
O	mantle
O	over
O	his
O	purple
O	,
O	gold-embroidered
O	jerkin;
O	a
O	plume
O	of
O	red
O	and
O	purple
O	feathers
O	waved
O	over
O	his
O	gold-coloured
O	barret-cap;
O	and
O	from
O	his
O	golden
O	belt
O	hung
O	a
O	glittering
O	jewelled
O	sword
O	.
O	The
O	white
O	courser
O	which
O	carried
O	him
O	was
O	of
O	lighter
O	make
O	than
O	the
O	generality
O	of
O	chargers
O	,
O	and
O	trod
O	so
O	airily
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	enamelled

O	seemed
O	scarcely
O	to
O	bend
O	under

O	The

O	Fisherman
O	could
O	not

O	shake
O	off

O	interrupted

O	He
O	began
O	as
O	follows:
O	""""
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	some
O	fifteen
O	years
O	ago
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	carrying
O	my
O	fish
O	through
O	that
O	dreary
O	wood
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	My
O	wife
O	stayed
O	at
O	home
O	,
O	as
O	usual;
O	and
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	good
O	and
O	pretty
O	reason
O	for
O	it--the
O	Lord
O	had
O	bestowed
O	upon
O	us
O	(
O	old
O	as
O	we
O	already
O	were
O	)
O	a
O	lovely
O	babe
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	girl;
O	and
O	so
O	anxious
O	were
O	we
O	to
O	do
O	our
O	best
O	for
O	the
O	little
O	treasure
O	,
O	that
O	we
O	began
O	to
O	talk
O	of
O	leaving
O	our
O	beautiful
O	home
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	give
O	our
O	darling
O	a
O	good
O	education
O	among
O	other
O	human
O	beings
O	.
O	With
O	us
O	poor
O	folks
O	,
O	wishing
O	is
O	one
O	thing
O	,
O	and
O	doing
O	is
O	quite
O	another
O	,
O	Sir
O	Knight;
O	but
O	what
O	then
O	?
O	we
O	can
O	only
O	try
O	our
O	best
O	.
O	Well
O	then
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	plodded
O	on
O	,
O	I
O	turned
O	over
O	the
O	scheme
O	in
O	my
O	head
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	loath
O	to
O	leave
O	our
O	own
O	dear
O	nook
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	made
O	me
O	shudder
O	to
O	think
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	din
O	and
O	brawls
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	,

O	in
O	some
O	place
O	nearly
O	as
O	bad

O	'
O	Yet
O	I
O	never
O	murmured
O	against
O	our
O	good
O	God
O	,
O	but
O	rather
O	thanked
O	Him
O	in
O	secret
O	for
O	His
O	last
O	blessing;

O	clothes
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	priest

O	warmed
O	toward
O	her;

O	what
O	with
O	coaxing
O	and
O	wilfulness
O	,

O	--OF
O	WHAT
O	HAD
O	BEFALLEN
O	THE
O	KNIGHT
O	IN
O	THE
O	FOREST
O	""""
O	About
O	eight
O	days
O	ago
O	,
O	I
O	rode
O	into
O	the
O	imperial
O	city
O	beyond
O	this
O	forest
O	.
O	A
O	grand
O	tournament
O	and
O	tilting
O	was
O	held
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	spared
O	neither
O	lance
O	nor
O	steed
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	stood
O	still
O	a
O	moment
O	to
O	rest
O	myself
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	pause
O	of
O	the
O	noble
O	game
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	just
O	given
O	my
O	helmet
O	in
O	charge
O	to
O	a
O	squire
O	,
O	my
O	eye
O	fell
O	upon
O	a
O	most
O	beautiful
O	woman
O	,
O	who
O	stood
O	,
O	richly
O	adorned
O	,
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	galleries
O	,
O	looking
O	on
O	.
O	I
O	inquired
O	her
O	name
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	that
O	this
O	charming
O	lady
O	was
O	Bertalda
O	,
O	the
O	adopted
O	daughter
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	principal
O	lords
O	in
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	.
O	I
O	observed
O	that
O	her
O	eye
O	was
O	upon
O	me
O	too
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	is
O	the
O	way
O	with
O	us
O	young
O	knights
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	slack
O	before
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	now
O	fought
O	more
O	bravely
O	still
O	.
O	That
O	evening
O	I
O	was
O	Bertalda
O	'
O	s
O	partner
O	in
O	the
O	dance
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	I
O	was

O	during
O	the
O	jousting
O	.

O	light
O	wakened
O	the
O	young
O	people;
O	and
O	Huldbrand
O	lay
O	musing
O	silently
O	.
O	As
O	often
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	dropped
O	asleep
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	scared
O	by
O	horrible
O	dreams
O	of
O	spectres
O	who
O	suddenly
O	took
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	fair
O	women
O	,
O	or
O	of
O	fair
O	women
O	who
O	were
O	transformed
O	into
O	dragons
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	started
O	up
O	from
O	these
O	grim
O	visions
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	pale
O	,
O	cold
O	moonlight
O	streaming
O	in
O	at
O	the
O	window
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	turn
O	an
O	anxious
O	look
O	toward
O	Undine;
O	she
O	lay
O	slumbering
O	in
O	undisturbed
O	beauty
O	and
O	peace
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	would
O	compose
O	himself
O	to
O	sleep
O	again--soon
O	again
O	to
O	wake
O	in
O	terror
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	looked
O	back
O	upon
O	all
O	this
O	in
O	broad
O	daylight
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	angry
O	with
O	himself
O	for
O	having
O	let
O	a
O	suspicion
O	,
O	a
O	shade
O	of
O	distrust
O	of
O	his
O	beautiful
O	wife
O	,
O	enter
O	his
O	mind
O	.
O	He
O	frankly
O	confessed
O	to
O	her
O	this
O	injustice;
O	she
O	answered
O	him
O	only
O	by
O	pressing
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	sighing
O	from
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	her
O	heart
O	.
O	But
O	a
O	look
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	her
O	eyes
O	had
O	never
O	before
O	given
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	deepest
O	and
O	most
O	confiding
O	tenderness
O	,
O	left
O	him
O	no
O	doubt
O	that
O	she
O	forgave
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	arose
O	cheerfully
O	,
O	and
O	joined
O	the
O	family
O	in
O	the
O	sitting-room
O	.
O	The
O	three
O	others
O	were
O	gathered
O	round
O	the
O	hearth
O	looking
O	uneasy
O	,
O	and
O	neither

O	yet
O	.
O	The
O	Priest
O	seemed
O	to

O	for

O	from
O	evil
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the

O	appeared
O	,
O	beaming
O	with

O	,
O	the

O	ventured
O	upon

O	.
O	Meanwhile

O	not
O	help
O	rising
O	to

O	her
O	,
O	and
O	stood
O	still
O	,
O	astonished;
O	the
O	young

O	was
O	the

O	,
O	yet
O	so

O	.
O	The

O	was
O	the

O	,
O	the

O	sank
O	on
O	her
O	knees
O	,
O	trembling
O	with
O	pious
O	awe
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	meek
O	and
O	humble
O	words
O	,
O	she
O	begged
O	him
O	to
O	forgive
O	the

O	,
O	to
O	pray
O	for
O	the
O	salvation
O	of
O	her
O	soul
O	.
O	Then
O	rising
O	,
O	she
O	kissed

O	All

O	pleasant;
O	through
O	the
O	foliage
O	gleamed
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	many
O	a
O	lamp
O	from
O	the

O	and
O	the

O	was
O	soothed
O	by
O	the

O	of
O	children
O	at
O	play
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	sauntering
O	groups
O	like
O	themselves;
O	they
O	enjoyed
O	at
O	once
O	the
O	pleasure
O	of
O	solitude
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	social
O	happiness
O	of
O	being
O	near
O	the
O	cheerful
O	haunts
O	of
O	men
O	.
O	Every
O	little
O	difficulty
O	that
O	had
O	occurred
O	to
O	their
O	favourite
O	plan
O	,
O	seemed
O	to
O	vanish
O	upon
O	nearer

O	,

O	the

O	fixed

O	so
O	earnestly

O	neither

O	In
O	those

O	it
O	bore
O	that
O	name
O	among
O	the
O	countrymen
O	,
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	deep
O	gloom
O	shed
O	over
O	it
O	by
O	many
O	high
O	trees
O	,
O	mostly
O	pines
O	.
O	Even
O	the
O	brook
O	which
O	gushed
O	down
O	between
O	the
O	cliffs
O	was
O	tinged
O	with
O	black
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	sparkled
O	like
O	the
O	merry
O	streams
O	from

O	looked

O	rocks

O	The
O	Knight
O	spurred
O	his
O	horse
O	along
O	its
O	banks
O	,
O	now
O	fearing
O	to
O	lose
O	ground
O	in
O	his
O	pursuit
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	again
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	overlook
O	the
O	fugitive
O	in
O	her
O	hiding-place
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	hurried
O	past
O	too
O	swiftly
O	.
O	He
O	presently
O	found
O	himself
O	far
O	advanced
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	and
O	hoped
O	he
O	must
O	soon
O	overtake
O	her
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	but
O	in
O	the
O	right
O	track
O	.
O	Then
O	again
O	,
O	the
O	thought
O	that
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	a
O	wrong
O	one
O	roused
O	the
O	keenest
O	anxiety

O	the

O	far
O	off

O	The

O	certain
O	yet
O	that
O	his
O	lost
O	darling
O	was
O	really
O	dead
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	if

O	cold
O	in

O	Danube
O	,
O	or
O	floating
O	down
O	its
O	stream
O	to
O	the
O	distant
O	ocean
O	,
O	then
O	Bertalda
O	ought
O	to
O	reproach
O	herself
O	for
O	her
O	death
O	,
O	and
O	it

O	became
O	her
O	to
O	take
O	the

O	of
O	her
O	poor
O	victim
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	the
O	Fisherman
O	was
O	very

O	was
O	now

O	did
O	yield
O	his
O	consent
O	at

O	he
O	remained
O	peaceably
O	at
O	the

O	an

O	the

O	step
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	when
O	the

O	had
O	all
O	fallen
O	back
O	,

O	,
O	and
O	now
O	slackened
O	her
O	pace
O	to
O	the
O	very
O	slowest
O	measure
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the

O	meekly

O	resting-place
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	veiled
O	form
O	gently
O	shook
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	extended
O	her
O	hands
O	in
O	humble
O	entreaty;
O	this
O	gesture
O	reminded
O	Bertalda
O	of
O	poor
O	Undine
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	gave
O	her
O	the
O	coral

O	on
O	the
O	Danube
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	could
O	not

O	.
O	Father
O	Heilmann
O	enjoined
O	silence;

O	had
O	begun
O	to

O	were
O	about

O	knelt
O	down
O	in
O	silence
O	,

O	knelt
O	,
O	a
O	bright
O	silvery
O	brook
O	now
O	gushed
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	turf
O	,
O	and
O	flowed
O	round
O	the
O	Knight
O	'
O	s
O	tomb
O	,
O	till
O	it
O	had
O	almost
O	wholly
O	encircled
O	it;
O	then
O	it
O	ran
O	further
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	emptied
O	itself
O	into
O	a
O	shady
O	pool
O	which
O	bounded
O	one
O	side
O	of

O	.
O	From
