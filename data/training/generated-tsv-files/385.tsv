O	While
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	was
O	busied
O	in
O	these
O	wars
O	,
O	King
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	of
O	Galicia
O	took
O	by
O	force
O	from
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	his
O	sister
O	a
O	great
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	lands
O	which
O	the
O	king
O	their
O	father
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	.
O	When
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	heard
O	what
O	his
O	brother
O	had
O	done
O	he
O	was
O	well
O	pleased
O	thereat
O	,
O	thinking
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	now
O	bring
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	which
O	he
O	so
O	greatly
O	desired;
O	and
O	he
O	assembled
O	together
O	his
O	Ricos-omes
O	[:
O	Noblemen
O	,
O	grandees
O	.
O	]
O	and
O	his
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	unto
O	them
O	,
O	The
O	king
O	my
O	father
O	divided
O	the
O	kingdoms
O	which
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	mine
O	,
O	and
O	therein
O	he
O	did
O	unjustly;
O	now
O	King
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	my
O	brother
O	hath
O	broken
O	the
O	oath
O	and
O	disherited
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	my
O	sister;
O	I
O	beseech
O	ye
O	therefore
O	counsel
O	me
O	what
O	I
O	shall
O	do
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	what
O	manner
O	to
O	proceed
O	against
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	will
O	take
O	his
O	kingdom
O	away
O	from
O	him
O	.
O	Upon
O	this
O	Count
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	Ordonez
O	arose
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	There
O	is
O	not
O	a
O	man
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	who
O	would
O	counsel
O	you
O	to
O	break
O	the
O	command
O	of
O	your
O	father
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	vow
O	which
O	you
O	made
O	unto
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	greatly
O	incensed
O	at
O	him
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Go
O	from
O	before
O	me
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	shall
O	never
O	receive
O	good
O	counsel
O	from
O	thee
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	then
O	took
O	the
O	Cid
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	apart
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	Thou
O	well
O	knowest
O	,
O	my
O	Cid
O	,
O	that
O	when
O	the
O	king
O	my
O	father
O	commended
O	thee
O	unto
O	me
O	,
O	he
O	charged
O	me
O	upon
O	pain
O	of
O	his
O	curse
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	take
O	you
O	for
O	my
O	adviser
O	,
O	and
O	whatever
O	I
O	did
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	do
O	it
O	with
O	your
O	counsel
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	have
O	done
O	so
O	even
O	until
O	this
O	day;
O	and
O	thou
O	hast
O	always
O	counselled
O	me
O	for
O	the
O	best
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	this
O	I
O	have
O	given
O	thee
O	a
O	county
O	in
O	my
O	kingdom
O	,
O	holding
O	it
O	well
O	bestowed
O	.
O	Now
O	then
O	I
O	beseech
O	you
O	advise
O	me
O	how
O	best
O	to
O	recover
O	these
O	kingdoms
O	,
O	for
O	if
O	I
O	have
O	not
O	counsel
O	from
O	you
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	expect
O	to
O	have
O	it
O	from
O	any
O	man
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	Greatly
O	troubled
O	at
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	answered
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Ill
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	would
O	it
O	behove
O	me
O	to
O	counsel
O	you
O	that
O	you
O	should
O	go
O	against
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	your
O	father
O	.
O	You
O	well
O	know
O	that
O	when
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	divided
O	his
O	kingdoms
O	,
O	how
O	he
O	made
O	me
O	swear
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	I
O	would
O	always
O	counsel
O	his
O	sons
O	the
O	best
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	give
O	them
O	ill
O	counsel;
O	and
O	while
O	I
O	can
O	,
O	thus
O	must
O	I
O	continue
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	king
O	answered
O	,
O	My
O	Cid
O	,
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	hold
O	that
O	in
O	this
O	I
O	am
O	breaking
O	the
O	oath
O	made
O	to
O	my
O	father
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	ever
O	said
O	that
O	the
O	partition
O	should
O	not
O	be
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	oath
O	which
O	I
O	made
O	was
O	forced
O	upon
O	me
O	.
O	Now
O	King
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	my
O	brother
O	hath
O	broken
O	the
O	oath
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	these
O	kingdoms
O	by
O	right
O	are
O	mine:
O	and
O	therefore
O	I
O	will
O	that
O	you
O	counsel
O	me
O	how
O	I
O	may
O	unite
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	from
O	so
O	doing
O	there
O	is
O	nothing
O	in
O	this
O	world
O	which
O	shall
O	prevent
O	me
O	,
O	except
O	it
O	be
O	death
O	.
O	Then
O	when
O	the
O	Cid
O	saw
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	by
O	no
O	means
O	turn
O	him
O	from
O	that
O	course
O	,
O	he
O	advised
O	him
O	to
O	obtain
O	the
O	love
O	of
O	his
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	grant
O	him
O	passage
O	through
O	his
O	kingdom
O	to
O	go
O	against
O	Don
O	Garcia:
O	and
O	if
O	this
O	should
O	be
O	refused
O	he
O	counselled
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	attempt
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	saw
O	that
O	his
O	counsel
O	was
O	good
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	his
O	letters
O	to
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	beseeching
O	him
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	at
O	Sahagun
O	.
O	When
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	received
O	the
O	letters
O	he
O	marvelled
O	to
O	what
O	end
O	this
O	might
O	be:
O	howbeit
O	he
O	sent
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	meet
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	two
O	kings
O	met
O	in
O	Sahagun
O	.
O	And
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	said
O	,
O	Brother
O	,
O	you
O	well
O	know
O	that
O	King
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	our
O	brother
O	hath
O	broken
O	the
O	oath
O	made
O	unto
O	our
O	father
O	,
O	and
O	disherited
O	our
O	sister
O	Donya
O	Urraca:
O	for
O	this
O	I
O	will
O	take
O	his
O	kingdom
O	away
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	beseech
O	you
O	join
O	with
O	me
O	.
O	But
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	answered
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	go
O	against
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	oath
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	sworn
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	said
O	,
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	let
O	him
O	pass
O	through
O	his
O	kingdom
O	he
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	part
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	should
O	gain:
O	and
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	agreed
O	to
O	this
O	.
O	And
O	upon
O	this
O	matter
O	they
O	fixed
O	another
O	day
O	to
O	meet;
O	and
O	then
O	forty
O	knights
O	were
O	named
O	,
O	twenty
O	for
O	Castille
O	and
O	twenty
O	for
O	Leon
O	,
O	as
O	vouchers
O	that
O	this
O	which
O	they
O	covenanted
O	should
O	be
O	faithfully
O	fulfilled
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	gathered
O	together
O	a
O	great
O	host
O	.
O	He
O	sent
O	Alvar
O	Fanez
O	,
O	the
O	cousin
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	to
O	King
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	,
O	to
O	bid
O	him
O	yield
O	up
O	his
O	kingdom
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	he
O	refused
O	to
O	do
O	this
O	to
O	defy
O	him
O	on
O	his
O	part
O	.
O	When
O	King
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	heard
O	this
O	he
O	was
O	greatly
O	troubled
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	Alvar
O	Fanez
O	,
O	Say
O	to
O	my
O	brother
O	that
O	I
O	beseech
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	break
O	the
O	oath
O	which
O	he
O	made
O	to
O	our
O	father;
O	but
O	if
O	he
O	will
O	persist
O	to
O	do
O	this
O	thing
O	I
O	must
O	defend
O	myself
O	as
O	I
O	can
O	.
O	He
O	called
O	his
O	chief
O	captains
O	together
O	and
O	they
O	advised
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	recall
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	Frojaz
O	,
O	for
O	having
O	him
O	the
O	realm
O	would
O	be
O	secure
O	,
O	and
O	without
O	him
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	danger
O	to
O	be
O	lost
O	.
O	So
O	two
O	hidalgos
O	[:
O	A
O	man
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
O	lower
O	nobility
O	,
O	a
O	gentleman
O	by
O	birth]
O	were
O	sent
O	after
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	found
O	him
O	in
O	Navarre
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	eve
O	of
O	passing
O	into
O	France
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	letters
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	the
O	peril
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	then
O	stood
O	,
O	setting
O	aside
O	the
O	remembrance
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	wrongs
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	good
O	and
O	true
O	Portuguese
O	,
O	he
O	turned
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	In
O	good
O	time
O	did
O	he
O	arrive
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	captains
O	of
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	had
O	now
O	gained
O	many
O	lands
O	in
O	Galicia
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	province
O	of
O	Beira
O	,
O	finding
O	none
O	to
O	resist
O	them
O	.
O	When
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	heard
O	this
O	and
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	Castillians
O	were
O	approaching
O	he
O	promised
O	the
O	king
O	either
O	to
O	maintain
O	his
O	cause
O	,
O	or
O	die
O	for
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	ordered
O	the
O	trumpets
O	to
O	be
O	sounded
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Portugueze
O	sallied
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	little
O	below
O	the
O	city
O	the
O	two
O	squadrons
O	met
O	.
O	The
O	Portugueze
O	fought
O	so
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	especially
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	brothers
O	,
O	that
O	at
O	length
O	they
O	discomfited
O	the
O	Castillians
O	,
O	killing
O	of
O	them
O	five
O	hundred
O	and
O	forty
O	,
O	of
O	whom
O	three
O	hundred
O	were
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	winning
O	their
O	pennons
O	and
O	banners
O	.
O	Howbeit
O	this
O	victory
O	was
O	not
O	obtained
O	without
O	great
O	loss
O	to
O	themselves;
O	for
O	two
O	hundred
O	and
O	twenty
O	of
O	their
O	people
O	were
O	left
O	upon
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	were
O	sorely
O	wounded
O	,
O	among
O	whom
O	,
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	peril
O	of
O	his
O	life
O	,
O	was
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	Frojaz
O	,
O	being
O	wounded
O	with
O	many
O	and
O	grievous
O	wounds
O	.
