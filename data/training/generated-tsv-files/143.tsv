O	Once

O	a
O	young
O	husband
O	and

O	named
O	Giles
O	and
O	Phyllida
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	cottage
O	in
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	plain
O	.
O	League
O	upon
O	league
O	,
O	the
O	rich
O	land
O	fell
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	west
O	,
O	there
O	to
O	end
O	at
O	a
O	wall
O	of
O	high
O	mountains
O	into
O	whose
O	fastnesses
O	no
O	one
O	had
O	ever
O	ventured
O	.
O	Yet
O	the
O	mountains
O	were
O	very
O	beautiful
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	cold
O	of
O	a
O	clear
O	winter
O	'
O	s
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	snowy
O	summits
O	and
O	rust-colored
O	pinnacles
O	shone
O	bright
O	and
O	near
O	at
O	hand;
O	in
O	the
O	spring
O	,
O	fogs
O	hid
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	like
O	gray
O	mantles
O	upon
O	the
O	lower
O	slopes
O	.
O	Midway
O	in
O	the
O	mountain
O	wall
O	,
O	a
O	wide
O	chasm
O	marked
O	the
O	entrance
O	to
O	a
O	deep
O	,
O	gloomy
O	valley
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	which
O	a
O	roaring
O	mountain
O	torrent
O	hurried
O	,
O	to
O	lose
O	itself
O	in
O	the
O	plain
O	below
O	.
O	And
O	because
O	somewhere
O	in
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	this
O	dark
O	valley
O	storms
O	were
O	brewed
O	,
O	whose
O	dark
O	clouds
O	,
O	laden
O	with
O	lightning
O	and
O	hail
O	,
O	poured
O	from
O	between
O	the
O	crags
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	out
O	over
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	this
O	valley
O	was
O	known
O	as
O	the
O	Valley
O	of
O	Thunder
O	.
O	According
O	to
O	an
O	old
O	legend
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	this
O	valley
O	a
O	king
O	should
O	one
O	day
O	come
O	to
O	rule
O	over
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	plain
O	.
O	Giles
O	and
O	Phyllida
O	kept
O	house
O	by
O	themselves
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	two
O	cows
O	,
O	one
O	red
O	and
O	white
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	black

O	white
O	,
O	a
O	flock
O	of
O	hens
O	,
O	some
O	hives

O	bees
O	,
O	a
O	white
O	horse
O	,
O	a
O	dog
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	cat
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	long
O	Phyllida
O	worked
O	happily
O	at
O	the
O	household
O	tasks
O	,
O	baking
O	the
O	sweet
O	white
O	bread
O	and
O	marking
O	the
O	fresh
O	golden
O	butter
O	into
O	square
O	pats
O	,
O	while
O	Giles
O	went
O	out
O	to
O	work
O	in
O	the
O	waving
O	grain;
O	and
O	Phyllida
O	,
O	watching
O	from
O	a
O	window
O	,
O	would
O	see
O	the
O	sun

O	on
O	the
O	uplifted
O	blade
O	of
O	her
O	husband
O	'
O	s
O	scythe
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	Phyllida
O	said
O	to
O	Giles:--
O	""""
O	I
O	have
O	made
O	a

O	cousins
O	,
O	Jack

O	Jill
O	,
O	and
O	this

O	I
O	shall
O	saddle
O	the
O	white
O	horse
O	and
O	ride
O	over
O	to
O	their
O	cottage
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	I
O	may
O	stay
O	with
O	them
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	.
O	You
O	will
O	find
O	a
O	fresh
O	baking
O	of
O	bread
O	and
O	a
O	meat-pie
O	in
O	the
O	larder
O	.
O	Good-bye

O	Giles;
O	I
O	'
O	ll
O	soon

O	.
O	""""
O	So
O	Giles
O	answered
O	,

O	Good-bye

O	""""
O	and
O	away
O	rode
O	Phyllida
O	on
O	the

O	horse
O	.
O	A
O	few
O	days
O	passed
O	,
O	and
O	Giles
O	,
O	wandering
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	through
O	the
O	quiet
O	house
O	,
O	felt
O	very
O	lonely
O	indeed
O	.
O	Finally
O	he
O	could
O	stand
O	it
O	no
O	longer
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	himself

O	So
O	he
O	turned
O	all
O	the

O	loose
O	in
O	the
O	fields

O	and
O	putting
O	a
O	few

O	of
O	bread
O	and
O	cheese
O	in
O	his
O	pockets

O	set

O	Leagues

O	rising
O	palely
O	through
O	the
O	haze
O	of
O	the
O	midsummer

O	.
O	A
O	pale
O	violet
O	light
O	fell
O	on
O	their

O	,
O	and
O	the
O	snow

O	their
O	sides

O	of
O	the

O	white
O	.
O	Gusts
O	of
O	wind
O	hurrying
O	from
O	the
O	distant
O	summits
O	swept
O	the
O	great

O	the

O	of
O	ripening
O	wheat
O	bent

O	Suddenly
O	,
O	down
O	the
O	throat

O	the
O	Thunder
O	Valley

O	from
O	far
O	away
O	came
O	a
O	low
O	murmur
O	of
O	thunder
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	faster
O	and
O	faster
O	,
O	a
O	storm
O	poured
O	down
O	the
O	chasm
O	like
O	a
O	flood
O	,
O	drowning
O	out
O	the
O	light

O	pale
O	underside
O	of
O	the
O	leaves
O	of
O	the

O	.
O	A
O	darkness
O	as
O	of
O	night
O	itself
O	covered
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	Rain
O	began
O	to
O	fall
O	in
O	great
O	spattering
O	drops
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	glare
O	of
O	the
O	lightning
O	,
O	Giles
O	would
O	see
O	the
O	endless
O	fields
O	,
O	drenched
O	and
O	waving
O	in
O	the
O	rain;
O	now
O	the
O	Thunder
O	Valley

O	,
O	and

O	.
O	Night

O	on
O	amid
O	the
O	storm
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	flash
O	of
O	lightning
O	revealed
O	to
O	Giles
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	lost
O	his
O	way
O	.
O	Hoping
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	shelter
O	or
O	some
O	friendly
O	cottage
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	plunged
O	on;
O	but
O	the
O	road
O	became
O	worse
O	and
O	worse
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	again
O	and
O	again
O	forced
O	to
O	wade
O	brooks
O	flooded
O	by
O	the
O	tempest
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	his
O	steps
O	led
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	pine
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	in
O	the
O	thickest
O	part
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	little
O	shelter
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	woke
O	,
O	numb
O	,
O	cramped
O	,
O	and
O	cold
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	to
O	his
O	horror
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	and
O	darkness
O	he
O	had
O	blundered
O	on
O	into
O	the
O	Valley
O	of
O	Thunder
O	,
O	into
O	which
O	no
O	living
O	soul
O	had
O	ever
O	before
O	advanced
O	.
O	Worst
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	the
O	way
O	by
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	entered
O	,
O	for
O	high
O	crags
O	rose
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	and
O	held
O	him
O	prisoner
O	.
O	Presently
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	amazement
O	,
O	he
O	beheld
O	a
O	narrow
O	flight
O	of
O	steps
O	cut
O	in
O	the
O	solid
O	rock
O	of
O	the
O	mountainside
O	.
O	Up
O	these
O	steps
O	climbed
O	Giles
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	mounted
O	higher
O	,
O	the
O	stairs
O	began
O	to
O	twist
O	and
O	turn
O	amid
O	the
O	crags
O	and
O	pinnacles
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	'
O	s
O	ascent
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	at
O	a
O	turn
O	from
O	which
O	the
O	Thunder
O	Valley
O	,
O	the
O	chasm
O	through
O	which
O	it
O	opened
O	into
O	the
O	plain
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wide
O	plain
O	itself
O	,
O	could
O	all
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	Giles
O	lingered
O	there
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	trying
O	to
O	see
O	his
O	own
O	cottage
O	,
O	or
O	perhaps
O	Phyllida
O	on
O	her
O	white
O	horse;
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	neither
O	one
O	nor
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	climb
O	again
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	long
O	he
O	climbed
O	and
O	climbed
O	and
O	climbed
O	.
O	Twilight
O	fell
O	.
O	The
O	circle
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	dropped
O	below
O	the
O	level
O	horizon
O	of
O	the
O	distant
O	fields
O	.
O	One
O	still
O	golden
O	star
O	hung
O	on
O	the
O	fringe
O	of
O	the
O	sun-glow
O	.
O	The
O	stairs
O	began
O	to
O	widen
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	Giles
O	found
O	himself
O	at
O	the
O	summit
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	.
O	Before
O	his
O	eyes
O	lay
O	a
O	little
O	level
O	field
O	surrounded
O	by
O	strange
O	crags
O	and
O	pinnacles
O	,
O	looming
O	tall
O	and
O	black
O	against
O	the
O	fast-appearing
O	stars
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	Giles
O	rubbed
O	his
O	eyes
O	in
O	wonder
O	,
O	lights
O	shone
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	in
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	towering
O	rocks
O	,
O	even
O	as
O	lights
O	shine
O	in
O	the
O	windows
O	of
O	a
O	village
O	when
O	you
O	see
O	it
O	from
O	afar
O	.
O	Giles
O	rubbed
O	his
O	eyes
O	again
O	.
O	Lights
O	?
O	What
O	could
O	they
O	mean
O	?
O	Presently
O	a
O	great
O	door
O	,
O	cut
O	in
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	a
O	towering
O	mass
O	of
O	stone
O	,
O	opened
O	with
O	a
O	burst
O	of
O	light
O	,
O	and
O	toward
O	Giles
O	there
O	hurried
O	the
O	two
O	strangest
O	creatures
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	seen
O	.
O	These
O	were
O	two
O	elves
O	,
O	alike
O	as
O	two
O	peas
O	and
O	each
O	about
O	three
O	feet
O	tall
O	.
O	Instead
O	of
O	having
O	ears
O	much
O	like
O	other
O	elves
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	first
O	one
O	had
O	ears
O	like
O	great
O	curved
O	cornucopias
O	,
O	which
O	projected
O	almost
O	a
O	foot
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	of
O	his
O	enormous
O	round
O	head
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	whose
O	ears
O	were
O	quite
O	natural
O	,
O	had
O	but
O	one
O	huge
O	eye
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	of
O	his
O	forehead
O	.
O	Without
O	saying
O	a
O	single
O	word
O	,
O	these
O	strange
O	elves
O	seized
O	Giles
O	by
O	the
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	hurrying
O	him
O	across
O	the
O	open
O	space
O	,
O	urged
O	him
O	through
O	the
O	open
O	doors
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	in
O	the
O	crags
O	.
O	Still
O	keeping
O	silence
O	,
O	the
O	elves
O	led
O	Giles
O	through
O	hundreds
O	of
O	splendid
O	rooms
O	and
O	great
O	halls
O	,
O	all
O	lighted
O	by
O	hanging
O	lamps
O	as
O	countless
O	in
O	number
O	as
O	the
O	leaves
O	upon
O	the
O	trees
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	archway
O	rose
O	before
O	them
O	,
O	through
O	which
O	appeared
O	a
O	hall
O	larger
O	and
O	brighter
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	others
O	seen
O	before
O	.
O	At
O	one
O	end
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	under
O	a
O	canopy
O	of
O	rosy-gray
O	,
O	stood
O	a
O	golden
O	throne
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	throne
O	sat
O	a
O	being

O	poor

O	folk
O	saw
O	Giles
O	coming
O	down
O	the
O	valley
O	,

O	recalled

O	a
O	king
O	should
O	come
O	to
O	them
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	and
O	hailed
O	Giles
O	as
O	their
O	king
O	.
O	Best
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	Phyllida
O	herself
O	ran
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	her
O	arms
O	about
O	her
O	husband
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	robbers
O	,
O	the
O	storm
O	had
O	overwhelmed
O	them
O	and
O	swept
O	them
O	all
O	into
O	the
O	river
O	.
O	There
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	glad
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	they
O	turned
O	into
O	little
O	fishes
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	Shepherd
O	of
O	Clouds
O	found
O	that
O	Giles
O	had
O	escaped
O	after
O	making
O	all
O	this
O	disturbance
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	angry
O	,
O	and
O	rushed
O	to
O	his
O	lightning
O	closet
O	to
O	hurl
O	some
O	thunderbolts
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	got
O	to
O	the
O	closet
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	Giles
O	had
O	used
O	every
O	single
O	bolt
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	cupboard
O	was
O	empty
O	.
O	Consequently
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	wait
O	till
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	summer
O	before
O	he
O	could
O	get
O	some
O	new
O	lightning
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	busy
O	arranging
O	the
O	autumn
O	frosts
O	that
O	he
O	quite
O	forgot
O	about
O	Giles
O	.
O	So
O	Giles
O	and
O	Phyllida
O	became
O	King
O	and
O	Queen
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	plain
O	and
O	lived
O	happily
O	ever
O	after
O	.
