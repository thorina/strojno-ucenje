O	Ages
O	and
O	ages
O	ago
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	world
O	was
O	first
O	made
O	,
O	the
O	gods
O	decided
O	to
O	build
O	a
O	beautiful
O	city
O	high
O	above
O	the
O	heavens
O	,
O	the
O	most
O	glorious
O	and
O	wonderful
O	city
O	that
O	ever
O	was
O	known
O	.
O	Asgard
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	its
O	name
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	stand
O	on
O	Ida
O	Plain
O	under
O	the
O	shade
O	of
O	Yggdrasil
O	,
O	the
O	great
O	tree
O	whose
O	roots
O	were
O	underneath
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	First
O	of
O	all
O	they
O	built
O	a
O	house
O	with
O	a
O	silver
O	roof
O	,
O	where
O	there
O	were
O	seats
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	twelve
O	chiefs
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	midst
O	,
O	and
O	high
O	above
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	wonder
O	throne
O	of
O	Odin
O	the
O	All-Father
O	,
O	whence
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	everything
O	that
O	happened
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	or
O	on
O	the
O	earth
O	or
O	in
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Next
O	they
O	made
O	a
O	fair
O	house
O	for
O	Queen
O	Frigg
O	and
O	her
O	lovely
O	daughters
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	built
O	a
O	smithy
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	great
O	hammers
O	,
O	tongs
O	,
O	anvils
O	,
O	and
O	bellows
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	gods
O	could
O	work
O	at
O	their
O	favourite
O	trade
O	,
O	the
O	making
O	of
O	beautiful
O	things
O	out
O	of
O	gold;
O	which
O	they
O	did
O	so
O	well
O	that
O	folk
O	name
O	that
O	time
O	the
O	Golden
O	Age
O	.
O	Afterward
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	more
O	leisure
O	,
O	they
O	built
O	separate
O	houses
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	AEsir
O	,
O	each
O	more
O	beautiful
O	than
O	the
O	preceding
O	,
O	for
O	of
O	course
O	they
O	were
O	continually
O	growing
O	more
O	skilful
O	.
O	They
O	saved
O	Father
O	Odin
O	'
O	s
O	palace
O	until
O	the
O	last
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	meant
O	this
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	largest
O	and
O	the
O	most
O	splendid
O	of
O	all
O	.
O	Gladsheim
O	,
O	the
O	home
O	of
O	joy
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Odin
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	built
O	all
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	set
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	a
O	wood
O	whereof
O	the
O	trees
O	had
O	leaves
O	of
O	ruddy
O	gold--like
O	an
O	autumn-gilded
O	forest
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	safety
O	of
O	All-Father
O	it
O	was
O	surrounded
O	by
O	a
O	roaring
O	river
O	and
O	by
O	a
O	high
O	picket
O	fence;
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	courtyard
O	within
O	.
O	The
O	glory
O	of
O	Gladsheim
O	was
O	its
O	wondrous
O	hall
O	,
O	radiant
O	with
O	gold
O	,
O	the
O	most
O	lovely
O	room
O	that
O	time
O	has
O	ever
O	seen
O	.
O	Valhalla
O	,
O	the
O	Hall
O	of
O	Heroes
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	roofed
O	with
O	the
O	mighty
O	shields
O	of
O	warriors
O	.
O	The
O	ceiling
O	was
O	made
O	of
O	interlacing
O	spears
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	portal
O	at
O	the
O	west
O	end
O	before
O	which
O	hung
O	a
O	great
O	gray
O	wolf
O	,
O	while
O	over
O	him
O	a
O	fierce
O	eagle
O	hovered
O	.
O	The
O	hall
O	was
O	so
O	huge
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	540
O	gates
O	,
O	through
O	each
O	of
O	which
O	800
O	men
O	could
O	march
O	abreast
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	there
O	needed
O	to
O	be
O	room
O	,
O	for
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	hall
O	where
O	every
O	morning
O	Odin
O	received
O	all
O	the
O	brave
O	warriors
O	who
O	had
O	died
O	in
O	battle
O	on
O	the
O	earth
O	below;
O	and
O	there
O	were
O	many
O	heroes
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	the
O	reward
O	which
O	the
O	gods
O	gave
O	to
O	courage
O	.
O	When
O	a
O	hero
O	had
O	gloriously
O	lost
O	his
O	life
O	,
O	the
O	Valkyries
O	,
O	the
O	nine
O	warrior
O	daughters
O	of
O	Odin
O	,
O	brought
O	his
O	body
O	up
O	to
O	Valhalla
O	on
O	their
O	white
O	horses
O	that
O	gallop
O	the
O	clouds
O	.
O	There
O	they
O	lived
O	forever
O	after
O	in
O	happiness
O	,
O	enjoying
O	the
O	things
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	most
O	loved
O	upon
O	earth
O	.
O	Every
O	morning
O	they
O	armed
O	themselves
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	to
O	fight
O	with
O	one
O	another
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	courtyard
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	wondrous
O	game
O	,
O	wondrously
O	played
O	.
O	No
O	matter
O	how
O	often
O	a
O	hero
O	was
O	killed
O	,
O	he
O	became
O	alive
O	again
O	in
O	time
O	to
O	return
O	perfectly
O	well
O	to
O	Valhalla
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	ate
O	a

O	breakfast
O	with
O	the
O	Jisir;
O	while
O	the
O	beautiful
O	Valkyries
O	who
O	had
O	first
O	brought
O	him
O	thither
O	waited
O	at

O	poured
O	the
O	blessed
O	mead
O	,
O	which
O	only

O	A

O	it
O	was
O	for
O	the
O	heroes
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	happy
O	life
O	for
O	all
O	who
O	dwelt
O	in
O	Asgard;
O	for
O	this
O	was
O	before
O	trouble
O	had
O	come
O	among
O	the
O	gods
O	,
O	following
O	the
O	mischief
O	of
O	Loki
O	.
O	This
O	is
O	how
O	the
O	trouble
O	began
O	.
O	From
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	time
O	,
O	the
O	giants
O	had
O	been
O	unfriendly
O	to
O	the
O	AEsir
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	giants
O	were
O	older
O	and
O	huger
O	and
O	more
O	wicked;
O	besides
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	jealous
O	because
O	the
O	good
O	AEsir
O	were
O	fast
O	gaining
O	more
O	wisdom
O	and
O	power
O	than
O	the
O	giants
O	had
O	ever
O	known
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	AEsir
O	who
O	set
O	the
O	fair
O	brother
O	and
O	sister
O	,
O	Sun
O	and
O	Moon
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	to
O	give
O	light
O	to
O	men;
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	they
O	also
O	who
O	made
O	the
O	jewelled
O	stars
O	out
O	of
O	sparks
O	from
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	fire
O	.
O	The
O	giants
O	hated
O	the
O	AEsir
O	,
O	and
O	tried
O	all
O	in
O	their
O	power
O	to
O	injure
O	them
O	and
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	below
O	,
O	whom
O	the
O	AEsir
O	loved
O	and
O	cared
O	for
O	.
O	The
O	gods
O	had
O	already
O	built
O	a
O	wall
O	around
O	Midgard
O	,
O	the
O	world
O	of
O	men
O	,
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	giants
O	out;
O	built
O	it
O	of
O	the
O	bushy
O	eyebrows
O	of
O	Ymir
O	,
O	the
O	oldest
O	and
O	hugest
O	of
O	giants
O	.
O	Between
O	Asgard
O	and
O	the

O	flowed
O	Ifing
O	,

O	Their
