O	me
O	,
O	then
O	will
O	we
O	be
O	your

O	but
O	if
O	I
O	prevail

O	And

O	,
O	they

O	Now
O	David
O	was
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	that
O	Ephrathite
O	of
O	Bethlehem-judah
O	,
O	whose

O	and
O	followed
O	Saul
O	to
O	the

O	of
O	his
O	three

O	to

O	drew
O	near
O	morning
O	and
O	evening
O	,
O	and
O	presented
O	himself
O	forty
O	days
O	.
O	And
O	Jesse
O	said
O	unto
O	David
O	his
O	son
O	,
O	Take
O	now
O	for
O	thy
O	brethren
O	an

O	how
O	thy
O	brethren
O	fare
O	,
O	and
O	take
O	their
O	pledge
O	.
O	Now
O	Saul
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Israel
O	,
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	of
O	Elah
O	,
O	fighting
O	with
O	the

O	.
O	And
O	David
O	rose
O	up
O	early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	sheep
O	with
O	a
O	keeper
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	,
O	as
O	Jesse
O	had
O	commanded
O	him;
O	and
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	trench
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	host
O	was
O	going
O	forth
O	to
O	the
O	fight
O	,
O	and
O	shouted

O	.
O	For

O	had
O	put
O	the

O	And
O	David
O	left
O	his

O	,
O	when

O	,
O	fled
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	sore
O	afraid
O	.
O	And
O	the

O	And
O	David

O	,
O	that

O	?
O	And
O	the
O	people
O	answered
O	him
O	after
O	this

O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	So

O	And
O	Eliab
O	his

O	heard
O	when
O	he
O	spake
O	unto
O	the

O	and
O	Eliab
O	'
O	s
O	anger
O	was
O	kindled
O	against
O	David
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	Why

O	thou
O	down
O	hither
O	?
O	and
O	with
O	whom
O	hast
O	thou
O	left
O	those

O	I
O	now
O	done
O	?
O	Is
O	there
O	not
O	a

O	?
O	And
O	he
O	turned
O	from
O	him
O	toward
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	spake
O	after

O	but
O	a
O	youth
O	,
O	and
O	ruddy
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	a
O	fair
O	countenance
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Philistine
O	said
O	unto
O	David
O	,
O	Am
O	I
O	a
O	dog
O	,
O	that
O	thou
O	comest
O	to
O	me
O	with
O	staves
O	?
O	And
O	the
O	Philistine
O	cursed
O	David
O	by
O	his
O	gods
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Philistine
O	said
O	to
O	David
O	,
O	Come
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	thy
O	flesh
O	unto
O	the
O	fowls
O	of
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	the
O	beasts
O	of
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	David
O	to
O	the
O	Philistine
O	,
O	Thou
O	comest
O	to
O	me
O	with
O	a
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	spear
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	shield:
O	but
O	I
O	come
O	to
O	thee
O	in
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	Lord
O	of
O	hosts
O	,
O	the
O	God
O	of
O	the
O	armies
O	of
O	Israel
O	,
O	whom
O	thou
O	hast
O	defied
O	.
O	This
O	day
O	will
O	the
O	Lord
O	deliver
O	thee
O	into
O	mine
O	hand;
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	smite
O	thee
O	,
O	and
O	take
O	thine
O	head
O	from
O	thee;
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	the
O	carcasses
O	of
O	the
O	host
O	of
O	the
O	Philistines
O	this
O	day
O	unto
O	the
O	fowls
O	of
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	of
O	the
O	earth;
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	earth
O	may
O	know
O	that
O	there
O	is
O	a
O	God
O	in
O	Israel
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	this
O	assembly
O	shall
O	know
O	that
O	the
O	Lord
O	saveth
O	not
O	with
O	sword
O	and
O	spear:
O	for
O	the
O	battle
O	is
O	the
O	Lord
O	'
O	s
O	and
O	He
O	will
O	give
O	you
O	into
O	our
O	hands
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	Philistine
O	arose
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	and
O	drew
O	nigh
O	to
O	meet
O	David
O	,
O	that
O	David
O	hasted
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	toward
O	the
O	army
O	to
O	meet
O	the
O	Philistine
O	.
O	And
O	David
O	put
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	his
O	bag
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	thence
O	a
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	slang
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	smote
O	the
O	Philistine
O	in
O	his
O	forehead
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	stone
O	sunk
O	into
O	his
O	forehead;
O	and
O	he
O	fell
O	upon
O	his
O	face
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	So
O	David
O	prevailed
O	over
O	the
O	Philistine
O	with
O	a
O	sling
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	smote
O	the
O	Philistine
O	,
O	and
O	slew
O	him;
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	sword
O	in
O	the
O	hand
O	of
O	David
O	.
O	Therefore
O	David
O	ran
O	,
O	and
O	stood
O	upon
O	the
O	Philistine
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	it
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	sheath
O	thereof
O	,
O	and
O	slew
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	head
O	therewith
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	Philistines
O	saw
O	their
O	champion
O	was
O	dead
O	,
O	they
O	fled
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Israel
O	and
O	of
O	Judah
O	arose
O	,
O	and
O	shouted
O	,
O	and
O	pursued
O	the
O	Philistines
O	,
O	until
O	thou
O	comest
O	to
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	Ekron
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	wounded
O	of
O	the
O	Philistines
O	fell
O	down
O	by
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	Shaaraim
O	,
O	even
O	unto
O	Gath
O	,
O	and
O	unto
O	Ekron
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	children
O	of
O	Irsael
O	returned
O	from
O	chasing
O	after
O	the
O	Philistines
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	spoiled
O	their
O	tents
O	.
O	And
O	David
O	took
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	Philistine
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	it
O	to
O	Jerusalem;
O	but
O	he
O	put
O	his
O	armour
O	in
O	his
O	tent
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Saul
O	saw
O	David
O	go
O	forth
O	against
O	the
O	Philistine
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	unto
O	Abner
O	,
O	the
O	captain
O	of
O	the
O	host
O	,
O	Abner
O	,
O	whose
O	son
O	is
O	this
O	youth
O	?
O	And
O	Abner
O	said
O	,
O	As
O	thy
O	soul
O	liveth
O	,
O	O
O	King
O	,
O	I
O	cannot
O	tell
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	King
O	said
O	,
O	Enquire
O	thou
O	whose
O	son
O	the
O	stripling
O	is
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	David
O	returned
O	from
O	the
O	slaughter
O	of
O	the
O	Philistine
O	,
O	Abner
O	took
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	him
O	before
O	Saul
O	with
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	Philistine
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	And
O	Saul
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	Whose
O	son
O	art
O	thou
O	,
O	thou
O	young
O	man
O	?
O	And
O	David
O	answered
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	thy
O	servant
O	Jesse
O	the
O	Bethlehemite
O	.
