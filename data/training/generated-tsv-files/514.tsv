O	used
O	to
O	hunt
O	with
O	his
O	father
O	in
O	the

O	and
O	he
O	grew
O	up
O	strong
O	and
O	active
O	sure
O	and
O	swift
O	footed
O	as
O	a

O	He

O	fell
O	down
O	over
O	his

O	like
O	a

O	and
O	the

O	night
O	when

O	was
O	rattling
O	through

O	From

O	the

O	in
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	Fergus
O	for
O	a
O	change
O	of

O	one
O	day
O	he
O	told

O	that
O	he
O	was
O	resolved
O	to
O	seek
O	his

O	that
O	he
O	would
O	set

O	palace
O	and
O	try
O	to

O	About
O	a
O	week
O	afterwards
O	he
O	took
O	leave
O	of

O	and
O	having

O	led
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	the
O	High
O	King
O	of

O	He
O	arrived
O	there
O	just
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	when
O	the
O	great
O	captain
O	of
O	the
O	Fenian
O	host
O	was
O	recruiting
O	his
O	battalions
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	thinned
O	in
O	recent
O	battle
O	The
O	manly
O	figure
O	of
O	Fergus
O	his
O	gallant
O	bearing
O	and
O	handsome
O	face
O	all
O	told
O	in
O	his
O	favor
O	But
O	before
O	he
O	could
O	be
O	received
O	into
O	the
O	Fenian
O	ranks
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	prove
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	play
O	the
O	harp
O	like
O	a
O	bard
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	contend
O	with
O	staff
O	and
O	shield
O	against
O	nine
O	Fenian
O	warriors
O	that

O	could
O	run
O	with

O	hair
O	through
O	the
O	tangled
O	forest
O	without
O	loosening
O	a
O	single
O	hair
O	and
O	that
O	in
O	his
O	course
O	he
O	could
O	jump
O	over
O	trees
O	as
O	high
O	as
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	stoop
O	under
O	trees
O	as
O	low
O	as
O	his
O	knee
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	run
O	so
O	lightly
O	that
O	the
O	rotten
O	twigs
O	should
O	not
O	break
O	under
O	his
O	feet
O	Fergus
O	proved
O	equal
O	to
O	all
O	the
O	tests
O	thanks
O	to
O	the
O	wandering
O	minstrel
O	who
O	taught
O	him
O	the
O	use
O	of
O	the
O	harp
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	brave
O	heart
O	and

O	was

O	before

O	he
O	was
O	its
O	bravest
O	and
O	ablest
O	champion
O	At
O	that
O	very
O	time
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	the

O	of

O	of

O	was
O	staying

O	She
O	was
O	as
O	proud

O	The

O	in

O	From

O	and
O	Spain
O	and
O	the

O	vikings
O	in

O	from
O	the
O	emerald
O	seas
O	as
O	they
O	swept
O	towards
O	the
O	Irish
O	coasts
O	But
O	the
O	lady
O	had
O	vowed
O	she
O	would
O	wed
O	with
O	no
O	one
O	except
O	a
O	battle
O	champion
O	who
O	could
O	excel
O	in

O	the
O	chief
O	bard
O	of
O	the
O	High
O	King
O	of

O	who

O	race
O	of
O	Tara
O	the

O	robe
O	a
O	garment
O	of
O	all
O	the

O	of
O	the

O	so
O	finely
O	spun
O	that
O	when

O	up
O	it
O	would
O	fit
O	in
O	the

O	of

O	small
O	white
O	hand
O	To

O	these
O	three
O	conditions
O	was
O	impossible
O	for
O	all
O	her
O	suitors
O	and
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	loveliest
O	lady
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	would
O	go
O	unmarried

O	ascending
O	the
O	mound
O	in

O	at
O	the

O	silence
O	like

O	of
O	night
O	fell
O	on

O	gathering
O	As
O	he

O	softly
O	over

O	rest
O	The
O	lark
O	soaring
O	and

O	mute
O	and

O	in
O	the

O	heard
O	over
O	the

O	save
O	the
O	dreamy
O	music
O	Then
O	the
O	bard
O	struck
O	another
O	key
O	and
O	a
O	gentle
O	sorrow
O	possessed
O	the

O	to

O	as
O	brightly
O	as

O	waters
O	dancing
O	in
O	the
O	sun
O	When
O	the
O	last
O	notes
O	had
O	died
O	away
O	a
O	cheer
O	arose
O	loud
O	as
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	the
O	storm
O	in
O	the
O	glen
O	when
O	the
O	live
O	thunder
O	is
O	reveling
O	on

O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the

O	had
O	descended
O	the
O	mound
O	the
O	Skald
O	from
O	the

O	took
O	his

O	by
O	cries
O	of
O	welcome
O	from
O	a
O	hundred
O	thousand
O	throats
O	He
O	touched
O	his
O	harp
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	perfect
O	silence
O	was
O	heard
O	the
O	strain
O	of
O	the
O	mermaid
O	s
O	song
O	and
O	through
O	it
O	the
O	pleasant
O	ripple
O	of
O	summer
O	waters
O	on
O	the
O	pebbly
O	beach
O	Then
O	the
O	theme
O	was
O	changed
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	air
O	was
O	borne
O	the
O	measured
O	sweep
O	of
O	countless
O	oars
O	and
O	the
O	swish
O	of
O	waters
O	around
O	the
O	prows
O	of
O	contending
O	galleys
O	and
O	the
O	breezy
O	voices
O	of
O	the
O	sailors
O	and
O	the
O	sea
O	bird
O	s
O	cry
O	Then
O	his
O	theme
O	was
O	changed
O	to
O	the
O	mirth
O	and
O	laughter
O	of
O	the
O	banquet
O	hall
O	the
O	clang
O	of
O	meeting
O	drinking
O	horns
O	and

O	When
O	the
O	last
O	strain
O	ended
O	from
O	the
O	mighty
O	host
O	a
O	great
O	shout
O	went
O	up
O	loud
O	as
O	the
O	roar
O	of
O	winter
O	billows
O	breaking
O	in
O	the
O	hollows
O	of

O	of
O	the

O	In
O	the

O	of
O	the

O	the
O	cry
O	arose
O	that
O	another

O	and
O	there
O	standing

O	Fergus
O	the
O	huntsman

O	All

O	but
O	no
O	one
O	looked
O	so
O	eagerly
O	as
O	the
O	princess
O	He
O	touched
O	his
O	harp
O	with
O	gentle
O	fingers
O	and
O	a
O	sound
O	low
O	and
O	soft
O	as
O	a
O	faint
O	summer
O	breeze
O	passing
O	through
O	forest
O	trees
O	stole
O	out
O	and
O	then
O	was
O	heard
O	the
O	rustle
O	of
O	birds
O	through
O	the
O	branches
O	and
O	the
O	dreamy
O	murmur
O	of

O	lost
O	in

O	woods
O	and

O	whispering
O	when

O	leaves
O	are
O	motionless
O	in
O	the
O	noonday
O	heat
O	then
O	followed
O	notes
O	cool
O	and
O	soft
O	as
O	the
O	drip
O	of
O	summer
O	showers
O	on
O	the
O	parched
O	grass
O	and
O	then
O	the

O	of
O	the

O	sounding
O	as
O	clearly
O	as
O	it
O	sounds
O	in

O	then
O	in
O	one
O	sweet
O	jocund
O	burst
O	the
O	multitudinous
O	voices
O	that

O	the

O	the

O	canopy
O	above

O	from
O	the

O	multitude
O	for
O	the

O	all

O	His

O	walked
O	aimlessly
O	through
O	the
O	woods
O	A
O	deer
O	starting
O	from
O	a
O	thicket
O	reminded
O	him
O	of
O	the
O	happy
O	days
O	of
O	his
O	boyhood
O	and
O	once
O	more
O	the
O	wish
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	left
O	his
O	forest
O	home
O	As
O	his
O	eyes
O	followed
O	the
O	deer
O	wistfully
O	suddenly
O	he
O	started
O	in
O	amazement
O	The
O	deer
O	vanished
O	from
O	view
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	stead
O	was
O	the
O	wild
O	horse
O	of
O	the
O	mountains
O	I
O	told
O	you
O	I
O	d
O	do
O	you
O	a
O	good
O	turn
O	said
O	the
O	Pooka
O	for
O	the
O	kindness
O	you
O	and
O	yours
O	did
O	me
O	on
O	that
O	wild
O	winter
O	s
O	night
O	The
O	day
O	is
O	passing
O	You
O	have
O	no
O	time
O	to
O	lose
O	The
O	white
O	steed
O	of
O	the
O	plains
O	is
O	coming
O	to
O	the
O	starting
O	post
O	Jump
O	on
O	my
O	back
O	and
O	remember
O	Faint
O	heart
O	never
O	won
O	fair
O	lady
O	In
O	half
O	a
O	second
O	Fergus
O	was
O	bestride
O	the
O	Pooka
O	whose
O	coat
O	of
O	shaggy
O	hair
O	became
O	at
O	once
O	as
O	glossy
O	as
O	silk
O	and
O	just
O	at
O	the
O	very
O	moment
O	when
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	declare
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	steed
O	to
O	compete
O	with
O	the
O	white
O	steed
O	of
O	the
O	plains
O	the
O	Pooka
O	with
O	Fergus
O	upon
O	his
O	back
O	galloped
O	up
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	royal
O	inclosure
O	When
O	the
O	people
O	saw
O	the
O	champion
O	a
O	thunderous
O	shout
O	rose
O	up
O	that
O	startled
O	the
O	birds
O	in
O	the
O	skies
O	and
O	sent
O	them
O	flying
O	to
O	the
O	groves
O	And
O	in
O	the
O	ladies
O	inclosure
O	was
O	a
O	rustle
O	of
O	many
O	colored
O	scarves
O	waving
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	At
O	the
O	striking
O	of
O	the
O	shields
O	the
O	contending
O	steeds
O	rushed
O	from
O	the
O	post
O	with
O	the
O	swiftness
O	of
O	a
O	swallow
O	s
O	flight
O	But
O	before
O	the
O	white
O	steed
O	of
O	the
O	plains
O	had
O	gone
O	halfway
O	round
O	Fergus
O	and
O	the
O	wild
O	horse
O	of
O	the
O	mountains
O	had
O	passed
O	the
O	winning
O	post
O	greeted
O	by
O	such
O	cheers
O	as
O	had
O	never
O	before
O	been
O	heard
O	on
O	the
O	plains
O	of
O	Tara
O	Fergus
O	heard
O	the
O	cheers
O	but
O	scarcely
O	heeded
O	them
O	for
O	his
O	heart
O	went
O	out
O	through
O	his
O	eyes
O	that
O	were
O	fastened
O	on
O	the
O	princess
O	and
O	a
O	wild
O	hope
O	stirred
O	him
O	that
O	his
O	glance
O	was
O	not
O	ungrateful
O	to
O	the
O	loveliest
O	lady
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	And
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	sad
O	and
O	sorry
O	for
O	her
O	vow
O	for
O	she
O	believed
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	beyond
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	Fergus
O	to
O	bring
O	her
O	a
O	robe
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	colors
O	of
O	the
O	rainbow
O	so
O	subtly
O	woven
O	as
O	to
O	fit
O	in
O	the
O	palm
O	of
O	her
O	soft
O	white
O	hand
O	That
O	night
O	also
O	Fergus
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	forest
O	not
O	too
O	sad
O	because
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	vague
O	hope
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	that
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	there
O	before
O	He
O	lay
O	down
O	under
O	the
O	branches
O	with
O	his
O	feet
O	towards
O	the
O	rustling
O	waters
O	and
O	the
O	smiles
O	of
O	the
O	princess
O	gilded
O	his
O	slumbers
O	as
O	the
O	rays
O	of
O	the
O	rising
O	sun
O	gild
O	the
O	glades
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	morning
O	came
O	he
O	was
O	scarcely
O	surprised
O	when
O	before
O	him
O	appeared
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	with
O	the
O	shuttle
O	he
O	had
O	welcomed
O	on
O	the
O	winter
O	s
O	night
O	You
O	think
O	you
O	have
O	won
O	her
O	already
O	said
O	the
O	little
O	woman
O	And
O	so
O	you
O	have
O	too
O	her
O	heart
O	is
O	all
O	your
O	own
O	and
O	I
O	m
O	half
O	inclined
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	my
O	trouble
O	will
O	be
O	thrown
O	away
O	for
O	if
O	you
O	had
O	never
O	a
O	wedding
O	robe
O	to
O	give
O	her
O	she
O	d
O	rather
O	have
O	you
O	this
O	minute
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	kings
O	of
O	Erin
O	or
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	other
O	princes
O	and
O	kings
O	and
O	chieftains
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	world
O	But
O	you
O	and
O	your
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	were
O	kind
O	to
O	me
O	on
O	a
O	wild
O	winter
O	s
O	night
O	and
O	I
O	d
O	never
O	see
O	your
O	mother
O	s
O	son
O	without
O	a
O	wedding
O	robe
O	fit
O	for
O	the
O	greatest
O	princess
O	that
O	ever
O	set
O	nations
O	to
O	battle
O	for
O	her
O	beauty
O	So
O	go
O	and
O	pluck
O	me
O	a
O	handful
O	of
O	wild
O	forest
O	flowers
O	and
O	I
O	ll
O	weave
O	out
O	of
O	them
O	a
O	wedding
O	robe
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	colors
O	of
O	the
O	rainbow
O	and
O	one
O	that
O	will
O	be
O	as
O	sweet
O	and
O	as
O	fragrant
O	as
O	the
O	ripe
O	red
O	lips
O	of
O	the
O	princess
O	herself
O	Fergus
O	with
O	joyous
O	heart
O	culled
O	the
O	flowers
O	and
O	brought
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	In
O	the
O	twinkling
O	of
O	an
O	eye
O	she
O	wove
O	with
O	her
O	little
O	shuttle
O	a
O	wedding
O	robe
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	colors
O	of
O	the
O	rainbow
O	as
O	light
O	as
O	the
O	fairy
O	dew
O	as
O	soft
O	as
O	the
O	hand
O	of
O	the
O	princess
O	as
O	fragrant
O	as
O	her
O	little
O	red
O	mouth
O	and
O	so
O	small
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	pass
O	through
O	the
O	eye
O	of
O	a
O	needle
O	Go
O	now
O	Fergus
O	said
O	she
O	and
O	may
O	luck
O	go
O	with
O	you
O	but
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	your
O	greatness
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	glory
O	which
O	will
O	come
O	to
O	you
O	when
O	you
O	are
O	wedded
O	to
O	the
O	princess
O	be
O	as
O	kind
O	and
O	have
O	as
O	open
O	a
O	heart
O	and
O	as
O	open
O	a
O	door
O	for
O	the
O	poor
O	as
O	you
O	had
O	when
O	you
O	were
O	only
O	a
O	poor
O	huntsman
O	s
O	son
O	Fergus
O	took
O	the
O	robe
O	and
O	went
O	towards
O	Tara
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	last
O	day
O	of
O	the
O	fair
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	contests
O	were
O	over
O	and
O	the
O	bards
O	were
O	about
O	to
O	chant
O	the
O	farewell
O	strains
O	to
O	the
O	memory
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	queen
O	But
O	before
O	the
O	chief
O	bard
O	could
O	ascend
O	the
O	mound
O	Fergus
O	attended
O	by
O	a
O	troop
O	of
O	Fenian
O	warriors
O	on
O	their
O	steeds
O	galloped
O	into
O	the
O	inclosure
O	and
O	rode
O	up
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	queen

O	pavilion
O	Holding
O	up
