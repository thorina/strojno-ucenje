O	In
O	a
O	region
O	of
O	country
O	where
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	the
O	prairie
O	strived
O	which
O	should
O	be
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful--the
O	open
O	plain
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	free
O	sunshine
O	and
O	winds
O	and
O	flowers
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	close
O	wood
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	delicious
O	twilight-walks
O	and
O	enamored
O	haunts--there
O	lived
O	a
O	wicked
O	manito
O	in
O	the
O	disguise
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	Indian
O	.
O	Although
O	the
O	country
O	furnished
O	an
O	abundance
O	of
O	game
O	,
O	and
O	whatever
O	else
O	a
O	good
O	heart
O	could
O	wish
O	for
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	study
O	of
O	this
O	wicked
O	genius
O	to
O	destroy
O	such
O	as
O	fell
O	into
O	his
O	hands
O	.
O	He
O	made
O	use
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	arts
O	to
O	decoy
O	men
O	into
O	his
O	power
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	purpose
O	of
O	killing
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	country
O	had
O	been
O	once
O	thickly
O	peopled
O	,
O	but
O	this
O	Mudjee
O	Monedo
O	had
O	so
O	thinned
O	it
O	by
O	his
O	cruel
O	practices
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	now
O	lived
O	almost
O	solitary
O	in
O	the
O	wilderness
O	.
O	The
O	secret
O	of
O	his
O	success
O	lay
O	in
O	his
O	great
O	speed
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	the
O	power
O	to
O	assume
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	any
O	four-footed
O	creature
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	his
O	custom
O	to
O	challenge
O	such
O	as
O	he
O	sought
O	to
O	destroy
O	,
O	to
O	run
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	a
O	beaten
O	path
O	on
O	which
O	he
O	ran
O	,
O	leading
O	around
O	a
O	large
O	lake
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	always
O	ran
O	around
O	this
O	circle
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	starting
O	and
O	the
O	winning-post
O	was
O	the
O	same
O	.
O	Whoever
O	failed
O	as
O	every
O	one
O	had
O	,
O	yielded
O	up
O	his
O	life
O	at
O	this
O	post;
O	and
O	although
O	he
O	ran
O	every
O	day
O	,
O	no
O	man
O	was
O	ever
O	known
O	to
O	beat
O	this
O	evil
O	genius;
O	for
O	whenever
O	he
O	was
O	pressed
O	hard
O	,
O	he
O	changed
O	himself
O	into
O	a
O	fox
O	,
O	wolf
O	,
O	deer
O	,
O	or
O	other
O	swift-footed
O	animal
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	thus
O	able
O	to
O	leave
O	his
O	competitor
O	behind
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	country
O	was
O	in
O	dread
O	of
O	this
O	same
O	Mudjee
O	Monedo
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	the
O	young
O	men
O	were
O	constantly
O	running
O	with
O	him;
O	for
O	if
O	they
O	refused
O	,
O	he
O	called
O	them
O	cowards
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	reproach
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	.
O	They
O	would
O	rather
O	die
O	than
O	be
O	called
O	cowards
O	.
O	To
O	keep
O	up
O	his
O	sport
O	,
O	the
O	manito
O	made
O	light
O	of
O	these
O	deadly
O	foot-matches
O	,
O	and
O	instead
O	of
O	assuming
O	a
O	braggart
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	going
O	about
O	in
O	a
O	boastful
O	way
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	blood
O	of
O	such
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	overcome
O	,
O	upon
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	he
O	adopted
O	very
O	pleasing
O	manners
O	,
O	and
O	visited
O	the
O	lodges
O	around
O	the
O	country
O	as
O	any
O	other
O	sweet-tempered
O	and
O	harmless
O	old
O	Indian
O	might
O	.
O	His
O	secret
O	object
O	in
O	these
O	friendly
O	visits
O	was
O	to
O	learn
O	whether
O	the
O	young
O	boys
O	were
O	getting
O	old
O	enough
O	to
O	run
O	with
O	him;
O	he
O	kept
O	a
O	very
O	sharp
O	eye
O	upon
O	their
O	growth
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	day
O	he
O	thought
O	them
O	ready
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	fail
O	to
O	challenge
O	them
O	to
O	a
O	trial
O	on
O	his
O	racing-ground
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	family
O	in
O	all
O	that
O	beautiful
O	region
O	which
O	had
O	not
O	in
O	this
O	way
O	been
O	visited
O	and
O	thinned
O	out;
O	and
O	the
O	manito
O	had
O	quite
O	naturally
O	come
O	to
O	be
O	held
O	in
O	abhorrence
O	by
O	all
O	the
O	Indian
O	mothers
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	It
O	happened
O	that
O	there
O	lived
O	near
O	him
O	a
O	poor
O	widow
O	woman
O	,
O	whose
O	husband
O	and
O	seven
O	sons
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	way
O	with;
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	now
O	living
O	with
O	an
O	only
O	daughter
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	son
O	of
O	ten
O	or
O	twelve
O	years
O	old
O	.
O	This
O	widow
O	was
O	very
O	poor
O	and
O	feeble
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	suffered
O	so
O	much
O	for
O	lack
O	of
O	food
O	and
O	other
O	comforts
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	glad
O	to
O	die
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	her
O	daughter
O	and
O	her
O	little
O	son
O	.
O	The
O	Mudjee
O	Monedo
O	had
O	already
O	visited
O	her
O	lodge
O	to
O	observe
O	whether
O	the
O	boy
O	was
O	sufficiently
O	grown
O	to
O	be
O	challenged
O	to
O	the
O	race;
O	and
O	so
O	crafty
O	in
O	his
O	approaches
O	and
O	so
O	soft
O	in
O	his
O	manners
O	was
O	the
O	monedo
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	mother
O	feared
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	yet
O	decoy
O	the
O	son
O	and
O	make
O	way
O	with
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	with
O	his
O	father
O	and
O	his
O	seven
O	brothers
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	all
O	her
O	struggles
O	to
O	save
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	yet
O	she
O	strove
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	might
O	to
O	strengthen
O	her
O	son
O	in
O	every
O	good
O	course
O	.
O	She
O	taught
O	him
O	,
O	as
O	best
O	she
O	could
O	,
O	what
O	was
O	becoming
O	for
O	the
O	wise
O	hunter
O	and
O	the
O	brave
O	warrior
O	.
O	She
O	remembered
O	and
O	set
O	before
O	him
O	all
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	recall
O	of
O	the
O	skill
O	and
O	the
O	craft
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	and
O	his
O	brothers
O	who
O	were
O	lost
O	.
O	The
O	widow
O	woman
O	also
O	instructed
O	her
O	daughter
O	in
O	whatever
O	could
O	make
O	her
O	useful
O	as
O	a
O	wife;
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	leisure-time
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	she
O	gave
O	her
O	lessons
O	in
O	the
O	art
O	of
O	working
O	with
O	the
O	quills
O	of
O	porcupine
O	,
O	and
O	bestowed
O	on
O	her
O	such
O	other
O	accomplishments
O	as
O	should
O	make
O	her
O	an
O	ornament
O	and
O	a
O	blessing
O	to
O	her
O	husband
O	'
O	s
O	household
O	.
O	The
O	daughter
O	,
O	Minda
O	by
O	name
O	,
O	was
O	kind
O	and
O	obedient
O	to
O	her
O	mother
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	failed
O	in
O	her
O	duty
O	.
O	Their
O	lodge
O	stood
O	high
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	a
O	lake
O	,
O	which
O	gave
O	them
O	a
O	wide
O	prospect
O	of
O	country
O	,
O	embellished
O	with
O	groves
O	and
O	open
O	fields
O	,
O	which
O	waved
O	with
O	the
O	blue
O	light
O	of
O	their
O	long
O	grass
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	,
O	at
O	all
O	hours
O	of
O	sun
O	and
O	moon
O	,
O	a
O	cheerful
O	scene
O	to
O	look
O	upon
O	.
O	Across
O	this
O	beautiful
O	prairie
O	,
O	Minda
O	had
O	one
O	morning
O	made
O	her
O	way
O	to
O	gather
O	dry
O	limbs
O	for
O	their
O	fire;
O	for
O	she
O	disdained
O	no
O	labor
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	And
O	while
O	enjoying
O	the
O	sweetness
O	of
O	the
O	air
O	and
O	the
O	green
O	beauty
O	of
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	she
O	strolled
O	far
O	away
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	a
O	bank
O	,
O	painted
O	with
O	flowers
O	of
O	every
O	hue
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	reclining
O	on
O	its
O	fragrant
O	couch
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	bird
O	,
O	of
O	red
O	and
O	deep-blue
O	plumage
O	softly
O	blended
O	,
O	alighted
O	on
O	a
O	branch
O	near
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	pour
O	forth
O	its
O	carol
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	bird
O	of
O	strange
O	character
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	never
O	before
O	seen
O	.
O	Its
O	first
O	note
O	was
O	so
O	delicious
O	to
O	the
O	ear
O	of
O	Minda
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	so
O	pierced
O	to
O	her
O	young
O	heart
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	listened
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	never
O	before
O	to
O	any
O	mortal
O	or
O	heavenly
O	sound
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	like
O	the
O	human
O	voice
O	,
O	forbidden
O	to
O	speak
O	,
O	and
O	uttering
O	its
O	language
O	through
O	this
O	wild
O	wood-chant
O	with
O	a
O	mournful
O	melody
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	bewailed
O	the
O	lack
O	of
O	the
O	power
O	or
O	the
O	right
O	to
O	make
O	itself
O	more
O	plainly
O	intelligible
O	.
O	The
O	voice
O	of
O	the
O	bird
O	rose
O	and
O	fell
O	,
O	and
O	circled
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	,
O	but
O	whithersoever
O	floated
O	or
O	spread
O	out
O	its
O	notes
O	,
O	they
O	seemed
O	ever
O	to
O	have
O	their
O	center
O	where
O	Minda
O	sat;
O	and
O	she
O	looked
O	with
O	sad
O	eyes
O	into
O	the
O	sad
O	eyes
O	of
O	the
O	mournful
O	bird

O	in
O	his
O	red
O	and
O	deep-blue
O	plumage
O	just
O	opposite
O	to
O	the
O	flowery
O	bank
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	bird
O	strove
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	with
O	his
O	voice
O	,

O	The

O	,
O	and

O	far

O	With

O	lover
O	,
O	whose

O	upon

O	.
O	He
O	addressed
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	she
O	directed
O	him
O	to
O	sit
O	down
O	beside
O	her
O	daughter
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	regarded
O	as
O	man
O	and
O	wife
O	.
O	Early
O	on
O	the

O	,
O	he
O	asked
O	for
O	the
O	bow
O	and

O	those
O	who
O	had
O	been

O	""""
O	While
O	the
O	widow
O	woman
O	was
O	still
O	lost
O	in
O	wonder
O	at
O	these
O	words
O	,
O	Monedowa
O	,
O	and
O	Minda
O	his

O	at
O	the
O	same
O	moment
O	,
O	rose
O	into
O	the

O	,
O	as
O	beautiful
O	birds
O	,
O	clothed
O	in
O	shining
O	colors
O	of
O	red
O	and
O	blue
O	.
O	They
O	caroled
O	together
O	as
O	they
O	flew
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	songs
O	were
O	happy
O	,
O	and
O	falling
O	,
O	falling
O	,
O	like

O	drops
O	,

O	winged
O	their
O	way
O	far
O	upward
O	,
O	a
O	delicious
O	peace
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	mind
O	of
O	the
O	poor
O	widow
O	woman
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	returned
O	to
O	her
O	lodge
O	deeply
O	thankful

O	for

O	she
O	never

O	and
O	her
O	young
O	son
O	proved
O	a
O	comfort
O	to
O	her
O	lodge
O	,
O	and
O	the

O	carol
O	of
O	Monedowa
O	and
O	Minda
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	fell
