O	Some

O	more
O	bravely
O	and
O	showed
O	more
O	likelihood

O	strength
O	and
O	courage
O	.
O	They
O	that
O	are
O	learned
O	in
O	such
O	things
O	said
O	that
O	his
O	arms
O	were
O	over-
O	long
O	for
O	the
O	height
O	of
O	his

O	but
O	this

O	On

O	drest

O	on

O	.
O	This
O	done

O	a
O	great

O	in

O	Half

O	.
O	In

O	the

O	and
O	all

O	equally

O	.
O	For
O	one
O	shameful
O	deed
O	the
O	English
O	King
O	must
O	answer
O	.
O	Of
O	this
O	deed
O	I
O	will
O	now
O	tell
O	the
O	story
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	army
O	had
O	had
O	sufficient
O	rest--and
O	the
O	King
O	knew
O	well
O	that
O	no
O	army
O	must
O	have
O	more
O	than
O	is
O	sufficient
O	,
O	suffering
O	more
O	from
O	excess
O	than
O	from
O	defect
O	in
O	this
O	matter--and
O	it
O	was
O	now
O	time
O	to
O	advance
O	,
O	there
O	arose
O	a
O	great
O	question
O	touching
O	the
O	agreement
O	made
O	when
O	the
O	town
O	was
O	given
O	up
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	much
O	going
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	of
O	messengers
O	and
O	embassies
O	between
O	the
O	English
O	King
O	and
O	the
O	Caliph
O	Saladin
O	,
O	much
O	debating
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	accusations
O	bandied
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	.
O	Even
O	to
O	this
O	day
O	no
O	man
O	can
O	speak
O	certainly
O	of
O	what
O	was
O	done
O	or
O	not
O	done
O	in
O	this
O	matter
O	.
O	What
O	I
O	write
O	,
O	I
O	write
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	my
O	knowledge
O	.
O	First
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	beyond
O	all
O	doubt
O	that
O	the
O	Caliph
O	did
O	not
O	send
O	either
O	the
O	Holy
O	Cross
O	or
O	the
O	money
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	covenanted
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	prisoners
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	promised
O	to
O	deliver
O	up;
O	but
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	cause
O	wherefore
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	send
O	them
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	agreement
O	,
O	the
O	Christians
O	affirming
O	one
O	thing
O	,
O	the
O	followers
O	of
O	Mahomet
O	another
O	.
O	As
O	to
O	the
O	Holy
O	Cross
O	,
O	let
O	that
O	be
O	put
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	account
O	.
O	No
O	man
O	that
O	I
O	ever
O	talked
O	with--and
O	I
O	have
O	talked
O	with
O	many--ever
O	saw
O	it
O	.
O	'
O	Tis
O	much
O	to
O	be
O	doubted
O	whether
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	being
O	.
O	As
O	to
O	the
O	money
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	Caliph
O	had
O	it
O	,
O	or
O	a
O	great
O	portion
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	at
O	hand
O	,
O	is
O	certainly
O	true
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	seen
O	and
O	counted
O	by
O	King
O	Richard
O	'
O	s
O	own
O	envoys
O	.
O	As
O	to
O	the
O	prisoners
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	hard
O	to
O	discover
O	the
O	truth
O	.
O	For
O	my
O	part
O	,
O	I
O	believe
O	that
O	the
O	Caliph
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	deliver
O	up
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	hands
O	or
O	could
O	find
O	elsewhere
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	promised
O	more
O	in
O	respect
O	of
O	this
O	than
O	he
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	perform
O	.
O	Many
O	of
O	those
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	covenanted
O	to
O	restore
O	were
O	dead
O	,
O	either
O	of
O	disease
O	or
O	by
O	violence
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	disease
O	,
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	noted
O	that
O	a
O	sick
O	man
O	was
O	likely
O	to
O	fare
O	worse
O	in
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	Turks;
O	as
O	for
O	violence
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	much
O	diversity
O	between
O	the
O	Christians
O	and
O	the
O	followers
O	of
O	Mahomet
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	may
O	be
O	said
O	,
O	that
O	one
O	who
O	invades
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	others
O	is
O	like
O	to
O	suffer
O	worse
O	injury
O	should
O	he
O	come
O	into
O	their
O	power
O	than
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	the
O	disposition
O	to
O	inflict
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	Whatever
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	the
O	cause
O	,
O	the
O	Caliph
O	had
O	engaged
O	in
O	this
O	matter
O	far
O	more
O	than
O	he
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	perform
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	fail
O	from
O	want
O	of
O	good
O	faith
O	.
O	I
O	take
O	it
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	from
O	the
O	matter
O	of
O	the
O	money
O	that
O	there
O	came
O	the
O	breaking
O	of
O	the
O	agreement
O	.
O	To
O	put
O	it
O	very
O	shortly
O	,
O	the
O	Caliph
O	said
O	,
O	""""
O	Restore
O	to
O	me
O	the
O	hostages

O	""""
O	And
O	neither
O	was
O	the

O	willing

O	the

O	,
O	nor
O	the
O	King
O	the

O	of

O	.
O	So
O	there
O	was
O	delay
O	after
O	delay
O	,
O	much
O	talk
O	to
O	no

O	growing
O	more
O	hot
O	with
O	anger
O	from
O	day
O	to
O	day
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	was
O	also
O	the
O	need
O	which
O	increased
O	from
O	day
O	to
O	day
O	,
O	as
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	it
O	needs
O	must
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	Christians
O	to
O	be
O	about
O	the
O	business
O	on
O	which
O	they
O	came
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	taken
O	the
O	town
O	of
O	Acre
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	was
O	but
O	the
O	beginning
O	of

O	,
O	for
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	conquer
O	the
O	whole
O	land
O	.
O	And
O	how
O	could
O	the
O	army
O	march
O	with
O	a
O	whole
O	multitude
O	of

O	It
O	would
O	need
O	no

O	number
O	of
O	men
O	to
O	keep
O	watch
O	over
O	them
O	,
O	lest

O	should
O	escape
O	,
O	or
O	,

O	was
O	more
O	to
O	be

O	do

O	What
O	could
O	be
O	worse
O	in

O	doubtful

O	than
O	that
O	there
O	should
O	be
O	these
O	enemies
O	in
O	its
O	very
O	midst
O	?
O	I
O	set
O	these
O	things
O	down
O	because
O	I
O	would
O	not
O	do
O	an
O	injustice
O	to
O	the
O	English

O	For
O	on

O	he

O	great
O	wealth
O	,
O	he
O	hoped
O	to
O	receive
O	a
O	ransom;
O	others
O	were
O	saved
O	by
O	private
O	persons
O	,
O	a
O	few
O	for
O	compassion
O	'
O	s
O	sake;
O	and
O	others
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	gain
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	greater
O	part
O	were
O	slain
O	without
O	mercy
O	,
O	the
O	soldiers
O	falling
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	without
O	arms
O	and
O	helpless
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	soon
O	made
O	plain
O	to
O	all
O	that
O	the
O	spirit
O	of
O	the
O	Caliph
O	and
O	his
O	Turks
O	was
O	not
O	broken
O	by
O	the
O	losing
O	of
O	Acre
O	.
O	Rather
O	were
O	they
O	stirred
O	up
O	by
O	it
O	to
O	more
O	earnestness
O	and
O	courage;
O	nor
O	did
O	they
O	forget
O	how
O	their
O	countrymen
O	had
O	been
O	cruelly
O	slaughtered
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	time
O	they
O	were
O	content
O	to
O	watch
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	army
O	as
O	it
O	went
O	on
O	its
O	way
O	,
O	taking
O	such
O	occasion
O	as
O	offered
O	itself
O	of
O	plundering
O	or
O	slaying
O	.
O	If
O	any
O	lagged
O	behind
O	,
O	falling
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	line
O	of
O	march
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	weariness
O	,
O	or
O	seeking
O	refreshment
O	on
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	as
O	when
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	spring
O	of
O	water
O	near
O	to
O	the
O	road
O	,
O	or
O	a
O	vineyard
O	with
O	grapes--
O	'
O	twas
O	just
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	the
O	ripening
O	of
O	grapes--then
O	the
O	Turkish
O	horsemen
O	would
O	be
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	Such
O	loiterers
O	escaped
O	but
O	seldom
O	.
O	And
O	for
O	this
O	business
O	the
O	Turks
O	had
O	a
O	particular
O	fitness
O	,
O	so
O	quickly
O	did
O	they
O	come
O	and
O	depart
O	.
O	The
O	Christian
O	knights
O	were
O	clad
O	in
O	armour
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	defense
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	against
O	arrows
O	and
O	stones
O	,
O	but
O	a
O	great
O	hindrance
O	if
O	a
O	man
O	would
O	move
O	quickly;
O	the
O	horses
O	also
O	had
O	armour
O	on
O	them
O	.
O	Why
O	do
O	they
O	set
O	men
O	on
O	horses
O	but
O	that
O	they
O	may
O	go
O	speedily
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	as
O	occasion
O	may
O	call
O	?
O	but
O	these
O	knights
O	are
O	like
O	to
O	fortresses
O	rather
O	than
O	to
O	riders
O	.
O	A
O	man
O	on
O	foot
O	can
O	easily
O	outrun
O	them;
O	as
O	for
O	the
O	Turks
O	who
O	rode
O	on
O	horses
O	from
O	the
O	desert--than
O	which
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	creature
O	on
O	earth
O	lighter
O	and
O	speedier--they
O	flew
O	from
O	the
O	Christian
O	who
O	would
O	pursue
O	them
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	bird
O	flies
O	from
O	a
O	child
O	who
O	would
O	catch
O	it
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	while
O	the
O	Turks
O	were
O	close
O	at
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	ready
O	to
O	assault
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	army
O	so
O	soon
O	as
O	a
O	convenient
O	occasion
O	would
O	arise
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	take
O	King
O	Richard
O	unaware
O	,
O	for
O	indeed
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	watchful
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	brave
O	.
O	I
O	will
O	now
O	set
O	forth
O	as
O	briefly
O	as
O	may
O	be
O	the
O	order
O	of
O	the
O	army
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	set
O	out
O	for
O	battle
O	at
O	Arsuf
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	right
O	hand
O	of
O	the
O	army
O	was
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	its
O	front
O	being
O	set
O	towards
O	the
O	south
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	van
O	were
O	the
O	Templars
O	,
O	and
O	next
O	to
O	these
O	the
O	Frenchmen
O	in
O	two
O	divisions
O	,
O	the
O	second
O	being
O	led
O	by
O	that
O	Guy
O	who
O	called
O	himself
O	King
O	of
O	Jerusalem
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	the
O	Frenchmen
O	King
O	Richard
O	with
O	his
O	Englishmen;
O	last
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	holding
O	the
O	rear-guard
O	,
O	were
O	the
O	Hospitallers
O	.
O	These
O	are
O	ever
O	rivals
O	of
O	the
O	Templars
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	custom
O	so
O	to
O	order
O	his
O	disposition
O	that
O	this
O	rivalry
O	should
O	work
O	for
O	the
O	common
O	good
O	.
O	On
O	one
O	day
O	the
O	Templars
O	would
O	lead
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Hospitallers
O	bring
O	up
O	the
O	rear;
O	on
O	another
O	each
O	would
O	take
O	the
O	other
O	'
O	s
O	place;
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	ever
O	a
O	mighty
O	contention
O	between
O	the
O	two
O	companies
O	which
O	would
O	bear
O	itself
O	the
O	better
O	.
O	These
O	two
O	posts
O	,
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	said
O	,
O	were
O	the
O	most
O	full
O	of
O	peril;
O	nor
O	was
O	any
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	army
O	save
O	only
O	these
O	two
O	companies
O	suffered
O	to
O	hold
O	either
O	the
O	one
O	or
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	Between
O	the
O	divisions
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	small
O	space
O	,
O	not
O	more
O	that
O	sufficient
O	to
O	mark
O	one
O	from
O	the
O	other:
O	otherwise
O	the
O	soldiers
O	stood
O	and
O	marched
O	in
O	as
O	close
O	array
O	as
O	might
O	be
O	.
O	Also
O	they
O	moved
O	very
O	slowly
O	,
O	travelling
O	less
O	than
O	a
O	league
O	in
O	the
O	space
O	of
O	two
O	hours
O	.
O	And
O	even
O	the
O	King
O	with
O	some
O	chosen
O	knights
O	rode
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	lines
O	,
O	watching
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	the
O	Turks
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	whenever
O	they
O	might
O	make
O	assault
O	the
O	army
O	might
O	be
O	ready
O	to
O	meet
O	them
O	.
O	Now
O	King
O	Richard
O	'
O	s
O	commandment
O	had
O	been
O	that
O	the
O	Christians
O	should
O	on
O	no
O	account
O	break
O	their
O	lines
O	to
O	attack
O	the
O	enemy
O	,
O	but
O	should
O	only
O	defend
O	themselves
O	as
O	best
O	they
O	could
O	.
O	There
O	is
O	nothing
O	harder
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	duty
O	of
O	a
O	soldier
O	than
O	so
O	to
O	stand;
O	even
O	they
O	who
O	have
O	been
O	men
O	of
O	war
O	from
O	their
O	youth
O	grow
O	greatly
O	impatient;
O	as
O	for
O	the
O	younger
O	sort
O	they
O	often
O	fail
O	to
O	endure
O	altogether
O	.
O	Many
O	a
O	man
O	will
O	sooner
O	throw
O	himself
O	upon
O	almost
O	sure
O	death
O	than
O	abide
O	danger
O	less
O	by
O	far
O	standing
O	still
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	it
O	could
O	be
O	seen
O	that
O	day
O	in
O	the
O	Christian
O	army
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	to
O	fail
O	were
O	the
O	men
O	that
O	carried
O	the
O	cross-bows;
O	nor
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	is
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	wondered
O	at
O	that
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	spent
O	their
O	store
O	of
O	bolts
O	,
O	they
O	,
O	having
O	but
O	short
O	swords
O	wherewith
O	to
O	defend
O	themselves
O	,
O	should
O	be
O	ill
O	content
O	to
O	hold
O	their
O	place
O	.
O	Many
O	I
O	did
O	see
O	throw
O	away
O	their
O	bows
O	and
O	fly
O	,
O	thrusting
O	themselves
O	by
O	main
O	force
O	into
O	the
O	ranks
O	of
O	the
O	men-at-arms
O	,
O	who
O	liked
O	not
O	to
O	beat
O	them
O	back
O	,
O	nor
O	yet
O	to
O	suffer
O	them
O	to
O	pass
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	themselves
O	had
O	much
O	ado
O	to
O	hold
O	their
O	ground
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	fierce
O	assault
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	endure
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	first
O	place
O	there
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	shower
O	of
O	darts
O	and
O	stones
O	and
O	arrows
O	that
O	the
O	very
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	itself
O	was
O	darkened
O	,
O	a
O	thing
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	always
O	before
O	judged
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	fable
O	,
O	but
O	saw
O	that
O	day
O	to
O	be
O	possible
O	.
O	The
O	greater
O	part
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	true
O	,
O	fell
O	without
O	effect
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	for
O	of
O	twenty
O	missiles
O	scarce
O	one
O	served
O	its
O	purpose
O	,
O	but
O	some
O	were
O	not
O	cast
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	number
O	,
O	they
O	lay
O	so
O	thick
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	that
O	a
O	man
O	might
O	gather
O	twenty
O	into
O	his
O	hand
O	without
O	moving
O	from
O	his
O	place
O	.
O	About
O	noon
O	the
O	Knights
O	Hospitallers
O	themselves
O	,
O	than
O	whom
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	said
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	braver
O	men
O	in
O	the

O	and
O	before
O	it
O	.
O	Where
O	he
O	rode
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	if
O	Azrael
O	had
O	passed
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	dead
O	lay
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	.
O	Never
O	had
O	the
O	Caliph
O	Saladin
O	suffered
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	defeat
O	as
O	that
O	which
O	fell
O	upon
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	battle
O	of
O	Arsuf;
O	never
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	after
O	that
O	day
O	did
O	he
O	dare
O	to
O	meet
O	King
O	Richard
O	in
O	the
O	open
O	field
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	from
O	that
O	very
O	day
O	did
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	the
O	Christians
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	accomplish
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	their
O	warfare
O	grow
O	less
O	and
O	less
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	if
O	any
O	one
O	ask
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	this
O	falling
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	should
O	bear
O	the
O	blame
O	,
O	I
O	,
O	for
O	one
O	,
O	know
O	not
O	what
O	answer
O	should
O	be
O	made
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	not
O	one
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	army
O	more
O	brave
O	and
O	more
O	generous
O	in
O	this
O	matter
O	than
O	King
O	Richard;
O	yet
O	even
O	he
O	,
O	I
O	hold
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	a
O	wholly
O	single
O	heart
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	ever
O	thinking
O	of
O	worldly
O	things;
O	he
O	desired
O	greatly
O	to
O	win
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Jerusalem
O	,
O	yet
O	he
O	desired
O	it
O	as
O	much
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	sake
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	glory
O	and
O	renown
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	increase
O	of
O	his
O	royal
O	power
O	,
O	as
O	for
O	any
O	other
O	cause
O	.
O	There
O	is
O	no
O	need
O	to
O	tell
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	combats
O	,
O	skirmishes
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	like
O	that
O	took
O	place
O	,
O	how
O	on
O	one
O	day
O	a
O	company
O	of
O	the
O	Templars
O	fell
O	into
O	an
O	ambush
O	,
O	how
O	on
O	another
O	the
O	Hospitallers
O	suffered
O	some
O	damage
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	most
O	part
O	the
O	Christians
O	had
O	the
O	better
O	in
O	these
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	not
O	a
O	little
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	skill
O	and
O	valour
O	of
O	the
O	English
O	King
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	the
O	fortunes
O	of
O	the
O	army
O	seemed
O	to
O	go
O	backwards
O	rather
O	than
O	forwards
O	.
O	About
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	King
O	began
O	to
O	have
O	dealings
O	for
O	peace
O	with
O	the
O	Caliph
O	Saladin
O	,
O	sending
O	an
O	embassage
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	receiving
O	the
O	like
O	from
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	ever
O	thus
O	that
O	the
O	King
O	asked
O	more
O	than
O	he
O	looked
O	for
O	the
O	Caliph
O	to
O	give;
O	and
O	the
O	Caliph
O	promised
O	more
O	than
O	he
O	had
O	the
O	purpose
O	to
O	fulfil
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	many
O	courtesies
O	passed
O	between
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	gifts
O	also
O	.
O	King
O	Richard
O	would
O	send
O	a
O	set
O	of
O	hawks
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	give;
O	but
O	the
O	presents
O	that
O	came
O	from
O	the
O	Caliph
O	were
O	of
O	exceeding
O	richness
O	and
O	splendour;
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	tent
O	made
O	of
O	cloth
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	and
O	horses
O	such
O	as
O	Kings
O	only
O	have
O	in
O	their
O	stalls
O	,
O	and
O	rare
O	beasts
O	and
O	birds
O	,
O	and
O	snow
O	from
O	Lebanon
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	cooling
O	of
O	wines
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	other
O	things
O	,
O	both
O	for
O	show
O	and
O	for
O	use
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	it
O	were
O	long
O	to
O	tell
O	.
O	And
O	these
O	things
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	costly
O	,
O	served
O	the
O	Caliph
O	'
O	s
O	purpose
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	this
O	reason
O	,
O	they
O	seemed
O	to
O	show
O	his
O	good
O	will
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	busy
O	destroying
O	the
O	towns
O	and
O	laying
O	waste
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	Of
O	these
O	things
O	the
O	King
O	heard
O	something
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	all
O	,
O	for
O	in
O	the
O	matter
O	of
O	news
O	he
O	was
O	ill
O	served
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	the
O	Turks
O	ceased
O	not
O	to
O	do
O	all
O	the
O	mischief
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	,
O	slaying
O	such
O	as
O	strayed
O	from
O	the
O	camp
O	,
O	yea
O	,
O	and
O	coming
O	into
O	the
O	camp
O	itself
O	,
O	and
O	doing
O	men
O	to
O	death
O	in
O	their
O	very
O	tents
O	,
O	and
O	Saladin
O	,
O	or
O	rather
O	Saphadin
O	,
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	it
O	was
O	who
O	held
O	converse
O	with
O	King
O	Richard
O	,
O	when
O	complaints
O	were
O	made
O	of
O	their
O	deeds
O	,
O	affirmed
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	done
O	by
O	robbers
O	and
O	others
O	who
O	were
O	not
O	subject
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	paid
O	no
O	reverence
O	to
O	his
O	commands;
O	of
O	which
O	pretence
O	there
O	need
O	be
O	said
O	this
O	only
O	,
O	that
O	these
O	robbers
O	or
O	murderers
O	,
O	whether
O	they
O	were
O	the
O	Caliph
O	'
O	s
O	men
O	or
O	no
O	,
O	never
O	harmed
O	any
O	but
O	such
O	as
O	were
O	his
O	enemies
O	.
O	For
O	all
O	this
O	King
O	Richard
O	still
O	strove
O	by
O	all
O	means
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	devise
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	a
O	peaceful
O	agreement
O	with
O	his
O	adversaries
O	.
O	Nor
O	did
O	he
O	refuse
O	any
O	instrument
O	by
O	which
O	he
O	might
O	hope
O	to
O	compass
O	this
O	end
O	.
O	When
O	a
O	whole
O	moon
O	had
O	been
O	wasted
O	in
O	parleying
O	and
O	the
O	sending
O	of
O	messengers
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	seeing
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	accomplish
O	his
O	purpose
O	by
O	force
O	of
O	arms
O	or
O	not
O	at
O	all
O	,
O	led
O	his
O	army
O	towards
O	the
O	Holy
O	City
O	.
O	It
O	would
O	serve
O	no
O	profitable
O	end
O	to
O	tell
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	places
O	where
O	he
O	pitched
O	his
O	camp
O	,
O	or
O	of
O	the
O	days
O	which
O	he
O	tarried
O	in
O	this
O	or
O	that
O	.
O	Let
O	it
O	suffice
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	in
O	a
O	month
O	'
O	s
O	time
O	he
O	traversed
O	so
O	much
O	space
O	only
O	as
O	an
O	army
O	well
O	equipped
O	might
O	pass
O	over
O	in
O	a
O	single
O	day
O	'
O	s
O	march;
O	and
O	that
O	about
O	twenty-one
O	days
O	after
O	the
O	winter
O	solstice
O	the
O	army
O	of
O	the
O	Christians
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	certain
O	place
O	which
O	is
O	named
O	the
O	Casal
O	of
O	Beitenoble
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	in
O	ancient
O	times
O	was
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	err
O	not
O	,
O	a
O	city
O	of
O	the
O	priests
O	.
O	There
O	it
O	tarried
O	some
O	twelve
O	days
O	,
O	being
O	much
O	troubled
O	by
O	storms
O	and
O	rains
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	winds
O	blew
O	and
O	the
O	rains
O	fell
O	during
O	the
O	whole
O	of
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	fashion
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	never
O	seen
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	tents
O	,
O	only
O	such
O	as
O	were
O	appointed
O	with
O	ropes
O	and
O	so
O	forth
O	could
O	be
O	kept
O	in
O	their
O	place
O	,
O	so
O	violent
O	were
O	the
O	blasts
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	greater
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	army
O	lay
O	under
O	the
O	open
O	sky
O	,
O	not
O	a
O	little
O	to
O	the
O	damage
O	of
O	their
O	health
O	.
O	The
O	horses
O	also
O	were
O	in
O	evil
O	case
O	.
O	These
O	creatures
O	,
O	all
O	men
O	know
O	,
O	suffer
O	from
O	much
O	sickness
O	,
O	and
O	multitudes
O	of
O	them
O	perished
O	.
O	Also
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	scarcity
O	of
O	victuals;
O	for
O	the
O	corn
O	and
O	even
O	the
O	biscuit
O	were
O	spoilt
O	by
O	the
O	rain
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hogs
O	'
O	flesh
O	grew
O	corrupt
O	.
O	Though
O	not
O	a
O	few
O	died
O	of
O	sickness
O	,
O	yet
O	did
O	the
O	host
O	daily
O	grow
O	greater
O	.
O	Many
O	who
O	had
O	stayed
O	behind
O	in
O	various
O	cities
O	,
O	their
O	zeal
O	having
O	grown
O	stale
O	,
O	now
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	camp
O	,
O	judging
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	do
O	well
O	to
O	take
O	part
O	in
O	an
O	enterprise
O	that
O	was
O	now
O	near
O	to
O	success
O	.
O	Also
O	many
O	that
O	had
O	tarried
O	on
O	the
O	march
O	for
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	sickness
O	now
O	made
O	shift
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	camp
O	.
O	Some
O	I
O	saw
O	carried
O	in
O	litters
O	,
O	and
O	others
O	that
O	could
O	scarce
O	set
O	one
O	foot
O	before
O	the
O	other
O	crawled
O	painfully
O	along
O	the
O	road
O	.
O	Many
O	of
O	these
O	were
O	slain
O	by
O	the
O	Turks
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	the
O	less
O	did
O	the
O	rest
O	brave
O	the
O	dangers
O	of
O	the
O	journey
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	the
O	camp
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	furbishing
O	of
O	arms
O	and
O	armour
O	,
O	and
O	trimming
O	of
O	the
O	plumes
O	of
O	helmets
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	counted
O	an
O	unseemly
O	thing
O	that
O	any
O	man
O	should
O	enter
O	such
O	a
O	place
O	as
O	the
O	Holy
O	City
O	save
O	in
O	his
O	best
O	array
O	.
O	On
O	a
O	certain
O	evening
O	,
O	some
O	eleven
O	days
O	after
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	the
O	army
O	to
O	Beitenoble
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	council
O	held
O	in
O	the
O	tent
O	of
O	King
O	Richard
O	,
O	at
O	which
O	were
O	present
O	the
O	Master
O	of
O	the
O	Templars
O	and
O	the
O	Master
O	of
O	the
O	Hospitallers
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	chief
O	men
O	in
O	the
O	army
O	.
O	About
O	an
O	hour
O	after
O	sunset
O	the
O	council
O	came
O	to
O	an
O	end;
O	darkness
O	had
O	long
O	since
O	fallen
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	chanced
O	to
O	be
O	full
O	moon
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	faces
O	of
O	them
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	present
O	at
O	the
O	council
O	were
O	plain
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	Before
O	ever
O	a
O	word
O	was
O	said
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	manifest
O	to
O	all
O	that
O	a
O	great
O	misfortune
O	had
O	befallen
O	them
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	faces
O	of
O	these
O	men
O	were
O	clouded
O	with
O	discouragement
O	.
O	And
O	straightway
O	all
O	the
O	multitude
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	gathered
O	together
O	departed
O	every
O	man
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	place
O	.
O	There
O	needed
O	no
O	proclaiming
O	that
O	neither
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	nor
O	on
O	any
O	other
O	day
O	would
O	there
O	be
O	a
O	marching
O	to
O	the
O	Holy
O	City
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	8th
O	day
O	of
O	January
O	the
O	army
O	departed
O	from
O	Beitenoble
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	20th
O	it
O	came
O	,
O	after
O	much
O	toil
O	and
O	suffering
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	rain
O	and
O	tempest
O	scarcely
O	abated
O	for
O	a
O	single
O	hour
O	through
O	the
O	twelve
O	days
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Ascalon
O	.
O	For
O	some
O	little
O	time
O	,
O	King
O	Richard
O	and
O	his
O	army
O	dwelt
O	in
O	peace
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Ascalon
O	.
O	Nor
O	can
O	it
O	be
O	denied
O	that
O	they
O	gathered
O	strength;
O	the
O	sick
O	,
O	being
O	duly
O	handled
O	by
O	their
O	physicians
O	,
O	were
O	restored
O	to
O	a
O	sound
O	body
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	that
O	were
O	wearied
O	with
O	the
O	labours
O	of
O	long-continued
O	warfare
O	had
O	rest
O	and
O	refreshment
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	it
O	may
O	be
O	doubted
O	whether
O	the
O	King
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	advance
O	the
O	cause
O	at
O	all
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	in
O	hand
O	,
O	namely
O	,
O	the
O	taking
O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	City
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	chief
O	cause
O	was
O	this
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	Christians
O	,
O	not
O	having
O	for
O	the
O	present
O	a
O	common
O	foe
O	with
O	whom
O	to
O	contend
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	quarrel
O	among
O	themselves
O	more
O	grievously
O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	the
O	French
O	,
O	among
O	whom
O	,
O	now
O	that
O	the
O	French
O	King
O	had
O	departed
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	land
O	,
O	a
O	certain
O	Duke
O	of
O	Burgundy
O	was
O	chief
O	,
O	fell
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	with
O	such
O	heat
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	duke
O	departed
O	from
O	Ascalon
O	to
O	Acre
O	in
O	great
O	haste
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	Frenchmen
O	followed
O	him
O	.
O	Now
O	about
O	this
O	same
O	time
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	messenger
O	to
O	King
O	Richard
O	bearing
O	a
O	letter

O	one
O	that

O	in

O	in
O	his

O	he
O	should

O	absent

O	In
O	this

O	there
O	were
O	written
O	many

O	about
O	the
O	doings
O	of
O	Prince
O	John
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	brother:
O	how

O	the
O	French
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	'

O	damage
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	troubling
O	all
O	loyal
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	taken
O	all
O	the
O	money
O	that
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	treasury
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	King
O	heard
O	these
O	things
O	he
O	was
O	sore
O	distraught
O	.
O	And
O	indeed
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	strait
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	one

O	there

O	there
O	was
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his

O	at

O	For
O	in
O	the

O	it
O	was
O	plainly

O	On
O	the
O	9th
O	day
O	of
O	October
O	,
O	1192
O	,
O	did
O	King
O	Richard
O	set
O	sail
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	his

O	.
O	But
O	it
O	fared
O	ill
O	with
O	him
O	on
O	his
O	journey
O	.
O	For
O	it
O	fell
O	out
O	that

O	was
O	separated

O	that
O	when

O	a

O	duke
O	,

O	laid
O	hands
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	laid

O	in

O	There
O	he
O	remained
O	for
O	the
O	space
O	of
O	a
O	year
O	and
O	more
O	,
O	fretting
O	much

O	was
O	a
O	man
O	more
O	impatient
O	of

O	.
O	But
O	he
O	could
O	not

O	,
O	nor
O	did
O	his
O	friends
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	know
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	.
O	And

O	chance
O	,
O	there
O	was

O	Not
O	many
O	years
O	after

O	by
O	a

O	arrow
O	shot
O	from
O	the
O	walls
O	of
O	a
O	certain
O	castle
O	which
