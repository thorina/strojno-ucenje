O	up
O	and
O	mortal
O	men
O	might
O	eat
O	of
O	them
O	But
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
O	this
O	time
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	Dooros
O	Wood
O	they
O	kept
O	up
O	the
O	feasting
O	and
O	dancing
O	so
O	long
O	and
O	were
O	so
O	full
O	of
O	joy
O	because
O	of
O	their
O	victory
O	over
O	the

O	that

O	not

O	than
O	my

O	lost

O	a

O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	When
O	the
O	feast
O	was
O	ended
O	the

O	for

O	than
O	a
O	week
O	before
O	they
O	knew
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	s
O	fault
O	and
O	this
O	is
O	how
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	know
O	of
O	it
O	A
O	great
O	wedding
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	come
O	off
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	of
O	the
O	fairies
O	sent
O	six
O	of
O	her
O	pages
O	to
O	Dooros
O	Wood
O	to
O	catch
O	fifty
O	butterflies
O	with
O	golden
O	spots
O	on
O	their
O	purple
O	wings
O	and
O	fifty
O	white
O	without
O	speck
O	or
O	spot
O	and
O	fifty
O	golden
O	yellow
O	as
O	the
O	cowslip
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	dress
O	for
O	herself
O	and
O	a
O	hundred
O	white
O	without
O	speck
O	or
O	spot
O	to
O	make
O	dresses
O	for
O	the
O	bride
O	and
O	bridesmaids
O	When
O	the
O	pages
O	came
O	near
O	the
O	wood
O	they
O	heard
O	the
O	most
O	wonderful
O	music
O	and
O	the
O	sky
O	above
O	them
O	became
O	quite
O	dark
O	as
O	if
O	a
O	cloud
O	had
O	shut
O	out
O	the
O	sun
O	They
O	looked
O	up
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	cloud
O	was
O	formed
O	of
O	bees
O	who
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	swarm
O	were
O	flying
O	towards
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	humming
O	as
O	they
O	flew
O	Seeing
O	this
O	they
O	were
O	sore
O	afraid
O	until
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	bees
O	settling
O	on
O	a
O	single
O	tree
O	and
O	on
O	looking
O	closely
O	at
O	the
O	tree
O	they
O	saw
O	it
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	fairy
O	berries
O	The
O	bees
O	took
O	no
O	notice
O	of
O	the
O	fairies
O	and
O	so
O	they
O	were
O	no
O	longer
O	afraid
O	and
O	they
O	hunted
O	the
O	butterflies
O	until
O	they
O	had
O	captured
O	the
O	full
O	number
O	of
O	various
O	colors
O	Then
O	they
O	returned
O	to
O	fairyland
O	and
O	they
O	told
O	the
O	queen
O	about
O	the
O	bees
O	and
O	the
O	berries
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	told
O	the
O	king
O	The
O	king
O	was
O	very
O	angry
O	and
O	he
O	sent
O	his
O	heralds
O	to
O	the
O	four
O	corners
O	of
O	fairyland
O	to
O	summon
O	all
O	his
O	subjects
O	to
O	his
O	presence
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	find
O	out
O	without
O	delay
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	culprit
O	They
O	all
O	came
O	except
O	the
O	little
O	weeny
O	fellow
O	who
O	dropped
O	the
O	berry
O	and
O	of
O	course
O	everyone
O	said
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	fear
O	that
O	kept
O	him
O	away
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	be
O	guilty
O	The
O	heralds
O	were
O	at
O	once
O	sent
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	him
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	while
O	they
O	found
O	him
O	hiding
O	in
O	a
O	cluster
O	of
O	ferns
O	and
O	brought
O	him
O	before
O	the
O	king
O	The
O	poor
O	little
O	fellow
O	was
O	so
O	frightened
O	that
O	at
O	first
O	he
O	could
O	scarcely
O	speak
O	a
O	word
O	but
O	after
O	a
O	time
O	he
O	told
O	how
O	he
O	never
O	missed
O	the
O	berry
O	until
O	he
O	had
O	returned
O	to
O	fairyland
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	afraid
O	to
O	say
O	anything
O	to
O	anyone
O	about
O	it
O	The
O	king
O	who
O	would
O	hear
O	of
O	no
O	excuse
O	sentenced
O	the
O	little
O	culprit
O	to
O	be
O	banished
O	into
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	giants
O	beyond
O	the
O	mountains
O	to
O	stay
O	there
O	for
O	ever
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	unless
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	a
O	giant
O	willing
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	Dooros
O	Wood
O	and
O	guard
O	the
O	fairy
O	tree
O	When
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	pronounced
O	sentence
O	everyone
O	was
O	very
O	sorry
O	because
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	was
O	a
O	favorite
O	with
O	them
O	all
O	No
O	fairy
O	harper
O	upon
O	his
O	harp
O	or
O	piper
O	upon
O	his
O	pipe
O	or
O	fiddler
O	upon
O	his
O	fiddle
O	could
O	play
O	half
O	so
O	sweetly
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	play
O	upon
O	an
O	ivy
O	leaf
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	remembered
O	all
O	the
O	pleasant
O	moonlit
O	nights
O	on
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	danced
O	to
O	his
O	music
O	and
O	thought
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	never
O	hear
O	or
O	dance
O	to
O	it
O	any
O	more
O	their
O	little
O	hearts
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	sorrow
O	The
O	queen
O	was
O	as
O	sad
O	as
O	any
O	of
O	her
O	subjects
O	but
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	word
O	should
O	be
O	obeyed
O	When
O	the
O	time
O	came
O	for
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	to
O	set
O	out
O	into
O	exile
O	the
O	queen
O	sent
O	her
O	head
O	page
O	to
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	handful
O	of
O	berries
O	These
O	the
O	queen
O	said
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	offer
O	to
O	the
O	giants
O	and
O	say
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	that
O	the
O	giant
O	who
O	was
O	willing
O	to
O	guard
O	the
O	tree
O	could
O	feast
O	on
O	berries
O	just
O	as
O	sweet
O	from
O	morn
O	till
O	night
O	As
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	went
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	nearly
O	all
O	the
O	fairies
O	followed
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	borders
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	him
O	go
O	up
O	the
O	mountain
O	towards
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	they
O	all
O	took
O	off
O	their
O	little
O	red
O	caps
O	and
O	waved
O	them
O	until
O	he
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	On
O	he
O	went
O	walking
O	all
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	sun
O	rose
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	he
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	stretched
O	far
O	below
O	him
O	Before
O	beginning
O	his
O	descent
O	he
O	turned
O	round
O	for
O	a
O	last
O	glimpse
O	of
O	fairyland
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	nothing
O	for
O	a
O	thick
O	dark
O	cloud
O	shut
O	it
O	out
O	from
O	view
O	He
O	was
O	very
O	sad
O	and
O	tired
O	and
O	footsore
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	struggled
O	down
O	the
O	rough
O	mountain
O	side
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	thinking
O	of
O	the
O	soft
O	green
O	woods
O	and
O	mossy
O	pathways
O	of
O	the
O	pleasant
O	land
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	behind
O	him
O	When
O	he
O	awoke
O	the
O	ground
O	was
O	trembling
O	and
O	a
O	noise
O	that
O	sounded
O	like
O	thunder
O	fell
O	on
O	his
O	ears
O	He
O	looked
O	up
O	and
O	saw
O	coming
O	towards
O	him
O	a
O	terrible
O	giant
O	with
O	one
O	eye
O	that
O	burned
O	like
O	a
O	live
O	coal
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	his
O	forehead
O	his
O	mouth
O	stretched
O	from
O	ear
O	to
O	ear
O	his
O	teeth
O	were
O	long
O	and
O	crooked
O	the
O	skin
O	of
O	his
O	face
O	was
O	as
O	black
O	as
O	night
O	and
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	chest
O	were
O	all
O	covered
O	with
O	black
O	shaggy
O	hair
O	round
O	his
O	body
O	was
O	an
O	iron
O	band
O	and
O	hanging
O	from
O	this
O	by
O	a
O	chain
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	club
O	with
O	iron
O	spikes
O	With
O	one
O	blow
O	of
O	this
O	club
O	he
O	could
O	break
O	a
O	rock
O	into
O	splinters
O	and
O	fire
O	could
O	not
O	burn
O	him
O	and

O	could
O	not
O	drown
O	him
O	and

O	could
O	not
O	wound
O	him
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	way
O	to
O	kill
O	him
O	but
O	by
O	giving
O	him
O	three
O	blows
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	club
O	And
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	bad
O	tempered
O	that
O	the
O	other
O	giants
O	called
O	him
O	Sharvan
O	the
O	Surly
O	When
O	the

O	spied
O	the
O	red
O	cap
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	fairy
O	he
O	gave
O	the
O	shout
O	that
O	sounded
O	like
O	thunder
O	The
O	poor
O	fairy
O	was
O	shaking
O	from

O	Then
O	the

O	land
O	but
O	a
O	black

O	tried
O	to
O	cross
O	them
O	his

O	stuck
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	move
O	a
O	step
O	Sharvan
O	gave
O	three
O	loud
O	shouts
O	that
O	were
O	heard
O	all
O	over
O	fairyland
O	and
O	made
O	the

O	in
O	the

O	tremble
O	as
O	if

O	Oh

O	Mr
O	Giant
O	let
O	me
O	out
O	said
O	Pinkeen
O	Sharvan
O	took
O	out
O	the

O	fellow
O	who
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	he
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	borders
O	of
O	fairyland
O	ran
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	his
O	legs
O	could
O	carry
O	him
O	and
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	gone
O	very
O	far
O	he
O	met
O	all
O	the
O	little
O	fairies
O	who
O	hearing
O	the
O	shouts
O	of
O	the
O	giant
O	came
O	trooping
O	out
O	from
O	the
O	ferns
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter
O	Pinkeen
O	told
O	them
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	giant
O	who
O	was
O	to
O	guard
O	the
O	tree
O	shouting
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	stuck
O	fast
O	on
O	the
O	borders
O	and
O	they
O	need
O	have
O	no
O	fear
O	of
O	him
O	The
O	fairies
O	were
O	so
O	delighted
O	to
O	have
O	Pinkeen
O	back
O	again
O	that
O	they
O	took
O	him
O	up
O	on
O	their
O	shoulders
O	and
O	carried
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	palace
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	harpers
O	and
O	pipers
O	and
O	fiddlers
O	marched
O	before
O	him
O	playing
O	the
O	most
O	jocund
O	music
O	that
O	was
O	ever
O	heard
O	The
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	were
O	on
O	the
O	lawn
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	when
O	the
O	gay
O	procession
O	came
O	up
O	and
O	halted
O	before
O	them
O	The
O	queen
O	s
O	eyes
O	glistened
O	with
O	pleasure
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	little
O	favorite
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	also
O	glad
O	at
O	heart
O	but
O	he
O	looked
O	very
O	grave
O	as
O	he
O	said
O	Why
O	have
O	you
O	returned
O	sirrah
O	Then
O	Pinkeen
O	told
O	his
O	majesty
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	with
O	him
O	a
O	giant
O	who
O	was
O	willing
O	to
O	guard
O	the
O	fairy
O	tree
O	And
O	who
O	is
O	he
O	and
O	where
O	is
O	he
O	asked
O	the
O	king
O	The
O	other
O	giants
O	called
O	him
O	Sharvan
O	the
O	Surly
O	said
O	Pinkeen
O	and
O	he
O	is
O	stuck
O	fast
O	outside
O	the
O	borders
O	of
O	fairyland
O	It
O	is
O	well
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	you
O	are
O	pardoned
O	When
O	the
O	fairies
O	heard
O	this
O	they
O	tossed
O	their
O	little
O	red
O	caps
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	and
O	cheered
O	so
O	loudly
O	that
O	a
O	bee
O	who
O	was
O	clinging
O	to
O	a
O	rose
O	bud
O	fell
O	senseless
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	Then
O	the
O	king
O	ordered
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	pages
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	handful
O	of
O	berries
O	and
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	Sharvan
O	and
O	show
O	him
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	Dooros
O	Wood
O	The
O	page
O	taking
O	the
O	berries
O	with
O	him
O	went
O	off
O	to
O	Sharvan
O	whose
O	roaring
O	nearly
O	frightened
O	the
O	poor
O	little
O	fellow
O	to
O	death
O	But
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	giant
O	tasted
O	the
O	berries
O	he
O	got
O	into
O	good
O	humor
O	and
O	he
O	asked
O	the
O	page
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	remove
O	the
O	spell
O	of
O	enchantment
O	from
O	him
O	I
O	can
O	said
O	the
O	page
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	if
O	you
O	promise
O	me
O	that
O	you
O	will
O	not
O	try
O	to
O	cross
O	the
O	borders
O	of
O	fairyland
O	I
O	promise
O	that
O	with
O	all
O	my
O	heart
O	said
O	the
O	giant
O	But
O	hurry
O	on
O	my
O	little
O	man
O	for
O	there
O	are
O	pins
O	and
O	needles
O	in
O	my
O	legs
O	The
O	page
O	plucked
O	a
O	cowslip
O	and
O	picking
O	out
O	the
O	five
O	little
O	crimson
O	spots
O	in
O	the
O	cup
O	of
O	it
O	he
O	flung
O	one
O	to
O	the
O	north
O	and
O	one
O	to
O	the
O	south
O	and
O	one
O	to
O	the
O	east
O	and
O	one
O	to
O	the
O	west
O	and
O	one
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	sky
O	and
O	the
O	spell
O	was
O	broken
O	and
O	the
O	giant
O	s
O	limbs
O	were
O	free
O	Then
O	Sharvan
O	and
O	the
O	fairy
O	page
O	set
O	off
O	for
O	Dooros
O	Wood
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	until
O	they
O	came
O	within
O	view
O	of
O	the
O	fairy
O	tree
O	When
O	Sharvan
O	saw
O	the
O	berries
O	glistening
O	in
O	the
O	sun
O	he
O	gave
O	a
O	shout
O	so
O	loud
O	and
O	strong
O	that
O	the
O	wind
O	of
O	it
O	blew
O	the
O	little
O	fairy
O	back
O	to
O	fairyland
O	But
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	wood
O	to
O	tell
O	the
O	giant
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	stay
O	all
O	day
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the

O	ready
O	to

O	battle
O	with
O	anyone
O	who
O	might
O	come
O	to
O	steal
O	the
O	berries
O	and
O	that
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	sleep
O	amongst
O	the
O	branches
O	All
O	right
O	said
O	the
O	giant
O	who
O	could
O	scarcely
O	speak
O	as
O	his
O	mouth
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	berries
O	Well
O	the
O	fame
O	of
O	the
O	fairy
O	tree
O	spread
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	and
O	every
O	day
O	some
O	adventurer
O	came
O	to
O	try
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	carry
O	away
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	berries
O	but
O	the
O	giant
O	true
O	to
O	his
O	word
O	was
O	always
O	on
O	the
O	watch
O	and
O	not
O	a
O	single
O	day
O	passed
O	on
O	which
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	fight
O	and
O	slay
O	a
O	daring
O	champion
O	and
O	the
O	giant
O	never
O	received
O	a
O	wound
O	for
O	fire
O	could
O	not
O	burn
O	him
O	nor

O	drown
O	him
O	nor

O	wound
O	him
O	Now
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	when
O	Sharvan
O	was
O	keeping
O	watch
O	and
O	ward
O	over
O	the
O	tree
O	a
O	cruel
O	king
O	was
O	reigning
O	over
O	the
O	lands
O	that
O	looked
O	towards
O	the

O	He
O	had
O	slain
O	the
O	rightful
O	king
O	by
O	foul
O	means
O	and
O	his
O	subjects
O	loving
O	their
O	murdered
O	sovereign
O	hated
O	the
O	usurper
O	but
O	much
O	as
O	they
O	hated
O	him
O	they
O	feared
O	him
O	more
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	brave
O	and
O	masterful
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	armed
O	with
O	a
O	helmet
O	and
O	shield
O	which
O	no
O	weapon
O	made
O	by
O	mortal
O	hands
O	could

O	and
O	he
O	carried
O	always
O	with

O	two
O	javelins
O	that
O	never
O	missed
O	their

O	The

O	that
O	scarcely

O	And
O	shunned

O	One
O	day
O	when

O	very
O	lonely
O	a

O	fallen
O	about

O	came
O	every
O	day
O	and
O	he
O	sang
O	so
O	sweetly
O	for
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	almost
O	forgot
O	her
O	loneliness
O	and
O	misery
O	But
O	once
O	while
O	the
O	robin
O	was
O	with
O	her
O	the
O	tyrant
O	king
O	s
O	daughter
O	who
O	was
O	very
O	beautiful
O	passed
O	with
O	her
O	maids
O	of
O	honor
O	and
O	seeing
O	Rosaleen
O	the
O	princess
O	said
O	Oh
O	there
O	is
O	that
O	horrid
O	ugly
O	thing
O	The
O	maids
O	laughed
O	and
O	giggled
O	and
O	said
O	they
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	such
O	a
O	fright
O	Poor
O	Rosaleen
O	felt

O	and
O	when

O	and
O	her
O	maids
O	were
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	she
O	almost
O	cried
O	her
O	eyes
O	out
O	When
O	the
O	robin
O	saw
O	her
O	crying
O	he
O	perched
O	on
O	her
O	shoulder
O	and
O	rubbed
O	his
O	little
O	head
O	against
O	her
O	neck
O	and
O	chirruped
O	softly
O	in
O	her
O	ear
O	and
O	Rosaleen
O	was
O	comforted
O	for
O	she
O	felt
O	she
O	had
O	at
O	least
O	one
O	friend
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	although
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	a
O	little
O	robin
O	But
O	the
O	robin
O	could
O	do
O	more
O	for
O	her
O	than
O	she
O	could
O	dream
O	of
O	He
O	heard
O	the
O	remark
O	made
O	by
O	the
O	princess
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	Rosaleen
O	s
O	tears
O	and
O	he
O	knew
O	now
O	why
O	she
O	was
O	shunned
O	by
O	everybody
O	and
O	why
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	unhappy
O	And
O	that
O	very
O	evening
O	he
O	flew
O	off
O	to
O	Dooros
O	Wood
O	and
O	called
O	on
O	a

O	When
O	the
O	robin
O	had

O	bemoaning
O	her

O	he
O	put
O	the
O	berry
O	between

O	passed
O	away

O	she
O	became
O	as
O	lovely
O	as
O	the
O	flower
O	of
O	beauty
O	Just
O	then
O	the
O	warriors
O	on
O	the
O	snow
O	white
O	steeds
O	came
O	up

O	with
O	the
O	mantle
O	of
O	yellow
O	silk
O	and
O	the

O	leaped
O	from

O	before

O	said
O	Fairest

O	leaving
O	the
O	prince
O	wondering
O	who
O	she
O	could
O	be
O	The
O	prince
O	then

O	a

O	the

O	she
O	had
O	not
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	restoration
O	of
O	her
O	beauty
O	Before
O	another
O	word
O	could
O	be
O	spoken
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	and
O	the
O	clang
O	of
O	arms
O	were
O	heard
O	outside
O	the
O	palace
O	The
O	king
O	and
O	his
O	guests
O	started
O	from
O	their
O	seats
O	and
O	drew
O	their
O	swords
O	and
O	the
O	bards
O	raised
O	the
O	song
O	of
O	battle
O	but
O	their
O	voices
O	were
O	stilled
O	and
O	their
O	harps
O	silenced
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	at
O	the
O	threshold
O	of
O	the
O	banquet
O	hall
O	a
O	battle
O	champion
O	in
O	whose

O	they
O	recognized
O	the
O	features
O	of
O	their
O	murdered
O	king
O	Tis
O	Niall
O	come
O	back
O	to
O	claim

O	Long

O	Niall
O	Long
O	live
O	Niall
O	answered
O	all
O	the
O	others
O	The
O	king
O	white
O	with
O	rage
O	and
O	amazement
O	turned
O	to
O	the
O	chiefs
O	and
O	nobles
O	of
O	his
O	court
O	and
O	cried
O	out
O	Is
O	there
O	none
O	loyal
O	enough
O	to
O	drive
O	that
O	intruder
O	from
O	the

O	hall
O	But
O	no
O	one
O	stirred
O	and
O	no
O	answer
O	was
O	given
O	Then
O	the
O	king
O	rushed
O	forward
O	alone
O	but
O	before
O	he
O	could
O	reach
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	Niall
O	was
O	standing
O	he
O	was
O	seized
O	by
O	a
O	dozen
O	chiefs
O	and
O	at
O	once
O	disarmed
O	During
O	this
O	scene
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	daughter
O	had
O	fled
O	frightened
O	but
O	Rosaleen
O	attracted
O	by
O	the
O	noise
O	and
O	hearing
O	her
O	brother
O	s
O	name
O	and
O	the
O	cheers
O	which
O	greeted
O	it
O	had
O	entered
O	the
O	banquet
O	hall
O	unperceived
O	by
O	anyone
O	But
O	when
O	her
O	presence
O	was
O	discovered
O	every
O	eye
O	was
O	dazzled
O	with
O	her
O	beauty
O	Niall
O	looked
O	at
O	her
O	for
O	a
O	second
O	wondering
O	if
O	the
O	radiant
O	maiden
O	before
O	him
O	could
O	be
O	the
O	little
O	sister
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	separated
O	from
O	for
O	so
O	many
O	years
O	In
O	another
O	second
O	she
O	was
O	clasped
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	Then
O	the
O	feast
O	was
O	spread
O	again
O	and
O	Niall
O	told
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	his
O	adventures
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	Prince
O	of
O	the
O	Sunny
O	Valley
O	asked
O	for
O	the
O	hand
O	of
O	Rosaleen
O	Niall
O	told
O	his
O	lovely
O	sister
O	to
O	speak
O	for
O	herself
O	With
O	downcast
O	eyes
O	and
O	smiling
O	lips
O	she
O	said
O	yes
O	and
O	that
O	very
O	day
O	was
O	the
O	gayest
O	and
O	brightest
O	wedding
O	that
O	ever
O	took
O	place
O	and
O	Rosaleen
O	became
O	the
O	prince
O	s
O	bride
O	In
O	her
O	happiness
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	forget
O	the
O	little
O	robin
O	who
O	was
O	her
O	friend
O	in
O	sorrow
O	She
O	took
O	him
O	home
O	with
O	her
O	to
O	Sunny
O	Valleys
O	and
O	every
O	day
O	she
O	fed
O	him
O	with
O	her
O	own
O	hands
O	and
O	every
O	day
O	he
O	sang
O	for
