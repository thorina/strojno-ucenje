O	left
O	upon
O	the
O	edges
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	hold
O	,
O	striving
O	to
O	hold
O	it
O	back
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	no
O	doubt
O	,
O	now
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	his
O	mother
O	.
O	To
O	get
O	free
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	Toad-Woman
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	necessary
O	that
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	should
O	kill
O	a
O	fat
O	bear;
O	and
O	,
O	being
O	directed
O	by
O	Spirit-Iron
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	very
O	wise
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	matter
O	,
O	he
O	secured
O	the
O	fattest
O	in
O	all
O	that
O	country;
O	and
O	having
O	stripped
O	a
O	tall
O	pine
O	of
O	all
O	its
O	bark
O	and
O	branches
O	,
O	he
O	perched
O	the
O	carcass
O	in
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	head
O	to
O	the
O	east
O	and
O	its
O	tail
O	due
O	west
O	.
O	Returning
O	to
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	he
O	informed
O	the
O	old
O	Toad-Woman
O	that
O	the
O	fat
O	bear
O	was
O	ready
O	for
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	go
O	very
O	far
O	,
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	to
O	get
O	it
O	.
O	She
O	answered:
O	"""It"
O	is
O	not
O	so
O	far
O	but
O	that
O	I
O	can
O	get
O	"it;"""
O	for
O	of
O	all
O	things
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	a
O	fat
O	bear
O	was
O	the
O	delight
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	Toad-Woman
O	.
O	She
O	at
O	once
O	set
O	forth;
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	no
O	sooner
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	than
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	and
O	his
O	dog
O	,
O	Spirit-Iron
O	,
O	blowing
O	a
O	strong
O	breath
O	in
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	Toad-Woman's
O	four
O	children
O	(
O	who
O	were
O	all
O	bad
O	spirits
O	,
O	or
O	bear-fiends
O	)
O	,
O	they
O	put
O	out
O	their
O	life
O	.
O	They
O	then
O	set
O	them
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	having
O	first
O	thrust
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	the
O	white
O	fat
O	in
O	each
O	of
O	their
O	mouths
O	.
O	The
O	Toad-Woman
O	spent
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	in
O	finding
O	the
O	bear
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	after
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	made
O	at
O	least
O	five
O	and
O	twenty
O	attempts
O	before
O	she
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	climb
O	to
O	the
O	carcass
O	.
O	She
O	slipped
O	down
O	three
O	times
O	where
O	she
O	went
O	up
O	once
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	returned
O	with
O	the
O	great
O	bear
O	on
O	her
O	back
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	drew
O	near
O	her
O	lodge
O	she
O	was
O	astonished
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	four
O	children
O	standing
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	door-posts
O	with
O	the
O	fat
O	in
O	their
O	mouths
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	angry
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	out:
O	"""Why"
O	do
O	you
O	thus
O	insult
O	the
O	pomatum
O	of
O	your
O	brother
O	?
O	""""
O	She
O	was
O	still
O	more
O	angry
O	when
O	they
O	made
O	no
O	answer
O	to
O	her
O	complaint;
O	but
O	when
O	she
O	found
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	stark
O	dead
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	in
O	this
O	way
O	to
O	mock
O	her
O	,
O	her
O	fury
O	was
O	very
O	great
O	indeed
O	.
O	She
O	ran
O	after
O	the
O	tracks
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	and
O	his
O	mother
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	she
O	could;
O	so
O	fast
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	point

O	overtaking
O	them
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	dog
O	,
O	Spirit-Iron
O	,
O	coming
O	close
O	up
O	to
O	his
O	master

O	whispered
O	to
O	"him--""Snakeberry"

O	cried
O	out
O	the
O	young
O	man;
O	and
O	immediately
O	the
O	berries
O	spread
O	like
O	scarlet
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	path
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	distance;
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	Toad-Woman
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	almost
O	as
O	fond
O	of
O	these
O	berries
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	of
O	fat
O	bears
O	,
O	could
O	not
O	avoid
O	stooping
O	down
O	to
O	pick

O	The
O	old
O	Toad-Woman
O	was
O	very
O	anxious
O	to

O	,
O	but
O	the
O	snakeberry-vines
O	kept
O	spreading
O	out
O	on

O	they
O	still
O	grow

O	spread;
O	and
O	to
O	this
O	day
O	the
O	wicked
O	old
O	Toad-Woman
O	is
O	busy
O	picking
O	the

O	the
