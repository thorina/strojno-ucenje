O	There
O	was
O	once
O	a
O	young
O	fellow
O	whom
O	fortune
O	had
O	blessed
O	with
O	a
O	good
O	mother
O	,
O	a
O	clever
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	strong
O	body
O	.
O	But
O	beyond
O	this
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	much
O	favoured
O	him;
O	and
O	though
O	able
O	and
O	willing
O	to
O	work
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	often
O	little
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	and
O	less
O	to
O	eat
O	.
O	But
O	his
O	mother
O	had
O	taught
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	contented
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	lot
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	feel
O	for
O	others
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	from
O	her
O	he
O	inherited
O	a
O	great
O	love
O	for
O	flowers
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	when
O	his
O	pockets
O	were
O	emptiest
O	,
O	a
O	fair
O	was
O	held
O	in
O	the
O	neighbouring
O	town
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	must
O	needs
O	go
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	money
O	to
O	spend
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	stuck
O	a
O	buttercup
O	in
O	his
O	cap
O	,
O	for
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	pay
O	,
O	and
O	strode
O	along
O	as
O	merrily
O	as
O	the
O	most
O	.
O	Towards
O	evening
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	merrymakers
O	became
O	riotous;
O	and
O	a
O	party
O	of
O	them
O	fell
O	upon
O	an
O	old
O	Jew
O	who
O	was
O	keeping
O	a
O	stall
O	of
O	glass
O	and
O	china
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	smash
O	his
O	stock
O	.
O	Now
O	as
O	the
O	Jew
O	stood
O	before
O	his
O	booth
O	beseeching
O	them
O	to
O	spare
O	his
O	property
O	,
O	up
O	came
O	the
O	strong
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	flower
O	still
O	unwithered
O	in
O	his
O	cap
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	old
O	Jew's
O	part
O	and
O	defended
O	him
O	.
O	For
O	from
O	childhood
O	his
O	mother
O	had
O	taught
O	him
O	to
O	feel
O	for
O	others
O	.
O	So
O	those
O	who
O	would
O	have
O	ill-treated
O	the
O	old
O	Jew
O	now
O	moved
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	stayed
O	with
O	him
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	packed
O	up
O	his
O	wares
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Jew
O	turned
O	towards
O	him

O	said

O	the

O	Then
O	the
