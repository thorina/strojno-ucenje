O	thus

O	with
O	them
O	for
O	many

O	all
O	the
O	world
O	to
O	travel
O	over
O	.
O	The
O	hunter
O	and

O	wife
O	were
O	happy
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	gone
O	,

O	looked
O	every
O	moment
O	to

O	by
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	tried
O	the
O	arrows
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	never
O	failed
O	to
O	bring
O	down
O	whatever
O	they
O	were
O	aimed
O	at
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	lived
O	on
O	,
O	prosperous
O	and
O	contented
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	year
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	the
O	hunter
O	being
O	absent
O	,
O	his
O	wife
O	on
O	going
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	saw
O	something
O	like
O	a
O	black
O	cloud
O	approaching
O	.
O	She
O	looked
O	until
O	it
O	came
O	near
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	perceived
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	another
O	Weendigo
O	or
O	Giant
O	Cannibal
O	.
O	Remembering
O	the
O	good
O	conduct
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	fear
O	of
O	this
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	to
O	look
O	into
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	so;
O	and
O	finding
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	glared
O	around
O	,
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	food
O	at
O	hand
O	,
O	he
O	grew
O	very
O	wroth
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	being
O	sorely
O	disappointed
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	lodge
O	and
O	threw
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	winds
O	.
O	He
O	seemed
O	hardly
O	at
O	first
O	to
O	notice
O	the
O	woman
O	in
O	his
O	anger;
O	but
O	presently
O	he
O	cast
O	a
O	fierce
O	glance
O	upon
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	seizing
O	her
O	by
O	the
O	waist
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	her
O	cries
O	and
O	entreaties
O	,
O	he
O	bore
O	her
O	off
O	.
O	To
O	the
O	little
O	son
O	,
O	who
O	ran
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	lamenting
O	,
O	he
O	paid
O	no
O	heed
O	.
O	At
O	night-fall
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	hunter
O	returned
O	from
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	amazed
O	.
O	His
O	lodge
O	was
O	gone
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	his
O	son
O	sitting
O	near
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	it
O	had
O	stood
O	,
O	shedding
O	tears
O	.
O	The
O	son
O	pointed
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	the
O	Weendigo
O	had
O	taken
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	father
O	hurried
O	along
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	remains
O	of
O	his
O	wife
O	strewn
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	The
O	hunter
O	blackened
O	his
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	vowed
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	revenge
O	.
O	He
O	built
O	another
O	lodge
O	,
O	and
O	gathering
O	together
O	the
O	bones
O	of
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	he
O	placed
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	hollow
O	part
O	of
O	a
O	dry
O	tree
O	.
O	He
O	left
O	his
O	boy
O	to
O	take
O	care
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	absent

O	hunting
O	and
O	roaming
O	about
O	from
O	place
O	to
O	place
O	,
O	striving
O	to
O	forget
O	his
O	misfortune
O	,
O	and
O	searching
O	for
O	the
O	wicked
O	Weendigo
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	gone
O	but
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	one
O	morning

O	had

O	luck

O	shot
O	another
O	,

O	in
O	the
O	same
O	way;
O	and
O	returning
O	to
O	the
O	lodge
O	to
O	replenish
O	his
O	quiver
O	,
O	he

O	to
O	espy
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	lucky
O	arrows
O	,
O	which
O	the

O	reached
O	up

O	shot

O	could
O	spare
O	from
O	the
O	chase
O	to
O	the
O	society
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	children;
O	but
O	,
O	what
O	affected
O	him
O	the
O	most
O	,
O	both
O	of
O	his
O	sons
O	,
O	although
O	they
O	were
O	well-formed
O	and
O	beautiful
O	,
O	grew
O	no
O	more
O	in
O	stature
O	,
O	but
O	remained
O	children
O	still
O	.
O	Every
O	day
O	they
O	resembled
O	each
O	other
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	never
O	ceased
O	to
O	sport
O	and
O	divert
O	themselves
O	in
O	the
O	innocent
O	ways
O	of
O	childhood
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	the
O	hunter
O	had
O	gone
O	abroad
O	with
O	his
O	bow
O	and
O	arrows
O	,
O	leaving
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	request
O	of
O	the
O	strange
O	boy
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	shafts
O	which
O	the
O	friendly
O	Weendigo
O	had
O	given
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	behind
O	in
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	returned
O	,
O	what
O	were
O	his
O	surprise
O	and
O	joy
O	to
O	see
O	stretched
O	dead
O	by
O	his
O	lodge-door
O	,
O	the
O	black
O	giant
O	who
O	had
O	slain
O	his
O	wife
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	stricken
O	down
O	by
O	the
O	magic
O	shaft
O	in
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	stranger
O	from
O	the
O	tree;
O	and
O	ever
O	after
O	the
O	boy
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	Bone-Dwarf
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	called
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	guardian
O	and
O	good
O	genius
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	evil
O	spirit
O	,
O	giant
O	,
O	or
O	Weendigo
O	,
O	dared
O	approach
O	it
O	to
O	mar
O	their
O	peace
O	.
