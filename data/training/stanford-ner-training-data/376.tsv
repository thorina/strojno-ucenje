O	Ogier
O	the
O	Dane
O	was
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	Geoffroy
O	,
O	who
O	wrested
O	Denmark
O	from
O	the
O	Pagans
O	,
O	and
O	reigned
O	the
O	first
O	Christian
O	king
O	of
O	that
O	country
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	education
O	nothing
O	was
O	neglected
O	to
O	elevate
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	standard
O	of
O	a
O	perfect
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	render
O	him
O	accomplished
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	arts
O	necessary
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	a
O	hero
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	hardly
O	reached
O	the
O	age
O	of
O	sixteen
O	years
O	,
O	when
O	Charlemagne
O	,
O	whose
O	power
O	was
O	established
O	over
O	all
O	the
O	sovereigns
O	of
O	his
O	time
O	,
O	recollected
O	that
O	Geoffroy
O	,
O	Ogier's
O	father
O	,
O	had
O	omitted
O	to
O	render
O	the
O	homage
O	due
O	to
O	him
O	as
O	emperor
O	,
O	and
O	sovereign
O	lord
O	of
O	Denmark
O	.
O	He
O	accordingly
O	sent
O	an
O	embassy
O	to
O	demand
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Denmark
O	this
O	homage
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	receiving
O	a
O	refusal
O	,
O	sent
O	an
O	army
O	to
O	enforce
O	the
O	demand
O	.
O	Geoffroy
O	,
O	after
O	an
O	unsuccessful
O	resistance
O	,
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	comply
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	a
O	pledge
O	of
O	his
O	sincerity
O	,
O	delivered
O	Ogier
O	,
O	his
O	eldest
O	son
O	,
O	a
O	hostage
O	to
O	Charles
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	brought
O	up
O	at
O	his
O	court
O	.
O	Ogier
O	grew
O	up
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	handsome
O	and
O	amiable
O	every
O	day
O	.
O	He
O	surpassed
O	in
O	form
O	,
O	strength
O	,
O	and
O	address
O	all
O	the
O	noble
O	youths
O	his
O	companions;
O	he
O	failed
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	present
O	at
O	all
O	tourneys;
O	he
O	was
O	attentive
O	to
O	the
O	elder
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	burned
O	with
O	impatience
O	to
O	imitate
O	them
O	.
O	Yet
O	his
O	heart
O	rose
O	sometimes
O	in
O	secret
O	against
O	his
O	condition
O	as
O	a
O	hostage
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	one
O	apparently
O	forgotten
O	by
O	his
O	father
O	.
O	Ogier's
O	mother
O	having
O	died
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	married
O	a
O	second
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	son
O	named
O	Guyon
O	.
O	The
O	new
O	queen
O	had
O	absolute
O	power
O	over
O	her
O	husband
O	,
O	and
O	fearing
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	should
O	see
O	Ogier
O	again
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	preference
O	over
O	Guyon
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	adroitly
O	persuaded
O	him
O	to
O	delay
O	rendering
O	his
O	homage
O	to
O	Charlemagne
O	,
O	till
O	now
O	four
O	years
O	had
O	passed
O	away
O	since
O	the
O	last
O	renewal
O	of
O	that
O	ceremony
O	.
O	Charlemagne
O	,
O	irritated
O	at
O	this
O	delinquency
O	,
O	drew
O	closer
O	the
O	bonds
O	of
O	Ogier's
O	captivity
O	until
O	he
O	should
O	receive
O	a
O	response
O	from
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Denmark
O	to
O	a
O	fresh
O	summons
O	which
O	he
O	caused
O	to
O	be
O	sent
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	answer
O	of
O	Geoffroy
O	was
O	insulting
O	and
O	defiant
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rage
O	of
O	Charlemagne
O	was
O	roused
O	in
O	the
O	highest
O	degree
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	at
O	first
O	disposed
O	to
O	wreak
O	his
O	vengeance
O	upon
O	Ogier
O	,
O	his
O	hostage;
O	but
O	consented
O	to
O	spare
O	his
O	life
O	,
O	if
O	Ogier
O	would
O	swear
O	fidelity
O	to
O	him
O	as
O	his
O	liege-lord
O	,
O	and
O	promise
O	not
O	to
O	quit
O	his
O	court
O	without
O	his
O	permission
O	.
O	Ogier
O	accepted
O	these
O	terms
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	allowed
O	to
O	retain
O	all
O	the
O	freedom
O	he
O	had
O	before
O	enjoyed
O	.
O	The
O	emperor
O	would
O	have
O	immediately
O	taken
O	arms
O	to
O	reduce
O	his
O	disobedient
O	vassal
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	called
O	off
O	in
O	another
O	direction
O	by
O	a
O	message
O	from
O	Pope
O	Leo
O	,
O	imploring
O	his
O	assistance
O	.
O	The
O	Saracens
O	had
O	landed
O	in
O	the
O	neighborhood
O	of
O	Rome
O	,
O	and
O	prepared
O	to
O	carry
O	fire
O	and
O	sword
O	to
O	the
O	capital
O	of
O	the
O	Christian
O	world
O	.
O	Charlemagne
O	speedily
O	assembled
O	an
O	army
O	,
O	crossed
O	the
O	Alps
O	,
O	traversed
O	Italy
O	,
O	and
O	arrived
O	at
O	Spoleto
O	,
O	a
O	strong
O	place
O	to
O	which
O	the
O	Pope
O	had
O	retired
O	.
O	He
O	stopped
O	but
O	two
O	days
O	at
O	Spoleto
O	,
O	and
O	learning
O	that
O	the
O	Infidels
O	were
O	besieging
O	the
O	Capitol
O	,
O	marched
O	promptly
O	to
O	attack
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	advanced
O	posts
O	of
O	the
O	army
O	were
O	commanded
O	by
O	Duke
O	Namo
O	,
O	on
O	whom
O	Ogier
O	waited
O	as
O	his
O	squire
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	yet
O	bear
O	arms
O	,
O	not
O	having
O	received
O	the
O	order
O	of
O	knighthood
O	.
O	The
O	Oriflamme
O	,
O	the
O	royal
O	standard
O	,
O	was
O	borne
O	by
O	a
O	knight
O	named
O	Alory
O	,
O	who
O	showed
O	himself
O	unworthy
O	of
O	the
O	honor
O	.
O	Duke
O	Namo
O	,
O	seeing
O	a
O	strong
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	Infidels
O	advancing
O	to
O	attack
O	him
O	,
O	gave
O	the
O	word
O	to
O	charge
O	them
O	.
O	Ogier
O	remained
O	in
O	the
O	rear
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	youths
O	,
O	grieving
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	permitted
O	to
O	fight
O	.
O	Very
O	soon
O	he
O	saw
O	Alory
O	lower
O	the
O	Oriflamme
O	,
O	and
O	turn
O	his
O	horse
O	in
O	flight
O	.
O	Ogier
O	pointed
O	him
O	out
O	to
O	the
O	young
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	seizing
O	a
O	club
O	,
O	rushed
O	upon
O	Alory
O	and
O	struck
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	companions
O	,
O	he
O	disarmed
O	him
O	,
O	clothed
O	himself
O	in
O	his
O	armor
O	,
O	raised
O	the
O	Oriflamme
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	mounting
O	the
O	horse
O	of
O	the
O	unworthy
O	knight
O	,
O	flew
O	to
O	the
O	front
O	rank
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	joined
O	Duke
O	Namo
O	,
O	drove
O	back
O	the
O	Infidels
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	the
O	Oriflamme
O	quite
O	through
O	their
O	broken
O	ranks
O	.
O	The
O	duke
O	,
O	thinking
O	it
O	was
O	Alory
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	held
O	in
O	high
O	esteem
O	,
O	was
O	astonished
O	at
O	his
O	strength
O	and
O	valor
O	.
O	Ogier's
O	young
O	companions
O	imitated
O	him
O	,
O	supplying
O	themselves
O	with
O	armor
O	from
O	the
O	bodies
O	of
O	the
O	slain;
O	they
O	followed
O	Ogier
O	and
O	carried
O	death
O	into
O	the
O	ranks
O	of
O	the
O	Saracens
O	,
O	who
O	fell
O	back
O	in
O	confusion
O	upon
O	their
O	main
O	body
O	.
O	Duke
O	Namo
O	now
O	ordered
O	a
O	retreat
O	,
O	and
O	Ogier
O	obeyed
O	with
O	reluctance
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	perceived
O	Charlemagne
O	advancing
O	to
O	their
O	assistance
O	.
O	The
O	combat
O	now
O	became
O	general
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	more
O	terrible
O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	Charlemagne
O	had
O	overthrown
O	Corsuble
O	,
O	the
O	commander
O	of
O	the
O	Saracens
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	drawn
O	his
O	famous
O	sword
O	,
O	Joyeuse
O	,
O	to
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	when
O	two
O	Saracen
O	knights
O	set
O	upon
O	him
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	whom
O	slew
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	overthrew
O	the
O	emperor
O	on
O	the
O	sand
O	.
O	Perceiving
O	by
O	the
O	eagle
O	on
O	his
O	casque
O	who
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	they
O	dismounted
O	in
O	haste
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	his
O	death-blow
O	.
O	Never
O	was
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	the
O	emperor
O	in
O	such
O	peril
O	.
O	But
O	Ogier
O	,
O	who
O	saw
O	him
O	fall
O	,
O	flew
O	to
O	his
O	rescue
O	.
O	Though
O	embarrassed
O	with
O	the
O	Oriflamme
O	,
O	he
O	pushed
O	his
O	horse
O	against
O	one

O	Saracens

O	knocked

O	the

O	so
O	vigorous
O	a
O	blow
O	that
O	he
O	fell
O	stunned

O	helping
