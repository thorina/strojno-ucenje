O	On
O	a

O	lies
O	his

O	and
O	in
O	the

O	made
O	of

O	beautifully
O	polished
O	West
O	India
O	wood
O	Somewhat
O	such
O	an
O	aspect
O	as
O	this
O	did
O	Phips
O	present
O	when
O	he
O	sat
O	in
O	Grandfather's
O	chair
O	after
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	appointed
O	him
O	Governor
O	of
O	Massachusetts
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	William
O	Phips
O	had
O	not
O	always
O	worn
O	a
O	gold-embroidered
O	coat
O	,
O	nor
O	always
O	sat
O	so
O	much
O	at
O	his
O	ease
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	in
O	Grandfather's
O	chair
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	poor
O	man's
O	son
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	born
O	in
O	the
O	province
O	of
O	Maine
O	,
O	where
O	in
O	his
O	boyhood
O	he
O	used
O	to
O	tend
O	sheep
O	upon
O	the
O	hills
O	.
O	Until
O	he
O	had
O	grown
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	even
O	know
O	how
O	to
O	read
O	and
O	write
O	.
O	Tired
O	of
O	tending
O	sheep
O	,
O	he
O	apprenticed
O	himself
O	to
O	a
O	ship-carpenter
O	,
O	and
O	spent
O	about
O	four
O	years
O	in
O	hewing
O	the
O	crooked
O	limbs
O	of
O	oak
O	trees
O	into
O	knees
O	for
O	vessels
O	.
O	In
O	1673
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	twenty-two
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	Boston
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	afterwards
O	was
O	married
O	to
O	a
O	widow
O	lady
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	property
O	enough
O	to
O	set
O	him
O	up
O	in
O	business
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	he
O	lost
O	all
O	the
O	money
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	acquired
O	by
O	his
O	marriage
O	,
O	and
O	became
O	a
O	poor
O	man
O	again
O	.
O	Still
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	discouraged
O	.
O	He
O	often
O	told
O	his
O	wife
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	very
O	rich
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	build
O	a
O	"""fair"
O	brick
O	"house"""
O	in
O	the
O	Green
O	Lane
O	of
O	Boston
O	.
O	Several
O	years
O	passed
O	away;
O	and
O	Phips
O	had
O	not
O	yet
O	gained
O	the
O	riches
O	which
O	he
O	promised
O	to
O	himself
O	.
O	During
O	this
O	time
O	he
O	had
O	begun
O	to
O	follow
O	the
O	sea
O	for
O	a
O	living
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	year
O	1684
O	he
O	happened
O	to
O	hear
O	of
O	a
O	Spanish
O	ship
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	cast
O	away
O	near
O	Porto
O	de
O	la
O	Plata
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	now
O	lain
O	for
O	fifty
O	years
O	beneath
O	the
O	waves
O	.
O	This
O	old
O	ship
O	had
O	been
O	laden
O	with
O	immense
O	wealth;
O	and
O	nobody
O	had
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	possibility
O	of
O	recovering
O	any
O	part
O	of
O	it
O	from
O	the
O	deep
O	sea
O	which
O	was
O	rolling
O	and
O	tossing
O	it
O	about
O	.
O	But
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	now
O	an
O	old
O	story
O	,
O	Phips
O	resolved
O	that
O	the
O	sunken
O	treasure
O	should
O	again
O	be
O	brought
O	to
O	light
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	to
O	London
O	and
O	obtained
O	admittance
O	to
O	King
O	James
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	the
O	king
O	of
O	the
O	vast
O	wealth
O	that
O	was
O	lying
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	King
O	James
O	listened
O	with
O	attention
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	this
O	a
O	fine
O	opportunity
O	to
O	fill
O	his
O	treasury
O	with
O	Spanish
O	gold
O	.
O	He
O	appointed
O	William
O	Phips
O	to
O	be
O	captain
O	of
O	a
O	vessel
O	,
O	called
O	the
O	_Rose
O	Algier_
O	,
O	carrying
O	eighteen
O	guns
O	and
O	ninety-five
O	men
O	.
O	So
O	now
O	he
O	was
O	Captain
O	Phips
O	of
O	the
O	English
O	navy
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	sailed
O	from
O	England
O	and
O	cruised
O	for
O	two
O	years
O	in
O	the
O	West
O	Indies
O	,
O	trying
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	wrecked
O	Spanish
O	ship
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	sea
O	is
O	so
O	wide
O	and
O	deep
O	that
O	it
O	is
O	no
O	easy
O	matter
O	to
O	discover
O	the
O	exact
O	spot
O	where
O	a
O	sunken
O	vessel
O	lies
O	.
O	The
O	prospect
O	of
O	success
O	seemed
O	very
O	small
O	,
O	and
O	most
O	people
O	thought
O	that
O	Phips
O	was
O	as
O	far
O	from
O	having
O	money
O	enough
O	to
O	build
O	a
O	"""fair"
O	brick
O	"house"""
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	while
O	he
O	tended
O	sheep
O	.
O	The
O	seamen
O	became
O	discouraged
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	up
O	all
O	hope
O	of
O	making
O	their
O	fortunes
O	by
O	discovering
O	the
O	Spanish
O	wreck
O	.
O	They
O	wanted
O	Phips
O	to
O	turn
O	pirate
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	much
O	better
O	prospect
O	of
O	growing
O	rich
O	by
O	plundering
O	vessels
O	which
O	still
O	sailed
O	in
O	the
O	sea
O	than
O	by
O	seeking
O	for
O	a
O	ship
O	that
O	had
O	lain
O	beneath
O	the
O	waves
O	full
O	half
O	a
O	century
O	.
O	They
O	broke
O	out
O	in
O	open
O	mutiny
O	,
O	but
O	were
O	finally
O	mastered
O	by
O	Phips
O	,
O	and
O	compelled
O	to
O	obey
O	his
O	orders
O	.
O	It
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	dangerous
O	to
O	continue
O	much
O	longer
O	at
O	sea
O	with
O	such
O	a
O	crew
O	of
O	mutinous
O	sailors;
O	and
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	unseaworthy
O	.
O	So
O	Phips
O	judged
O	it
O	best
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	England
O	.
O	Before
O	leaving
O	the
O	West
O	Indies
O	,
O	he
O	met
O	with
O	an
O	old
O	Spaniard
O	who
O	remembered
O	the
O	wreck
O	of
O	the
O	Spanish
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	directions
O	how
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	very
O	spot
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	on
O	a
O	reef
O	of
O	rocks
O	,
O	a
O	few
O	leagues
O	from
O	Porto
O	de
O	la
O	Plata
O	.
O	On
O	his
O	arrival
O	in
O	England
O	Phips
O	solicited
O	the
O	king
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	have
O	another
O	vessel
O	and
O	send
O	him
O	back
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	West
O	Indies
O	.
O	But
O	King
O	James
O	refused
O	to
O	have
O	anything
O	more
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	the
O	affair
O	.
O	Phips
O	might
O	never
O	have
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	renew
O	the
O	search
O	if
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Albemarle
O	and
O	some
O	other
O	noblemen
O	had
O	not
O	lent
O	their
O	assistance
O	.
O	They
O	fitted
O	out
O	a
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	sailed
O	from
O	England
O	,
O	and
O	arrived
O	safely
O	at
O	La
O	Plata
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	took
O	an
O	adze
O	and
O	assisted
O	his
O	men
O	to
O	build
O	a
O	large
O	boat
O	.
O	The
O	boat
O	was
O	intended
O	for
O	going
O	closer
O	to
O	the
O	rocks
O	than
O	a
O	large
O	vessel
O	could
O	safely
O	venture
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	finished
O	,
O	the
O	captain
O	sent
O	several
O	men
O	in
O	it
O	to
O	examine
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	the
O	Spanish
O	ship
O	was
O	said
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	wrecked
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	accompanied
O	by
O	some
O	Indians
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	skilful
O	divers
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	go
O	down
O	a
O	great
O	way
O	into
O	the
O	depths
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	The
O	boat's
O	crew
O	proceeded
O	to
O	the
O	reef
O	of
O	rocks
O	,
O	and
O	gazed
O	down
O	into
O	the

O	Hereupon
O	the
O	captain
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	crew
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	,
O	with
O	iron
O	rakes
O	and
O	great
O	hooks
O	and
O	lines
O	,
O	fishing
O	for
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Up
O	came
O	the
O	treasures
O	in
O	abundance
O	.
O	Now
O	they
O	beheld
O	a
O	table
O	of
O	solid
O	silver
O	,
O	once
O	the
O	property
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	Spanish
O	grandee
O	.
O	Now
O	they
O	found
O	an
O	altar
O	vessel
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	destined
O	as
O	a
O	gift
O	to
O	some
O	Catholic
O	church
O	.
O	Now
O	they
O	drew
O	up
O	a
O	golden
O	cup
O	,
O	fit
O	for
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Spain
O	to
O	drink
O	his
O	wine
O	out
O	of
O	.
O	Now
O	their
O	rakes
O	were
O	loaded
O	with
O	masses
O	of
O	silver
O	bullion
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	also
O	precious
O	stones
O	among
O	the
O	treasure
O	,
O	glittering
O	and
O	sparkling
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	is
O	a
O	wonder
O	how
O	their
O	radiance
O	could
O	have
O	been
O	concealed
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	day
O	or
O	two
O	they
O	discovered
O	another
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	wreck
O	where
O	they
O	found
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	bags
O	of
O	silver
O	dollars
O	.
O	But
O	nobody
O	could
O	have
O	guessed
O	that
O	these
O	were
O	money-bags
O	.
O	By
O	remaining
O	so
O	long
O	in
O	the
O	salt-water
O	they
O	had
O	become
O	covered
O	over
O	with
O	a
O	crust
O	which
O	had
O	the
O	appearance
O	of
O	stone
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	necessary
O	to
O	break
O	them
O	in
O	pieces
O	with
O	hammers
O	and
O	axes
O	.
O	When
O	this
O	was
O	done
O	,
O	a
O	stream
O	of
O	silver
O	dollars
O	gushed
O	out
O	upon
O	the
O	deck
O	of
O	the
O	vessel
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	value
O	of
O	the
O	recovered
O	treasure
O	,
O	plate
O	,
O	bullion
O	,
O	precious
O	stones
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	,
O	was
O	estimated
O	at
O	more
O	than
O	two
O	millions
O	of
O	dollars
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	dangerous
O	even
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	such
O	a
O	vast
O	amount
O	of
O	wealth
O	.
O	A
O	captain
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	assisted
O	Phips
O	in
O	the
O	enterprise
O	,
O	lost
O	his
O	reason
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	died
O	two
O	years
O	afterward
O	,
O	still
O	raving
O	about
O	the
O	treasures
O	that
O	lie
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Phips
O	and
O	his
O	men
O	continued
O	to
O	fish
O	up
O	plate
O	,
O	bullion
O	,
O	and
O	dollars
O	,
O	as
O	plentifully
O	as
O	ever
O	,
O	till
O	their
O	provisions
O	grew
O	short
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	feed
O	upon
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	any
O	more
O	than
O	old
O	King
O	Midas
O	could
O	,
O	they
O	found
O	it
O	necessary
O	to
O	go
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	food
O	.
O	Phips
O	returned
O	to
O	England
O	,
O	arriving
O	there
O	in
O	1687
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	received
O	with
O	great
O	joy
O	by
O	the
O	Albemarles
O	and
O	other
O	English
O	lords
O	who
O	had
O	fitted
O	out
O	the
O	vessel
O	.
O	Well
O	they
O	might
O	rejoice;
O	for
O	they
O	took
O	the
O	greater
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	treasures
O	to
O	themselves
O	.
O	The
O	captain's
O	share
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	was
O	enough
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	comfortable
O	for
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	his
O	days
O	.
O	It
O	also
O	enabled
O	him
O	to
O	fulfil
O	his
O	promise
O	to
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	by
O	building
O	a
O	"""fair"
O	brick
O	"house"""
O	in
O	the
O	Green
O	Lane
O	of
O	Boston
O	.
O	The
O	Duke
O	of
O	Albemarle
O	sent
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Phips
O	a
O	magnificent
O	gold
O	cup
O	,
O	worth
O	at
O	least
O	five
O	thousand
O	dollars
O	.
O	Before
O	Captain
O	Phips
O	left
O	London
O	,
O	King
O	James
O	made
O	him
O	a
O	knight;
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	the
O	obscure
O	ship-carpenter
O	who
O	had
O	formerly
O	dwelt
O	among
O	them
O	,
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	of
O	Boston
O	welcomed
O	him
O	on
O	his
O	return
O	as
O	the
O	rich
O	and
O	famous
O	Sir
O	William
O	Phips
O	.
