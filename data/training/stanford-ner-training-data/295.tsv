O	the

O	page
O	Owen
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	saved
O	King
O	Arthur
O	from
O	midnight
O	murder
O	at
O	the
O	hand
O	of
O	the
O	evil
O	Sir
O	Turquine
O	,
O	whom
O	Lancelot
O	slew
O	,
O	had
O	tarried
O	at
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	prowess
O	and
O	knightly
O	achievements
O	was
O	among
O	the
O	most
O	famous
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	.
O	And
O	always
O	was
O	he
O	wishful
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	strange
O	adventures
O	,
O	however
O	far
O	might
O	be
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	or
O	dangerous
O	the
O	ways
O	thereto
O	,
O	or
O	cruel
O	and
O	crafty
O	the
O	foes
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	King
O	Arthur
O	was
O	at
O	Caerleon-upon-Usk
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	conversing
O	with
O	a
O	few
O	of
O	his
O	knights
O	in
O	the
O	presence-chamber
O	.
O	With
O	him
O	was
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	and
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	also
O	Sir
O	Conan
O	and
O	Sir
O	Bedevere
O	.
O	The
O	queen
O	sat
O	near
O	them
O	,
O	while
O	her
O	handmaidens
O	stood
O	by
O	the
O	window
O	at
O	needlework
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	Arthur
O	said
O	he
O	would
O	sleep
O	until
O	the
O	horn
O	sounded
O	for
O	dinner
O	.
O	For
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	from
O	London
O	late
O	the
O	night
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	not
O	had
O	his
O	full
O	rest
O	.
O	'
O	But
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	'
O	do
O	you
O	,
O	my
O	knights
O	,
O	continue
O	your
O	talk
O	,
O	and
O	tell
O	each
O	other
O	tales
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	you
O	are
O	hungry
O	,
O	Kay
O	will
O	give
O	you
O	collops
O	of
O	meat
O	and
O	horns
O	of
O	mead
O	.
O	'
O	So
O	the
O	king
O	slept
O	on
O	his
O	broad
O	seat
O	of
O	green
O	rushes
O	,
O	over
O	which
O	was
O	spread
O	a
O	splendid
O	covering
O	of
O	flame-coloured
O	satin
O	.
O	And
O	cushions
O	of
O	red
O	satin
O	were
O	under
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	Kay
O	ordered
O	a
O	page
O	to
O	bring
O	meat
O	and
O	bread
O	and
O	mead
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	four
O	had
O	eaten
O	,
O	Sir
O	Conan
O	was
O	called
O	upon
O	to
O	tell
O	how
O	he
O	became
O	possessed
O	of
O	a
O	dark
O	bay
O	palfrey
O	,
O	as
O	to
O	which
O	all
O	envied
O	him
O	for
O	its
O	beauty
O	,
O	but
O	concerning
O	which
O	he
O	always
O	put
O	off
O	telling
O	the
O	tale
O	of
O	how
O	he
O	had
O	obtained
O	it
O	.
O	'
O	You
O	must
O	know
O	,
O	'
O	began
O	Sir
O	Conan
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	son
O	of
O	my
O	parents
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	confines
O	of
O	my
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	barony
O	in
O	Lothian
O	were
O	too
O	small
O	for
O	my
O	aspiring
O	and
O	my
O	daring
O	.
O	I
O	thought
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	adventure
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	too
O	great
O	for
O	my
O	doing
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	had
O	fought
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	who
O	would
O	meet
O	me
O	in
O	my
O	own
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	slain
O	all
O	the
O	trolls
O	that
O	wrought
O	evil
O	there
O	,
O	I
O	equipped
O	myself
O	in
O	my
O	best
O	armour
O	and
O	set
O	forth
O	to
O	seek
O	greater
O	adventures
O	in
O	deserts
O	and
O	wild
O	regions
O	.
O	And
O	I
O	fared
O	south
O	for
O	many
O	weeks
O	,
O	over
O	desolate
O	mountains
O	and
O	wild
O	and
O	terrible
O	fastnesses
O	of
O	rock
O	and
O	moor
O	,
O	where
O	only
O	the
O	robber
O	seemed
O	to
O	live
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wild
O	,
O	magic
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	green
O	mounds
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	sound
O	but
O	the
O	song
O	of
O	the
O	lark
O	,
O	the
O	plunge
O	of
O	the
O	beaver
O	and
O	otter
O	in
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	the
O	growl
O	of
O	the
O	brown
O	bear
O	from
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	howl
O	of
O	the
O	wolf
O	at
O	night
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	I
O	fared
O	through
O	all
O	these
O	terrors
O	unscathed
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	day
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	high
O	ridge
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	stretching
O	below
O	me
O	the
O	fairest
O	valley
O	I
O	had
O	ever
O	seen
O	.
O	The
O	grass
O	was
O	green
O	and
O	smooth
O	,
O	the
O	trees
O	were
O	soft
O	and
O	of
O	an
O	equal
O	growth;
O	and
O	a
O	river
O	ran
O	gently
O	through
O	the
O	dale
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	path
O	beside
O	it
O	.
O	'
O	I
O	followed
O	the
O	path
O	all
O	day
O	until
O	the
O	evening
O	,
O	but
O	met
O	no
O	one
O	,
O	until
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	afternoon
O	was
O	waning
O	,
O	I
O	came
O	suddenly
O	upon
O	a
O	large
O	and
O	massive
O	castle
O	,
O	which
O	shone
O	in
O	the
O	westering
O	sun
O	.
O	And
O	I
O	approached
O	the
O	green
O	before
O	the
O	gateway
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	two
O	youths
O	with
O	curling
O	auburn
O	hair
O	,
O	clad
O	richly
O	in
O	garments
O	of
O	yellow
O	satin
O	,
O	with
O	frontlets
O	of
O	gold
O	upon
O	their
O	forehead
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	had
O	daggers
O	with
O	jewelled
O	hilts
O	,
O	and
O	these
O	they
O	were
O	shooting
O	at
O	a
O	mark
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	on
O	a
O	bench
O	a
O	little
O	way
O	from
O	them
O	was
O	a
O	handsome
O	man
O	in
O	the
O	prime
O	of
O	life
O	,
O	of
O	a
O	proud
O	look
O	,
O	clad
O	in
O	a
O	rich
O	mantle
O	.
O	'
O	I
O	went
O	forward
O	and
O	saluted
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	returned
O	my
O	greeting
O	with
O	great
O	courtesy
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	rising
O	,
O	he
O	led
O	me
O	into
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	was
O	but
O	poorly
O	furnished
O	.
O	And
O	I
O	wondered
O	that
O	the
O	knight
O	and
O	the
O	youths
O	should
O	be
O	so
O	richly
O	clothed
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	hall
O	was
O	scanty
O	.
O	'
O	Six
O	maidens
O	came
O	forward
O	,
O	and
O	while
O	three
O	took
O	my
O	horse
O	,
O	the
O	others
O	unarmed
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	me
O	water
O	wherein
O	to
O	wash
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	dining-robe
O	to
O	put
O	on
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	six
O	maidens
O	were
O	fairer
O	than
O	any
O	I
O	had
O	ever
O	seen
O	.
O	Then
O	we
O	sat
O	down
O	when
O	the
O	meat
O	was
O	ready
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	the
O	food
O	was
O	good
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	simple
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	vessels
O	and
O	flagons
O	upon
O	the
O	table
O	were
O	of
O	silver
O	,
O	but
O	very
O	old
O	and

O	'
O	At
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	awoke
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	whether
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	time
O	for
O	meat
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	horn
O	was
O	sounded
O	,
O	and
O	men
O	came
O	in
O	from
O	the
O	tilting-ground
O	and
O	the
O	play-field
O	,
O	and
O	washed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	household
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	dinner
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morrow
O	,
O	before
O	dawn
O	,
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	rose
O	privily
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	armour
O	and
O	took
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	many
O	days
O	rode
O	over
O	mountains
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	sea
O	like
O	a
O	sheet
O	of
O	burnished
O	lead
O	lying
O	on
O	his
O	left
O	hand
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	turned
O	his
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	far
O	through
O	wild
O	and
O	distant
O	places
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	And
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	valley
O	which
O	Conan
O	had
O	described
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	whereat
O	he
O	rejoiced
O	greatly
O	.
O	He
O	descended
O	to
O	the
O	path
O	beside
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	and
O	journeyed
O	along
O	it
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	Sir
O	Dewin
O	,
O	as
O	Conan
O	had
O	described
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	two
O	youths
O	were
O	on
O	the
O	green
O	before
O	the
O	gate
O	wrestling
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	tall
O	knight
O	of
O	proud
O	mien
O	was
O	standing
O	by
O	.
O	To
O	Owen
O	it
O	seemed
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	fiercer
O	and
O	prouder-looking
O	than
O	Conan
O	had
O	described
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	the
O	salute
O	of
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	courteously
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	was
O	entertained
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	Conan
O	had
O	been
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	hall
O	seemed
O	poorer
O	,
O	the
O	food
O	coarser
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	maidens
O	seemed
O	careworn
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	so
O	fair
O	as
O	his
O	friend
O	had
O	described
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	meal
O	Sir
O	Dewin
O	asked
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	who
O	he
O	was
O	and
O	whither
O	he
O	wended
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	replied:

O	.

O	looked
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	keen
O	fierce
O	eyes
O	,

O	bring
O	.

O	for
O	some
O	moments
O	,

O	and

O	,
O	whom
O	my

O	sent
O	to

O	'
O	With
O	that
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	received
O	so
O	hard
O	and
O	fierce
O	a
O	blow
O	upon
O	his
O	headpiece
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	hard
O	put
O	to
O	it
O	to
O	keep
O	his
O	wits
O	and
O	his
O	seat;
O	and
O	looking
O	round
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	troll
O	,
O	a
O	fierce
O	dark
O	little
O	man
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	mound
O	,
O	wielding
O	a
O	long
O	thick
O	bar
O	of
O	iron
O	,
O	as
O	thick
O	as
O	a
O	weaver
O	'
O	s
O	beam
O	.
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	thrust
O	at
O	the
O	troll
O	with
O	his
O	lance;
O	but
O	the
O	moundman
O	seized
O	it
O	below
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	steel
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	strong
O	was
O	he
O	,
O	that
O	though
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	drew
O	him
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	hillock
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	loose
O	it
O	from
O	the
O	little
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	hold
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	,
O	the
O	troll
O	was
O	beating
O	at
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	with
O	the
O	staff
O	of
O	iron
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	its
O	weight
O	and
O	size
O	,
O	he
O	wielded
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	stout
O	cudgel
O	.
O	And
O	hard
O	bestead
O	was
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	to
O	shield
O	himself
O	from
O	the
O	smashing
O	blows
O	which
O	rained
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	seventh
O	blow
O	his
O	shield
O	was
O	cracked
O	across
O	and
O	his
O	shield
O	arm
O	was
O	numbed
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	he
O	dashed
O	his
O	horse
O	forward
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	man
O	,
O	still
O	holding
O	the
O	lance
O	,
O	was
O	thrown
O	backward
O	upon
O	the
O	grassy
O	slope
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	mound
O	.
O	Swiftly
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	leaped
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	while
O	the
O	troll
O	was
O	rising
O	he
O	dashed
O	at
O	him
O	and
O	wounded
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	next
O	moment
O	the
O	troll
O	was
O	up
O	,
O	his
O	dark
O	narrow
O	face
O	terrible
O	with
O	rage
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	blood
O	ran
O	down
O	the
O	deer-skin
O	tunic
O	which
O	half
O	covered
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	the
O	blows
O	of
O	his
O	iron
O	rod
O	came
O	thicker
O	and
O	faster
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	moved
O	so
O	swiftly
O	round
O	about
O	the
O	knight
O	that
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	thrust
O	quickly
O	and
O	fiercely
O	,
O	could
O	not
O	strike
O	him
O	again
O	.
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	was
O	becoming
O	dizzy
O	and
O	weak
O	,
O	and
O	felt
O	that
O	not
O	for
O	long
O	now
O	could
O	he
O	bear
O	up
O	his
O	dented
O	and
O	broken
O	shield
O	against
O	the
O	blows
O	that
O	must
O	at
O	length
O	smash
O	his
O	arm
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	the
O	quick
O	movements
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	troll
O	ceased
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	staggered
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	dropped
O	the
O	iron
O	bar
O	and
O	swayed
O	like
O	a
O	drunken
O	man
O	towards
O	the
O	knight
O	.
O	He
O	fell
O	on
O	his
O	knees
O	before
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	,
O	put
O	his
O	head
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	clutched
O	the
O	knight
O	'
O	s
O	steel-clad
O	foot
O	as
O	if
O	to
O	put
O	it
O	upon
O	his
O	neck
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	no
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	lay
O	panting
O	and
O	spent
O	with
O	exhaustion
O	.
O	And
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	it
O	in
O	himself
O	to
O	pierce
O	him
O	through
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	troll
O	'
O	s
O	subjection
O	made
O	pity

O	And

O	a

O	The

O	burned

O	flash
O	,
O	when

O	thanked

O	,
O	put
O	the
O	string
O	about

O	troll
O	as
O	he
O	limped
O	,
O	faint
O	and
O	wounded
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	mound
O	that

O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	picking
O	up
O	his

O	,
O	Sir

O	mounted

O	forward
O	through

O	,
O	thinking

O	adventure
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	fountain
O	where
O	a
O	silver
O	cup
O	hung
O	by
O	a
O	silver
O	chain
O	,
O	he
O	filled

O	that

O	set
O	beside
O	the
O	fountain
O	.
O	And
O	instantly
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	clap
O	of
O	thunder
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	earth
O	would
O	dash
O	asunder
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	the
O	thunder
O	came
O	the
O	shower
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	fierce
O	and
O	heavy
O	were
O	the
O	hailstones
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	surely
O	have
O	slain
O	horse

O	that
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	,

O	had
O	bidden
O	him
O	,

O	kept
O	his

O	hand
O	therein
O	,
O	whereby
O	the
O	hailstones
O	became
O	thin
O	rain
O	before
O	they
O	touched
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	sky
O	became
O	bright
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	flock
O	of
O	birds
O	descended
O	on
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	heeded
O	them
O	not
O	,
O	but
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	dressed
O	his
O	shield
O	and
O	lance
O	,
O	and
O	prepared
O	for
O	the
O	combat
O	.
O	There
O	came
O	a
O	mourning
O	cry
O	through
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	sky-blue
O	knight
O	on
O	a
O	high-stepping
O	destrier
O	dashed
O	through
O	the
O	trees
O	towards
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	against
O	him
O	,
O	lance
O	in
O	rest
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	put
O	spurs
O	to
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	furiously
O	rode
O	against
O	the
O	knight
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	first
O	onset
O	each
O	broke
O	his
O	lance;
O	whereat
O	they
O	drew
O	their
O	swords
O	and
O	lashed
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	most
O	fiercely
O	.
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	feinted
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	quickly
O	recovering
O	,
O	he
O	smote
O	the
O	other
O	so
O	hard
O	and
O	stern
O	a
O	blow
O	that
O	the
O	blade
O	bit
O	through
O	headpiece
O	,
O	skin
O	and
O	bone
O	,
O	until
O	it
O	wounded
O	the
O	brain
O	itself
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	cry
O	,
O	the
O	blue
O	knight
O	wheeled
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	fled
O	,
O	with
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	in
O	pursuit
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	other
O	knight
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	was
O	fleeter
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	could
O	not
O	overtake
O	him
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	kept
O	within
O	a
O	few
O	yards
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	a
O	great
O	castle
O	,
O	resplendent
O	with
O	new
O	stone
O	,
O	shone
O	before
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	wounded
O	knight
O	thundered
O	across
O	the
O	drawbridge
O	,
O	with
O	Owen
O	close
O	behind
O	him;
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	blue
O	knight
O	gained
O	the
O	street
O	beyond
O	,
O	the
O	portcullis
O	was
O	let
O	fall
O	with
O	a
O	rush
O	.
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	fell
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	round
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	horse
O	had
O	been
O	cut
O	in
O	twain
O	by
O	the
O	gate
O	.
O	So
O	that
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	found
O	himself
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	forepart
O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	horse
O	,
O	in
O	a

O	the
O	horse
O	was
O	outside
O	.
O	And
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	saw
O	that
O	his
O	death
O	must
O	be
O	very
O	near
O	,
O	for
O	already
O	he
O	saw
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	soldiers
O	who
O	were
O	guarding
O	the
O	gate
O	run
O	after
O	the
O	knight
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	for
O	orders
O	to
O	slay
O	him
O	.
O	Looking
O	through
O	the
O	inner
O	gate
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	narrow
O	street
O	facing
O	him
O	,
O	with
O	booths
O	and
O	little
O	houses
O	on
O	each
O	side;
O	and
O	coming
O	towards
O	him
O	he
O	beheld
O	a
O	maiden
O	,
O	small
O	but
O	beautiful
O	,
O	with
O	black
O	curling
O	hair
O	and
O	a
O	circlet
O	of
O	gold
O	upon
O	her
O	forehead;
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	of
O	high
O	rank
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	wore
O	a
O	dress
O	of
O	yellow
O	satin
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	her
O	feet
O	were
O	shoes
O	of
O	speckled
O	leather
O	.
O	She
O	stopped
O	when
O	but
O	a
O	few
O	steps
O	from
O	the
O	gate
O	where
O	the
O	soldiers
O	stood
O	watching
O	Sir
O	Owen;
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	bent
O	fixedly
O	upon
O	the
O	blue
O	stone
O	which
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	knight
O	'
O	s
O	breast
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
O	of
O	his
O	prison
O	,
O	it
O	shone
O	with
O	a
O	fierce
O	blue
O	flame
O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	up
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	maiden
O	'
O	s
O	eyes
O	bent
O	on
O	his
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	seemed
O	to
O	hear
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	the
O	maiden
O	speaking
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	as
O	clearly
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	stood
O	beside
O	him
O	.
O	In
O	these
O	words
O	she
O	spoke:
O	'
O	Take
O	that
O	stone
O	which
O	is
O	on
O	thy
O	breast
O	,
O	and
O	hold
O	it
O	tightly
O	in
O	the
O	palm
O	of
O	one
O	hand
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	thou
O	concealest
O	it
O	,
O	so
O	will
O	it
O	conceal
O	thee
O	.
O	Thus
O	wilt
O	thou
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	pass
O	unseen
O	between
O	the
O	bars
O	of
O	the
O	portcullis
O	.
O	And
O	I
O	will
O	wait
O	for
O	thee
O	on
O	the
O	horseblock
O	yonder
O	,
O	and
O	thou
O	wilt
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	see
O	me
O	,
O	though
O	I
O	cannot
O	see
O	thee
O	.
O	Therefore
O	,
O	come
O	and
O	place
O	thy
O	hand
O	on
O	my
O	shoulder
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	shall
O	know
O	that
O	thou
O	art
O	come
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	thou
O	must
O	accompany
O	me
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	shall
O	hide
O	thee
O	.
O	'
O	He
O	saw
O	the
O	maiden
O	turn
O	away
O	and
O	go
O	up
O	the
O	street
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	did
O	as
O	the
O	voice
O	had
O	bidden
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	looking
O	down
O	he
O	saw
O	nothing
O	of
O	himself
O	,
O	although
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	the
O	soldiers
O	looking
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	surprise
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	horror
O	on
O	their
O	faces
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	realised
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	seen
O	him
O	spirited
O	away
O	before
O	their
O	eyes
O	.
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	passed
O	between
O	them
O	and
O	rejoined
O	the
O	maiden
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	bidden
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	still
O	invisible
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	led
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	small
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	large
O	and
O	beautiful
O	chamber
O	,
O	all
O	painted
O	with
O	gorgeous
O	colours
O	,
O	and
O	well
O	furnished
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	she
O	gave
O	him
O	food
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	rested
O	securely
O	until
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	looked
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	upon
O	the
O	wall
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	which
O	towered
O	dark
O	and
O	high
O	above
O	him
O	,

O	heard
O	a
O	clamour
O	and
O	sounds
O	of
O	a
O	mourning
O	coming
O	from
O	it
O	.

O	'
O	At
O	that
O	time
O	she
O	would
O	tell
O	him
O	no
O	more
O	,
O	but
O	shortly
O	left
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	rest
O	,
O	saying
O	she
O	would
O	come
O	to
O	attend
O	upon
O	him
O	again
O	at
O	the
O	dawning
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	silence
O	and
O	darkness
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	awoke
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	a
O	woful
O	outcry
O	and
O	lamenting;
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	Earl
O	Cadoc
O	,
O	the
O	Knight
O	of
O	the
O	Fountain
O	,
O	was
O	dead
O	from
O	the
O	wound
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	dawn
O	he
O	arose
O	and
O	clothed
O	himself;
O	and
O	looking
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	streets
O	filled
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	host
O	of
O	people
O	in
O	black
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	weeping
O	and
O	the
O	mourning
O	were
O	pitiful
O	to
O	hear
O	.
O	Knights
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	armour
O	craped
O	,
O	rode
O	in
O	great
O	companies
O	before;
O	then
O	came
O	the
O	men-at-arms
O	with
O	weapons
O	reversed;
O	then
O	the
O	ladies
O	of
O	the
O	household
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	these
O	the
O	priests
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	their
O	midst
O	was
O	the
O	bier
O	.
O	And
O	over
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	veil
O	of
O	white
O	linen
O	,
O	and
O	wax
O	tapers
O	burning
O	beside
O	and
O	around
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	gentlemen
O	who
O	supported
O	the
O	bier
O	on
O	their
O	shoulders
O	none
O	was
O	lower
O	in
O	rank
O	than
O	a
O	powerful
O	baron
O	,
O	owning
O	broad
O	lands
O	and
O	great
O	companies
O	of
O	retainers
O	.
O	Last
O	of
O	all
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	lady
O	walking
O	behind
O	the
O	bier
O	.
O	And
O	though
O	her
O	face
O	was
O	stained
O	with
O	the
O	many
O	tears
O	she
O	had
O	shed
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	pale
O	with
O	sorrow
O	,
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	so
O	beautiful
O	a
O	lady
O	,
O	or
O	one
O	so
O	gentle
O	and
O	kind
O	of
O	mien
O	.
O	Deeply
O	he
O	sorrowed
O	because
O	he
O	had
O	caused
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	her
O	lord
O	,
O	inasmuch
O	as
O	it
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	such
O	grief
O	.
O	Her
O	hair
O	,
O	yellow
O	and
O	long
O	and
O	curled
O	,
O	hung
O	dishevelled
O	about
O	her
O	shoulders
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	dress
O	of
O	rich
O	yellow
O	satin
O	was
O	torn
O	,
O	and
O	across
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	wide
O	sash
O	of
O	black
O	velvet
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	marvel
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	see
O	how
O	to
O	walk
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	tears
O	filled
O	her
O	eyes
O	.
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	could
O	not
O	take
O	his
O	gaze
O	from
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	love
O	and
O	pity
O	for
O	her
O	filled
O	his
O	mind
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	procession
O	had
O	passed
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	the
O	maiden
O	Elined
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	asked

O	were
O	gaining
O	the
O	day
O	.
O	From
O	her
O	window
O	the
O	countess
O	watched
O	with
O	a
O	sorrowing
O	and
O	dreading
O	heart;
O	for
O	Elined
O	had
O	not
O	yet
O	returned
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	the
O	countess
O	must
O	be
O	the
O	prize
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	suitors
O	who
O	had
O	pestered
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	none
O	of
O	whom
O	she
O	cared
O	for
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	dust
O	of
O	the
O	jousting
O	had
O	a
O	little
O	cleared
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	knights
O	had
O	withdrawn
O	to
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	lists
O	,
O	to
O	breathe
O	and
O	rest
O	awhile
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	seen
O	that
O	twelve
O	remained
O	of
O	the
O	ninety-nine
O	.
O	The
O	countess
O	,
O	looking
O	from
O	her
O	window
O	,
O	knew
O	them
O	all
O	from
O	the
O	devices
O	on
O	their
O	shields
O	,
O	and
O	none
O	of
O	them
O	were
O	men
O	she
O	favoured
O	.
O	Some
O	she
O	knew
O	were
O	evil
O	men
O	,
O	yet
O	,
O	as
O	knights
O	,
O	were
O	powerful
O	in
O	jousting
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	dreaded
O	which
O	of
O	them
O	should
O	be
O	the
O	victor
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	her
O	lord
O	and
O	master
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	knights
O	hurtled
O	together
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	one
O	after
O	the
O	other
O	was
O	unhorsed
O	by
O	stronger
O	opponents
O	and
O	went
O	from
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	she
O	went
O	pale
O	with
O	fear
O	and
O	anxiety
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	there
O	were
O	but
O	two
O	,
O	and
O	these
O	were
O	Sir
O	Dewin
O	,
O	whom
O	she
O	knew
O	as
O	the
O	Earl
O	of
O	Drood
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	was
O	a
O	knight
O	in
O	blue
O	armour
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	shield
O	on
O	which
O	was
O	painted
O	a
O	hillock
O	or
O	mound
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	knew
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	man
O	named
O	Sir
O	Daunt
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	Knight
O	of
O	the
O	Mount
O	,
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	fierce
O	temper
O	,
O	quarrelsome
O	and
O	cruel
O	.
O	The
O	countess
O	could
O	have
O	swooned
O	with
O	terror
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	that
O	now
O	she
O	was
O	doomed
O	to
O	an
O	unhappy
O	life
O	,
O	whichever
O	of
O	these
O	knights
O	prevailed
O	.
O	For
O	though
O	the
O	Earl
O	of
O	Drood
O	was
O	soft
O	and
O	gentle
O	in
O	speech
O	and
O	manner
O	,
O	she
O	feared
O	that
O	this
O	but
O	covered
O	a
O	wicked
O	heart
O	.
O	She
O	could
O	hardly
O	bear
O	to
O	look
O	as
O	she
O	heard
O	these
O	two
O	,
O	the
O	last
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	ninety-nine
O	,
O	crash
O	together
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	jousting-ground
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	heard
O	the
O	cries
O	of
O	the
O	onlookers
O	.
O	'
O	The
O	blue
O	knight
O	'
O	s
O	the
O	better
O	man
O	!
O	How
O	he
O	heaves
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	!
O	Ah
O	,
O	the
O	golden
O	knight
O	is
O	down
O	!
O	'
O	And
O	looking
O	from
O	her
O	window
O	the
O	countess
O	saw
O	the
O	earl
O	was
O	lying
O	wounded
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Knight
O	of
O	the
O	Mount
O	stood
O	over
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	earl
O	surrendered
O	and
O	was
O	carried
O	off
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	The
O	great
O	shouts
O	that
O	saluted
O	the
O	victor
O	made
O	the
O	countess
O	turn
O	faint
O	and
O	sick
O	with
O	dread
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	fell
O	back
O	among
O	her
O	handmaidens
O	in
O	a
O	swoon
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	quickly
O	recovering
O	,
O	she
O	stood
O	up
O	,
O	resolved
O	to
O	meet
O	her
O	fate
O	with
O	proud
O	dignity
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	the
O	door
O	opened
O	and
O	the
O	arras
O	was
O	pushed
O	aside
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	groom
O	of
O	the
O	chambers
O	announced
O	with
O	a
O	shout:
O	'
O	The
O	Knight
O	of
O	the
O	Mound
O	,
O	victorious
O	in
O	the
O	joust
O	,
O	craves
O	leave
O	to
O	greet
O	our
O	lady
O	the
O	countess
O	.
O	'
O	The
O	lady
O	bowed
O	assent
O	,
O	trembling
O	in
O	every
O	limb
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	groom
O	stepped
O	aside
O	,
O	and
O	into
O	the
O	chamber
O	came
O	a
O	comely
O	gentleman
O	,
O	clad
O	in
O	purple
O	tunic
O	,
O	rich
O	with
O	chains
O	and
O	jewelled
O	belt
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	the
O	knight
O	whom
O	the
O	countess
O	had
O	expected
O	,
O	but
O	a
O	stranger
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	courtly
O	and
O	gentle
O	manner
O	and
O	a
O	winning
O	smile
O	.
O	Then
O	from
O	behind
O	him
O	came
O	Elined
O	,
O	full
O	of
O	smiles
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	look
O	of
O	triumph
O	in
O	her
O	eyes
O	.
O	'
O	My
O	lady
O	,
O	'
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	bowing
O	low
O	,
O	'
O	this
O	is
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	of
O	Wales
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	whom
O	I
O	have
O	brought
O	to
O	protect
O	you
O	and
O	wed
O	you
O	.
O	He
O	hath
O	just
O	proved
O	himself
O	the
O	doughtiest
O	among
O	a
O	hundred
O	.
O	'
O	The
O	terror
O	of
O	the
O	countess
O	was
O	changed
O	instantly
O	into
O	joy
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	put
O	forth
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	bent
O	and
O	kissed
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	led
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	seat
O	,
O	and
O	commanded
O	Elined
O	to
O	sit
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	spoke
O	full
O	joyously
O	together
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	countess
O	was
O	much
O	taken
O	with
O	the
O	noble
O	and
O	gentle
O	bearing
O	of
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	,
O	and
O	admired
O	him
O	because
O	he
O	had
O	proved
O	himself
O	the
O	best
O	man
O	of
O	all
O	her
O	wooers
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	she
O	sent
O	for
O	the
O	bishops
O	and
O	priests
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	nuptials
O	with
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	were
O	celebrated
O	with
O	such
O	feasting
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	country
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	merriment
O	and
O	joy
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	earldom
O	came
O	and
O	did
O	homage
O	to
O	Owen
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	became
O	the
O	Earl
O	of
O	the
O	Fountain
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	thereafter
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	told
O	his
O	lady
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	he
O	who
O	had
O	chased
O	the
O	soul
O	from
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	her
O	former
O	lord
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	countess
O	was
O	not
O	vexed
O	by
O	the
O	knowledge
O	,
O	for
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	loved
O	her
O	greatly
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	all
O	tenderness
O	and
O	honour
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	had
O	the
O	countess
O	been
O	so
O	happy
O	with
O	Earl
O	Cadoc
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	with
O	Owen
O	.
O	Thereafter
O	Earl
O	Owen
O	defended
O	the
O	fountain
O	with
O	lance
O	and
O	sword
O	against
O	all
O	who
O	ventured
O	to
O	challenge
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	earldom
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	knights
O	who
O	were
O	thus
O	conquered
O	he
O	held
O	to
O	ransom
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	money
O	he
O	thus
O	obtained
O	he
O	divided
O	equally
O	among
O	his
O	barons
O	and
O	knights
O	.
O	Never
O	had
O	they
O	had
O	so
O	generous
O	a
O	lord
O	,
O	nor
O	one
O	of
O	such
O	prowess
O	and
O	knightly
O	worth
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	his
O	subjects
O	loved
O	Earl
O	Owen
O	passing
O	well
O	.
O	Thus
O	for
O	three
O	years
O	in
O	all
O	happiness
O	and
O	quiet
O	did
O	Owen
O	and
O	the
O	countess
O	dwell
O	.
O	Sir
O	Dewin
O	of
O	Castle
O	Cower
O	had
O	not
O	power
O	to
O	hurt
O	them
O	,
O	nor
O	did
O	any
O	other
O	evil
O	light
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	this
O	space
O	,
O	towards
O	the
O	close
O	of
O	a
O	summer
O	'
O	s
O	day
O	,
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	magic
O	whereby
O	it
O	was
O	made
O	known
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	knew
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	knight
O	who
O	challenged
O	him
O	at
O	the
O	fountain
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	putting
O	on
O	his
O	sky-blue
O	armour
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	forth
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	knight
O	.
O	They
O	rushed
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	strange
O	knight
O	was
O	overthrown
O	.
O	But
O	others
O	who
O	were
O	with
O	him
O	took
O	him
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	waited
O	.
O	But
O	none
O	other
O	challenge
O	was
O	made
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	twilight
O	he
O	retired
O	,
O	resolved
O	to
O	attend
O	next
O	day
O	in
O	case
O	any
O	others
O	desired
O	to
O	challenge
O	him
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	the
O	same
O	knight
O	came
O	forth
O	from
O	the
O	company
O	of
O	knights
O	which
O	was
O	among
O	the
O	trees
O	about
O	the
O	fountain
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	fiercely
O	did
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	assail
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	his
O	lance
O	broke
O	the
O	helmet
O	of
O	the
O	stranger
O	and
O	pierced
O	the
O	flesh
O	to
O	the
O	bone
O	.
O	Again
O	his
O	companions
O	carried
O	him
O	off
O	.
O	Then
O	other
O	knights
O	came
O	forth
O	and
O	had
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	were
O	overthrown
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	came
O	one
O	having
O	over
O	himself
O	and
O	his
O	horse
O	a
O	rich
O	satin
O	robe
O	of
O	honour
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	be
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	great
O	dignity
O	,
O	big
O	of
O	body
O	and
O	of
O	knightly
O	prowess
O	.
O	They
O	fought
O	together
O	that
O	evening
O	and
O	half
O	through
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	but
O	neither
O	could
O	obtain
O	the
O	mastery
O	.
O	And
O	about
O	noon
O	they
O	took
O	still
O	stronger
O	lances
O	and
O	fought
O	most
O	stubbornly
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	they
O	came
O	so
O	furiously
O	together
O	that
O	the
O	girths
O	of
O	their
O	horses
O	were
O	broken
O	and
O	both
O	were
O	borne
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	They
O	rose
O	up
O	speedily
O	and
O	drew
O	their
O	swords
O	and
O	resumed
O	the
O	combat;
O	and
O	all
O	those
O	that
O	witnessed
O	it
O	felt
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	such
O	a
O	battle
O	of
O	heroes
O	before
O	.
O	And
O	suddenly
O	with
O	a
O	blow
O	fiercely
O	strong
O	and
O	swiftly
O	keen
O	,
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	cut
O	the
O	fastenings
O	of
O	the
O	strange
O	knight
O	'
O	s
O	helm
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	headpiece
O	came
O	off
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	cry
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	dropped
O	his
O	weapon
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	his
O	cousin
O	.
O	'
O	My

O	I
O	yield
O	me
O	to
O	thee
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Nay
O	,
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	'
O	take
O	thou
O	mine
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	am
O	at
O	thy
O	mercy
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	came
O	forward
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	knew
O	him
O	and
O	kneeled
O	before
O	him
O	and
O	kissed
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	embraced
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	was
O	much
O	joy
O	between
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	and
O	Owen
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	had
O	feared
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	slain
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	in
O	despair
O	had
O	come
O	upon
O	this
O	adventure
O	to
O	learn
O	tidings
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	all
O	proceeded
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	the
O	countess
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	banquet
O	was
O	prepared
O	,
O	with
O	joustings
O	and
O	hawking
O	parties
O	and
O	games
O	.
O	They
O	stayed
O	three
O	months
O	in
O	great
O	happiness
O	and
O	diversion
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	when
O	King
O	Arthur
O	prepared
O	to
O	depart
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	countess
O	and
O	besought
O	her
O	to
O	permit
O	Owen
O	to
O	go
O	with
O	him
O	for
O	the
O	space
O	of
O	three
O	months
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	renew
O	his
O	friendships
O	at
O	the
O	court
O	at
O	Caerleon
O	.
O	And
O	though
O	it
O	made
O	the
O	countess
O	sorrowful
O	to
O	lose
O	the
O	man
O	she
O	loved
O	best
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	she
O	consented
O	,
O	and
O	Owen
O	promised
O	to
O	return
O	even
O	before
O	the
O	time
O	appointed
O	.
O	So
O	King
O	Arthur
O	returned
O	to
O	Caerleon
O	with
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	much
O	feasting
O	and
O	diversion
O	to
O	welcome
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	his
O	kindred
O	and
O	friends
O	tried
O	to
O	make
O	Owen
O	forget
O	the
O	countess
O	and
O	his
O	earldom
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	.
O	For
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	lady
O	he
O	loved
O	best
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	would
O	liefer
O	be
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	to
O	guard
O	and
O	cherish
O	her
O	,
O	than
O	in
O	any
O	other
O	place
O	on
O	the
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	One
O	night
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	court
O	sat
O	after
O	dinner
O	over
O	the
O	mead
O	cups
O	,
O	a
O	juggler
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	hall
O	and
O	performed
O	many
O	tricks
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	much
O	laughter
O	and
O	gaiety
O	at
O	his
O	merry
O	quips
O	and
O	jests
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	craved
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	search
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	each
O	lord
O	and
O	lady
O	present
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	tell
O	them
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	be
O	happy
O	in
O	love
O	.
O	He
O	began
O	with
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	along
O	the
O	board
O	,
O	uttering
O	merry
O	thoughts
O	on
O	all
O	,
O	but
O	speaking
O	with
O	serious
O	and
O	solemn
O	looks
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	looked
O	long
O	and
O	earnestly
O	at
O	the
O	marks
O	in
O	that
O	knight
O	'
O	s
O	palm
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	said
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	croaking
O	voice:
O	'
O	A
O	night
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	,
O	a
O	night
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	!
O	Thou
O	'
O	lt
O	grieve
O	for
O	thy
O	love
O	for
O	ever
O	and
O	aye
O	.
O	'
O	None
O	knew
O	what
O	this
O	might
O	mean
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	marvelled
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	pale
O	went
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	.
O	For
O	he
O	had
O	suddenly
O	remembered
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	Decet
O	the
O	troll-man
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	Beware
O	thee
O	of
O	leaving
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	her
O	that
O	shall
O	love
O	thee
O	for
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	night
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	,
O	or
O	long
O	woe
O	shall
O	find
O	thee
O	.
O	'
O	Instantly
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	rose
O	from
O	the
O	board
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	.
O	Going
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	abode
O	he
O	made
O	preparations
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	dawn
O	he
O	arose
O	and
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	forth
O	swiftly
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	dominions
O	of
O	the
O	countess
O	.
O	Great
O	was
O	his
O	fear
O	that
O	some
O	evil
O	had
O	befallen
O	her
O	in
O	consequence
O	of
O	his
O	leaving
O	her
O	unprotected
O	from
O	the
O	evil
O	powers
O	of
O	Sir
O	Dewin
O	.
O	He
O	rode
O	hard
O	and
O	fast
O	northwards
O	through
O	the
O	wild
O	and
O	desolate
O	mountains
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	sea
O	like
O	burnished
O	lead
O	lying
O	on
O	his
O	left
O	hand
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	turned
O	his
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	away
O	and
O	rode
O	far
O	into
O	the
O	deep
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	But
O	though
O	he
O	knew
O	the
O	way
O	passing
O	well
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	the
O	road
O	now
O	,
O	and
O	wandered
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	lonely
O	moorlands
O	and
O	the
O	dark
O	forest
O	rides
O	,
O	baffled
O	and
O	wearied
O	,
O	heartsick
O	and
O	full
O	of
O	dread
O	.
O	Thus
O	he
O	wandered
O	,
O	for
O	ever
O	seeking
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	trying
O	this
O	one
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	until
O	all
O	his
O	apparel
O	was
O	worn
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	body
O	was
O	wasted
O	away
O	and
O	his
O	hair
O	was
O	grown
O	long
O	.
O	And
O	at
O	length
O	,
O	from
O	misery
O	and
O	hopelessness
O	,
O	he
O	grew
O	so
O	weak
O	that
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	die
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	descended
O	slowly
O	from
O	the
O	mountains
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	hermit
O	,
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	might
O	tell
O	all
O	his
O	misery
O	before
O	he
O	died
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	any
O	harbourage
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	he
O	crawled
O	to
O	a
O	brook
O	in
O	a
O	park
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	there
O	wondering
O	why
O	this
O	evil
O	fate
O	had
O	been
O	visited
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	grieving
O	that
O	now
O	his
O	beloved
O	countess
O	must
O	be
O	in
O	wretchedness
O	and
O	sorrow
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	his
O	forgetting
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	never
O	more
O	could
O	he
O	hope
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	and
O	tell
O	her
O	how
O	grieved
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	to
O	cause
O	her
O	such
O	pain
O	.
O	Then
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	he
O	swooned
O	under
O	the
O	heat
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	from
O	hunger
O	and
O	weakness
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	half
O	in
O	and
O	half
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	brook
O	.
O	It
O	befell
O	that
O	a
O	widowed
O	lady
O	,
O	to
O	whom
O	the
O	brook
O	and
O	the
O	land
O	belonged
O	,
O	came
O	walking
O	in
O	the
O	fields
O	with
O	her
O	maids
O	.
O	And
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	saw
O	the
O	figure
O	of
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	and
O	,
O	half
O	fearful
O	,
O	she
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	found
O	him
O	faintly
O	breathing
O	.
O	The
O	widow
O	lady
O	had
O	him
O	taken
O	into
O	the
O	farmstead
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	tenants
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	was
O	tended
O	carefully
O	until
O	he
O	came
O	again
O	to
O	his
O	senses
O	.
O	And
O	with
O	the
O	good
O	care
O	,
O	meat
O	,
O	drink
O	,
O	and
O	medicaments
O	,
O	he
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	thrive
O	again
O	.
O	He
O	asked
O	the
O	man
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	who
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	there
O	.
O	'
O	It
O	was
O	our
O	Lady
O	of
O	the
O	Moors
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	man
O	sadly
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	though
O	she
O	is
O	herself
O	in
O	sore
O	straits
O	and
O	narrowly
O	bestead
O	by
O	a
O	cruel
O	and
O	oppressive
O	earl
O	,
O	who
O	would
O	rob
O	her
O	of
O	these
O	last
O	few
O	acres
O	,
O	yet
O	she
O	hath
O	ever
O	a
O	tender
O	heart
O	for
O	those
O	in
O	greater
O	distress
O	than
O	herself
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	It
O	grieves
O	me
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	the
O	lady
O	is
O	oppressed
O	by
O	that
O	felon
O	earl
O	.
O	He
O	should
O	be
O	hindered
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	sternly
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Ay
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	man
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	would
O	cease
O	his
O	wrongful
O	dealing
O	if
O	she
O	would
O	wed
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	cannot
O	abide
O	the
O	evil
O	face
O	of

O	.
O	'
O	Ever
O	and
O	anon
O	the
O	Lady
O	of
O	the
O	Moors
O	sent
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	maidens
O	to
O	learn
O	how
O	the
O	stranger
O	was
O	progressing
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	maiden
O	came
O	one
O	day
O	when
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	was
O	quite
O	recovered
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	greatly
O	astounded
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	comely
O	a
O	man
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	straight
O	and
O	tall
O	and
O	knightly
O	was
O	his
O	mien
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	sat
O	talking
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	the
O	jingle
O	and
O	clatter
O	of
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	looking
O	forth
O	,
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	saw
O	a
O	large
O	company
O	of
O	knights
O	and
O	men-at-arms
O	pass
O	down
O	the
O	road
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	inquired
O	of

O	were
O	.
O	'
O	That

O	'
O	I
O	will
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	maiden
O	,
O	and
O	wondered
O	what
O	he
O	would
O	do
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	Before
O	the
O	day
O	was
O	passed
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	beautiful
O	black
O	steed
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	beechen
O	saddle
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	suit
O	of
O	armour
O	,
O	both
O	for
O	man
O	and
O	horse
O	.
O	And
O	Owen
O	armed
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	dark
O	he
O	went
O	forth
O	and
O	stationed
O	himself
O	under
O	a
O	great
O	oak
O	,
O	where
O	none
O	could
O	see
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	earl
O	,
O	elated
O	with
O	insolence
O	and
O	wine
O	,
O	came
O	back
O	that
O	way
O	,
O	shouting
O	and
O	rolling
O	in
O	his
O	saddle
O	,
O	Owen
O	marked
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	rode
O	.
O	He
O	dashed
O	out
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	fiercely
O	swift
O	was
O	he
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	heavy
O	were
O	his
O	blows
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	beaten
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	beside
O	the
O	earl
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	earl
O	he
O	had
O	dragged
O	from
O	the
O	saddle
O	and
O	laid
O	him
O	across
O	his
O	crupper
O	,
O	before
O	the
O	earl
O	'
O	s
O	companions
O	were
O	aware
O	of
O	what
O	was
O	done
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	countess
O	sat
O	in
O	hall
O	,
O	sadly
O	thinking
O	how
O	soon
O	the
O	craven
O	earl
O	would
O	thrust
O	her
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	home
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	the
O	beat
O	of
O	hoofs
O	,
O	the
O	great
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	manor
O	swung
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	tall
O	knight
O	in
O	black
O	armour
O	strode
O	in
O	,
O	thrusting
O	another
O	knight
O	before

O	.

O	In

O	terror
O	the
O	earl
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	since
O	he
O	oppressed
O	women
O	,
O	was
O	an
O	abject

O	,
O	sank
O	upon

O	that
O	his

O	Wisht
O	Wood
O	,
O	the
O	Dead

O	the
O	Hill

O	of
O	Stone
O	,
O	and
O	only
O	a

O	Joyously
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	glad
O	to
O	learn
O	that
O	now
O	he
O	might
O	hope

O	the
O	Lady

O	long
O	and
O	earnestly
O	till
O	he
O	disappeared
O	into
O	a
O	forest
O	.
O	He
O	journeyed
O	three
O	days
O	through
O	the
O	Wisht
O	Wood
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	were
O	the
O	dreadful
O	things
O	he
O	saw

O	heard
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	eyes
O	,
O	green
O	and
O	black
O	and
O	yellow
O	,
O	peered
O	at
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	bushes
O	as
O	he
O	sat
O	over
O	his
O	fire
O	at
O	night
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	clasped
O	the
O	blue
O	stone
O	which
O	the
O	troll
O	Decet
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	naught
O	could

O	On
O	the
O	fourth
O	day
O	he
O	descended
O	into
O	the
O	Dead
O	Valley
O	.
O	And
O	here
O	he
O	was
O	like
O	to
O	die
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	air
O	was
O	so
O	thick
O	,
O	and
O	filled
O	with
O	the
O	poison
O	of
O	witches
O	who
O	haunted
O	there
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	ridden
O	fiercely
O	and
O	fast
O	through
O	its
O	deathly
O	vapours
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	have
O	reached
O	the
O	slopes
O	of
O	the
O	Hill
O	of
O	the
O	Tower
O	of
O	Stone
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	air
O	was
O	pure
O	and
O	blew
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	clean
O	sky
O	.
O	Long
O	and
O	toilsome
O	and
O	exceedingly
O	steep
O	was
O	the
O	way
O	up
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	times
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	sink
O	down
O	for
O	sheer
O	weariness
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	was
O	dark
O	night
O	before
O	he
O	reached
O	level
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	or
O	what
O	place
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	.
O	But
O	having
O	said
O	his
O	prayers
O	,
O	fed
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	eaten
O	from
O	the
O	scrip
O	which
O	the
O	Lady
O	of
O	the
O	Moors
O	had
O	made
O	up
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	lay
O	down
O	beside
O	a
O	thick
O	bush
O	and
O	slept
O	soundly
O	.
O	Many
O	were
O	the
O	terrible
O	sounds
O	that
O	came
O	from
O	far
O	below
O	,
O	where
O	fierce
O	witches
O	and
O	warlocks
O	battled
O	and
O	tore
O	each
O	other
O	in
O	the
O	Dead
O	Valley;
O	but
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	was
O	so
O	overcome
O	that
O	he
O	awoke
O	not
O	.
O	And
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	morning
O	broke
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	serpent
O	issued
O	from
O	a
O	rock
O	near
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	and
O	crept
O	towards
O	him
O	to
O	slay
O	him
O	.
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	still
O	lay
O	asleep
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	huge
O	creature
O	reared
O	his
O	head
O	to
O	strike
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	that
O	moment
O	a
O	great
O	brown
O	bear
O	,
O	that
O	had
O	sat
O	near
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	through
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	leaped
O	forward
O	with
O	a
O	fierce
O	growl
O	,
O	and
O	gripped
O	the
O	serpent
O	by
O	the
O	head
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	serpent
O	hissed
O	and
O	writhed
O	.
O	With
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	the
O	struggle
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	awoke
O	,
O	and
O	marvelled
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	two
O	animals
O	closed
O	in
O	deadly
O	combat
O	.
O	He
O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	and
O	slew
O	the
O	serpent
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	wiped
O	his
O	weapon
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	led
O	it
O	forward
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	bear
O	followed
O	him
O	and
O	played
O	about
O	him
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	greyhound
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	reared
O	.
O	And
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	stopped
O	and
O	said:
O	'
O	This
O	is
O	a
O	marvel
O	,

O	follow
O	me
O	gambolling
O	,

O	I
O	slew

O	ye
O	so
O	grateful
O	,
O	then
O	,

O	been
O	captive
O	unto
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	are
O	fain
O	to
O	see
O	one
O	in
O	this
O	desolate
O	waste
O	?
O	'
O	The
O	bear
O	gambolled
O	as
O	if
O	pleased
O	to
O	hear
O	him
O	speak
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	a
O	little
O	way
O	and
O	looked
O	back
O	as
O	if
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	the
O	knight
O	was
O	following
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	would
O	go
O	another
O	way
O	,
O	the
O	bear
O	stamped
O	his
O	foot
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	at
O	length
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	laugh
O	,
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	said
O	he
O	would
O	follow
O	the
O	way
O	he
O	wished
O	.
O	Wild
O	was
O	that
O	place
O	and
O	rocky
O	,
O	full
O	of
O	great
O	boulders
O	and
O	with
O	deep
O	pits
O	obscured
O	by
O	bushes
O	.
O	Full
O	irksome
O	was
O	it
O	to
O	pass
O	through
O	,
O	for
O	besides
O	the
O	slipperiness

O	the
O	way
O	,
O	the
O	sun
O	shone
O	pitilessly
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	heat
O	was
O	returned
O	by
O	the
O	hard
O	rocks
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	water
O	.
O	If
O	the
O	bear
O	had
O	not
O	led
O	him
O	,
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	would
O	have
O	missed

O	many
O	times
O	,

O	down
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	many
O	chasms
O	that
O	yawned
O	everywhere
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	became
O	faint
O	with
O	hunger
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	dismounted
O	and
O	tethered
O	his
O	horse
O	to
O	a
O	leafless
O	thorn
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	shadow
O	of
O	an
O	enormous
O	rock
O	that
O	reared
O	up
O	like
O	a
O	huge
O	tower
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	bear
O	looked
O	at
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	and
O	then
O	disappeared
O	.
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	wondered
O	sadly
O	whether
O	he
O	should
O	ever
O	win
O	through
O	the
O	perils
O	that
O	encompassed
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	see
O	again
O	the
O	lady
O	whom
O	he
O	loved
O	best
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	And
O	weak
O	with
O	famine
O	,
O	he
O	doubted
O	whether
O	he
O	should
O	not
O	leave
O	his
O	bones
O	to
O	bleach
O	beside
O	the
O	great
O	rock
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	looked
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	bear
O	coming
O	towards
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	carried
O	a
O	roebuck
O	,
O	freshly
O	slain
O	,
O	which
O	it
O	brought
O	and
O	laid
O	at
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	'
O	s
O	feet
O	.
O	The
O	knight
O	sprang
O	up
O	with
O	a
O	glad
O	cry
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	fire
O	with
O	his
O	flint
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bear
O	brought
O	dried
O	sticks
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	a
O	fire
O	was
O	blazing
O	,
O	and
O	juicy
O	collops
O	were
O	spluttering
O	on
O	skewers
O	before
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	When
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	had
O	finished
O	eating
O	,
O	the
O	bear
O	seemed
O	to
O	wish
O	him
O	to
O	follow
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bear
O	led
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	brook
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	green
O	patch
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	the
O	knight
O	quenched
O	his
O	thirst
O	.
O	By
O	now
O	it
O	was
O	twilight
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	made
O	up
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	prepared
O	himself
O	to
O	slumber;
O	and
O	the
O	bear
O	lay
O	down
O	beside
O	him
O	and
O	blinked
O	at
O	the
O	fire
O	like
O	a
O	great
O	dog
O	.
O	The
O	knight
O	saw
O	the
O	sun
O	far
O	in
O	the
O	west
O	dip
O	beneath
O	a
O	cloud
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	cold
O	wind
O	blew
O	across
O	the
O	waste
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	sigh
O	from
O	somewhere
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	another
O	and
O	again
O	a
O	third
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	sound
O	seemed
O	to
O	come
O	from
O	within
O	the
O	towering
O	stone
O	.
O	He
O	cried
O	out
O	,
O	'
O	If
O	thou

O	as

O	in

O	I
O	am
O	imprisoned
O	,
O	unless

O	'
O	The
O	stone
O	was
O	so
O	thick
O	that
O	the
O	voices
O	of
O	both
O	were
O	muffled
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	neither
O	recognised
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	asked
O	who

O	was

O	spoke
O	to
O	him
O	.

O	'
O	Much
O	as
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	wished
O	to
O	ask
O	how
O	his
O	countess
O	had
O	fared
O	through
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	his

O	stole
O	away
O	,
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	stamped
O	out
O	his
O	fire
O	.
O	Towards
O	midnight
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	great
O	roaring
O	wind
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	shower
O	of
O	hailstones
O	,
O	and
O	thunder
O	and
O	lightning
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	three
O	great
O	black
O	shapes
O	descend
O	from
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	these
O	were
O	the
O	evil
O	wizard
O	knights
O	,
O	Sir
O	Dewin
O	and
O	his
O	two
O	sons
O	.
O	They
O	alighted
O	upon
O	the
O	hill
O	near
O	the
O	Tower
O	of
O	Stone
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	shapes
O	of
O	men
O	.
O	Instantly
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	gather
O	wood
O	and
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	huge
O	heap
O	.
O	And
O	Sir
O	Dewin
O	made
O	witchfire
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	light
O	the
O	pile
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	crept
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	,

O	the
O	bear
O	went
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	the
O	wizard
O	bent
O	to
O	light
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	raised
O	his
O	sword

O	chopped
O	off

O	s
O	head
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	hopped
O	into
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	The
O	bear
O	had
O	gone
O	behind
O	the
O	two
O	sons
O	and
O	now
O	clawed
O	them
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	they
O	struggled
O	fiercely
O	to
O	get
O	loose
O	,
O	the
O	bear
O	hugged
O	them
O	so
O	tightly
O	that

O	could
O	not
O	move
O	.

O	Sir
O	Owen
O	slew
O	them
O	both
