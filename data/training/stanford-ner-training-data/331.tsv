O	And
O	in

O	Once
O	more
O	she

O	long
O	hall

O	close

O	I'll
O	manage

O	she
O	said
O	to
O	herself
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	by
O	taking
O	the

O	golden
O	key
O	,
O	and
O	unlocking
O	the
O	door
O	that
O	led
O	into
O	the
O	garden
O	.
O	Then
O	she
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	nibbling
O	at
O	the
O	mushroom
O	(
O	she
O	had
O	kept
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	it
O	in
O	her
O	pocket
O	)
O	till
O	she
O	was
O	about
O	a
O	foot
O	high:
O	then
O	she
O	walked
O	down
O	the
O	little
O	passage:
O	and
O	_then_--she
O	found
O	herself
O	at
O	last
O	in
O	the
O	beautiful
O	garden
O	among
O	the
O	bright
O	flower-beds

O	the
O	cool
O	fountains
O	.
