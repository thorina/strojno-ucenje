O	a

O	two

O	a

O	was
O	stretched

O	his

O	,
O	Sir

O	uttered
O	never

O	Then
O	,
O	in
O	great
O	wrath
O	,
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	laid
O	his
O	lance
O	in

O	a
O	bitter
O	cry
O	from
O	the
O	other
O	path
O	and
O	,
O	looking
O	round
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	a

O	into

O	came
O	up
O	twelve
