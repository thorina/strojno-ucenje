O	Guerin
O	de
O	Montglave
O	held
O	the
O	lordship
O	of
O	Vienne
O	,
O	subject
O	to
O	Charlemagne
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	quarrelled
O	with
O	his
O	sovereign
O	,
O	and
O	Charles
O	laid
O	siege
O	to
O	his
O	city
O	,
O	having
O	ravaged
O	the
O	neighboring
O	country
O	.
O	Guerin
O	was
O	an
O	aged
O	warrior
O	,
O	but
O	relied
O	for
O	his
O	defence
O	upon
O	his
O	four
O	sons
O	and
O	two
O	grandsons
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	among
O	the
O	bravest
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	age
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	siege
O	had
O	continued
O	two
O	months
O	,
O	Charlemagne
O	received
O	tidings
O	that
O	Marsilius
O	,
O	King
O	of
O	Spain
O	,
O	had
O	invaded
O	France
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	finding
O	himself
O	unopposed
O	,
O	was
O	advancing
O	rapidly
O	in
O	the
O	Southern
O	provinces
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	intelligence
O	,
O	Charles
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	counsel
O	of
O	his
O	peers
O	,
O	and
O	consented
O	to
O	put
O	the
O	quarrel
O	with
O	Guerin
O	to
O	the
O	decision
O	of
O	Heaven
O	,
O	by
O	single
O	combat
O	between
O	two
O	knights
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	each
O	party
O	,
O	selected
O	by
O	lot
O	.
O	The
O	proposal
O	was
O	acceptable
O	to
O	Guerin
O	and
O	his
O	sons
O	.
O	The
O	names
O	of
O	the
O	four
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	Guerin's
O	own
O	,
O	who
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	excused
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	grandsons
O	,
O	who
O	claimed
O	their
O	lot
O	,
O	being
O	put
O	into
O	a
O	helmet
O	,
O	Oliver's
O	was
O	drawn
O	forth
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	the
O	youngest
O	of
O	the
O	grandsons
O	,
O	was
O	assigned
O	the
O	honor
O	and
O	the
O	peril
O	of
O	the
O	combat
O	.
O	He
O	accepted
O	the
O	award
O	with
O	delight
O	,
O	exulting
O	in
O	being
O	thought
O	worthy
O	to
O	maintain
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	his
O	family
O	.
O	On
O	Charlemagne's
O	side
O	Roland
O	was
O	the
O	designated
O	champion
O	,
O	and
O	neither
O	he
O	nor
O	Oliver
O	knew
O	who
O	his
O	antagonist
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	.
O	They
O	met
O	on
O	an
O	island
O	in
O	the
O	river
O	Rhone
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	warriors
O	of
O	both
O	camps
O	were
O	ranged
O	on
O	either
O	shore
O	,
O	spectators
O	of
O	the
O	battle
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	first
O	encounter
O	both
O	lances
O	were
O	shivered
O	,
O	but
O	both
O	riders
O	kept
O	their
O	seats
O	,
O	immovable
O	.
O	They
O	dismounted
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	their
O	swords
O	.
O	Then
O	ensued
O	a
O	combat
O	which
O	seemed
O	so
O	equal
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	spectators
O	could
O	not
O	form
O	an
O	opinion
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	probable
O	result
O	.
O	Two
O	hours
O	and
O	more
O	the
O	knights
O	continued
O	to
O	strike
O	and
O	parry
O	,
O	to
O	thrust
O	and
O	ward
O	,
O	neither
O	showing
O	any
O	sign
O	of
O	weariness
O	,
O	nor
O	ever
O	being
O	taken
O	at
O	unawares
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	Roland
O	struck
O	furiously
O	upon
O	Oliver's
O	shield
O	,
O	burying
O	Durindana
O	in
O	its
O	edge
O	so
O	deeply
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	draw
O	it
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	Oliver
O	,
O	almost
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	moment
O	,
O	thrust
O	so
O	vigorously
O	upon
O	Roland's
O	breastplate
O	that
O	his
O	sword
O	snapped
O	off
O	at
O	the
O	handle
O	.
O	Thus
O	were
O	the
O	two
O	warriors
O	left
O	weaponless
O	.
O	Scarcely
O	pausing
O	a
O	moment
O	,
O	they
O	rushed
O	upon
O	one
O	another
O	,
O	each
O	striving
O	to
O	throw
O	his
O	adversary
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	failing
O	in
O	that
O	,
O	each
O	snatched
O	at
O	the
O	other's
O	helmet
O	to
O	tear
O	it
O	away
O	.
O	Both
O	succeeded
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	moment
O	they
O	stood
O	bareheaded
O	face
O	to
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	Roland
O	recognized
O	Oliver
O	,
O	and
O	Oliver
O	,
O	Roland
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	moment
O	they
O	stood
O	still;
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	,
O	with
O	open
O	arms
O	,
O	rushed
O	into
O	one
O	another's
O	embrace
O	.
O	"""I"
O	am
O	conquered
O	,
O	""""
O	said
O	Roland
O	.
O	"""I"
O	yield
O	me
O	,
O	""""
O	said
O	Oliver
O	.
O	The
O	people
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	to
O	make
O	of
O	all
O	this
O	.
O	Presently
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	two
O	late
O	antagonists
O	standing
O	hand
O	in
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	evident
O	the
O	battle
O	was
O	at
O	an
O	end
O	.
O	The
O	knights
O	crowded
O	round
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	one
O	voice
O	hailed
O	them
O	as
O	equals
O	in
O	glory
O	.
O	If
O	there
O	were
O	any
O	who
O	felt
O	disposed
O	to
O	murmur
O	that
O	the
O	battle
O	was
O	left
O	undecided
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	silenced
O	by
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	Ogier
O	the
O	Dane
O	,
O	who
O	proclaimed
O	aloud
O	that
O	all
O	had
O	been
O	done
O	that
O	honor
O	required
O	,
O	and
O	declared
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	maintain
O	that
O	award
O	against
O	all
O	gainsayers
O	.
O	The
O	quarrel
O	with
O	Guerin
O	and
O	his
O	sons
O	being
O	left
O	undecided
O	,
O	a
O	truce
O	was
O	made
O	for
O	four
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	efforts
O	of
O	Duke
O	Namo
O	on
O	the
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	Oliver
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	a
O	reconciliation
O	was
O	effected
O	.
O	Charlemagne
O	,
O	accompanied
O	by
O	Guerin
O	and
O	his
O	valiant
O	family
O	,
O	marched
O	to
O	meet
O	Marsilius
O	,
O	who
O	hastened
O	to
O	retreat
O	across
O	the
O	frontier
O	.
