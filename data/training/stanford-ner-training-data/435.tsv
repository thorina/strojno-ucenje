O	upon

O	And
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	boat
O	rapidly
O	advanced
O	,
O	Edward
O	could
O	make
O	out
O	a
O	great

O	The

O	The
O	men
O	rowed
O	straight
O	for

O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	letting
O	the
O	boat

O	At

O	the

O	The

O	Presently
O	,

O	the

O	,

O	his
O	whole

O	,
O	and
O	about
O	a

O	five

O	behind
O	several
O	others
O	slumbered

O	.
O	In
O	a

O	seen
O	the
O	carcasses
O	of
O	both
O	sheep
O	and
O	cattle
O	,
O	hung
O	by
O	the
O	heels
O	as
O	in
O	a
O	butcher's
O	shop
O	,
O	some
O	of

O	the
O	Baron

O	herds
O	.
O	The
O	master
O	of
O	this
O	strange
O	dwelling
O	came
O	forward
O	to
O	welcome
O	Edward
O	,
O	while
O	Evan
O	Dhu
O	stood
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	necessary
O	introductions
O	.
O	Edward
O	had
O	expected
O	to
O	meet
O	with
O	a
O	huge
O	savage
O	warrior
O	in
O	the
O	captain
O	of
O	such
O	banditti
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	his
O	surprise
O	he
O	found
O	Donald
O	Bean
O	Lean
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	little
O	man
O	,
O	pale
O	and
O	insignificant
O	in
O	appearance
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	even
O	Highland
O	in
O	dress
O	.
O	For
O	at
O	one
O	time
O	Donald
O	had
O	served
O	in
O	the
O	French
O	army
O	.
O	So
O	now
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	receiving
O	Edward
O	in
O	his
O	national
O	costume
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	put
O	on
O	an
O	old
O	blue-and-red
O	foreign
O	uniform
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	made
O	so
O	strange
O	a
O	figure
O	that
O	,
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	donned
O	in
O	his
O	honour
O	,
O	his
O	visitor
O	had
O	hard
O	work
O	to
O	keep
O	from
O	laughing
O	.
O	Nor
O	was
O	the
O	freebooter's
O	conversation
O	more
O	in
O	accord
O	with
O	his
O	surroundings
O	.
O	He
O	talked
O	much
O	of
O	Edward's
O	family
O	and
O	connections
O	,
O	and
O	especially
O	of
O	his
O	uncle's
O	Jacobite
O	politics--on
O	which
O	last
O	account
O	,
O	he
O	seemed
O	inclined
O	to
O	welcome
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	with
O	more
O	cordiality
O	than
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	soldier
O	of
O	King
O	George
O	,
O	Edward
O	felt
O	to
O	be
O	his
O	due
O	.
O	The
O	scene
O	which
O	followed
O	was
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	better
O	fitted
O	to
O	the
O	time
O	and
O	place
O	.
O	At
O	a
O	half-savage
O	feast
O	Edward
O	had
O	the
O	opportunity
O	of
O	tasting
O	steaks
O	fresh
O	cut
O	from
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	Baron's
O	cattle
O	,
O	broiled
O	on
O	the
O	coals
O	before
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	washed
O	down
O	with
O	draughts
O	of
O	Highland
O	whiskey
O	.
O	Yet
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	warmth
O	of
O	his
O	welcome
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	something
O	very
O	secret
O	and
O	unpleasant
O	about
O	the
O	shifty
O	cunning
O	glance
