O	when

O	to

O	No

O	,

O	could
O	peep
O	over
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	climb
O	up
O	a
O	ladder
O	to
O	comb
O	his

O	Every

O	,
O	after

O	in

O	had
O	done
O	at
O	the
O	fairy
O	Do-nothing
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	ending
O	in
O	a
O	miserable
O	death
O	.
O	But
O	his
O	attention
O	was
O	soon
O	after
O	most
O	alarmingly
O	roused
O	by
O	hearing
O	the
O	giant
O	Snap-
O	'
O	em-up
O	again
O	in
O	conversation
O	with
O	his
O	cook
O	,
O	who
O	said
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	wished
O	for
O	a
O	good
O	large
O	dish
O	of
O	scalloped
O	children
O	at
O	dinner
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	necessary
O	to
O	catch
O	a
O	few
O	more
O	,
O	as
O	those
O	he
O	had
O	already
O	provided
O	would
O	scarcely
O	be
O	a
O	mouthful
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	giant
O	kept
O	very
O	fashionable
O	hours
O	,
O	and
O	always
O	waited
O	dinner
O	for
O	himself
O	till
O	nine
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	still
O	plenty
O	of
O	time;
O	so
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	loud
O	grumble
O	about
O	the
O	trouble
O	,
O	he
O	seized
O	a
O	large
O	basket
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	off
O	at
O	a
O	rapid
O	pace
O	towards
O	the
O	fairy
O	Teach-all
O	'
O	s
O	garden
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	very
O	seldom
O	that
O	Snap-
O	'
O	em-up
O	ventured
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	foraging
O	in
O	this
O	direction
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	never
O	once
O	succeeded
O	in
O	carrying
O	off
O	a
O	single
O	captive
O	from
O	the
O	enclosure
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	well
O	fortified
O	and
O	so
O	bravely
O	defended;
O	but
O	on
O	this
O	occasion
O	,
O	being
O	desperately
O	hungry
O	,
O	he
O	felt
O	as
O	bold
O	as
O	a
O	lion
O	,
O	and
O	walked
O	,
O	with
O	outstretched
O	hands
O	,
O	straight
O	towards
O	the
O	fairy
O	Teach-all
O	'
O	s
O	dinner-table
O	,
O	taking
O	such
O	prodigious
O	strides
O	that
O	he
O	seemed
O	almost
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	trample
O	on
O	himself
O	.
O	A
O	cry
O	of
O	consternation
O	arose
O	the
O	instant
O	this
O	tremendous
O	giant
O	appeared
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	usual
O	on
O	such
O	occasions
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	the
O	same
O	attempt
O	before
O	,
O	a
O	dreadful
O	battle
O	took
O	place
O	.
O	Fifty
O	active
O	little
O	boys
O	bravely
O	flew
O	upon
O	the
O	enemy
O	,
O	armed
O	with
O	their
O	dinner-knives
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	nest
O	of
O	hornets
O	,
O	stinging
O	him
O	in
O	every
O	direction
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	roared
O	with
O	pain
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	run
O	away;
O	but
O	the
O	fairy
O	Teach-all
O	,
O	seeing
O	his
O	intention
O	,
O	rushed
O	forward
O	with
O	the
O	carving-knife
O	,
O	and
O	brandishing
O	it
O	high
O	over
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	she
O	most
O	courageously
O	stabbed
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	heart
O	.
O	If
O	a
O	great
O	mountain
O	had
O	fallen
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	seemed
O	like
O	nothing
O	in
O	comparison
O	with
O	the
O	giant
O	Snap-
O	'
O	em-up
O	,
O	who
O	crushed
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	houses
O	to
O	powder
O	beneath
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	upset
O	several
O	fine
O	monuments
O	that
O	were
O	to
O	have
O	made
O	people
O	remembered
O	for
O	ever
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	this
O	would
O	have
O	seemed
O	scarcely
O	worth
O	mentioning
O	had
O	it
O	not
O	been
O	for
O	a
O	still
O	greater
O	event
O	which
O	occurred
O	on
O	the
O	occasion
O	,
O	no
O	less
O	than
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	the
O	fairy
O	Do-nothing
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	indolently
O	looking
O	on
O	at
O	this
O	great
O	battle
O	without
O	taking
O	the
O	trouble
O	to
O	interfere
O	,
O	or
O	even
O	to
O	care
O	who
O	was
O	victorious;
O	but
O	being
O	also
O	lazy
O	about
O	running
O	away
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	giant
O	fell
O	,
O	his
O	sword
O	came
O	with
O	so
O	violent
O	a
O	stroke
O	on
O	her
O	head
O	that
O	she
O	instantly
O	expired
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	luckily
O	for
O	the
O	whole
O	world
O	,
O	the
O	fairy
O	Teach-all
O	got
O	possession
O	of
O	immense
O	property
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	proceeded
O	without
O	delay
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	best
O	use
O	of
O	in
O	her
O	power
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	first
O	place
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	she
O	lost
O	no
O	time
O	in
O	liberating
O	Master
O	No-book
O	from
O	his
O	hook
O	in
O	the
O	larder
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	lecture
O	on
O	activity
O	,
O	moderation
O	,
O	and
O	good
O	conduct
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	never
O	afterwards
O	forgot;
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	astonishing
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	change
O	that
O	took
O	place
O	immediately
O	in
O	his
O	whole
O	thoughts
O	and
O	actions
O	.
O	From
O	this
O	very
O	hour
O	Master
O	No-book
O	became
O	the
O	most
O	diligent
O	,
O	active
O	,
O	happy
O	boy
O	in
O	the
O	fairy
O	Teach-all
O	'
O	s
O	garden;
O	and
O	on
O	returning
O	home
O	a
O	month
O	afterwards
O	,
O	he
O	astonished
O	all
O	the
O	masters
O	at
O	school
O	by
O	his
O	extraordinary
O	reformation
O	.
O	The
O	most
O	difficult
O	lessons
O	were
O	a
O	pleasure
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	scarcely
O	ever
O	stirred
O	without
O	a
O	book
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	never
O	lay
O	on
O	a
O	sofa
O	again
O	,
O	would
O	scarcely
O	even
O	sit
O	on
O	a
O	chair
O	with
O	a
O	back
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	preferred
O	a
O	three-legged
O	stool
O	,
O	detested
O	holidays
O	,
O	never
O	thought
O	any
O	exertion
O	a
O	trouble
O	,
O	preferred
O	climbing
O	over
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	hill
O	to
O	creeping
O	round
O	the
O	bottom
O	,
O	always
O	ate
O	the
O	plainest
O	food
O	in
O	very
O	small
O	quantities
O	,
O	joined
O	a
O	temperance
O	society
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	tasted
O	a
O	morsel
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	worked
O	very
O	hard
O	and
O	got
O	an
O	appetite
O	.
O	Not
O	long
O	after
O	this
O	an
O	old
O	uncle
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	formerly
O	been
O	ashamed
O	of
O	Master
O	No-book
O	'
O	s
O	indolence
O	and
O	gluttony
O	,
O	became
O	so
O	pleased
O	at
O	the
O	wonderful
O	change
O	that
O	on
O	his
O	death
O	he
O	left
O	him
O	a
O	magnificent
O	estate
O	,
O	desiring
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	take
O	his
O	name;
O	therefore
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	being
O	any
O	longer
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	No-book
O	family
O	,
O	he
O	is
O	now
O	called
O	Sir
O	Timothy
O	Blue-stocking
O	,
O	a
O	pattern
O	to
O	the
O	whole
O	country
O	around
O	for
O	the
O	good
O	he
O	does
O	to
O	everyone
O	,
O	and
O	especially
O	for
O	his
O	extraordinary
O	activity
O	,
O	appearing
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	twenty
O	things
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	Though
O	generally
O	very
O	good-natured
O	and
O	agreeable
O	,
O	Sir
O	Timothy
O	is
O	occasionally
O	observed
O	in
O	a
O	violent
O	passion
O	,
O	laying
O	about
O	him
O	with
O	his
O	walking-stick
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	terrific
O	manner
O	,
O	and
O	beating
O	little
O	boys
O	within
O	an
O	inch
O	of
O	their
O	lives;
O	but
O	on
O	inquiry
O	it
O	invariably
O	appears
O	that
O	he
O	has
O	found
O	them
O	out
O	to
O	be
O	lazy
O	,
O	idle
O	,
O	or
O	greedy;
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	industrious
O	boys
O	in
O	the
O	parish
O	are
O	sent
O	to
O	get
O	employment
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	assures
O	them
O	that
O	they
O	are
O	far
O	happier
O	breaking
O	stones
O	on
O	the
O	road
O	than
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	sitting
O	idly
O	in
O	a
O	drawing-room
O	with
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	.
