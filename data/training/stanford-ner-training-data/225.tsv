O	There
O	lived
O	a
O	hunter
O	in
O	the
O	North
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	a
O	wife
O	and
O	one
O	child
O	.
O	His
O	lodge
O	stood
O	far
O	off
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	several
O	days'
O	journey
O	from
O	any
O	other
O	.
O	He
O	spent
O	his
O	days
O	in
O	hunting
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	evenings
O	in
O	relating
O	to
O	his
O	wife
O	the
O	incidents
O	that
O	had
O	befallen
O	him
O	.
O	As
O	game
O	was
O	very
O	abundant
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	no
O	difficulty
O	in
O	killing
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	they
O	wanted
O	.
O	Just
O	in
O	all
O	his
O	acts
O	,
O	he
O	lived
O	a
O	peaceful
O	and
O	happy
O	life
O	.
O	One
O	evening
O	during
O	the
O	winter
O	season
O	,
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
O	he
O	remained
O	out
O	longer
O	than
O	usual
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	began
O	to
O	fear
O	that
O	some
O	accident
O	had
O	befallen
O	him
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	already
O	dark
O	.
O	She
O	listened
O	attentively
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	heard
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	approaching
O	footsteps
O	.
O	Not
O	doubting
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	her
O	husband
O	,
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	beheld
O	two
O	strange
O	females
O	.
O	She
O	bade
O	them
O	enter
O	,
O	and
O	invited
O	them
O	to
O	remain
O	.
O	She
O	observed
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	total
O	strangers
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	something
O	so
O	peculiar
O	in
O	their
O	looks
O	,
O	air
O	and
O	manner
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	disturbed
O	by
O	their
O	presence
O	.
O	They
O	would
O	not
O	come
O	near
O	to
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	They
O	sat
O	in
O	a
O	remote
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	shy
O	and
O	taciturn
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	their
O	garments
O	about
O	them
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	manner
O	as
O	nearly
O	to
O	hide
O	their
O	faces
O	.
O	So
O	far
O	as
O	she
O	could
O	judge
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	pale
O	,
O	hollow-eyed
O	,
O	and
O	long-visaged
O	,
O	very
O	thin
O	and
O	emaciated
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	but
O	little
O	light
O	in
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	fire
O	was
O	low
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	fitful
O	flashes
O	,
O	by
O	disclosing
O	their
O	white
O	faces
O	and
O	then
O	dropping
O	them
O	in
O	sudden
O	darkness

O	served
O	rather
O	to
O	increase
