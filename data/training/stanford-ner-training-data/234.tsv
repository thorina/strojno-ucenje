O	along
O	by

O	By

O	he

O	Aggo

O	a

O	to
O	a
O	ride
O	upon
O	one
O	of

O	In
O	the
O	mean
O	time
O	,
O	Aggo
O	Dah
O	Gauda
O	had
O	reached
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	finding
O	that
O	his
O	daughter
O	had
O	been
O	stolen
O	,
O	his
O	indignation
O	was
O	so
O	thoroughly
O	awakened
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	forthwith
O	torn
O	every
O	hair
O	from
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	being
O	entirely
O	bald
O	,
O	this
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	question
O	,
O	so
O	,
O	as
O	an
O	easy
O	and
O	natural
O	vent
O	to
O	his
O	feelings
O	,
O	Aggo
O	hopped
O	off
O	half
O	a
O	mile
O	in
O	every
O	direction
O	.
O	First
O	he
O	hopped
O	east
O	,
O	then
O	he
O	hopped
O	west
O	,
O	next
O	he
O	hopped
O	north
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	he
O	hopped
O	south
O	,
O	all
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	his
O	daughter;
O	till
O	the
O	one
O	leg
O	was
O	fairly
O	tired
O	out
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	sat
O	down
O	in
O	his
O	lodge
O	,
O	and
O	resting
O	himself
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	he
O	reflected
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	vowed
O	that
O	his
O	single
O	leg
O	should
O	never
O	know
O	rest
O	again
O	until
O	he
O	had
O	found
O	his
O	beautiful
O	daughter
O	and
O	brought
O	her
O	home
O	.
O	For
O	this
O	purpose
O	he
O	immediately
O	set
O	out
O	.
O	Now
O	that
O	he
O	proceeded
O	more
O	coolly
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	easily
O	track
O	the
O	buffalo-king
O	until
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	plunged
O	in
O	and
O	swam
O	over
O	.
O	There
O	having
O	been
O	a
O	frosty
O	night
O	or
O	two
O	since
O	,
O	the
O	water
O	was
O	so
O	covered
O	with
O	thin
O	ice
O	that
O	Aggo
O	could
O	not
O	venture
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	even
O	with
O	one
O	leg
O	.
O	He
O	encamped
O	hard
O	by
O	till
O	it
O	became
O	more
O	solid
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	crossed
O	over
O	and
O	pursued
O	the
O	trail
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	went
O	along
O	he
O	saw
O	branches
O	broken
O	off
O	and
O	strewed
O	behind
O	,
O	which
O	guided
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	course;
O	for
O	these
O	had
O	been
O	purposely
O	cast
O	along
O	by
O	the
O	daughter
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	manner
O	in
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	accomplished
O	it
O	was
O	this
O	.
O	Her
O	hair
O	was
O	all
O	untied
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	caught
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	being
O	very
O	long
O	it
O	took
O	hold
O	of
O	the
O	branches
O	as
O	they
O	darted
O	along
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	these
O	twigs
O	that
O	she
O	broke
O	off
O	as
O	signs
O	to
O	her
O	father
O	.
O	When
O	Aggo
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	king's
O	lodge
O	it
O	was
O	evening
O	.
O	Carefully
O	approaching
O	,
O	he
O	peeped
O	through
O	the
O	sides
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	his
O	daughter
O	sitting
O	disconsolate
O	.
O	She
O	immediately
O	caught
O	his
O	eye
O	,
O	and
O	knowing
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	her
O	father
O	come
O	for
O	her
O	,
O	she
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	appeared
O	to
O	relent
O	in
O	her
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	asking
O	for
O	the
O	royal
O	dipper
O	,
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	"""I"
O	will
O	go
O	and
O	get
O	you
O	a
O	drink
O	of
O	water
O	.
O	""""
O	This
O	token
O	of
O	submission
O	delighted
O	his
O	majesty
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	high
O	in
O	hope
O	,
O	he
O	waited
O	with
O	impatience
O	for
O	her
O	return
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	but
O	nothing
O	could
O	be
O	seen
O	or
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	captive
O	daughter
O	.
O	Calling
O	together
O	his
O	followers
O	,
O	they
O	sallied
O	forth
O	upon
O	the
O	plains
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	not
O	gone
O	far
O	when
O	they
O	espied
O	by
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	moon
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	shining
O	roundly
O	just
O	over
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	prairie
O	,
O	Aggo
O	Dah
O	Gauda
O	,
O	his
O	daughter
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	,
O	making
O	all
O	speed
O	with
O	his
O	one
O	leg
O	toward
O	the
O	west
O	.
O	The
O	buffalos
O	being
O	set
O	on
O	by
O	their
O	king
O	,
O	raised
O	a
O	great
O	shout
O	,
O	and
O	scampered
O	off
O	in
O	pursuit
O	.
O	They
O	thought
O	to
O	overtake
O	Aggo
O	in
O	less
O	than
O	no
O	time;
O	but
O	although
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	single
O	leg
O	only
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	such
O	fine
O	condition
O	to
O	go
O	,
O	that
O	to
O	every
O	pace
O	of
O	theirs
O	,
O	he
O	hopped
O	the
O	length
O	of
O	a
O	cedar-tree
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	buffalo-king
O	was
O	well
O	assured
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	overtake
O	Aggo
O	,
O	hop
O	as
O	briskly
O	as
O	he
O	might
O	.
O	It
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	mortal
O	shame
O	,
O	thought
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	outstripped
O	by
O	a
O	man
O	with
O	one
O	leg
O	tied
O	up;
O	so
O	,
O	shouting
O	and
O	cheering
O	,
O	and
O	issuing
O	orders
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	,
O	he
O	set
O	the
O	swiftest
O	of
O	his
O	herd
O	upon
O	the
O	track
O	,
O	with
O	strict
O	commands
O	to
O	take
O	Aggo
O	dead
O	or
O	alive
O	.
O	And
O	a
O	curious
O	sight
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	see
O	.
O	At
O	one
O	time
O	a
O	buffalo
O	would
O	gain
O	handsomely
O	upon
O	Aggo
O	,
O	and
O	be
O	just
O	at
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	laying
O	hold
O	of
O	him
O	,
O	when
O	off
O	Aggo
O	would
O	hop
O	,
O	a
O	good
O	furlong
O	,
O	in
O	an
O	oblique
O	line
O	,
O	wide
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	reach;
O	which
O	bringing
O	him
O	nearly
O	in
O	contact
O	with
O	another
O	of
O	the
O	herd
O	,
O	away
O	he
O	would
O	go
O	again
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	far
O	off
O	in
O	another
O	direction
O	.
O	And
O	in
O	this
O	way
O	Aggo
O	kept
O	the
O	whole
O	company
O	of
O	the
O	buffalos
O	zig-zagging
O	across
O	the
O	plain
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	poor
O	king
O	at
O	their
O	head
O	,
O	running
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	,
O	shouting
O	among
O	them
O	and
O	hurrying
O	them
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	wildest
O	way
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	an
O	extraordinary
O	road
O	that
O	Aggo
O	was
O	taking
O	toward
O	home;
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	time
O	it
O	so
O	puzzled
O	and
O	bewildered
O	the
O	buffalos
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	driven
O	half
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	wits
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	roared
O	,
O	and
O	brandished
O	their
O	tails
O	,
O	and
O	foamed
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	put
O	out
O	of
O	countenance
O	and
O	frighten
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	in
O	the
O	moon
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	looking
O	on
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	,
O	just
O	above
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	prairie
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	king
O	himself
O	,
O	losing
O	at
O	last
O	all
O	patience
O	at
O	the
O	absurd
O	idea
O	of
O	chasing
O	a
O	man
O	with
O	one
O	leg
O	all
O	night
O	long
O	,
O	he
O	called
O	his
O	herd
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	fled
O	,
O	in
O	disgust
O	,
O	toward
O	the
O	west
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	more
O	appeared
O	in
O	all
O	that
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	Aggo
O	,
O	relieved
O	of
O	his
O	pursuers
O	,
O	hopped
O	off
O	a
O	hundred
O	steps
O	in
O	one
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	stream
O	,
O	crossed
O	it
O	in
O	a
O	twinkling
O	of
O	the
O	eye
O	,
O	and
O	bore
O	his
O	daughter
O	in
O	triumph
O	to
O	his
O	lodge
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	course
O	of
O	time
O	Aggo's
O	beautiful
O	daughter
O	married
O	a
O	very
O	worthy
O	young
O	warrior
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	neither
O	a
O	buffalo-king
O	nor
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	the
O	owner
O	of
O	any
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	buffalos
O	than
O	a
O	splendid
O	skin
O	robe
O	which
O	he
O	wore
O	,
O	with
O	great
O	effect
O	,
O	thrown
O	over
O	his
O	shoulders
O	,
O	on
O	his
O	wedding-day
O	.
O	On
O	which
O	occasion
O	,
O	Aggo
O	Dah
O	Gauda
O	hopped
O	about
O	on
O	his
O	one
O	leg
O	livelier
O	than
O	ever
O	.
