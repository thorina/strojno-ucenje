O	Very
O	few
O	foreigners
O	travel
O	in
O	Sweden
O	in
O	the
O	winter
O	,
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	intense
O	cold
O	.
O	As
O	you
O	go
O	northward
O	from
O	Stockholm
O	,
O	the
O	capital
O	,
O	the
O	country
O	becomes
O	ruder
O	and
O	wilder
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	climate
O	more
O	severe
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	sheltered
O	valleys
O	along
O	the
O	Gulf
O	of
O	Bothnia
O	and
O	the
O	rivers
O	which
O	empty
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	there
O	are
O	farms
O	and
O	villages
O	for
O	a
O	distance
O	of
O	seven
O	or
O	eight
O	hundred
O	miles
O	,
O	after
O	which
O	fruit-trees
O	disappear
O	,
O	and
O	nothing
O	will
O	grow
O	in
O	the
O	short
O	,
O	cold
O	summers
O	except
O	potatoes
O	and
O	a
O	little
O	barley
O	.
O	Farther
O	inland
O	,
O	there
O	are
O	great
O	forests
O	and
O	lakes
O	,
O	and
O	ranges
O	of
O	mountains
O	where
O	bears
O	,
O	wolves
O	,
O	and
O	herds
O	of
O	wild
O	reindeer
O	make
O	their
O	home
O	.
O	No
O	people
O	could
O	live
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	country
O	unless
O	they
O	were
O	very
O	industrious
O	and
O	thrifty
O	.
O	I
O	made
O	my
O	journey
O	in
O	the
O	winter
O	,
O	because
O	I
O	was
O	on
O	my
O	way
O	to
O	Lapland
O	,
O	where
O	it
O	is
O	easier
O	to
O	travel
O	when
O	the
O	swamps
O	and
O	rivers
O	are
O	frozen
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	reindeer-sleds
O	can
O	fly
O	along
O	over
O	the
O	smooth
O	snow
O	.
O	It
O	wras
O	very
O	cold
O	indeed
O	,
O	the
O	greater
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	time;
O	the
O	days
O	were
O	short
O	and
O	dark
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	found
O	the
O	people
O	so
O	kind
O	,
O	so
O	cheerful
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	honest
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	felt
O	inclined
O	to
O	turn
O	back
O	,
O	more
O	than
O	once
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	think
O	there
O	are
O	better
O	people
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	than
O	those
O	who
O	live
O	in
O	Norrland
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	a
O	Swedish
O	province
O	,
O	commencing
O	about
O	two
O	hundred
O	miles
O	north
O	of
O	Stockholm
O	.
O	They
O	are
O	a
O	hale
O	,
O	strong
O	race
O	,
O	with
O	yellow
O	hair
O	and
O	bright
O	blue
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	handsomest
O	teeth
O	I
O	ever
O	saw
O	.
O	They
O	live
O	plainly
O	,
O	but
O	very
O	comfortably
O	,
O	in
O	snug
O	wooden
O	houses
O	,
O	with
O	double
O	windows
O	and
O	doors
O	to
O	keep
O	out
O	the
O	cold;
O	and
O	since
O	they
O	cannot
O	do
O	much
O	out-door
O	work
O	,
O	they
O	spin
O	and
O	weave
O	and
O	mend
O	their
O	farming
O	implements
O	in
O	the
O	large
O	family
O	room
O	,
O	thus
O	enjoying
O	the
O	winter
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	its
O	severity
O	.
O	They
O	are
O	very
O	happy
O	and
O	contented
O	,
O	and
O	few
O	of
O	them
O	would
O	be
O	willing
O	to
O	leave
O	that
O	cold
O	country
O	and
O	make
O	their
O	homes
O	in
O	a
O	warmer
O	climate
O	.
O	Here
O	there
O	are
O	neither
O	railroads
O	nor
O	stages
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	government
O	has
O	established
O	post-stations
O	at
O	distances
O	varying
O	from
O	ten
O	to
O	twenty
O	miles
O	.
O	At
O	each
O	station
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	horses
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	vehicles
O	,
O	are
O	kept
O	,
O	but
O	generally
O	the
O	traveler
O	has
O	his
O	own
O	sled
O	,
O	and
O	simply
O	hires
O	the
O	horses
O	from
O	one
O	station
O	to
O	another
O	.
O	These
O	horses
O	are
O	either
O	furnished
O	by
O	the
O	keeper
O	of
O	the
O	station
O	or
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	neighboring
O	farmers
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	are
O	wanted
O	a
O	man
O	or
O	boy
O	goes
O	along
O	with
O	the
O	traveler
O	to
O	bring
O	them
O	back
O	.
O	It
O	would
O	be
O	quite
O	an
O	independent
O	and
O	convenient
O	way
O	of
O	traveling
O	,
O	if
O	the
O	horses
O	were
O	always
O	ready;
O	but
O	sometimes
O	you
O	must
O	wait
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	more
O	before
O	they
O	can
O	be
O	furnished
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	my
O	own
O	little
O	sled
O	,
O	filled
O	with
O	hay
O	and
O	covered
O	with
O	reindeer-skins
O	to
O	keep
O	me
O	warm
O	.
O	So
O	long
O	as
O	the
O	weather
O	was
O	not
O	too
O	cold
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	pleasant
O	to
O	speed
O	along
O	through
O	the
O	dark
O	forests
O	,
O	over
O	the
O	frozen
O	rivers
O	,
O	or
O	past
O	farm
O	after
O	farm
O	in
O	the
O	sheltered
O	valleys
O	up
O	hill
O	and
O	down
O	,
O	until
O	long
O	after
O	the
O	stars
O	came
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	get
O	a
O	warm
O	supper
O	in
O	some
O	dark-red
O	post
O	cottage
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	cheerful
O	people
O	sang
O	or
O	told
O	stories
O	around
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	The
O	cold
O	increased
O	a
O	little
O	every
O	day
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	became
O	gradually
O	accustomed
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	fancy
O	that
O	the
O	Arctic
O	climate
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	difficult
O	to
O	endure
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	supposed
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	the
O	thermometer
O	fell
O	to
O	zero;
O	then
O	it
O	went
O	down
O	ten
O	degrees
O	below;
O	then
O	twenty
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	thirty
O	.
O	Being
O	dressed
O	in
O	thick
O	furs
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
O	,
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	suffer
O	greatly;
O	but
O	I
O	was
O	very
O	glad
O	when
O	the
O	people
O	assured
O	me
O	that
O	such
O	extreme
O	cold
O	never
O	lasted
O	more
O	than
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	days
O	.
O	Boys
O	of
O	twelve
O	or
O	fourteen
O	very
O	often
O	went
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	bring
O	back
O	their
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	horses
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	long
O	as
O	those
O	lively
O	,
O	red-cheeked
O	fellows
O	could
O	face
O	the
O	weather
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	not
O	do
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	be
O	afraid
O	.
O	One
O	night
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	wonderful
O	aurora
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	The
O	streamers
O	of
O	red
O	and
O	blue
O	light
O	darted
O	hither
O	and
O	thither
O	,
O	chasing
O	each
O	other
O	up
O	the
O	zenith
O	and
O	down
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	northern
O	horizon
O	with
O	a
O	rapidity
O	and
O	a
O	brilliance
O	which

O	had
O	never

O	Next

O	the

O	the
O	short

O	was
O	as

O	as
O	our
O	twilight
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	quite
O	so
O	cold
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	travelled
O	onward
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	possible
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	tract
O	of
O	wild
O	and
O	thinly-settled
O	country
O	before
O	me

O	wished
O	to
O	get
O	through
O	it
O	before
O	stopping
O	for

O	two
O	lumber-merchants
O	were
O	travelling
O	the
O	same
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	taken
O	the
O	horses;
O	so
O	I
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	wait
O	at
O	the

O	until
O	other
O	horses
O	were
O	brought
O	from
O	the
O	neighbouring

O	.
O	This
O	delayed
O	me
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	at
O	seven
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	I
O	had
O	still
O	one
O	more
O	station
O	of
O	three
O	Swedish
O	miles
O	before
O	reaching
O	the
O	village
O	where
O	I
O	intended
O	to
O	spend
O	the
O	night
O	.
O	Now
O	a
O	Swedish
O	mile
O	is
O	nearly
O	equal
O	to
O	seven
O	English
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	station
O	was
O	at
O	least
O	twenty
O	miles

O	.
O	I
O	decided
O	to
O	take
O	supper
O	while
O	the
O	horse
O	was
O	eating
O	his

O	travellers
O	at

O	He
O	put

O	over
O	me;
O	and
O	I
O	lay
O	as
O	snugly
O	as
O	in
O	the
O	best
O	bed
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	surprised
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	,
O	although
O	my
O	head
O	was
O	covered
O	,
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	feel
O	stifled
O	.
O	Enough
O	air
O	came
O	in
O	under
O	the
O	skins
O	to
O	prevent
O	us
O	from
O	feeling
O	oppressed
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	barely
O	room
O	for
O	the
O	two
O	of
O	us
O	to
O	lie
O	,
O	with
O	no
O	chance
O	of
O	turning
O	over
O	or
O	rolling
O	about
O	.
O	In
O	five
O	minutes
O	,
O	I
O	think
O	,
O	we
O	were
O	asleep
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	dreamed
O	of
O	gathering
O	peaches
O	on
O	a
O	warm
O	August
O	day
O	,
O	at
O	home
O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	wake
O	up
O	thoroughly
O	during
O	the
O	night;
O	neither
O	did
O	Lars
O	,
O	though
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	me
O	that
O	we
O	both
O	talked
O	in
O	our
O	sleep
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	I
O	must
O	have
O	talked
O	English
O	and
O	he
O	Swedish
O	,
O	there
O	could
O	have
O	been
O	no
O	connection
O	between
O	our
O	remarks
O	.
O	I
O	remember
O	that
O	his
O	warm
O	,
O	soft
O	hair
O	pressed
O	against
O	my
O	chin
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	his
O	feet
O	reached
O	no
O	farther
O	than
O	my
O	knees
O	.
O	Just
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	beginning
O	to
O	feel
O	a
O	little
O	cramped
O	and
O	stiff
O	from
O	lying
O	so
O	still
O	I
O	was
O	suddenly
O	aroused
O	by
O	the
O	cold
O	wind
O	on
O	my
O	face
O	.
O	Lars
O	had
O	risen
O	up
O	on
O	his
O	elbow
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	peeping
O	out
O	from
O	under
O	the
O	skins
O	.
O	""""
O	I
O	think
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	near
O	six
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	,
O	""""
O	he

O	The

O	I

O	Lars
O	remarked
O	very

O	that
O	is

O	not
O	yet
O	possible
O	to

O	cried
O	Lars
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	began
O	to
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	boots
O	,
O	his
O	scarf
O	,
O	and
O	heavy
O	coat
O	.
O	I
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	time
O	we
O	were
O	ready
O	we
O	heard
O	shouts
O	and
O	the
O	crack
O	of
O	whips
O	.
O	We
O	harnessed
O	Axel
O	to
O	the
O	sled
O	,
O	and
O	proceeded
O	slowly
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	of
O	the
O	sound
O	,
O	which
O	came
O	,
O	as
O	we
O	presently
O	saw
O	,
O	from
O	a
O	company
O	of
O	farmers
O	,
O	out
O	thus
O	early
O	to
O	plough
O	the
O	road
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	six
O	pairs
O	of
O	horses
O	geared
O	to
O	a
O	wooden
O	frame
O	,
O	something
O	like
O	the
O	bow
O	of
O	a
O	ship
O	,
O	pointed
O	in
O	front
O	and
O	spreading
O	out
O	to
O	a
O	breadth
O	of
O	ten
O	or
O	twelve
O	feet
O	.
O	This
O	machine
O	not
O	only
O	cut
O	through
O	the
O	drifts
O	but
O	packed
O	the
O	snow
O	,
O	leaving
O	a
O	good
O	,
O	solid
O	road
O	behind
O	it
O	.
O	After
O	it
O	had
O	passed
O	,
O	we
O	sped
O	along
O	merrily
O	in
O	the
O	cold
O	morning
O	twilight
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	than
O	an
O	hour
O	reached
O	the
O	post-house
O	at
O	Umeae
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	found
O	Lars
O	'
O	father
O	prepared
O	to
O	return
O	home
O	.
O	He
O	waited
O	,
O	nevertheless
O	,
O	until
O	Lars
O	had
O	eaten
O	a
O	good
O	warm
O	breakfast
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	said
O	good-bye
O	to
O	both
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	towards
O	Lapland
O	.
O	Some
O	weeks
O	afterwards
O	,
O	on
O	my
O	return
O	to
O	Stockholm
O	,
O	I
O	stopped
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	little
O	station
O	.
O	This
O	time
O	the
O	weather
O	was
O	mild
O	and
O	bright
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	father
O	would
O	have
O	gone
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	the
O	next
O	post-house;
O	but
O	I
O	preferred
O	to
O	take
O	my
O	little
O	bed-fellow
O	and
O	sled-fellow
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	quiet
O	and
O	cheerful
O	and
O	fearless
O	,
O	that
O	although
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	nearly
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	away
O	from
O	home
O	,
O	--although
O	I
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	and
O	he
O	a
O	young
O	boy
O	,
O	--I
O	felt
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	learned
O	a
O	lesson
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	might
O	probably
O	learn
O	many
O	more
O	if
O	I
O	should
O	know
O	him
O	better
O	.
O	We
O	had
O	a
O	merry
O	trip
O	of
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	hours
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	I
O	took
O	leave
O	of
O	Lars
O	forever
O	.
