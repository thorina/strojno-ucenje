O	Scrooge
O	stood
O	with
O	the
O	Ghost
O	of
O	Christmas
O	Present
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	streets
O	on
O	Christmas
O	morning
O	,
O	where
O	(
O	for
O	the
O	weather
O	was
O	severe
O	)
O	the
O	people
O	made
O	a
O	rough
O	,
O	but
O	brisk
O	and
O	not
O	unpleasant
O	kind
O	of
O	music
O	,
O	in
O	scraping
O	the
O	snow
O	from
O	the
O	pavement
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	their
O	dwellings
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	tops
O	of
O	their
O	houses:
O	whence
O	it
O	was
O	mad
O	delight
O	to
O	the
O	boys
O	to
O	see
O	it
O	come
O	plumping
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	road
O	below
O	,
O	and
O	splitting
O	into
O	artificial
O	little
O	snowstorms
O	.
O	The
O	house
O	fronts
O	looked
O	black
O	enough
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	windows
O	blacker
O	,
O	contrasting
O	with
O	the
O	smooth
O	white
O	sheet
O	of
O	snow
O	upon
O	the
O	roofs
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	dirtier
O	snow
O	upon
O	the
O	ground;
O	which
O	last
O	deposit
O	had
O	been
O	plowed
O	up
O	in
O	deep
O	furrows
O	by
O	the
O	heavy
O	wheels
O	of
O	carts
O	and
O	wagons;
O	furrows
O	that
O	crossed
O	and
O	recrossed
O	each
O	other
O	hundreds
O	of
O	times
O	where
O	the
O	great
O	streets
O	branched
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	intricate
O	channels
O	,
O	hard
O	to
O	trace
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	thick
O	yellow
O	mud
O	and
O	icy
O	water
O	.
O	The
O	sky
O	was
O	gloomy
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	shortest
O	streets
O	were
O	choked
O	up
O	with
O	a
O	dingy
O	mist
O	,
O	half
O	thawed
O	half
O	frozen
O	,
O	whose
O	heavier
O	particles
O	descended
O	in
O	a
O	shower
O	of
O	sooty
O	atoms
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	all
O	the
O	chimneys
O	in
O	Great
O	Britain
O	had
O	,
O	by
O	one
O	consent
O	,
O	caught
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	blazing
O	away
O	to
O	their
O	dear
O	hearts'
O	content
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	nothing
O	very
O	cheerful
O	in
O	the
O	climate
O	or
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	was
O	there
O	an
O	air
O	of
O	cheerfulness
O	abroad
O	that
O	the
O	clearest
O	summer
O	air
O	and
O	brightest
O	summer
O	sun
O	might
O	have
O	endeavored
O	to
O	diffuse
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	For
O	,
O	the
O	people
O	who
O	were
O	shovelling
O	away
O	on
O	the
O	house-tops
O	were
O	jovial
O	and
O	full
O	of
O	glee;
O	calling
O	out
O	to
O	one
O	another
O	from
O	the
O	parapets
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	exchanging
O	a
O	facetious
O	snowball--better-natured
O	missile
O	far
O	than
O	many
O	a
O	wordy
O	jest--laughing
O	heartily
O	if
O	it
O	went
O	right
O	and
O	not
O	less
O	heartily
O	if
O	it
O	went
O	wrong
O	.
O	The
O	poulterers'
O	shops
O	were
O	still
O	half
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fruiterers'
O	were
O	radiant
O	in
O	their
O	glory
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	great
O	,
O	round
O	,
O	pot-bellied
O	baskets
O	of
O	chestnuts
O	,
O	shaped
O	like
O	the
O	waistcoats
O	of
O	jolly
O	old
O	gentlemen
O	,
O	lolling
O	at
O	the
O	doors
O	,
O	and
O	tumbling
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	street
O	in
O	their
O	apoplectic
O	opulence
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	ruddy
O	,
O	brown-faced
O	,
O	broad-girthed
O	Spanish
O	onions
O	,
O	shining
O	in
O	the
O	fatness
O	of
O	their
O	growth
O	like
O	Spanish
O	friars;
O	and
O	winking
O	from
O	their
O	shelves
O	in
O	wanton
O	slyness
O	at
O	the
O	girls
O	as
O	they
O	went
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	glanced
O	demurely
O	at
O	the
O	hung-up
O	mistletoe
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	pears
O	and
O	apples
O	,
O	clustered
O	high
O	in
O	blooming
O	pyramids;
O	there
O	were
O	bunches
O	of
O	grapes
O	,
O	made
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	shopkeepers'
O	benevolence
O	,
O	to
O	dangle
O	from
O	conspicuous
O	hooks
O	,
O	that
O	people's
O	mouths
O	might
O	water
O	gratis
O	as
O	they
O	passed;
O	there
O	were
O	piles
O	of
O	filberts
O	,
O	mossy
O	and
O	brown
O	,
O	recalling
O	,
O	in
O	their
O	fragrance
O	,
O	ancient
O	walks
O	among
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	and
O	pleasant
O	shufflings
O	ankle-deep
O	through
O	withered
O	leaves;
O	there
O	were
O	Norfolk
O	Biffins
O	,
O	squab
O	,
O	and
O	swarthy
O	,
O	setting
O	off
O	the
O	yellow
O	of
O	the
O	oranges
O	and
O	lemons
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	compactness
O	of
O	their
O	juicy
O	persons
O	,
O	urgently
O	entreating
O	and
O	beseeching
O	to
O	be
O	carried
O	home
O	in
O	paper
O	bags
O	and
O	eaten
O	after
O	dinner
O	.
O	The
O	very
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	fish
O	,
O	set
O	forth
O	among
O	these
O	choice
O	fruits
O	in
O	a
O	bowl
O	,
O	though
O	members
O	of
O	a
O	dull
O	and
O	stagnant-blooded
O	race
O	,
O	appeared
O	to
O	know
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	something
O	going
O	on;
O	and
O	,
O	to
O	a
O	fish
O	,
O	went
O	gasping
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	their
O	little
O	world
O	in
O	slow
O	and
O	passionless
O	excitement
O	.
O	The
O	grocers'
O	!
O	oh
O	,
O	the
O	grocers'
O	!
O	nearly
O	closed
O	,
O	with
O	perhaps
O	two
O	shutters
O	down
O	,
O	or
O	one;
O	but
O	through
O	those
O	gaps
O	such
O	glimpses
O	!
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	alone
O	that
O	the
O	scales
O	descending
O	on
O	the
O	counter
O	made
O	a
O	merry
O	sound
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	the
O	twine
O	and
O	roller
O	parted
O	company
O	so
O	briskly
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	the
O	canisters
O	were
O	rattled
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	like
O	juggling
O	tricks
O	,
O	or
O	even
O	that
O	the
O	blended
O	scents
O	of
O	tea
O	and
O	coffee
O	were
O	so
O	grateful
O	to
O	the
O	nose
O	,
O	or
O	even
O	that
O	the
O	raisins
O	were
O	so
O	plentiful
O	and
O	rare
O	,
O	the
O	almonds
O	so
O	extremely
O	white
O	,
O	the
O	sticks
O	of
O	cinnamon
O	so
O	long
O	and
O	straight
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	spices
O	so
O	delicious
O	,
O	the
O	candied
O	fruits
O	so
O	caked
O	and
O	spotted
O	with
O	molten
O	sugar
O	as
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	coldest
O	lookers-on
O	feel
O	faint
O	and
O	subsequently
O	bilious
O	.
O	Nor
O	was
O	it
O	that
O	the
O	figs
O	were
O	moist
O	and
O	pulpy
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	the
O	French
O	plums
O	blushed
O	in
O	modest
O	tartness
O	from
O	their
O	highly-decorated
O	boxes
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	everything
O	was
O	good
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	in
O	its
O	Christmas
O	dress:
O	but
O	the
O	customers
O	were
O	all
O	so
O	hurried
O	and
O	so
O	eager
O	in
O	the
O	hopeful
O	promise
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	tumbled
O	up
O	against
O	each
O	other
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	clashing
O	their
O	wicker
O	baskets
O	wildly
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	their
O	purchases
O	upon
O	the
O	counter
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	running
O	back
O	to
O	fetch
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	committed
O	hundreds
O	of
O	the
O	like
O	mistakes
O	in
O	the
O	best
O	humor
O	possible;
O	while
O	the
O	grocer
O	and
O	his
O	people
O	were
O	so
O	frank
O	and
O	fresh
O	that
O	the
O	polished
O	hearts
O	with
O	which
O	they
O	fastened
O	their
O	aprons
O	behind
O	might
O	have
O	been
O	their
O	own
O	,
O	worn
O	outside
O	for
O	general
O	inspection
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	Christmas
O	daws
O	to
O	peck
O	at
O	if
O	they
O	chose
O	.
O	But
O	soon
O	the
O	steeples
O	called
O	good
O	people
O	all
O	,
O	to
O	church
O	and
O	chapel
O	,
O	and
O	away
O	they
O	came
O	,
O	flocking
O	through
O	the
O	streets
O	in
O	their
O	best
O	clothes
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	their
O	gayest
O	faces
O	.
O	And
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	there
O	emerged
O	from
O	scores
O	of
O	by-streets
O	,
O	lanes
O	,
O	and
O	nameless
O	turnings
O	,
O	innumerable
O	people
O	,
O	carrying
O	their
O	dinners
O	to
O	the
O	bakers'
O	shops
O	.
O	The
O	sight
O	of
O	these
O	poor
O	revellers
O	appeared
O	to
O	interest
O	the
O	Spirit
O	very
O	much
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	stood
O	with
O	Scrooge
O	beside
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	baker's
O	doorway
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	off
O	the
O	covers
O	as
O	their
O	bearers
O	passed
O	,
O	sprinkled
O	incense
O	on
O	their
O	dinners
O	from
O	his
O	torch
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	uncommon
O	kind
O	of
O	torch
O	,
O	for
O	once
O	or
O	twice
O	when
O	there
O	were
O	angry
O	words
O	between
O	some
O	dinner-carriers
O	who
O	had
O	jostled
O	with
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	he
O	shed
O	a
O	few
O	drops
O	of
O	water
O	on
O	them
O	from
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	good
O	humor

O	restored
O	directly
O	.
O	For

O	such
O	a
O	goose
O	.
O	Bob
O	said
O	he
O	didn't
O	believe
O	there
O	ever
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	goose
O	cooked
O	.
O	Its
O	tenderness
O	and
O	flavor
O	,
O	size
O	and
O	cheapness
O	,
O	were
O	the
O	themes
O	of
O	universal
O	admiration
O	.
O	Eked
O	out
O	by
O	the
O	apple-sauce
O	and
O	mashed
O	potatoes
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	sufficient
O	dinner
O	for
O	the
O	whole
O	family;
O	indeed
O	,
O	as
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Cratchit
O	said
O	with
O	great
O	delight
O	(
O	surveying
O	one
O	small
O	atom
O	of
O	a
O	bone
O	upon
O	the
O	dish
O	)
O	,
O	they
O	hadn't
O	ate
O	it
O	all
O	at
O	last
O	!
O	Yet
O	every
O	one
O	had
O	had
O	enough
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	younger
O	Cratchits
O	in
O	particular
O	,
O	were
O	steeped
O	in
O	sage
O	and
O	onion
O	to
O	the
O	eyebrows
O	!
O	But
O	now
O	,
O	the
O	plates
O	being
O	changed
O	by
O	Miss
O	Belinda
O	,
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Cratchit
O	left
O	the
O	room
O	alone--too
O	nervous
O	to
O	bear
O	witness--to
O	take
O	the
O	pudding
O	up
O	and
O	bring
O	it
O	in
O	.
O	Suppose
O	it
O	should
O	not
O	be
O	done
O	enough
O	!
O	Suppose
O	it
O	should
O	break
O	in
O	turning
O	out
O	!
O	Suppose
O	somebody
O	should
O	have
O	got
O	over
O	the
O	wall
O	of
O	the
O	backyard
O	,
O	and
O	stolen
O	it
O	,
O	while
O	they
O	were
O	merry
O	with
O	the
O	goose--a
O	supposition
O	at
O	which
O	the
O	two
O	young
O	Cratchits
O	became
O	livid
O	!
O	All
O	sorts
O	of
O	horrors
O	were
O	supposed
O	.
O	Hallo
O	!
O	A
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	steam
O	!
O	The
O	pudding
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	copper
O	.
O	A
O	smell
O	like
O	a
O	washing-day
O	!
O	That
O	was
O	the
O	cloth
O	.
O	A
O	smell
O	like
O	an
O	eating-house
O	and
O	a
O	pastrycook's
O	next
O	door
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	laundress's
O	next
O	door
O	to
O	that
O	!
O	That
O	was
O	the
O	pudding
O	!
O	In
O	half
O	a
O	minute
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Cratchit
O	entered--flushed
O	,
O	but
O	smiling
O	proudly--with
O	the
O	pudding
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	speckled
O	cannon-ball
O	,
O	so
O	hard
O	and
O	firm
O	,
O	blazing
O	in
O	half
O	of
O	half-a-quartern
O	of
O	ignited
O	brandy
O	,
O	and
O	bedight
O	with
O	Christmas
O	holly
O	stuck
O	into
O	the
O	top
O	.
O	Oh
O	,
O	a
O	wonderful
O	pudding
O	!
O	Bob
O	Cratchit
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	calmly
O	too
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	regarded
O	it
O	as
O	the
O	greatest
O	success
O	achieved
O	by
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Cratchit
O	since
O	their
O	marriage
O	.
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Cratchit
O	said
O	that
O	now
O	the
O	weight
O	was
O	off
O	her
O	mind
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	confess
O	she
O	had
O	had
O	her
O	doubts
O	about
O	the
O	quantity
O	of
O	flour
O	.
O	Everybody
O	had
O	something
O	to
O	say
O	about
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	nobody
O	said
O	or
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	at
O	all
O	a
O	small
O	pudding
O	for
O	a
O	large
O	family
O	.
O	It
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	flat
O	heresy
O	to
O	do
O	so
O	.
O	Any
O	Cratchit
O	would
O	have
O	blushed
O	to
O	hint
O	at
O	such
O	a
O	thing
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	dinner
O	was
O	all
O	done
O	,
O	the
O	cloth
O	was
O	cleared
O	,
O	the
O	hearth
O	swept
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fire
O	made
O	up
O	.
O	The
O	compound
O	in
O	the
O	jug
O	being
O	tasted
O	,
O	and
O	considered
O	perfect
O	,
O	apples
O	and
O	oranges
O	were
O	put
O	upon
O	the
O	table
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	shovelful
O	of
O	chestnuts
O	on
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	Then
O	all
O	the
O	Cratchit
O	family
O	drew
O	round
O	the
O	hearth
O	,
O	in
O	what
O	Bob
O	Cratchit
O	called
O	a
O	circle
O	,
O	meaning
O	half
O	a
O	one;
O	and
O	at
O	Bob
O	Cratchit's
O	elbow
O	stood
O	the
O	family
O	display
O	of
O	glass
O	.
O	Two
O	tumblers
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	custard-cup
O	without
O	a
O	handle
O	.
O	These
O	held
O	the
O	hot
O	stuff
O	from
O	the
O	jug
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	golden
O	goblets
O	would
O	have
O	done;
O	and
O	Bob
O	served
O	it
O	out
O	with
O	beaming
O	looks
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	chestnuts
O	on
O	the
O	fire
O	sputtered
O	and
O	cracked
O	noisily
O	.
O	Then
O	Bob
O	proposed:
O	"""A"
O	Merry
O	Christmas
O	to
O	us
O	all
O	,
O	my
O	dears
O	.
O	God
O	bless
O	us
O	!
O	""""
O	Which
O	all
O	the
O	family
O	re-echoed
O	.
O	"""God"
O	bless
O	us
O	every
O	one
O	!
O	""""
O	said
O	Tiny
O	Tim
O	,
O	the
O	last
O	of
O	all
O	.
