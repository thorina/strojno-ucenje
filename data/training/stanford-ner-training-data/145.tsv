O	soon

O	But
O	he
O	left
O	the

O	entirely
O	to

O	cook
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	like
O	all

O	,
O	considered
O	nothing
O	fit

O	rich

O	,
O	or
O	highly

O	meat
O	,
O	or
O	spiced
O	sweet
O	cakes--things
O	which
O	Proserpina
O	'
O	s
O	mother
O	had
O	never
O	given
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	smell
O	of
O	which
O	quite
O	took
O	away
O	her
O	appetite
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	sharpening
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	my
O	story
O	must
O	now
O	clamber
O	out
O	of
O	King
O	Pluto
O	'
O	s
O	dominions
O	,
O	and
O	see
O	what
O	Mother
O	Ceres
O	has
O	been
O	about
O	since
O	she
O	was
O	bereft
O	of
O	her
O	daughter
O	.
O	We
O	had
O	a
O	glimpse
O	of
O	her
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	remember
O	,
O	half
O	hidden
O	among
O	the
O	waving
O	grain
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	four
O	black
O	steeds
O	were
O	swiftly
O	whirling
O	along
O	the
O	chariot
O	in
O	which
O	her
O	beloved
O	Proserpina
O	was
O	so
O	unwillingly
O	borne
O	away
O	.
O	You
O	recollect
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	the
O	loud
O	scream
O	which
O	Proserpina
O	gave
O	,
O	just
O	when
O	the
O	chariot
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	.
O	Of
O	all
O	the
O	child
O	'
O	s
O	outcries
O	,
O	this
O	last
O	shriek
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	one
O	that
O	reached
O	the
O	ears
O	of
O	Mother
O	Ceres
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	mistaken
O	the
O	rumbling
O	of
O	the
O	chariot
O	wheels
O	for
O	a
O	peal
O	of
O	thunder
O	,
O	and
O	imagined
O	that
O	a
O	shower
O	was
O	coming
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	assist
O	her
O	in
O	making
O	the
O	corn
O	grow
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	Proserpina
O	'
O	s
O	shriek
O	,
O	she
O	started
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	about
O	in
O	every
O	direction
O	,
O	not
O	knowing
O	whence
O	it
O	came
O	,
O	but
O	feeling
O	almost
O	certain
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	her
O	daughter
O	'
O	s
O	voice
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	so
O	unaccountable
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	girl
O	should
O	have
O	strayed
O	over
O	so
O	many
O	lands
O	and
O	seas
O	(
O	which
O	she
O	herself
O	could
O	not
O	have
O	traversed
O	without
O	the
O	aid
O	of
O	her
O	winged
O	dragons
O	)
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	good
O	Ceres
O	tried
O	to
O	believe
O	that
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	the
O	child
O	of
O	some
O	other
O	parent
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	her
O	own
O	darling
O	Proserpina
O	who
O	had
O	uttered
O	this
O	lamentable
O	cry
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	it
O	troubled
O	her
O	with
O	a
O	vast
O	many
O	tender
O	fears
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	are
O	ready
O	to
O	bestir
O	themselves
O	in
O	every
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	finds
O	it
O	necessary
O	to
O	go
O	away
O	from
O	her
O	dear
O	children
O	without
O	leaving
O	them
O	under
O	the
O	care
O	of
O	some
O	maiden
O	aunt
O	,
O	or
O	other
O	such
O	faithful
O	guardian
O	.
O	So
O	she
O	quickly
O	left
O	the
O	field
O	in
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	busy;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	her
O	work
O	was
O	not
O	half
O	done
O	,
O	the
O	grain
O	looked
O	,

O	as
O	if

O	needed
O	both
O	sun

O	had
O	something
O	the

O	.
O	The

O	days
O	and
O	nights
O	while
O	Ceres
O	was
O	seeking
O	for
O	Proserpina
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	merely
O	of
O	human
O	beings
O	that
O	she
O	asked
O	tidings

O	.
O	In

O	by

O	met

O	,
O	to

O	,
O	and
O	were
O	very
O	sociable
O	with
O	persons
O	who
O	understood
O	their
O	language
O	and
O	customs
O	,
O	as
O	Mother
O	Ceres
O	did
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	,
O	for
O	instance
O	,
O	she
O	tapped
O	with
O	her
O	finger
O	against
O	the
O	knotted
O	trunk
O	of
O	a
O	majestic
O	oak;
O	and
O	immediately
O	its
O	rude
O	bark
O	would
O	cleave
O	asunder
O	,
O	and
O	forth
O	would
O	step
O	a
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	hamadryad
O	of
O	the
O	oak
O	,
O	dwelling
O	inside
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	sharing
O	its
O	long
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	rejoicing
O	when
O	its
O	green
O	leaves
O	sported
O	with
O	the
O	breeze
O	.
O	But
O	not
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	leafy
O	damsels
O	had
O	seen
O	Proserpina
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	going
O	a
O	little
O	farther
O	,
O	Ceres
O	would
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	come
O	to
O	a
O	fountain
O	gushing
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	pebbly
O	hollow
O	in
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	dabble
O	with
O	her
O	hand
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	Behold
O	,
O	up
O	through
O	its
O	sandy
O	and
O	pebbly
O	bed
O	,
O	along
O	with
O	the
O	fountain
O	'
O	s
O	gush
O	,
O	a
O	young
O	woman
O	with

O	would
O	arise
O	,
O	and
O	stand

O	at
O	Mother
O	Ceres
O	,
O	half
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	undulating
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	with

O	ever-restless
O	motion
O	.

O	Often
O	,

O	,

O	they
O	had
O	no

O	But
O	sometimes
O	she

O	How

O	satyrs
O	!
O	And
O	once
O	,
O	while
O	crossing
O	a
O	solitary
O	sheep
O	pasture
O	,
O	she
O	saw
O	a

O	,
O	seated
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	a
O	tall
O	rock
O	and
O	making
O	music
O	on
O	a
O	shepherd
O	'
O	s
O	flute
O	.
O	He
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	had
O	horns
O	,
O	and
O	hairy
O	ears
O	,

O	feet;
O	but
O	,
O	being
O	acquainted
O	with
O	Mother
O	Ceres
O	,
O	he
O	answered
O	her
O	question
O	as
O	civilly
O	as
O	he
O	knew
O	how
O	,
O	and
O	invited

O	to
O	taste
O	some
O	milk
O	and
O	honey
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	wooden
O	bowl
O	.
O	But
O	neither
O	could
O	Pan
O	tell
O	her
O	what
O	had
O	become
O	of
O	Proserpina
O	,
O	any
O	better
O	than
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	these
O	wild
O	people
O	.
O	And
O	thus
O	Mother
O	Ceres
O	went
O	wandering
O	about
O	for
O	nine
O	long
O	days
O	and
O	nights
O	,
O	finding
O	no
O	trace
O	of
O	Proserpina
O	,
O	unless
O	it

O	now
O	and
O	then
O	a
O	withered
O	flower;
O	and
O	these
O	she
O	picked
O	up
O	and
O	put
O	in
O	her
O	bosom
O	,
O	because
O	she
O	fancied
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	have
O	fallen
O	from
O	her
O	poor
O	child
O	'
O	s
O	hand
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	she
O	travelled
O	onward
O	through
O	the
O	hot
O	sun;
O	and
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	again
O	,
O	the
O	flame
O	of
O	the
O	torch
O	would
O	redden
O	and
O	gleam
O	along
O	the
O	pathway
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	continued
O	her
O	search
O	by
O	its
O	light
O	,
O	without
O	ever
O	sitting
O	down
O	to
O	rest
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	tenth
O	day
O	,
O	she
O	chanced
O	to
O	espy
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	a
O	cavern
O	,
O	within
O	which
O	(
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	bright
O	noon

O	)
O	there
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	only
O	a
O	dusky
O	twilight;
O	but
O	it
O	so
O	happened
O	that
O	a
O	torch
O	was
O	burning
O	there
O	.
O	It
O	flickered
O	,
O	and
O	struggled
O	with
O	the
O	duskiness
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	half
O	light
O	up
O	the
O	gloomy
O	cavern
O	with
O	all
O	its
O	melancholy
O	glimmer
O	.
O	Ceres
O	was
O	resolved
O	to
O	leave
O	no
O	spot
O	without
O	a
O	search;
O	so
O	she
O	peeped
O	into
O	the
O	entrance
O	of
O	the
O	cave
O	,
O	and
O	lighted
O	it
O	up
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	by
O	holding
O	her
O	own
O	torch
O	before
O	her
O	.
O	In
O	so
O	doing
O	,
O	she
O	caught
O	a
O	glimpse
O	of
O	what
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	woman
O	,
O	sitting
O	on
O	the
O	brown
O	leaves
O	of
O	the
O	last
O	autumn
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	heap

O	which
O	had
O	been
O	swept
O	into
O	the
O	cave
O	by
O	the
O	wind
O	.
O	This
O	woman
O	(

O	was
O	by
O	no

O	The

O	Ceres

O	that
O	Hecate
O	was
O	welcome
O	to
O	go
O	back
O	thither
O	herself
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	,
O	for
O	her

O	And
O	Hecate
O	took
O	her
O	at
O	her
O	word
O	,
O	and
O	hurried
O	back
O	to
O	her
O	beloved
O	cave
O	,
O	frightening
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	little
O	children
O	with
O	a
O	glimpse
O	of
O	her

O	s
O	face
O	as
O	she
O	went
O	.
O	Poor
O	Mother
O	Ceres
O	!
O	It
O	is
O	melancholy
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	her
O	,
O	pursuing
O	her
O	toilsome
O	way
O	all
O	alone
O	,
O	and
O	holding
O	up
O	that
O	never-dying
O	torch
O	,
O	the

O	of
O	which
O	seemed

O	together

O	,

O	Neither
