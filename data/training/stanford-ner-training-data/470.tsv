O	ones
O	which
O	brought
O	on
O	the

O	.
O	James
O	II
O	,
O	the
O	bigoted
O	successor
O	of
O	Charles
O	the
O	Voluptuous
O	,
O	had
O	annulled
O	the
O	charters

O	all
O	the
O	colonies
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	a

O	to
O	take
O	away
O	our

O	The

O	of
O	Sir
O	Edmund
O	Andros
O	lacked
O	scarcely
O	a
O	single

O	a
O	Governor
O	and
O	Council
O	,
O	holding
O	office
O	from
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	and
O	wholly
O	independent
O	of
O	the
O	country;
O	laws
O	made
O	and
O	taxes
O	levied
O	without
O	concurrence
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	immediate
O	or
O	by
O	their
O	representatives;
O	the

O	violated
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	titles
O	of
O	all
O	landed
O	property
O	declared
O	void;
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	complaint
O	stifled
O	by
O	restrictions
O	on
O	the
O	press;
O	and
O	,
O	finally
O	,
O	disaffection
O	overawed
O	by
O	the
O	first
O	band
O	of
O	mercenary
O	troops
O	that
O	ever
O	marched
O	on
O	our
O	free
O	soil
O	.
O	For
O	two
O	years
O	our
O	ancestors
O	were
O	kept
O	in
O	sullen
O	submission
O	by
O	that
O	filial
O	love
O	which
O	had
O	invariably
O	secured
O	their
O	allegiance
O	to
O	the
O	mother
O	country
O	,
O	whether
O	its
O	head
O	chanced
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	Parliament
O	,
O	Protector
O	,
O	or
O	Popish
O	Monarch
O	.
O	Till
O	these
O	evil
O	times
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	such
O	allegiance
O	had
O	been
O	merely
O	nominal
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	colonists
O	had
O	ruled
O	themselves
O	,
O	enjoying
O	far
O	more
O	freedom
O	than
O	is
O	even
O	yet
O	the
O	privilege
O	of
O	the
O	native
O	subjects
O	of
O	Great
O	Britain
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	a
O	rumour
O	reached
O	our
O	shores
O	that
O	the
O	Prince
O	of
O	Orange
O	had
O	ventured
O	on
O	an
O	enterprise
O	,
O	the
O	success
O	of
O	which
O	would
O	be
O	the
O	triumph
O	of
O	civil
O	and
O	religious
O	rights
O	and
O	the
O	salvation
O	of
O	New
O	England
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	but
O	a
O	doubtful
O	whisper;
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	false
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	attempt
O	might
O	fail;
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	either
O	case
O	,
O	the
O	man
O	that
O	stirred
O	against
O	King
O	Tames
O	would
O	lose
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	Still
O	the
O	intelligence
O	produced
O	a
O	marked
O	effect
O	.
O	The
O	people
O	smiled
O	mysteriously
O	in
O	the
O	streets
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	bold
O	glances
O	at
O	their
O	oppressors;
O	while
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	subdued
O	and
O	silent
O	agitation
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	slightest
O	signal
O	would
O	rouse
O	the
O	whole
O	land
O	from
O	its
O	sluggish
O	despondency
O	.
O	Aware
O	of
O	their
O	danger
O	,
O	the
O	rulers
O	resolved
O	to
O	avert
O	it
O	by
O	an
O	imposing
O	display
O	of
O	strength
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	to
O	confirm
O	their
O	despotism
O	by
O	yet
O	harsher
O	measures
O	.
O	One
O	afternoon
O	in
O	April
O	,
O	1689
O	,
O	Sir
O	Edmund
O	Andros
O	and
O	his
O	favourite
O	councillors
O	,
O	being
O	warm
O	with

O	,
O	assembled
O	the
O	red-coats
O	of
O	the
O	Governor
O	'
O	s
O	Guard
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	their
O	appearance
O	in
O	the
O	streets
O	of
O	Boston
O	.
O	The
O	sun
O	was
O	near
O	setting
O	when
O	the
O	march
O	commenced
O	.
O	The
O	roll
O	of
O	the

O	at
O	that
O	unquiet

O	seemed
O	to

O	,
O	less

O	martial
O	music
O	of
O	the

O	,
O	than
O	as
O	a
O	muster-call
O	to
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	themselves
O	.
O	A
O	multitude
O	,
O	by
O	various
O	avenues
O	,
O	assembled
O	in
O	King
O	Street
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	destined
O	to
O	be
O	the

O	,
O	nearly
O	a

O	of
O	another

O	between
O	the

O	of
O	Britain
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	people
O	struggling
O	against
O	her
O	tyranny
O	.
O	Though
O	more
O	than
O	sixty
O	years
O	had
O	elapsed
O	since

O	their
O	character
O	perhaps
O	more
O	strikingly
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	stern
O	emergency
O	than
O	on
O	happier
O	occasions
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	the
O	sober
O	garb
O	,
O	the
O	general
O	severity
O	of
O	mien
O	,
O	the
O	gloomy
O	but
O	undismayed
O	expression
O	,
O	the
O	scriptural
O	forms
O	of
O	speech
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	confidence
O	in
O	Heaven
O	'
O	s
O	blessing
O	on
O	a
O	righteous
O	cause
O	,
O	which
O	would
O	have
O	marked
O	a

O	of
O	the

O	Puritans
O	,
O	when
O	threatened
O	by

O	of
O	the
O	wilderness
O	.
O	Indeed

O	""""
O	The
O	people
O	had
O	been
O	drawing
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	,
O	and
O	drinking
O	in
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	their
O	champion
O	,
O	who
O	spoke
O	in
O	accents
O	long
O	disused
O	,
O	like
O	one
O	unaccustomed
O	to
O	converse
O	,
O	except
O	with
O	the
O	dead
O	of
O	many
O	years
O	ago
O	.
O	But
O	his
O	voice
O	stirred
O	their
O	souls
O	.
O	They
O	confronted
O	the
O	soldiers
O	,
O	not
O	wholly
O	without
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	ready
O	to
O	convert
O	the
O	very
O	stones
O	of
O	the
O	street
O	into
O	deadly
O	weapons
O	.
O	Sir
O	Edmund
O	Andros
O	looked
O	at
O	the
O	old
O	man;
O	then
O	he
O	cast
O	his
O	hard
O	and
O	cruel
O	eye
O	over
O	the
O	multitude
O	,
O	and
O	beheld
O	them
O	burning
O	with
O	that
O	lurid
O	wrath
O	,
O	so
O	difficult
O	to
O	kindle
O	or
O	to
O	quench;
O	and
O	again
O	he
O	fixed
O	his
O	gaze
O	on
O	the
O	aged
O	form
O	,
O	which
O	stood
O	obscurely
O	in
O	an
O	open
O	space
O	,
O	where
O	neither
O	friend
O	nor
O	foe
O	had
O	thrust
O	himself
O	.
O	What
O	were
O	his
O	thoughts
O	,
O	he
O	uttered
O	no
O	word
O	which
O	might
O	discover
O	.
O	But
O	whether
O	the
O	oppressor
O	were
O	averawed
O	by
O	the
O	Gray
O	Champion
O	'
O	s
O	look
O	,
O	or
O	perceived
O	his
O	peril
O	in
O	the
O	threatening
O	attitude
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	certain
O	that
O	he
O	gave
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	ordered
O	his
O	soldiers
O	to
O	commence
O	a
O	slow
O	and
O	guarded
O	retreat
O	.
O	Before
O	another
O	sunset
O	,
O	the
O	Governor
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	that
O	rode
O	so
O	proudly
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	were
O	prisoners
O	,
O	and
O	long
O	ere
O	it
O	was
O	known
O	that
O	James
O	had
O	abdicated
O	,
O	King
O	William
O	was
O	proclaimed
O	throughout
O	New
O	England
O	.
O	But
O	where
O	was
O	the
O	Gray
O	Champion
O	?
O	Some
O	reported
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	troops
O	had
O	gone
O	from
O	King
O	Street
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	were
O	thronging
O	tumultuously
O	in
O	their
O	rear
O	,
O	Bradstreet
O	,
O	the
O	aged
O	Governor
O	,
O	was
O	seen
O	to
O	embrace
O	a
O	form
O	more
O	aged
O	than
O	his
O	own
O	.
O	Others
O	soberly
O	affirmed
O	,
O	that
O	while
O	they
O	marvelled
O	at
O	the
O	venerable
O	grandeur
O	of
O	his
O	aspect
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	had
O	faded
O	from
O	their
O	eyes
O	,
O	melting
O	slowly
O	into
O	the
O	hues
O	of
O	twilight
O	,
O	till
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	stood
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	empty
O	space
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	agreed
O	that
O	the
O	hoary
O	shape
O	was
O	gone
O	.
O	The
O	men
O	of
O	that
O	generation
O	watched
O	for
O	his
O	reappearance
O	,
O	in
O	sunshine
O	and
O	in
O	twilight
O	,
O	but
O	never
O	saw
O	him
O	more
O	,
O	nor
O	knew
O	when
O	his
O	funeral
O	passed
O	,
O	nor
O	where
O	his
O	gravestone
O	was
O	.
O	And
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	Gray
O	Champion
O	?
O	Perhaps
O	his
O	name
O	might
O	be
O	found
O	in
O	the
O	records
O	of
O	that
O	stern
O	Court
O	of
O	Justice
O	,
O	which
O	passed
O	a
O	sentence
O	,
O	too
O	mighty
O	for
O	the
O	age
O	,
O	but
O	glorious
O	in
O	all
O	after-times
O	,
O	for
O	its
O	humbling
O	lesson
O	to
O	the
O	monarch
O	and
O	its
O	high
O	example
O	to
O	the
O	subject
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	heard
O	,
O	that
O	whenever
O	the
O	descendants
O	of
O	the
O	Puritans
O	are
O	to
O	show
O	the
O	spirit
O	of
O	their
O	sires
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	appears
O	again
O	.
O	When
O	eighty
O	years
O	had
O	passed
O	,
O	he
O	walked
O	once
O	more
O	in
O	King
O	Street
O	.
O	Five
O	years
O	later
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	twilight
O	of
O	an
O	April
O	morning
O	,
O	he
O	stood
O	on
O	the
O	green
O	,
O	beside
O	the
O	meeting-house
O	,
O	at
O	Lexington
O	,
O	where
O	now
O	the
O	obelisk
O	of
O	granite
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	slab
O	of
O	slate
O	inlaid
O	,
O	commemorates
O	the
O	first
O	fallen
O	of
O	the
O	Revolution
O	.
O	And
O	when

O	were
O	toiling
O	at
O	the
O	breastwork
O	on
O	Bunker
O	'
O	s
O	Hill
O	,
O	all
O	through
O	that
O	night
O	the
O	old
O	warrior
O	walked
O	his
O	rounds
O	.
O	Long
O	,
O	long
O	may
O	it
O	be
O	,
O	ere
O	he
O	comes
O	again
O	!
O	His
O	hour
O	is
O	one
O	of
O	darkness
O	,
O	and
O	adversity
O	,
O	and
O	peril
O	.
O	But
O	should
O	domestic

O	THE
O	LEGEND
O	OF
O	SLEEPY
O	HOLLOW
O	FOUND
O	AMONG
O	THE
O	PAPERS
O	OF
O	THE
O	LATE
O	DIEDRICH
O	KNICKERBOCKER
O	IN
O	THE
O	bosom
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	those
O	spacious
O	coves
O	which
O	indent
O	the
O	eastern
O	shore
O	of
O	the
O	Hudson
O	,
O	at
O	that
O	broad
O	expansion
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	denominated
O	by
O	the
O	ancient
O	Dutch
O	navigators
O	the
O	Tappan
O	Zee
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	they
O	always
O	prudently
O	shortened
O	sail
O	and
O	implored
O	the
O	protection
O	of
O	St
O	.
O	Nicholas
O	when
O	they
O	crossed
O	,
O	there
O	lies
O	a
O	small
O	market
O	town
O	or
O	rural
O	port
O	,
O	which
O	by
O	some
O	is
O	called
O	Greensburgh
O	,
O	but
O	which
O	is
O	more
O	generally
O	and
O	properly
O	known
O	by
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Tarry
O	Town
O	.
O	This
O	name
O	was
O	given
O	,
O	we
O	are
O	told
O	,
O	in
O	former
O	days
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	good
O	housewives
O	of
O	the
O	adjacent
O	country
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	inveterate
O	propensity
O	of
O	their
O	husbands
O	to
O	linger
O	about
O	the
O	village
O	tavern
O	on
O	market
O	days
O	.
O	Be
O	that
O	as
O	it
O	may
O	,
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	vouch
O	for
O	the
O	fact
O	,
O	but
O	merely
O	advert
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	being
O	precise
O	and
O	authentic
O	.
O	Not
O	far
O	from
O	this
O	village
O	,
O	perhaps
O	about
O	two
O	miles
O	,
O	there
O	is
O	a
O	little
O	valley
O	or
O	rather
O	lap
O	of
O	land
O	among
O	high
O	hills
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	quietest
O	places
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	world
O	.
O	A
O	small
O	brook
O	glides
O	through
O	it
O	,
O	with
O	just
O	murmur
O	enough
O	to
O	lull
O	one
O	to
O	repose;
O	and
O	the
O	occasional
O	whistle
O	of
O	a
O	quail
O	or
O	tapping
O	of
O	a
O	woodpecker
O	is
O	almost
O	the
O	only
O	sound
O	that
O	ever
O	breaks
O	in
O	upon
O	the
O	uniform
O	tranquillity
O	.
O	I
O	recollect
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	stripling
O	,
O	my
O	first
O	exploit
O	in
O	squirrel-shooting
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	grove
O	of
O	tall
O	walnut
O	trees
O	that
O	shades
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	wandered
O	into
O	it
O	at
O	noontime
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	nature
O	is
O	peculiarly
O	quiet
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	startled
O	by
O	the
O	roar
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	gun
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	broke
O	the
O	Sabbath
O	stillness
O	around
O	and
O	was
O	prolonged
O	and
O	reverberated
O	by
O	the
O	angry
O	echoes
O	.
O	If
O	ever
O	I
O	should
O	wish
O	for
O	a
O	retreat
O	whither
O	I
O	might
O	steal
O	from
O	the
O	world
O	and
O	its
O	distractions
O	,
O	and
O	dream
O	quietly
O	away
O	the
O	remnant
O	of
O	a
O	troubled
O	life
O	,
O	I
O	know
O	of
O	none
O	more
O	promising
O	than
O	this
O	little
O	valley
O	.
O	From
O	the
O	listless
O	repose
O	of
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	peculiar
O	character
O	of
O	its
O	inhabitants
O	,
O	who
O	are
O	descendants
O	from
O	the
O	original
O	Dutch
O	settlers
O	,
O	this
O	sequestered
O	glen
O	has
O	long
O	been
O	known
O	by
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Sleepy
O	Hollow
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	rustic
O	lads
O	are
O	called
O	the
O	Sleepy
O	Hollow
O	Boys
O	throughout
O	all
O	the
O	neighbouring
O	country
O	.
O	A
O	drowsy
O	,
O	dreamy
O	influence
O	seems
O	to
O	hang
O	over
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	pervade
O	the
O	very
O	atmosphere
O	.
O	Some
O	say
O	that
O	the
O	place
O	was
O	bewitched
O	by
O	a
O	High
O	German
O	doctor
O	,
O	during
O	the
O	early
O	days
O	of
O	the
O	settlement;
O	others
O	,
O	that
O	an
O	old
O	Indian
O	chief
O	,
O	the
O	prophet
O	or
O	wizard
O	of
O	his
O	tribe
O	,
O	held
O	his
O	powwows
O	there
O	before
O	the
O	country
O	was
O	discovered
O	by
O	Master
O	Hendrick
O	Hudson
O	.
O	Certain
O	it
O	is
O	,
O	the
O	place
O	still
O	continues
O	under
O	the
O	sway
O	of
O	some
O	witching
O	power
O	,
O	that
O	holds
O	a
O	spell
O	over
O	the
O	minds
O	of
O	the
O	good
O	people
O	,
O	causing
O	them
O	to
O	walk
O	in
O	a
O	continual
O	reverie
O	.
O	They
O	are
O	given
O	to
O	all
O	kinds
O	of
O	marvellous
O	beliefs;
O	are
O	subject
O	to
O	trances
O	and
O	visions
O	,
O	and
O	frequently
O	see
O	strange
O	sights
O	,
O	and
O	hear
O	music
O	and
O	voices
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	neighbourhood
O	abounds
O	with
O	local
O	tales
O	,
O	haunted
O	spots
O	,
O	and
O	twilight
O	superstitions;
O	stars
O	shoot
O	and
O	meteors
O	glare
O	oftener
O	across
O	the
O	valley
O	than
O	in
O	any
O	other
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	nightmare
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	whole
O	ninefold
O	,
O	seems
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	the

O	The

O	Among

O	Katrina
O	Van

O	,
O	the
O	daughter
O	and
O	only
O	child
O	of
O	a
O	substantial
O	Dutch
O	farmer
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	a
O	blooming
O	lass
O	of
O	fresh
O	eighteen;
O	plump
O	as
O	a
O	partridge;
O	ripe
O	and
O	melting
O	and
O	rosy-cheeked
O	as
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	peaches
O	,
O	and
O	universally
O	famed
O	,
O	not
O	merely
O	for
O	her
O	beauty
O	,
O	but
O	her
O	vast
O	expectations
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	withal
O	a
O	little
O	or
O	a
O	coquette
O	,
O	as
O	might
O	be
O	perceived
O	even
O	in
O	her
O	dress
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	mixture
O	of
O	ancient
O	and
O	modern
O	fashions
O	,
O	as
O	most
O	suited
O	to
O	set
O	off
O	her
O	charms
O	.
O	She
O	wore
O	the
O	ornaments
O	of
O	pure
O	yellow
O	gold
O	,
O	which
O	her
O	great-great-grandmother
O	had
O	brought
O	over
O	from
O	Saardam;
O	the
O	tempting
O	stomacher
O	of
O	the
O	olden
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	withal
O	a
O	provokingly
O	short
O	petticoat
O	,
O	to
O	display
O	the
O	prettiest
O	foot
O	and
O	ankle
O	in
O	the
O	country

O	Ichabod
O	Crane
O	had
O	a
O	soft
O	and
O	foolish
O	heart
O	toward
O	the
O	sex;
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	wondered
O	at
O	,
O	that
O	so
O	tempting
O	a
O	morsel
O	soon
O	found
O	favour
O	in
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	more
O	especially
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	visited
O	her
O	in
O	her
O	paternal
O	mansion
O	.
O	Old
O	Baltus
O	Van
O	Tassel
O	was
O	a
O	perfect
O	picture
O	of
O	a
O	thriving
O	,
O	contented
O	,
O	liberal
O	hearted
O	farmer
O	.
O	He
O	seldom
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	true
O	,
O	sent
O	either
O	his
O	eyes
O	or
O	his
O	thoughts
O	beyond
O	the
O	boundaries
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	farm;
O	but
O	within
O	those
O	everything
O	was
O	snug
O	,
O	happy
O	and
O	well-conditioned
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	satisfied
O	with
O	his
O	wealth
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	proud
O	of
O	it;
O	and
O	piqued
O	himself
O	upon
O	the
O	hearty
O	abundance
O	,
O	rather
O	than
O	the
O	style
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	lived
O	.
O	His
O	stronghold
O	was
O	situated
O	on
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	Hudson
O	,
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	those
O	green
O	,
O	sheltered
O	,
O	fertile
O	nooks
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	Dutch
O	farmers
O	are
O	so
O	fond
O	of
O	nestling
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	elm
O	tree
O	spread
O	its
O	broad
O	branches
O	over
O	it
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	which
O	bubbled
O	up
O	a
O	spring
O	of
O	the
O	softest
O	and
O	sweetest
O	water
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	well
O	formed
O	of
O	a
O	barrel;
O	and
O	then
O	stole
O	sparkling
O	away
O	through
O	the
O	grass
O	,
O	to
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	brook
O	,
O	that
O	babbled
O	along
O	among
O	alders
O	and
O	dwarf
O	willows
O	.
O	Hard
O	by
O	the
O	farmhouse
O	was
O	a
O	vast
O	barn
O	,
O	that
O	might
O	have
O	served
O	for
O	a
O	church;
O	every
O	window
O	and
O	crevice
O	of
O	which
O	seemed
O	bursting
O	forth
O	with
O	the
O	treasures
O	of
O	the
O	farm;
O	the
O	flail
O	was
O	busily
O	resounding
O	within
O	it
O	from
O	morning
O	to
O	night;
O	swallows
O	and
O	martins
O	skimmed
O	twittering
O	about
O	the
O	eaves;
O	and
O	rows
O	of
O	pigeons
O	,
O	some
O	with
O	one
O	eye
O	turned
O	up
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	watching
O	the
O	weather
O	,
O	some
O	with
O	their
O	heads
O	under
O	their
O	wings
O	or
O	buried
O	in
O	their
O	bosoms
O	,
O	and
O	others
O	swelling
O	,
O	and
O	cooing
O	,
O	and
O	bowing
O	about
O	their
O	dames
O	,
O	were
O	enjoying
O	the
O	sunshine
O	on
O	the
O	roof
O	.
O	Sleek
O	unwieldy
O	porkers
O	were
O	grunting
O	in
O	the
O	repose
O	and
O	abundance
O	of
O	their
O	pens
O	,
O	from
O	whence
O	sallied
O	forth
O	,
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	troops
O	of
O	sucking
O	pigs
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	to
O	snuff
O	the
O	air
O	.
O	A
O	stately
O	squadron
O	of
O	snowy
O	geese
O	were
O	riding
O	in
O	an
O	adjoining
O	pond
O	,
O	convoying
O	whole
O	fleets
O	of
O	ducks;
O	regiments
O	of
O	turkeys
O	were
O	gobbling
O	through
O	the
O	farmyard
O	,
O	and
O	Guinea
O	fowls
O	fretting
O	about
O	it
O	,
O	like
O	ill-tempered
O	housewives
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	peevish
O	,
O	discontented
O	cry
O	.
O	Before
O	the
O	barn
O	door
O	strutted
O	the
O	gallant
O	cock
O	,
O	that
O	pattern
O	of
O	a
O	husband
O	,
O	a
O	warrior
O	and
O	a
O	fine
O	gentleman
O	,
O	clapping
O	his
O	burnished
O	wings
O	and
O	crowing
O	in
O	the
O	pride
O	and
O	gladness
O	of
O	his
O	heart--sometimes
O	tearing
O	up
O	the
O	earth
O	with
O	his
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	generously
O	calling
O	his
O	ever-hungry
O	family
O	of
O	wives
O	and
O	children
O	to
O	enjoy
O	the
O	rich
O	morsel
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	discovered
O	.
O	The
O	pedagogue
O	'
O	s
O	mouth
O	watered
O	as
O	he
O	looked
O	upon
O	this
O	sumptuous
O	promise
O	of
O	luxurious
O	winter
O	fare
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	devouring
O	mind
O	'
O	s
O	eye
O	,
O	he
O	pictured
O	to
O	himself
O	every
O	roasting-pig
O	running
O	about
O	with
O	a
O	pudding
O	in
O	his
O	belly
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	apple
O	in
O	his
O	mouth;
O	the
O	pigeons
O	were
O	snugly
O	put
O	to
O	bed
O	in
O	a
O	comfortable
O	pie
O	,
O	and
O	tucked
O	in
O	with
O	a
O	coverlet
O	of
O	crust;
O	the
O	geese
O	were
O	swimming
O	in
O	their
O	own
O	gravy;
O	and
O	the
O	ducks
O	pairing
O	cosily
O	in
O	dishes
O	,
O	like
O	snug
O	married
O	couples
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	decent
O	competency
O	of
O	onion
O	sauce
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	porkers
O	he
O	saw
O	carved
O	out
O	the
O	future
O	sleek
O	side
O	of
O	bacon
O	,
O	and
O	juicy
O	relishing
O	ham;
O	not
O	a
O	turkey
O	but
O	he
O	beheld
O	daintily
O	trussed
O	up
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	gizzard
O	under
O	its
O	wing
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	peradventure
O	,
O	a
O	necklace
O	of
O	savoury
O	sausages;
O	and
O	even
O	bright
O	chanticleer
O	himself
O	lay
O	sprawling
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	side
O	dish
O	,
O	with
O	uplifted
O	claws
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	craving
O	that
O	quarter
O	which
O	his
O	chivalrous
O	spirit
O	disdained
O	to
O	ask
O	while
O	living
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	enraptured
O	Ichabod
O	fancied
O	all
O	this
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	rolled
O	his
O	great
O	green
O	eyes
O	over
O	the
O	fat
O	meadow
O	lands
O	,
O	the
O	rich
O	fields
O	of
O	wheat
O	,
O	of
O	rye
O	,
O	of
O	buckwheat
O	,
O	and
O	Indian
O	corn
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	orchards
O	burdened
O	with
O	ruddy
O	fruit
O	,
O	which
O	surrounded
O	the
O	warm
O	tenement
O	of
O	Van
O	Tassel
O	,
O	his
O	heart
O	yearned
O	after
O	the
O	damsel
O	who
O	was
O	to
O	inherit
O	these
O	domains
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	imagination
O	expanded
O	with
O	the
O	idea
O	,
O	how
O	they
O	might
O	be
O	readily
O	turned
O	into
O	cash
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	money
O	invested
O	in
O	immense
O	tracts
O	of
O	wild
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	shingle
O	palaces
O	in
O	the
O	wilderness
O	.
O	Nay
O	,
O	his
O	busy
O	fancy
O	already
O	realised
O	his
O	hopes
O	,
O	and
O	presented
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	blooming
O	Katrina
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	whole
O	family
O	of
O	children
O	,
O	mounted
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	wagon
O	loaded
O	with
O	household
O	trumpery
O	,
O	with
O	pots
O	and
O	kettles
O	dangling
O	beneath;
O	and
O	he
O	beheld
O	himself
O	bestriding
O	a
O	pacing
O	mare
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	colt
O	at
O	her
O	heels
O	,
O	setting
O	out
O	for
O	Kentucky
O	,
O	Tennessee--or
O	the
O	Lord
O	knows
O	where
O	!
O	When
O	he
O	entered
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	the
O	conquest
O	of
O	his
O	heart
O	was
O	complete
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	one
O	,
O	of
O	those
O	spacious
O	farmhouses
O	,
O	with
O	high
O	ridged
O	but
O	lowly
O	sloping
O	roofs
O	,
O	built
O	in
O	the
O	style
O	handed
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	first
O	Dutch
O	settlers;
O	the
O	low
O	projecting
O	eaves
O	forming
O	a
O	piazza
O	along
O	the
O	front
O	,
O	capable
O	of
O	being
O	closed
O	up
O	in
O	bad
O	weather
O	.
O	Under
O	this
O	were
O	hung
O	flails
O	,
O	harness
O	,
O	various
O	utensils
O	of
O	husbandry
O	,
O	and
O	nets
O	for
O	fishing
O	in
O	the
O	neighbouring
O	river
O	.
O	Benches
O	were
O	built
O	along
O	the
O	sides
O	for
O	summer
O	use;
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	spinning-wheel
O	at
O	one
O	end
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	churn
O	at
O	the

O	,
O	showed

O	uses
O	to
O	which
O	this

O	porch
O	might
O	be
O	devoted
O	.
O	From
O	this
O	piazza
O	the
O	wondering
O	Ichabod
O	entered
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	which
O	formed
O	the
O	centre
O	of
O	the

O	,

O	In
O	one

O	stood
O	a

O	a

O	From

O	Ichabod
O	laid

O	the

O	of
O	the

O	In

O	he
O	had
O	more

O	than

O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	lot
O	of
O	a

O	who
O	seldom

O	to
O	win
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the

O	of
O	a
O	country
O	coquette
O	,
O	beset
O	with
O	a
O	labyrinth
O	of
O	whims
O	and
O	caprices
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	forever
O	presenting
O	new
O	difficulties
O	and
O	impediments;
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	encounter
O	a
O	host
O	of
O	fearful
O	adversaries
O	of
O	real
O	flesh

O	,
O	the

O	rustic
O	admirers
O	,
O	who
O	beset
O	every
O	portal
O	to
O	her
O	heart
O	,
O	keeping
O	a
O	watchful
O	and
O	angry
O	eye
O	upon
O	each

O	out
O	in

O	cause
O	against
O	any
O	new

O	Among
O	these

O	the
O	most
O	formidable
O	was
O	a
O	burly

O	roaring

O	,
O	of
O	the

O	with
O	his

O	He

O	,
O	with
O	short
O	curly
O	black
O	hair
O	,

O	but

O	,
O	having
O	a
O	mingled
O	air
O	of
O	fun
O	and
O	arrogance
O	.
O	From
O	his
O	Herculean
O	frame
O	and
O	great
O	powers
O	of
O	limb
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	received
O	the
O	nickname
O	of
O	Brom
O	Bones
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	universally
O	known
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	famed
O	for
O	great
O	knowledge
O	and
O	skill
O	in
O	horsemanship
O	,
O	being
O	as
O	dexterous
O	on

O	as
O	a

O	He
O	was

O	and
O	cock-fights;

O	,
O	with

O	which
O	bodily
O	strength
O	always
O	acquires
O	in
O	rustic
O	life
O	,
O	was
O	the

O	in
O	all
O	disputes
O	,
O	setting
O	his
O	hat
O	on
O	one

O	,
O	and
O	giving
O	his
O	decisions
O	with
O	an
O	air
O	and
O	tone
O	that
O	admitted
O	of
O	no
O	gainsay
O	or
O	appeal
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	always
O	ready
O	for
O	either
O	a
O	fight
O	or
O	a
O	frolic;
O	but
O	had
O	more
O	mischief
O	than
O	ill-will
O	in
O	his
O	composition;
O	and
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	overbearing
O	roughness
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	strong
O	clash
O	of
O	waggish
O	good
O	humour
O	at

O	.
O	He
O	had
O	three

O	four
O	boon

O	,
O	who
O	regarded
O	him
O	as

O	at

O	for

O	In

O	an

O	.
O	There
O	was
O	something

O	in
O	this
O	obstinately

O	it
O	left

O	But

O	The

O	were
O	hurried
O	through

O	lessons
O	without
O	stopping
O	at
O	trifles;
O	those

O	was

O	loose
O	an
O	hour
O	before
O	the

O	,
O	bursting
O	forth
O	like
O	a

O	about

O	at
O	their

O	The

O	Ichabod

O	in

O	with
O	whom
O	he
O	was
O	domiciliated

O	issued
O	forth
O	like
O	a
O	knight-errant
O	in
O	quest

O	.
O	But
O	it
O	is

O	should
O	,

O	looks
O	and
O	equipments
O	of
O	my
O	hero
O	and
O	his
O	steed

O	The
O	animal
O	he
O	bestrode
O	was
O	a
O	broken
O	down
O	plow-horse
O	,
O	that
O	had
O	outlived
O	almost
O	everything
O	but
O	its
O	viciousness
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	gaunt
O	and
O	shagged
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	ewe
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	head
O	like
O	a
O	hammer;
O	his
O	rusty
O	mane
O	and
O	tail
O	were
O	tangled
O	and
O	knotted
O	with
O	burs;
O	one
O	eye
O	had
O	lost
O	its
O	pupil
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	glaring
O	and
O	spectral
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	other
O	had
O	the
O	gleam
O	of
O	a
O	genuine
O	devil
O	in
O	it
O	.
O	Still
O	he
O	must
O	have
O	had
O	fire
O	and
O	mettle
O	in
O	his
O	day
O	,
O	if
O	we
O	may
O	judge
O	from
O	the
O	name
O	he
O	bore
O	of
O	Gunpowder
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	been
O	a
O	favourite
O	steed
O	of
O	his
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	the
O	choleric
O	Van
O	Ripper
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	furious
O	rider
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	infused
O	,
O	very
O	probably
O	,
O	some
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	spirit
O	into
O	the
O	animal;
O	for
O	,
O	old
O	and
O	broken
O	down
O	as
O	he
O	looked
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	lurking
O	devil
O	in
O	him
O	than
O	in
O	any
O	young
O	filly
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	Ichabod
O	was
O	a
O	suitable
O	figure
O	for
O	such
O	a
O	steed
O	.
O	He
O	rode
O	with
O	short
O	stirrups
O	,
O	which
O	brought
O	his
O	knees
O	nearly
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	pommel
O	of
O	the
O	saddle;
O	his
O	sharp
O	elbows
O	stuck
O	out
O	like
O	grasshoppers
O	'
O	;
O	he
O	carried
O	his
O	whip
O	perpendicularly
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	sceptre
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	his
O	horse
O	jogged
O	on
O	,
O	the
O	motion
O	of
O	his
O	arms
O	was
O	not
O	unlike
O	the
O	flapping
O	of
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	wings
O	.
O	A
O	small
O	wool
O	hat
O	rested
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	his
O	nose
O	,
O	for
O	so
O	his
O	scanty
O	strip
O	of
O	forehead
O	might
O	be
O	called
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	skirts
O	of
O	his
O	black
O	coat
O	fluttered
O	out
O	almost
O	to
O	the
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	tail
O	.
O	Such
O	was
O	the
O	appearance
O	of
O	Ichabod
O	and
O	his
O	steed
O	as
O	they
O	shambled
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	Hans
O	Van
O	Ripper
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	altogether
O	such
O	an
O	apparition
O	as
O	is
O	seldom
O	to
O	be
O	met
O	with
O	in
O	broad
O	daylight
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	said
O	,
O	a
O	fine
O	autumnal
O	day;
O	the
O	sky
O	was
O	clear
O	and
O	serene
O	,
O	and
O	nature
O	wore
O	that
O	rich
O	and
O	golden
O	livery
O	which
O	we
O	always
O	associate
O	with
O	the
O	idea
O	of
O	abundance
O	.
O	The
O	forests
O	had
O	put
O	on
O	their
O	sober
O	brown
O	and
O	yellow
O	,
O	while
O	some
O	trees
O	of
O	the
O	tenderer
O	kind
O	had
O	been
O	nipped
O	by
O	the
O	frosts
O	into
O	brilliant
O	dyes
O	of
O	orange
O	,
O	purple
O	,
O	and
O	scarlet
O	.
O	Streaming
O	files
O	of
O	wild
O	ducks
O	began
O	to
O	make
O	their
O	appearance
O	high
O	in
O	the
O	air;
O	the
O	bark
O	of
O	the
O	squirrel
O	might
O	be
O	heard
O	from
O	the
O	groves
O	of
O	beech
O	and
O	hickory
O	nuts
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	pensive
O	whistle
O	of
O	the
O	quail
O	at
O	intervals
O	from
O	the
O	neighbouring
O	stubble
O	field
O	.
O	The
O	small
O	birds
O	were
O	taking
O	their
O	farewell
O	banquets
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	fullness
O	of
O	their
O	revelry
O	,
O	they
O	fluttered
O	,
O	chirping

O	but
O	did

O	He

O	dilated

O	with
O	good

O	idle;
O	and
O	to
O	have
O	seen
O	his
O	loosely
O	hung
O	frame
O	in
O	full
O	motion
O	,
O	and
O	clattering
O	about
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	you
O	would
O	have
O	thought
O	St
O	.
O	Vitus
O	himself
O	,
O	that
O	blessed
O	patron
O	of
O	the
O	dance
O	,
O	was
O	figuring
O	before
O	you
O	in
O	person
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	the
O	admiration
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	negroes;
O	who
O	,
O	having
O	gathered
O	,
O	of
O	all
O	ages
O	and
O	sizes
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	farm
O	and
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	,
O	stood
O	forming
O	a
O	pyramid
O	of
O	shining
O	black
O	faces
O	at
O	every
O	door
O	and
O	window;
O	gazing
O	with
O	delight
O	at
O	the
O	scene;
O	rolling
O	their
O	white
O	eye-balls
O	,
O	and
O	showing
O	grinning
O	rows
O	of
O	ivory
O	from
O	ear
O	to
O	ear
O	.
O	How
O	could
O	the
O	flogger
O	of
O	urchins
O	be
O	otherwise
O	than
O	animated
O	and
O	joyous
O	?
O	the
O	lady
O	of
O	his
O	heart
O	was
O	his
O	partner
O	in
O	the
O	dance
O	,
O	and
O	smiling
O	graciously
O	in
O	reply
O	to
O	all
O	his
O	amorous
O	oglings;
O	while
O	Brom
O	Bones
O	,
O	sorely
O	smitten
O	with
O	love
O	and
O	jealousy
O	,
O	sat
O	brooding
O	by
O	himself
O	in
O	one
O	corner
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	dance
O	was
O	at
O	an
O	end
O	,
O	Ichabod
O	was
O	attracted
O	to
O	a
O	knot
O	of
O	the
O	sager
O	folks
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	with
O	Old
O	Van
O	Tassel
O	,
O	sat
O	smoking
O	at
O	one
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	piazza
O	,
O	gossiping
O	over
O	former
O	times
O	,
O	and
O	drawing
O	out
O	long
O	stories
O	about
O	the
O	war
O	.
O	This
O	neighbourhood
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	am
O	speaking
O	,
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	those
O	highly
O	favoured
O	places
O	which
O	abound
O	with
O	chronicle
O	and
O	great
O	men
O	.
O	The
O	British
O	and
O	American
O	line
O	had
O	run
O	near
O	it
O	during
O	the
O	war;
O	it
O	had
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	been
O	the
O	scene
O	of
O	marauding
O	,
O	and
O	infested
O	with
O	refugees
O	,
O	cow-boys
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	kinds
O	of
O	border
O	chivalry
O	.
O	Just
O	sufficient
O	time
O	had
O	elapsed
O	to
O	enable
O	each
O	story-teller
O	to
O	dress
O	up
O	his
O	tale
O	with
O	a
O	little
O	becoming
O	fiction
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	indistinctness
O	of
O	his
O	recollection
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	himself
O	the
O	hero
O	of
O	every
O	exploit
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	Doffue
O	Martling
O	,
O	a
O	large
O	blue-bearded
O	Dutchman
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	nearly
O	taken
O	a
O	British
O	frigate
O	with
O	an
O	old
O	iron
O	nine-pounder
O	from
O	a
O	mud
O	breast
O	work
O	,
O	only
O	that
O	his
O	gun
O	burst
O	at
O	the
O	sixth
O	discharge
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	old
O	gentleman
O	who
O	shall
O	be
O	nameless
O	,
O	being
O	too
O	rich
O	a
O	mynheer
O	to
O	be
O	lightly
O	mentioned
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	battle
O	of
O	White
O	Plains
O	,
O	being
O	an
O	excellent
O	master
O	of
O	defence
O	,
O	parried
O	a
O	musket-ball
O	with
O	a
O	small-sword
O	,
O	insomuch
O	that
O	he
O	absolutely
O	felt
O	it
O	whiz
O	round
O	the
O	blade
O	,
O	and
O	glance
O	off
O	at
O	the
O	hilt;
O	in
O	proof
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	ready
O	at
O	any
O	time
O	to
O	show
O	the
O	sword
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	hilt
O	a
O	little
O	bent
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	several
O	more
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	equally
O	great
O	in
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	not
O	one
O	of
O	whom
O	but
O	was
O	persuaded
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	considerable
O	hand
O	in
O	bringing
O	the
O	war
O	to
O	a
O	happy
O	termination
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	these
O	were
O	nothing
O	to
O	the
O	tales
O	of
O	ghosts
O	and
O	apparitions
O	that
O	succeeded
O	.
O	The
O	neighbourhood
O	is
O	rich
O	in
O	legendary
O	treasures
O	of
O	the
O	kind
O	.
O	Local
O	tales
O	and
O	superstitions
O	thrive
O	best
O	in
O	these
O	sheltered
O	,
O	long-settled
O	retreats;
O	but
O	are
O	trampled
O	under
O	foot
O	by
O	the
O	shifting
O	throng
O	that
O	forms
O	the
O	population
O	of
O	most
O	of
O	our
O	country
O	places
O	.
O	Besides
O	,
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	encouragement
O	for
O	ghosts
O	in
O	most
O	of
O	our
O	villages
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	have
O	scarcely
O	had
O	time
O	to
O	finish
O	their
O	first
O	nap
O	and
O	turn
O	themselves
O	in
O	their
O	graves
O	,
O	before
O	their
O	surviving
O	friends
O	have
O	travelled
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	neighbourhood;
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	they
O	turn
O	out
O	at
O	night
O	to
O	walk
O	their
O	rounds
O	,
O	they
O	have
O	no
O	acquaintance
O	left
O	to
O	call
O	upon
O	.
O	This
O	is
O	perhaps
O	the
O	reason
O	why
O	we
O	so
O	seldom
O	hear
O	of
O	ghosts
O	except
O	in
O	our
O	long
O	established
O	Dutch
O	communities
O	.
O	The
O	immediate
O	cause
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	prevalence
O	of
O	supernatural
O	stories
O	in
O	these
O	parts
O	,
O	was
O	doubtless
O	owing
O	to
O	the
O	vicinity
O	of
O	Sleepy
O	Hollow
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	contagion
O	in
O	the
O	very
O	air
O	that
O	blew
O	from
O	that
O	haunted
O	region;
O	it
O	breathed
O	forth
O	an
O	atmosphere
O	of
O	dreams
O	and
O	fancies
O	infecting
O	all
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	Several
O	of
O	the
O	Sleepy
O	Hollow
O	people
O	were
O	present
O	at
O	Van
O	Tassel
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	usual
O	,
O	were
O	doling
O	out
O	their
O	wild
O	and
O	wonderful
O	legends
O	.
O	Many
O	dismal
O	tales
O	were
O	told
O	about
O	funeral
O	trains
O	,
O	and
O	mourning
O	cries
O	and
O	wailings
O	heard
O	and
O	seen
O	about
O	the
O	great
O	tree
O	where
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	Major
O	Andre
O	was
O	taken
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	stood
O	in
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	.
O	Some
O	mention
O	was
O	made
O	also
O	of
O	the
O	woman
O	in
O	white
O	,
O	that
O	haunted
O	the
O	dark
O	glen
O	at
O	Raven
O	Rock
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	often
O	heard
O	to
O	shriek
O	on
O	winter
O	nights
O	before
O	a
O	storm
O	,
O	having
O	perished
O	there
O	in
O	the
O	snow
O	.
O	The
O	chief
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	stories
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	turned
O	upon
O	the
O	favourite
O	spectre
O	of
O	Sleepy
O	Hollow
O	,
O	the
O	Headless
O	Horseman
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	heard
O	several
O	times
O	of
O	late
O	,
O	patrolling
O	the
O	country;
O	and
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	said
O	,
O	tethered
O	his
O	horse
O	nightly
O	among
O	the
O	graves
O	in
O	the
O	churchyard
O	.
O	The
O	sequestered
O	situation
O	of
O	the
O	church
O	seems
O	always
O	to
O	have
O	made
O	it
O	a
O	favourite
O	haunt
O	of
O	troubled
O	spirits
O	.
O	It
O	stands
O	on
O	a
O	knoll
O	,
O	surrounded
O	by
O	locust
O	trees
O	and
O	lofty
O	elms
O	from
O	among
O	which
O	its
O	decent
O	,
O	whitewashed
O	walls
O	shine
O	modestly
O	forth
O	,
O	like
O	Christian
O	purity
O	beaming
O	through
O	the
O	shades
O	of
O	retirement
O	.
O	A
O	gentle
O	slope
O	descends
O	from
O	it
O	to
O	a
O	silver
O	sheet
O	of
O	water
O	,
O	bordered
O	by
O	high
O	trees
O	,
O	between
O	which
O	,
O	peeps
O	may
O	be
O	caught
O	at
O	the
O	blue
O	hills
O	of
O	the
O	Hudson
O	.
O	To
O	look
O	upon
O	its
O	grass-grown
O	yard
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	sunbeams
O	seem
O	to
O	sleep
O	so
O	quietly
O	,
O	one
O	would
O	think
O	that
O	there
O	at
O	least
O	the
O	dead
O	might
O	rest
O	in
O	peace
O	.
O	On
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	church
O	extends
O	a
O	wide
O	woody
O	dell
O	,
O	along
O	which
O	raves
O	a
O	large
O	brook
O	among
O	broken
O	rocks
O	and
O	trunks
O	of
O	fallen
O	trees
O	.
O	Over
O	a
O	deep
O	black
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	stream
O	,
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	church
O	,
O	was
O	formerly
O	thrown
O	a
O	wooden
O	bridge;
O	the
O	road
O	that
O	led
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bridge
O	itself
O	,
O	were
O	thickly
O	shaded
O	by
O	overhanging
O	trees
O	,
O	which
O	cast
O	a
O	gloom
O	about
O	it
O	,
O	even
O	in
O	the
O	daytime;
O	but
O	occasioned
O	a
O	fearful
O	darkness
O	at
O	night
O	.
O	Such
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	favourite
O	haunts
O	of
O	the
O	Headless
O	Horseman
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	most
O	frequently
O	encountered
O	.
O	The
O	tale
O	was
O	told
O	of
O	old
O	Brouwer
O	,
O	a
O	most
O	heretical
O	disbeliever
O	in
O	ghosts
O	,
O	how
O	he
O	met
O	the
O	Horseman
O	returning
O	from
O	his
O	foray
O	into
O	Sleepy
O	Hollow
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	get
O	up
O	behind
O	him;
O	how
O	they
O	galloped
O	over
O	bush
O	and
O	brake
O	,
O	over
O	hill
O	and
O	swamp
O	,
O	until
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	bridge;
O	when
O	the
O	Horseman
O	suddenly
O	turned
O	into
O	a
O	skeleton
O	,
O	threw
O	old
O	Brouwer
O	into
O	the
O	brook
O	,
O	and
O	sprang
O	away
O	over
O	the
O	tree-tops
O	with
O	a
O	clap
O	of
O	thunder
O	.
O	This
O	story
O	was
O	immediately
O	matched
O	by
O	a
O	thrice
O	marvellous
O	adventure
O	of
O	Brom
O	Bones
O	,
O	who
O	made
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	Galloping
O	Hessian
O	as
O	an
O	arrant
O	jockey
O	.
O	He
O	affirmed
O	that
O	on
O	returning
O	one
O	night
O	from
O	the
O	neighbouring
O	village
O	of
O	Sing
O	Sing
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	overtaken
O	by
O	this
O	midnight
O	trooper;
O	that
O	the
O	had
O	offered
O	to
O	race
O	with
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	bowl
O	of
O	punch
O	,
O	and
O	should
O	have
O	won
O	it
O	too
O	,
O	for
O	Daredevil
O	beat
O	the
O	goblin
O	horse
O	all
O	hollow
O	,
O	but
O	just
O	as
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	church
O	bridge
O	,
O	the
O	Hessian
O	bolted
O	,
O	and
O	vanished
O	in
O	a
O	flash
O	of
O	fire
O	.
O	All
O	these
O	tales
O	,
O	told
O	in
O	that
O	drowsy
O	undertone
O	with
O	which
O	men
O	talk
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	,
O	the
O	countenances
O	of
O	the
O	listeners
O	only
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	receiving
O	a
O	casual
O	gleam
O	from
O	the
O	glare
O	of
O	a
O	pipe
O	,
O	sank
O	deep
O	in
O	the
O	mind
O	of
O	Ichabod
O	.
O	He
O	repaid
O	them
O	in
O	kind
O	with
O	large
O	extracts
O	from
O	his
O	invaluable
O	author
O	,
O	Cotton
O	Mather
O	,
O	and
O	added
O	many
O	marvellous
O	events
O	that
O	had
O	taken
O	place
O	in
O	his
O	native
O	state
O	of
O	Connecticut
O	,
O	and
O	fearful
O	sights
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	in
O	his
O	nightly
O	walks
O	about
O	Sleepy
O	Hollow
O	.
O	The
O	revel
O	now
O	gradually
O	broke
O	up
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	farmers
O	gathered
O	together
O	their
O	families
O	in
O	their
O	wagons
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	heard
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	rattling
O	along
O	the
O	hollow
O	roads
O	,
O	and
O	over
O	the
O	distant
O	hills
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	damsels
O	mounted
O	on
O	pillions
O	behind
O	their
O	favourite
O	swains
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	light-hearted
O	laughter
O	,
O	mingling
O	with
O	the
O	clatter
O	of
O	hoofs
O	,
O	echoed
O	along
O	the
O	silent
O	woodlands
O	,
O	sounding
O	fainter
O	and
O	fainter
O	,
O	until
O	they
O	gradually
O	died
O	away--and
O	the
O	late
O	scene
O	of
O	noise
O	and
O	frolic
O	was
O	all
O	silent
O	and
O	deserted
O	.
O	Ichabod
O	only
O	lingered
O	behind
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	custom
O	of
O	country
O	lovers
O	,
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	tete-a-tete
O	with
O	the
O	heiress;
O	fully
O	convinced
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	now
O	on
O	the
O	high
O	road
O	to
O	success
O	.
O	What
O	passed
O	at
O	this
O	interview
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	pretend
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	for
O	in
O	fact
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	.
O	Something
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	I
O	fear
O	me
O	,
O	must
O	have
O	gone
O	wrong
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	certainly
O	sallied
O	forth
O	,
O	after
O	no
O	very
O	great
O	interval
O	,
O	with
O	an
O	air
O	quite
O	desolate
O	and
O	chapfallen
O	.
O	Oh
O	,
O	these
O	women
O	!
O	these
O	women
O	!
O	Could
O	that
O	girl
O	have
O	been
O	playing
O	off
O	any
O	of
O	her
O	coquettish
O	tricks
O	?
O	Was
O	her
O	encouragement
O	of
O	the
O	poor
O	pedagogue
O	all
O	a
O	mere
O	sham
O	to
O	secure
O	her
O	conquest
O	of
O	his
O	rival
O	?
O	Heaven
O	only
O	knows
O	,
O	not
O	I
O	!
O	Let
O	it
O	suffice
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	Ichabod
O	stole
O	forth
O	with
O	the
O	air
O	of
O	one
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	sacking
O	a
O	henroost
O	,
O	rather
O	than
O	a
O	fair
O	lady
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	.
O	Without
O	looking
O	to
O	the
O	right
O	or
O	left
O	to
O	notice
O	the
O	scene
O	of
O	rural
O	wealth
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	so
O	often
O	gloated
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	straight
O	to
O	the
O	stable
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	several
O	hearty
O	cuffs
O	and
O	kicks
O	roused
O	his
O	steed
O	most
O	uncourteously
O	from
O	the
O	comfortable
O	quarters
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	soundly
O	sleeping
O	,
O	dreaming
O	of
O	mountains
O	of
O	corn
O	and
O	oats
O	,
O	and
O	whole
O	valleys
O	of
O	timothy
O	and
O	clover
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	very
O	witching
O	time
O	of
O	night
O	that
O	Ichabod
O	,
O	heavy-hearted
O	and
O	crest-fallen
O	,
O	pursued
O	his
O	travels
O	homewards
O	,
O	along
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	lofty
O	hills
O	which
O	rise
O	above
O	Tarry
O	Town
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	traversed
O	so
O	cheerily
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	.
O	The
O	hour
O	was
O	as
O	dismal
O	as
O	himself
O	.
O	Far
O	below
O	him
O	the
O	Tappen
O	Zee
O	spread
O	its
O	dusky
O	and
O	indistinct
O	waste
O	of
O	waters
O	,
O	with
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	the
O	tall
O	mast
O	of
O	a
O	sloop
O	,
O	riding
O	quietly
O	at
O	anchor
O	under
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	dead
O	hush
O	of
O	midnight
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	even
O	hear
O	the
O	barking
O	of
O	the
O	watchdog
O	from
O	the
O	opposite
O	shore
O	of
O	the
O	Hudson;
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	vague
O	and
O	faint
O	as
O	only
O	to
O	give
O	an
O	idea
O	of
O	his
O	distance
O	from
O	this
O	faithful
O	companion
O	of
O	man
O	.
O	Now
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	the
O	long-drawn
O	crowing
O	of
O	a
O	cock
O	,
O	accidentally
O	awakened
O	,
O	would
O	sound
O	far
O	,
O	far
O	off
O	,
O	from
O	some
O	farmhouse
O	away
O	among
O	the
O	hills--but
O	it
O	was
O	like
O	a
O	dreaming
O	sound
O	in
O	his
O	ear
O	.
O	No
O	signs
O	of
O	life
O	occurred
O	near
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	occasionally
O	the
O	melancholy
O	chirp
O	of
O	a
O	cricket
O	,
O	or
O	perhaps
O	the
O	guttural
O	twang
O	of
O	a
O	bull-frog
O	from
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	marsh
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	sleeping
O	uncomfortably
O	and
O	turning
O	suddenly
O	in
O	his
O	bed
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	stories
O	of
O	ghosts
O	and
O	goblins
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	now
O	came
O	crowding
O	upon
O	his
O	recollection
O	.
O	The
O	night
O	grew
O	darker
O	and
O	darker;
O	the
O	stars
O	seemed
O	to
O	sink
O	deeper
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	and
O	driving
O	clouds
O	occasionally
O	hid
O	them
O	from
O	his
O	sight
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	never
O	felt
O	so
O	lonely
O	and
O	dismal
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	,
O	moreover
O	,
O	approaching
O	the
O	very
O	place
O	where
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	scenes
O	of
O	the
O	ghost
O	stories
O	had
O	been
O	laid
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	centre
O	of
O	the
O	road
O	stood
O	an
O	enormous
O	tulip-tree
O	,
O	which
O	towered
O	like
O	a
O	giant
O	above
O	all
O	the
O	other
O	trees
O	of
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	,
O	and
O	formed
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	landmark
O	.
O	Its
O	limbs
O	were
O	gnarled
O	and
O	fantastic
O	,
O	large
O	enough
O	to
O	form
O	trunks
O	for
O	ordinary
O	trees
O	,
O	twisting
O	down
O	almost
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	and
O	rising
O	again
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	connected
O	with
O	the
O	tragical
O	story
O	of
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	Andre
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	taken
O	prisoner
O	hard
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	universally
O	known
O	by
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Major
O	Andre
O	'
O	s
O	tree
O	.
O	The
O	common
O	people
O	regarded
O	it
O	with
O	a
O	mixture
O	of
O	respect
O	and
O	superstition
O	,
O	partly
O	out
O	of
O	sympathy
O	for
O	the
O	fate
O	of
O	its
O	ill-starred
O	namesake
O	,
O	and
O	partly
O	from
O	the
O	tales
O	of
O	strange
O	sights
O	,
O	and
O	doleful
O	lamentations
O	,
O	told
O	concerning
O	it
O	.
O	As
O	Ichabod
O	approached
O	this
O	fearful
O	tree
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	whistle;
O	he
O	thought
O	his
O	whistle
O	was
O	answered;
O	it
O	was
O	but
O	a
O	blast
O	sweeping
O	sharply
O	through
O	the
O	dry
O	branches
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	approached
O	a
O	little
O	nearer
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	saw
O	something
O	white
O	,
O	hanging
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	tree:
O	he
O	paused
O	,
O	and
O	ceased
O	whistling;
O	but
O	,
O	on
O	looking
O	more
O	narrowly
O	,
O	perceived
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	tree
O	had
O	been
O	scathed
O	by
O	lightning
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	white
O	wood
O	laid
O	bare
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	groan--his
O	teeth
O	chattered
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	knees
O	smote
O	against
O	the
O	saddle:
O	it
O	was
O	but
O	the
O	rubbing
O	of
O	one
O	huge
O	bough
O	upon
O	another
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	swayed
O	about
O	by
O	the
O	breeze
O	.
O	He
O	passed
O	the
O	tree
O	in
O	safety
O	,
O	but
O	new
O	perils
O	lay
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	About
O	two
O	hundred
O	yards
O	from
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	a
O	small
O	brook
O	crossed
O	the
O	road
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	into
O	a
O	marshy
O	and
O	thickly-wooded
O	glen
O	,
O	known
O	by
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Wiley
O	'
O	s
O	Swamp
O	.
O	A
O	few
O	rough
O	logs
O	,
O	laid
O	side
O	by
O	side
O	,
O	served
O	for
O	a
O	bridge
O	over
O	this
O	stream
O	.
O	On
O	that
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	road
O	where
O	the
O	brook
O	entered
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	a
O	group
O	of
O	oaks
O	and
O	chestnuts
O	,
O	matted
O	thick
O	with
O	wild
O	grape-vines
O	,
O	threw
O	a
O	cavernous
O	gloom
O	over
O	it
O	.
O	To
O	pass
O	this
O	bridge
O	was
O	the
O	severest
O	trial
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	at
O	this
O	identical
O	spot
O	that
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	Andre
O	was
O	captured
O	,
O	and
O	under
O	the
O	covert
O	of
O	those
O	chestnuts
O	and
O	vines
O	were
O	the
O	sturdy
O	yeomen
O	concealed
O	who
O	surprised
O	him
O	.
O	This
O	has
O	ever
O	since
O	been
O	considered
O	a
O	haunted
O	stream
O	,
O	and
O	fearful
O	are
O	the
O	feelings
O	of
O	the
O	schoolboy
O	who
O	has
O	to
O	pass
O	it
O	alone
O	after
O	dark
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	approached
O	the
O	stream
O	,
O	his
O	heart
O	began
O	to
O	thump;
O	he
O	summoned
O	up
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	all
O	his
O	resolution
O	,
O	gave
O	his
O	horse
O	half
O	a
O	score
O	of
O	kicks
O	in
O	the
O	ribs
O	,
O	and
O	attempted
O	to
O	dash
O	briskly
O	across
O	the
O	bridge;
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	starting
O	forward
O	,
O	the
O	perverse
O	old
O	animal
O	made
O	a
O	lateral
O	movement
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	broadside
O	against
O	the
O	fence
O	.
O	Ichabod
O	,
O	whose
O	fears
O	increased
O	with
O	the
O	delay
O	,
O	jerked
O	the
O	reins
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	kicked
O	lustily
O	with
O	the
O	contrary
O	foot:
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	in
O	vain;
O	his
O	steed
O	started
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	true
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	to
O	plunge
O	to
O	the
O	opposite
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	road
O	into
O	a
O	thicket
O	of
O	brambles
O	and
O	alder-bushes
O	.
O	The
O	schoolmaster
O	now
O	bestowed
O	both
O	whip
O	and
O	heel
O	upon
O	the
O	starveling
O	ribs
O	of
O	old
O	Gunpowder
O	,
O	who
O	dashed
O	forward
O	,
O	snuffling
O	and
O	snorting
O	,
O	but
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	stand
O	just
O	by
O	the
O	bridge
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	suddenness
O	that
O	had
O	nearly
O	sent
O	his
O	rider
O	sprawling
O	over
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	Just
O	at
O	this
O	moment
O	a
O	plashy
O	tramp
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	bridge
O	caught
O	the
O	sensitive
O	ear
O	of
O	Ichabod
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	dark
O	shadow
O	of
O	the
O	grove
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	margin
O	of
O	the
O	brook
O	,
O	he
O	beheld
O	something
O	huge
O	,
O	misshapen
O	,
O	and
O	towering
O	.
O	It
O	stirred
O	not
O	,
O	but
O	seemed
O	gathered
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	gloom
O	,
O	like
O	some
O	gigantic
O	monster
O	ready
O	to
O	spring
O	upon
O	the
O	traveller
O	.
O	The
O	hair
O	of
O	the
O	affrighted
O	pedagogue
O	rose
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	with
O	terror
O	.
O	What
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	?
O	To
O	turn
O	and
O	fly
O	was
O	now
O	too
O	late;
O	and
O	besides
O	,
O	what
O	chance
O	was
O	there
O	of
O	escaping
O	ghost
O	or
O	goblin
O	,
O	if
O	such
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	which
O	could
O	ride
O	upon
O	the
O	wings
O	of
O	the
O	wind
O	?
O	Summoning
O	up
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	a
O	show
O	of
O	courage
O	,
O	he
O	demanded
O	in
O	stammering
O	accents
O	,
O	""""
O	Who
O	are
O	you
O	?
O	""""
O	He
O	received
O	no
O	reply
O	.
O	He
O	repeated
O	his
O	demand
O	in
O	a
O	still
O	more
O	agitated
O	voice
O	.
O	Still
O	there
O	was
O	no

O	Once

O	he
O	cudgelled
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	inflexible
O	Gunpowder
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	shutting
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	broke
O	forth
O	with
O	involuntary
O	fervour
O	into
O	a
O	psalm
O	tune
O	.
O	Just
O	then
O	the
O	shadowy
O	object
O	of
O	alarm
O	put
O	itself
O	in
O	motion
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	scramble
O	and
O	a
O	bound
O	stood
O	at
O	once
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	road
O	.
O	Though
O	the
O	night
O	was
O	dark
O	and
O	dismal
O	,
O	yet
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	the
O	unknown
O	might
O	now
O	in
O	some
O	degree
O	be
O	ascertained
O	.
O	He
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	horseman
O	of
O	large
O	dimensions
O	,
O	and
O	mounted
O	on
O	a
O	black
O	horse
O	of
O	powerful
O	frame
O	.
O	He
O	made
O	no
O	offer
O	of
O	molestation
O	or
O	sociability
O	,
O	but
O	kept
O	aloof
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	road
O	,
O	jogging
O	along
O	on
O	the
O	blind
O	side
O	of
O	old
O	Gunpowder
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	now
O	got
O	over
O	his
O	fright
O	and
O	waywardness
O	.
O	Ichabod
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	no
O	relish
O	for
O	this
O	strange
O	midnight
O	companion
O	,
O	and
O	bethought
O	himself
O	of
O	the
O	adventure
O	of
O	Brom
O	Bones
O	with
O	the
O	Galloping
O	Hessian
O	,
O	now
O	quickened
O	his
O	steed
O	in
O	hopes
O	of
O	leaving
O	him
O	behind
O	.
O	The
O	stranger
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	quickened
O	his
O	horse
O	to
O	an
O	equal
O	pace
O	.
O	Ichabod
O	pulled
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	walk
O	,
O	thinking
O	to
O	lag
O	behind--the
O	other
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	.
O	His
O	heart
O	began
O	to
O	sink
O	within
O	him;
O	he
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	resume
O	his
O	psalm
O	tune
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	parched
O	tongue
O	clove
O	to
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	utter
O	a
O	stave
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	something
O	in
O	the
O	moody
O	and
O	dogged
O	silence
O	of
O	this
O	pertinacious
O	companion
O	that
O	was
O	mysterious
O	and
O	appalling
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	soon
O	fearfully
O	accounted
O	for
O	.
O	On
O	mounting
O	a
O	rising
O	ground
O	,
O	which
O	brought
O	the
O	figure
O	of
O	his
O	fellow-traveller
O	in
O	relief
O	against
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	gigantic
O	in
O	height
O	,
O	and
O	muffled
O	in
O	a
O	cloak
O	,
O	Ichabod
O	was
O	horror-struck
O	on
O	perceiving
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	headless
O	!
O	but
O	his
O	horror
O	was
O	still
O	more
O	increased
O	on
O	observing
O	that
O	the
O	head
O	,
O	which
O	should
O	have
O	rested
O	on
O	his
O	shoulders
O	,
O	was
O	carried
O	before
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	pommel
O	of
O	his
O	saddle
O	!
O	His
O	terror
O	rose
O	to
O	desperation;
O	he
O	rained
O	a
O	shower
O	of
O	kicks
O	and
O	blows
O	upon
O	Gunpowder
O	,
O	hoping
O	by
O	a
O	sudden
O	movement
O	to
O	give
O	his
O	companion
O	the
O	slip;
O	but
O	the
O	spectre
O	started
O	full
O	jump
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	Away
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	they
O	dashed
O	through
O	thick
O	and
O	thin;
O	stones
O	flying
O	and
O	sparks
O	flashing
O	at
O	every
O	bound
O	.
O	Ichabod
O	'
O	s
O	flimsy
O	garments
O	fluttered
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	stretched
O	his
O	long
O	lank
O	body
O	away
O	over
O	his
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	eagerness
O	of
O	his
O	flight
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	now
O	reached
O	the
O	road
O	which
O	turns
O	off
O	to
O	Sleepy
O	Hollow;
O	but
O	Gunpowder
O	,
O	who
O	seemed
O	possessed
O	with
O	a
O	demon
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	keeping
O	up
O	it
O	,
O	made
O	an
O	opposite
O	turn
O	,
O	and
O	plunged
O	headlong
O	down
O	hill
O	to
O	the
O	left
O	.
O	This
O	road
O	leads
O	through
O	a
O	sandy
O	hollow
O	,
O	shaded
O	by
O	trees
O	for
O	about
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	a
O	mile
O	,
O	where
O	it
O	crosses
O	the
O	bridge
O	famous
O	in
O	goblin
O	story;
O	and
O	just
O	beyond
O	swells
O	the
O	green
O	knoll
O	on
O	which
O	stands
O	the
O	whitewashed
O	church
O	.
O	As
O	yet
O	the
O	panic
O	of
O	the
O	steed
O	had
O	given
O	his
O	unskilful
O	rider
O	an
O	apparent
O	advantage
O	in
O	the
O	chase;
O	but
O	just
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	got
O	half
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	hollow
O	,
O	the
O	girths
O	of
O	the
O	saddle
O	gave
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	felt
O	it
O	slipping
O	from
O	under
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	seized
O	it
O	by
O	the
O	pommel
O	,
O	and
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	hold
O	it
O	firm
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	vain;
O	and
O	had
O	just
O	time
O	to
O	save
O	himself
O	by
O	clasping
O	old
O	Gunpowder
O	round
O	the
O	neck
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	saddle
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	heard
O	it
O	trampled
O	under
O	foot
O	by
O	his
O	pursuer
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	moment
O	the
O	terror
O	of
O	Hans
O	Van
O	Ripper
O	'
O	s
O	wrath
O	passed
O	across
O	his
O	mind--for
O	it
O	was
O	his
O	Sunday
O	saddle;
O	but
O	this
O	was
O	no
O	time
O	for
O	petty
O	fears;
O	the
O	goblin
O	was
O	hard
O	on
O	his
O	haunches;
O	and
O	(
O	unskilful
O	rider
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	!
O	)
O	he
O	had
O	much
O	ado
O	to
O	maintain
O	his
O	seat;
O	sometimes
O	slipping
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	sometimes
O	on
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	jolted
O	on
O	the
O	high
O	ridge
O	of
O	his
O	horse
O	'
O	s
O	backbone
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	violence
O	that
O	he
O	verily
O	feared
O	would
O	cleave
O	him
O	asunder
O	.
O	An
O	opening
O	in
O	the
O	trees
O	now
O	cheered
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	hopes
O	that
O	the
O	church
O	bridge
O	was
O	at
O	hand
O	.
O	The
O	wavering
O	reflection
O	of
O	a
O	silver
O	star
O	in
O	the
O	bosom
O	of
O	the
O	brook
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	mistaken
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	the
O	walls
O	of
O	the
O	church
O	dimly
O	glaring
O	under
O	the
O	trees
O	beyond
O	.
O	He
O	recollected
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	Brom
O	Bones
O	'
O	s
O	ghostly
O	competitor
O	had
O	disappeared

O	Just
O	then
O	he
O	heard
O	the

O	close
O	behind

O	he
O	even

O	that

O	.
O	Another

O	in
O	the
O	ribs
O	,

O	old
O	Gunpowder
O	sprang
O	upon
O	the

O	thundered
O	over
O	the
O	resounding

O	he
O	gained
O	the
O	opposite

O	now
O	Ichabod
O	cast
O	a
O	look
O	behind
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	his
O	pursuer

O	in
O	a
O	flash
O	of
O	fire

O	.
O	Just
O	then
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	goblin
O	rising
O	in
O	his
O	stirrups
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	very
O	act
O	of
O	hurling
O	his
O	head
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	Ichabod
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	dodge
O	the
O	horrible
O	missile
O	,
O	but
O	too
O	late
O	.
O	It
O	encountered
O	his
O	cranium
O	with
O	a
O	tremendous
O	crash--he
O	was
O	tumbled
O	headlong
O	into
O	the
O	dust
O	,

O	Gunpowder
O	,
O	the
O	black

O	and
O	the
O	goblin
O	rider
O	,
O	passed
O	by
O	like
O	a
O	whirlwind
O	.
O	The
O	next

O	the
O	old
O	horse

O	under

O	Ichabod

O	no

O	The

O	about

O	no

O	Hans
O	Van

O	Ichabod

O	In
O	one
O	part

O	leading
O	to
O	the

O	Hans
O	Van

O	They
O	consisted

O	reading

O	possessed
O	,

O	had
O	received
O	his

O	'
O	s
O	pay
O	but
O	a

O	or
O	two
O	before
O	,

O	must
O	have
O	had
O	about
O	his
O	person
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	his
O	disappearance
O	.
O	The
O	mysterious
O	event
O	caused
O	much
O	speculation
O	at
O	the

O	on
O	the
O	following
O	Sunday
O	.
O	Knots
O	of
O	gazers
O	and
O	gossips
O	were
O	collected
O	in
O	the
O	churchyard
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	bridge
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	the
O	hat
O	and
O	pumpkin
O	had
O	been
O	found
O	.
O	The
O	stories
O	of
O	Brouwer
O	,
O	of
O	Bones
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	whole
O	budget
O	of
O	others
O	were
O	called
O	to
O	mind;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	diligently
O	considered
O	them
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	compared
O	them
O	with
O	the
O	symptoms
O	of
O	the
O	present
O	case
O	,
O	they
O	shook
O	their
O	heads
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	conclusion
O	that
O	Ichabod
O	had
O	been
O	carried
O	off
O	by
O	the
O	Galloping
O	Hessian
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	bachelor
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	nobody
O	'
O	s
O	debt
O	,
O	nobody
O	troubled
O	his
O	head
O	any
O	more
O	about
O	him;
O	the
O	school
O	was
O	removed
O	to
O	a
O	different
O	quarter
O	of
O	the
O	Hollow
O	,
O	and
O	another
O	pedagogue
O	reigned
O	in
O	his
O	stead
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	true
O	,
O	an
O	old
O	farmer
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	down
O	to
O	New
O	York
O	on
O	a
O	visit
O	several
O	years
O	after
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	whom
O	this
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	ghostly
O	adventure
O	was
O	received
O	,
O	brought
O	home
O	the
O	intelligence
O	that
O	Ichabod
O	Crane
O	was
O	still
O	alive;
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	partly
O	through
O	fear
O	of
O	the
O	goblin
O	and
O	Hans
O	Van
O	Ripper
O	,
O	and
O	partly
O	in
O	mortification
O	at
O	having
O	been
O	suddenly
O	dismissed
O	by
O	the
O	heiress;
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	changed
O	his
O	quarters
O	to
O	a
O	distant
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	country;
O	had
O	kept
O	school
O	and
O	studied
O	law
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time;
O	had
O	been
O	admitted
O	to
O	the
O	bar;
O	turned
O	politician;
O	electioneered;
O	written
O	for
O	the
O	newspapers;
O	and
O	finally
O	had
O	been
O	made
O	a
O	justice
O	of

O	the

O	whenever
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	Ichabod
O	was
O	related
O	,
O	and
O	always
O	burst
O	into
O	a
O	hearty
O	laugh
O	at
O	the

O	of
O	the

O	judges
O	of

O	,
O	maintain
O	to
O	this
O	day
O	that
O	Ichabod
O	was
O	spirited
O	away

O	round
O	the
O	winter

O	The

O	became
O	more
O	than
O	ever
O	an
O	object
O	of
O	superstitious
O	awe;
O	and
O	that

O	the
O	reason
O	why
O	the

O	The
O	schoolhouse
O	being
O	deserted
O	soon
O	fell
O	to
O	decay
O	,
O	and

O	by
O	the

O	guard
