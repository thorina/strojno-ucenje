O	I
O	.
O	IN
O	THE
O	TOILS
O	OF
O	RASHLEIGH
O	BUT
O	it
O	became
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	evident
O	that
O	Frank's
O	time
O	at
O	Osbaldistone
O	Hall
O	was
O	growing
O	short
O	.
O	A
O	certain
O	travelling
O	merchant
O	,
O	a
O	friend
O	and
O	countryman
O	of
O	Andrew
O	Fairservice
O	,
O	the
O	Osbaldistone
O	gardener
O	,
O	brought
O	news
O	from
O	London
O	of
O	how
O	Frank's
O	character
O	had
O	been
O	attacked
O	there
O	in
O	the
O	matter
O	of
O	Morris
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	high
O	court
O	of
O	Parliament
O	itself
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	Frank
O	felt
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	much
O	longer
O	remain
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	house
O	with
O	Miss
O	Vernon
O	.
O	His
O	love
O	for
O	her
O	daily
O	increased
O	.
O	Yet
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	plainly
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	and
O	would
O	only
O	be
O	a
O	friend
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	must
O	ask
O	her
O	no
O	questions
O	,
O	however
O	deep
O	the
O	mysteries
O	which
O	encircled
O	her
O	might
O	seem
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	man's
O	glove
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	library
O	table
O	.
O	On
O	another
O	occasion
O	,
O	after
O	Rashleigh's
O	departure
O	for
O	London
O	,
O	he
O	distinguished
O	two
O	shadows
O	on
O	the
O	windows
O	of
O	the
O	library
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	patrolling
O	the
O	garden
O	after
O	dark
O	.
O	Last
O	of
O	all
O	Frank
O	received
O	a
O	letter
O	through
O	some
O	secret
O	channel
O	of
O	Diana's
O	written
O	by
O	his
O	father's
O	partner
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	Tresham
O	.
O	This
O	informed
O	him
O	that
O	his
O	father
O	had
O	been
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	Holland
O	on
O	business
O	of
O	the
O	firm
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	Rashleigh
O	had
O	gone
O	north
O	to
O	Scotland
O	some
O	time
O	ago
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	large
O	amount
O	of
O	money
O	to
O	take
O	up
O	bills
O	granted
O	by
O	his
O	father
O	to
O	merchants
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	.
O	Since
O	his
O	setting
O	out
O	,
O	nothing
O	whatever
O	had
O	been
O	heard
O	of
O	Rashleigh
O	,
O	and
O	Owen
O	had
O	gone
O	north
O	to
O	find
O	him
O	.
O	Frank
O	was
O	urgently
O	prayed
O	to
O	proceed
O	to
O	Glasgow
O	for
O	the
O	same
O	purpose
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	possible
O	.
O	For
O	if
O	Rashleigh
O	were
O	not
O	found
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	likely
O	that
O	the
O	great
O	house
O	of
O	Osbaldistone
O	and
O	Tresham
O	might
O	have
O	to
O	suspend
O	payment
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	news
O	Frank
O	was
O	stricken
O	to
O	the
O	heart
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	now
O	how
O	his
O	foolishness
O	had
O	ruined
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	because
O	it
O	was
O	through
O	his
O	obstinacy
O	that
O	Rashleigh
O	had
O	gained
O	admission
O	to
O	his
O	father's
O	confidence
O	.
O	Mr
O	.
O	Osbaldistone
O	,
O	he
O	knew
O	,
O	would
O	never
O	survive
O	the
O	disgrace
O	of
O	bankruptcy
O	.
O	He
O	must
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	instantly
O	depart
O	.
O	And
O	Diana
O	willingly
O	sped
O	him
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	,
O	giving
O	him
O	a
O	letter
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	only
O	to
O	open
O	if
O	all
O	other
O	means
O	of
O	paying
O	his
O	father's
O	debts
O	had
O	failed
O	.
O	Frank
O	resolved
O	to
O	quit
O	Osbaldistone
O	Hall
O	by
O	night
O	secretly
O	,
O	leaving
O	only
O	a
O	letter
O	of
O	thanks
O	for
O	his
O	uncle
O	,
O	and
O	informing
O	him
O	that
O	immediate
O	and
O	urgent
O	business
O	called
O	him
O	to
O	Glasgow
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	a
O	willing
O	guide
O	ready
O	to
O	his
O	hand
O	in
O	the
O	gardener
O	Andrew
O	Fairservice
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	had
O	long
O	been
O	awaiting
O	such
O	an
O	opportunity
O	of
O	quitting
O	his
O	employment
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	same
O	Andrew
O	came
O	near
O	to
O	involving
O	Frank
O	in
O	a
O	fresh
O	breach
O	of
O	the
O	law
O	.
O	For
O	,
O	as
O	Squire
O	Thorncliff
O	owed
O	him
O	ten
O	pounds
O	which
O	he
O	refused
O	to
O	pay
O	,
O	Andrew
O	had
O	mounted
O	himself
O	on
O	Squire
O	Thornie's
O	good
O	beast
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	until
O	the
O	animal
O	was
O	safely
O	arrested
O	by
O	the
O	law
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	Scotch
O	town
O	across
O	the
O	border
O	,
O	and
O	Frank
O	had
O	written
O	the
O	whole
O	story
O	to
O	Sir
O	Hildebrand
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	felt
O	easy
O	in
O	his
O	mind
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	irregular
O	act
O	of
O	his
O	attendant
O	.
O	They
O	arrived
O	at
O	Glasgow
O	,

O	small

O	ancient
O	town
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	eve
O	of
O	the
O	Sabbath
O	day
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	impossible
O	for
O	Frank
O	to
O	discover
O	Owen
O	that
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	proved
O	to
O	be
O	no
O	more
O	easy
O	the
O	following
O	morning
O	.
O	For
O	when
O	he
O	proposed
O	to
O	his
O	landlady
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	dwelling-house
O	of
O	Mr

O	MacVittie
O	,

O	to

O	At

O	out

O	to
O	remark
O	his
O	English
O	accent
O	,
O	after

O	since

O	left

O	But
O	he
O	liked
O	somewhat
O	less
O	what
O	he
O	was
O	next
O	to

O	The
O	English

O	had
O	received
O	instructions

O	two

O	,
O	one

O	It
O	seemed
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	Frank
O	and
O	the
O	Bailie
O	answered
O	fairly
O	well

O	In

O	of
O	the
O	protests
O	and
O	threats
O	of
O	the
O	honourable
O	magistrate
O	,
O	he
O	ordered
O	them
O	both
O	to
O	follow
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	advance
O	into
O	the
O	Highland
O	country
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	immediately
O	to
O	set

O	The
O	letter

O	from
O	the
O	landlady
O	of
O	the

O	,
O	being
O	found
O	upon

O	to

O	been
O	in

O	with
O	Rob
O	Roy
O	,

O	Next
O	the
O	shock-headed

O	who

O	quarrel
O	upon

O	,
O	having
O	been
O	captured
O	,
O	was
O	brought
O	before
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	commanded
O	,
O	on
O	pain
O	of
O	being
O	instantly
O	hanged
O	,
O	to
O	lead
O	them

O	of
O	it
O	of
O	the
O	roughest
O	sort
O	,

O	Dougal
O	consented
O	for

O	.
O	This
O	sinful
O	compliance
O	of
O	Dougal's
O	angered
O	the
O	Bailie
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	cried
O	to
O	the
O	soldiers
O	to
O	take
O	Dougal
O	away
O	,
O	because
O	now
O	he
O	deserved
O	hanging
O	for
O	his
O	treachery
O	more
O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	This
O	drew
O	the

O	the
O	Corporal
O	who
O	was
O	acting
O	as

O	But
O	on
O	this

O	At

O	Frank
O	soon
