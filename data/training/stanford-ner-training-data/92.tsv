O	Following
O	the
O	footsteps
O	of
O	the
O	passers-by
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	himself

O	off

O	at
O	the

O	.
O	He

O	his

O	How

O	the

O	,
O	and
O	it
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	many
O	minutes
O	now
O	before
O	the
O	floor
O	gave
O	way
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	roof
O	crashed
O	in
O	,
O	or
O	both
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	felt
O	his
O	feet
O	scorched
O	through
O	his
O	stockings
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	set
O	foot
O	on
O	the
O	boards
O	.
O	Down
O	in
O	the
O	street
O	the
O	crowd
O	had
O	increased
O	enormously;
O	gentlemen
O	from
O	the
O	clubs
O	,
O	waiters
O	and
O	loungers
O	from
O	a
O	distance
O	had
O	all
O	gathered
O	to
O	look
O	.
O	As
O	Elliot
O	descended
O	the
O	ladder
O	with
O	his
O	burden
O	a
O	frantic
O	storm
O	of
O	cheering
O	broke
O	forth--for
O	every
O	soul
O	present
O	understood
O	the
O	splendid
O	action
O	that
O	had
O	just
O	been
O	performed;
O	and
O	the
O	crush
O	around
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	ladder
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	pressed
O	forward
O	to
O	express
O	their
O	admiration
O	was
O	terrific
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	knew
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	nothing
O	of
O	the
O	stout
O	lady
O	still
O	left
O	in
O	the
O	bedroom;
O	and
O	when
O	Elliot
O	,
O	heedless
O	of
O	the
O	cheers
O	and
O	hand-shakes
O	that
O	met
O	him
O	,
O	flung
O	Lady
O	Dover
O	into
O	the
O	arms
O	of
O	the
O	nearest
O	bystander
O	,
O	and
O	turned
O	again
O	towards
O	the
O	ladder
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	utterly
O	at
O	a
O	loss
O	to
O	understand
O	what
O	he
O	could
O	be
O	about
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	kept
O	his
O	word
O	,
O	A
O	dead
O	hush
O	fell
O	again
O	upon
O	the
O	spectators
O	,
O	as
O	once
O	more
O	the
O	brave
O	man
O	dashed
O	up
O	the
O	ladder
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	the
O	firemen
O	had
O	ceased
O	now
O	to
O	play
O	.
O	Half-way
O	up
O	he
O	turned
O	.
O	"""Keep"
O	on
O	at
O	the
O	pumps
O	!
O	""""
O	he
O	called;
O	and
O	then
O	again
O	was
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	looked
O	in
O	.
O	The
O	lady
O	had
O	still
O	preserved
O	her
O	former
O	attitude
O	,
O	though
O	leaning
O	now
O	further
O	back
O	against
O	the
O	wall
O	and
O	panting
O	for
O	breath
O	in
O	the
O	stifling
O	smoke
O	.
O	He
O	put
O	his
O	hand
O	out
O	to
O	her
O	.
O	"""Catch"
O	hold
O	of
O	my
O	neck
O	and
O	hold
O	tightly
O	round
O	it
O	,
O	""""
O	he
O	said
O	.
O	But
O	again
O	she
O	was
O	speechless
O	and
O	helpless
O	.
O	Her
O	eyes
O	lit
O	up
O	as
O	she
O	saw
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	beyond
O	this
O	she
O	hardly
O	seemed
O	to
O	understand
O	his
O	words
O	.
O	Elliot
O	groaned
O	,
O	and
O	finding
O	,
O	after
O	another
O	trial
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	comprehend
O	,
O	boldly
O	reached
O	in
O	and
O	grasped
O	her
O	round
O	the
O	waist
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	heavier
O	even
O	than
O	he
O	had
O	imagined
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	one
O	fearful
O	moment
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	stood
O	poised
O	on
O	the
O	topmost
O	rung
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	all
O	was
O	over
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	impossible
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	ever
O	reach
O	the
O	ground
O	except
O	by
O	tumbling
O	off
O	the
O	ladder
O	.
O	By
O	a
O	superhuman
O	effort
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	managed
O	to
O	drag
O	her
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	clasping
O	her
O	waist
O	with
O	one
O	arm
O	,
O	whilst
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	he
O	held
O	on
O	like
O	grim
O	death
O	,
O	he
O	hung
O	breathless
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	began
O	slowly
O	to
O	descend
O	.
O	Up
O	to
O	this
O	point
O	there
O	had
O	been
O	no
O	sound
O	in
O	the
O	street
O	below
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	watchers
O	saw
O	his
O	feet
O	moving
O	down
O	the
O	ladder
O	,
O	their
O	enthusiasm
O	broke
O	out
O	in
O	one
O	deep
O	sigh
O	,
O	followed
O	by
O	yells
O	and
O	shouts
O	of
O	admiration
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	young
O	stableman
O	slowly
O	descended
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	,
O	by
O	God's
O	mercy
O	,
O	reached
O	the
O	ground
O	with
O	his
O	burden
O	,
O	these
O	feelings
O	broke
O	all
O	bounds
O	.
O	Men
O	rushed
O	round
O	him;
O	guineas
O	were
O	poured
O	by
O	the
O	handful
O	into
O	his
O	pockets;
O	and
O	when
O	these
O	and
O	his
O	hands
O	were
O	full
O	,
O	the
O	gold
O	was
O	even
O	stuffed
O	into
O	his
O	mouth
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	this
O	excitement
O	,
O	a
O	sudden
O	crash
O	caused
O	the
O	spectators
O	to
O	look
O	upwards
O	again
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	that
O	had
O	fallen
O	in
O	,
O	only
O	a
O	minute
O	after
O	Elliot
O	had
O	set
O	his
O	foot
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	The
O	lady
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	saved
O	by
O	this
O	second
O	brave
O	ascent
O	was
O	a
O	relative
O	of
O	Lady
O	Dover
O	,
O	by
O	name
O	Mile
O	,
O	von
O	Hompesch
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	pleasant
O	to
O	hear
O	that
O	her
O	preserver
O	was
O	rewarded
O	by
O	the
O	family
O	of
O	Lady
O	Dover
O	,
O	who
O	bestowed
O	a
O	pension
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	At
O	a
O	later
O	period
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	Lord
O	Braybrooke
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	narrative
O	was
O	preserved
O	by
O	a
O	member
O	of
O	the
O	family
O	who
O	had
O	often
O	heard
O	Elliot
O	relate
O	it
O	.
O	Like
O	all
O	brave
O	men
O	,
O	he
O	never
O	spoke
O	vaingloriously
O	of
O	his
O	exploit;
O	but
O	always
O	professed
O	great
O	gratitude
O	for
O	his
O	reward
O	,
O	which
O	seemed
O	to
O	him
O	considerably
O	higher
O	than
O	his
O	deserts
O	.
