O	In
O	the
O	fair
O	city
O	of
O	Edinburgh
O	there
O	lived
O	many
O	many
O	years
O	ago
O	a
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	named
O	Lizzie
O	Lindsay
O	.
O	Her
O	home
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	Canongate
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	now
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	poorest
O	parts
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	when
O	Lizzie
O	danced
O	and
O	sang
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	and
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	rejoice
O	,
O	the
O	Canongate
O	was
O	the
O	home
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	richest
O	lords
O	and
O	ladies
O	.
O	For
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	Canongate
O	was
O	Holyrood
O	,
O	the
O	palace
O	where
O	the
O	king
O	held
O	his
O	court
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	was
O	well
O	,
O	thought
O	the
O	lords
O	and
O	ladies
O	of
O	long
O	ago
O	,
O	to
O	live
O	near
O	the
O	palace
O	where
O	there
O	were
O	many
O	gay
O	sights
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	Lizzie
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	bonny
O	wee
O	girl
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	grew
O	up
O	she
O	grew
O	bonnier
O	still
O	,
O	until
O	,
O	not
O	only
O	in
O	Edinburgh
O	,
O	but
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	throughout
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	people
O	would
O	speak
O	of
O	her
O	beauty
O	.
O	Even
O	the
O	folk
O	who
O	dwelt
O	away
O	over
O	the
O	hills
O	in
O	the
O	Highlands
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	beauty
O	of
O	Lizzie
O	Lindsay
O	.
O	Dame
O	Lindsay
O	loved
O	her
O	daughter
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	her
O	beautiful
O	gowns
O	of
O	silk
O	and
O	velvet
O	.
O	Her
O	father
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	would
O	bring
O	her
O	home
O	many
O	a
O	sparkling
O	jewel
O	,
O	many
O	a
O	brilliant
O	gem
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	as
O	though
O	Lizzie
O	Lindsay
O	had
O	all
O	that
O	her
O	heart
O	could
O	wish
O	.
O	Certainly
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	wish
O	to
O	leave
O	her
O	home
O	in
O	the
O	Canongate
O	,
O	for
O	though
O	lord
O	after
O	lord
O	,
O	noble
O	after
O	noble
O	begged
O	for
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	Lizzie
O	but
O	tossed
O	her
O	beautiful
O	head
O	high
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	as
O	she
O	said
O	them
O	nay
O	.
O	But
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	well
O	known
O	that
O	the
O	lovely
O	maiden
O	had
O	kind
O	looks
O	and
O	gentle
O	words
O	to
O	spare
O	for
O	none
O	save
O	only
O	her
O	dear
O	father
O	and
O	her
O	doting
O	mother
O	,
O	yet
O	still
O	the
O	lords
O	and
O	nobles
O	would
O	dance
O	more
O	gladly
O	with
O	Lizzie
O	than
O	with
O	any
O	other
O	maiden
O	.
O	And
O	a
O	ball
O	,
O	even
O	a
O	ball
O	given
O	by
O	the
O	court
O	at
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	Holyrood
O	,
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	less
O	gladsome
O	were
O	it
O	known
O	that
O	the
O	fair
O	maiden
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	there
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	told
O	you
O	,
O	the
O	fame
O	of
O	Lizzie
O	Lindsay
O	'
O	s
O	beauty
O	had
O	spread
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	Highlands
O	.
O	And
O	Donald
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	of
O	Kingcaussie
O	,
O	heard
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	fairer
O	than
O	any
O	other
O	maiden
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	haughtier
O	and
O	more
O	wilful
O	as
O	well
O	.
O	For
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	nought
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	to
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	rich
O	suitors
O	who
O	surrounded
O	her
O	.
O	Then
O	Donald
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	tall
O	and
O	handsome
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	was
O	used
O	to
O	have
O	his
O	own
O	way
O	,
O	smiled
O	as
O	he
O	heard
O	of
O	Lizzie
O	'
O	s
O	wilful
O	spirit
O	and
O	her
O	great
O	beauty
O	.
O	He
O	made
O	up
O	his
O	mind
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	go
O	to
O	Edinburgh
O	and
O	try
O	to
O	win
O	as
O	his
O	bride
O	the
O	bonnie
O	lassie
O	who
O	would
O	have
O	nought
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	noble
O	or
O	with
O	lord
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	laird
O	lived
O	with
O	his
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	in
O	a
O	castle
O	built
O	high
O	amid
O	the
O	heather-covered
O	hills
O	,
O	and
O	little
O	until
O	now
O	had
O	Donald
O	cared
O	for
O	city
O	ways
O	or
O	city
O	walls
O	.
O	To
O	hunt
O	the
O	deer
O	,
O	to
O	chase
O	the
O	roe
O	,
O	to
O	spend
O	the
O	long
O	hours
O	from
O	early
O	morn
O	until
O	even
O	among
O	the
O	heathery
O	moors
O	which
O	were
O	all
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	had
O	been
O	happiness
O	enough
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	,
O	now
O	the
O	glory
O	faded
O	from
O	the
O	heather
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hunt
O	and
O	chase
O	lost
O	their
O	delight
O	.
O	Sir
O	Donald
O	'
O	s
O	heart
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	fair
O	city
O	of
O	Edinburgh
O	with
O	beautiful
O	Lizzie
O	Lindsay
O	,
O	whom
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	seen
O	,
O	he
O	loved
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	one
O	day
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	lady
O	mother
O	and
O	,
O	kissing
O	her
O	hand
O	right
O	courteously
O	,
O	he
O	begged
O	her
O	to
O	grant
O	him
O	a
O	boon
O	.
O	For
O	Donald
O	had
O	been
O	well
O	trained
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	a
O	boy
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	dream
O	of
O	leaving
O	his
O	home
O	among
O	the
O	hills
O	until
O	he
O	had
O	gained
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	consent
O	.
O	'
O	Grant
O	me
O	a
O	boon
O	,
O	lady
O	mother
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	.
O	'
O	Send
O	me
O	away

O	there
O	that
O	my
O	true
O	love
O	dwells
O	.
O	And
O	if
O	ye
O	will
O	do
O	this
O	I
O	will
O	bring
O	you
O	home
O	a
O	daughter
O	more
O	beautiful
O	than
O	any
O	other
O	maiden
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	'
O	Now
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	'
O	s
O	mother
O	had
O	heard
O	of
O	Lizzie
O	Lindsay
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	may
O	be
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	glad
O	that
O	her
O	son
O	should
O	wish
O	to
O	bring
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	so
O	beautiful
O	a
O	bride
O	.
O	Yet
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	wish
O	for
O	the
O	maiden
O	to
O	be
O	won
O	by
O	aught
O	save
O	by
O	love
O	for
O	her
O	dear
O	son
O	alone
O	.
O	Lizzie
O	had
O	refused
O	to
O	wed
O	with
O	lord
O	or
O	noble
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	true
O	,
O	yet
O	the
O	broad
O	lands
O	,
O	the
O	ancient
O	castle
O	of
O	the
O	MacDonalds
O	,
O	might
O	please
O	her
O	fancy
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	Lady
O	of
O	Kingcaussie
O	determined
O	that
O	neither
O	for
O	land
O	nor
O	for
O	castle
O	should
O	bonnie
O	Lizzie
O	Lindsay
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	Highlands
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	saw
O	young
O	Donald
O	at
O	her
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	him
O	begging
O	leave
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	fair
O	city
O	of
O	Edinburgh
O	,

O	smiled
O	as
O	she
O	looked
O	into
O	his
O	eager
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	answered
O	slowly
O	,
O	'
O	My
O	son
O	,
O	ye
O	shall

O	to

O	her
O	eyes

O	bright

O	glad
O	,

O	weary
O	at

O	'
O	For
O	his
O	old
O	father
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	thought
O	that
O	no
O	maiden
O	could
O	refuse
O	to
O	love
O	his
O	bonny
O	self-willed
O	son
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	young
O	Donald
O	was
O	too
O	anxious
O	to
O	be
O	off
O	and
O	away
O	to
O	Edinburgh
O	to
O	be
O	grieved
O	to
O	go
O	as
O	a
O	simple
O	Highlander
O	.
O	Before
O	the
O	day
O	was
O	over

O	had
O	said

O	without
O	a
O	servant
O	to
O	follow
O	him
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	was
O	off
O	to
O	the
O	fair
O	city
O	of
O	Edinburgh
O	.
O	When
O	Donald
O	reached
O	Edinburgh
O	he
O	wondered
O	how
O	he
O	would
O	see
O	the
O	maiden
O	of
O	whose
O	beauty
O	and
O	of
O	whose
O	cleverness
O	he
O	had
O	so
O	often
O	heard
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	not
O	long
O	to
O	wait
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	scarce
O	been
O	a
O	day
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	that
O	a
O	great
O	ball
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	given
O	and
O	to
O	be
O	graced
O	by
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	the
O	fair
O	maiden
O	whom
O	he
O	hoped
O	to
O	win
O	as
O	his
O	bride
O	.
O	Donald
O	made
O	up
O	his
O	mind
O	that
O	he
O	too
O	would
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	ball
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	easy
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	do
O	this
O	,
O	as
O	there
O	were
O	many
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	who
O	knew
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	entered
O	the
O	ballroom
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	lords
O	and
O	nobles
O	were
O	dressed
O	in
O	suits
O	of
O	velvet
O	or
O	silk
O	and
O	satins
O	,
O	while

O	wore

O	kilt
O	of
O	rough
O	tartan
O	.
O	The
O	lords
O	and
O	ladies
O	too
O	stared
O	at
O	the
O	tall
O	handsome
O	young
O	Highlander
O	in
O	his
O	strange
O	garments
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	,
O	who
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	him
O	,
O	forgot
O	their
O	good
O	manners
O	and
O	smiled
O	and
O	nudged
O	each
O	other
O	as
O	he
O	passed
O	down
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	had
O	no
O	thought
O	to
O	spare
O	for
O	the
O	crowd
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	making
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	circle
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	which
O	stood
O	Lizzie
O	Lindsay
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	heard
O	too
O	often
O	of
O	the
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	it
O	was
O	she
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	his
O	eyes
O	fell
O	upon
O	her
O	face
O	.
O	Young
O	Donald
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	homespun
O	tartan
O	,
O	stood
O	on
O	the
O	outskirt
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	crowd
O	that
O	surrounded
O	her
O	,
O	listening
O	.
O	The
O	lords
O	in
O	their
O	gay
O	suits
O	were
O	doing
O	their
O	utmost
O	to
O	win
O	the
O	goodwill
O	of
O	the
O	maiden
O	,
O	but
O	their
O	flattery
O	and
O	foolish
O	words
O	seemed
O	to
O	give
O	her
O	little
O	pleasure
O	.
O	Indeed
O	she
O	was
O	too
O	used
O	to
O	them
O	to
O	find
O	them
O	aught
O	but
O	a
O	weariness
O	.
O	Soon
O	Donald
O	was
O	bowing
O	before
O	the
O	maiden
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	his
O	home
O	to
O	win
O	,
O	and
O	begging
O	her
O	to
O	dance
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	something
O	in
O	the
O	bright
O	eyes
O	and
O	gallant
O	bearing
O	of
O	young
O	Donald
O	pleased
O	the
O	petted
O	maiden
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	despite
O	his
O	rough
O	suit
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	nought
O	but
O	smiles
O	for
O	the
O	young
O	stranger
O	from
O	the
O	Highlands
O	.
O	The
O	lords
O	,
O	in
O	their
O	silks
O	and
O	velvets
O	,
O	opened
O	their
O	eyes
O	wide
O	in
O	astonishment
O	as
O	Lizzie
O	glided
O	past
O	them
O	with
O	young
O	Donald;
O	the
O	ladies
O	smiled
O	and
O	flouted
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	maiden
O	paid
O	no
O	heed
O	to
O	their
O	words
O	or
O	looks
O	.
O	Donald
O	was
O	not
O	flattering
O	her
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	used
O	to
O	be
O	flattered
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	telling
O	her
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	dwelt
O	.
O	And
O	Lizzie
O	as
O	she
O	listened
O	heard
O	the
O	hum
O	of
O	the
O	bees
O	,
O	smelt
O	the
O	fragrance
O	of
O	the
O	heather
O	.
O	Nay
O	,
O	she
O	even
O	forgot
O	the
O	ballroom
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	silent
O	moorland
O	or
O	climbing
O	the
O	steep
O	mountains
O	side
O	by
O	side
O	with
O	the
O	young
O	stranger
O	whose
O	face
O	was
O	so
O	eager
O	,
O	whose
O	eyes
O	were
O	so
O	bright
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	stooping
O	to
O	pluck
O	the
O	wildflowers
O	that
O	grew
O	in
O	the
O	nooks
O	of
O	some
O	sheltered
O	glen
O	,
O	or
O	she
O	was
O	kilting
O	her
O	dainty
O	gown
O	and
O	crossing
O	the
O	mountain
O	streamlets
O	,
O	and
O	ever
O	the
O	tall
O	,
O	young
O	stranger
O	was
O	by
O	her
O	side
O	.
O	Before
O	the
O	ball
O	was
O	over
O	Donald
O	knew
O	that
O	Lizzie
O	Lindsay
O	'
O	s
O	home
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	Canongate
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	begged
O	to
O	be
O	allowed
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	there
O	.
O	Lizzie
O	had
O	no
O	wish
O	to
O	lose
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	bright
O	young
O	Highlander
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	gaily
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	Canongate
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	welcome
O	,
O	both
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	her
O	dear
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	dance
O	ended
O	the
O	young
O	laird
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	lodgings
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	heart
O	was
O	light
O	and
O	his
O	dreams
O	glad
O	.
O	His
O	old
O	father
O	had
O	thought
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	in
O	Edinburgh
O	a
O	year
O	ere
O	he
O	won
O	his
O	bride
O	.
O	But
O	young
O	Donald
O	murmured
O	to
O	himself
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	scarce
O	be
O	twelve
O	long
O	months
O	before
O	he
O	was
O	back
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	Highlands
O	with
O	his
O	bonny
O	Lizzie
O	Lindsay
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	Donald
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	Canongate
O	betimes
O	,
O	and
O	Lizzie
O	welcomed
O	him
O	merrily
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	looked
O	in
O	kindly
O	fashion
O	at
O	the
O	young
O	stranger
O	,
O	for
O	indeed
O	Donald
O	had
O	the
O	gift
O	of
O	winning
O	hearts
O	.
O	But
O	neither
O	father
O	nor
O	mother
O	dreamed
O	that
O	the
O	country
O	clad
O	youth
O	would
O	win
O	their
O	beautiful
O	daughter
O	'
O	s
O	hand
O	,
O	for
O	had
O	she
O	not
O	refused
O	it
O	to
O	many
O	a
O	lordly
O	earl
O	and
O	noble
O	knight
O	.
O	Yet
O	the
O	more
O	Lizzie
O	heard
O	about
O	the
O	Highlands
O	,
O	the
O	more
O	she
O	longed
O	to
O	be
O	there
O	with
O	young
O	Donald
O	by
O	her
O	side
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	a
O	day
O	came
O	when
O	Donald
O	,
O	with
O	little
O	fear
O	and
O	much
O	hope
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	,
O	asked
O	the
O	maiden
O	if
O	she
O	would
O	go
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	Highlands
O	.
O	'
O	We
O	will
O	feed
O	on
O	curds
O	and
O	whey
O	,
O	'
O	cried
O	the
O	daring
O	young
O	Donald;
O	'
O	your
O	cheeks
O	will
O	grow
O	more
O	pink
O	,
O	and
O	your
O	brow
O	more
O	white
O	with
O	our
O	simple
O	fare
O	.
O	Your
O	bed
O	shall
O	be
O	made
O	on
O	the
O	fresh
O	green
O	bracken
O	and
O	my
O	plaid
O	shall
O	wrap
O	you
O	round
O	.
O	Will
O	ye
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	Highlands
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	Lizzie
O	Lindsay
O	?
O	'
O	Now
O	Lizzie
O	had
O	listened
O	to
O	young
O	Donald
O	'
O	s
O	words
O	with
O	joy
O	,
O	but
O	also
O	with
O	some
O	fear
O	.
O	Her
O	food
O	had
O	been
O	of
O	the
O	daintiest
O	,
O	her
O	bed
O	of
O	the
O	softest
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	young
O	stranger
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	indeed
O	scarce
O	a
O	stranger
O	now
O	,
O	had
O	,
O	it
O	seemed
O	,
O	but
O	little
O	to
O	offer
O	her
O	save
O	his
O	love
O	.
O	Yet
O	Lizzie
O	still
O	wished
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	Highlands
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	Dame
O	Lindsay
O	heard
O	what
O	young
O	Donald
O	had
O	said
O	she
O	hardened
O	her
O	heart
O	against
O	the
O	bonny
O	young
O	Highlander
O	.
O	'
O	Ye
O	shall
O	speak
O	no
O	more
O	to
O	my
O	daughter
O	,
O	'
O	she
O	cried
O	,
O	'
O	until
O	ye
O	have
O	told
O	me
O	where
O	your
O	home
O	is
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	many
O	broad
O	lands
O	are
O	your
O	own
O	?
O	'
O	For
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	the
O	old
O	dame
O	that
O	a
O	penniless
O	lad
O	would
O	never
O	dare
O	to
O	win
O	her
O	daughter
O	,
O	when
O	lords
O	and
O	nobles
O	had
O	wooed
O	her
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	But
O	Donald
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	was
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	seemed
O	to
O	feel
O	no
O	shame
O	as
O	he
O	answered
O	the
O	old
O	dame
O	bravely--
O	'
O	My
O	name

O	Donald

O	be
O	to

O	beautiful
O	daughter

O	Dame
O	Lindsay
O	could
O	scarce

O	had
O	heard
O	aright
O	.

O	daughter
O	marry
O	a
O	shepherd

O	,
O	that
O	should
O	never

O	indeed
O	the
O	lad
O	was
O	a
O	bonny
O	one
O	and
O	brave
O	.
O	Then
O	in
O	her
O	anger
O	she
O	bade
O	young
O	Donald
O	begone
O	.
O	'

O	she
O	cried
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	laird
O	turned
O	haughtily
O	on
O	his
O	heel
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	little
O	patience
O	,
O	nor
O	could
O	his
O	spirit
O	easily
O	brook
O	such
O	scorn
O	as

O	old
O	Dame
O	flung
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	turned
O	on
O	his
O	heel
