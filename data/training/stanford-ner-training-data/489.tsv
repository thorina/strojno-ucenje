O	A

O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	a
O	certain
O	lake
O	a
O	tribe
O	of
O	wicked

O	These
O	Indians
O	were
O	so
O	fierce
O	,
O	and
O	warlike
O	,
O	and
O	wasteful
O	,
O	they
O	went
O	about
O	destroying
O	everything
O	.
O	They
O	laid
O	low
O	a
O	tract
O	of
O	beautiful
O	forest
O	trees
O	,
O	for
O	no
O	good

O	.
O	They
O	tore
O	up
O	shrubs
O	and
O	plants
O	that
O	gave
O	them
O	food
O	and
O	medicine
O	.
O	They
O	shot
O	their
O	arrows
O	into
O	every
O	bird
O	or
O	animal
O	they
O	saw
O	,
O	just

O	.
O	The
O	great
O	trees--their
O	silent
O	brothers
O	of
O	the
O	wood--trembled
O	and
O	sighed
O	when
O	they
O	heard
O	these
O	Indians
O	coming
O	.
O	The
O	squirrels

O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	birds
O	flew
O	in
O	alarm
O	at

O	The
O	deer

O	ran
O	from
O	the
O	trail
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	became
O	very
O	angry
O	with
O	this
O	tribe
O	.
O	Always
O	he

O	never

O	The

O	The

O	One

O	,

O	lying
O	there
O	asleep
O	,

O	a
O	deep

O	sleep

O	Just

O	the
O	ice

O	gave
