O	Having
O	forgotten
O	my
O	former
O	perils
O	,
O	I
O	built
O	a
O	ship
O	at
O	my
O	own
O	expense
O	,
O	loaded
O	it
O	with
O	a
O	rich
O	cargo
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	taking
O	with
O	me
O	other
O	merchants
O	,
O	once
O	more
O	set
O	sail
O	.
O	We
O	were
O	much
O	driven
O	about
O	by
O	a
O	storm
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	landed
O	upon
O	a
O	desert
O	island
O	to
O	search
O	for
O	fresh
O	water
O	.
O	There
O	we
O	found
O	a
O	roc
O	'
O	s
O	egg
O	,
O	equal
O	in
O	size
O	to
O	the
O	one
O	I
O	had
O	seen
O	before
O	.
O	The
O	merchants
O	and
O	sailors
O	gathered
O	round
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	I
O	advised
O	them
O	not
O	to
O	meddle
O	with
O	it
O	,
O	they
O	nevertheless
O	made
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	it
O	with
O	their
O	hatchets
O	,
O	and
O	picked
O	out
O	the
O	young
O	roc
O	,
O	piece
O	after
O	piece
O	,
O	and
O	roasted
O	it
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	scarcely
O	finished
O	when
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	birds
O	appeared
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	.
O	We
O	hurried
O	on
O	board
O	ship
O	and
O	set
O	sail
O	,
O	but
O	had
O	not
O	gone
O	far
O	before
O	we
O	saw
O	the
O	immense
O	birds
O	approaching
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	after
O	they
O	hovered
O	over
O	the
O	ship
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	let
O	fall
O	an
O	enormous
O	fragment
O	of
O	stone
O	,
O	which
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	close
O	beside
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	other
O	let
O	fall
O	a
O	piece
O	which
O	split
O	our
O	ship
O	.
O	I
O	caught
O	hold
O	of
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	the
O	wreck
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	borne
O	by
O	the
O	wind
O	and
O	tide
O	to
O	an
O	island
O	,
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	very
O	steep
O	.
O	I
O	reached
O	the
O	dry
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	most
O	delicious
O	fruits
O	and
O	excellent
O	water
O	,
O	which
O	refreshed
O	me
O	.
O	Farther
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	feeble
O	old
O	man
O	sitting
O	near
O	a
O	rivulet
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	enquired
O	of
O	him
O	how
O	he
O	came
O	there
O	,
O	he
O	only
O	answered
O	by
O	signs
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	carry
O	him
O	over
O	the
O	rivulet
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	eat
O	some
O	fruit
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	him
O	on
O	my
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	crossed
O	the
O	brook
O	,
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	getting
O	down
O	,
O	he
O	clasped
O	his
O	legs
O	so
O	firmly
O	round
O	my
O	throat
O	that
O	I
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	strangle
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	soon
O	fainted
O	with
O	pain
O	and
O	fright
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	recovered
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	fellow
O	was
O	still
O	sitting
O	on
O	my
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	quickly
O	made
O	me
O	rise
O	up
O	and
O	walk
O	under
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	gathered
O	the
O	fruit
O	at
O	his
O	ease
O	.
O	This
O	lasted
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	while
O	carrying
O	him
O	about
O	,
O	I
O	picked
O	up
O	a
O	large
O	gourd
O	called
O	a
O	calabash
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	cleared
O	out
O	the
O	inside
O	,
O	I
O	pressed
O	into
O	it
O	the
O	juice
O	of
O	grapes
O	.
O	Having
O	filled
O	it
O	,
O	I
O	left
O	it
O	for
O	several
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	found
O	that
O	it
O	became
O	excellent
O	wine
O	.
O	I
O	drank
O	of
O	this
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	a
O	while
O	forgot
O	my
O	sorrows
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	with
O	cheerfulness
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	man
O	made
O	me
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	calabash
O	,
O	and
O	liking
O	the
O	flavor
O	of
O	the
O	wine
O	,
O	he
O	drank
O	it
O	off
O	,
O	soon
O	became
O	intoxicated
O	,
O	fell
O	from
O	my
O	shoulders
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	died
O	in
O	convulsions
O	.
O	I
O	hastened
O	to
O	the
O	seaside
O	,
O	and
O	presently
O	found
O	the
O	crew
O	of
O	a
O	ship
O	.
O	They
O	told
O	me
O	I
O	had
O	fallen
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	Old
O	Man
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	person
O	that
O	had
O	ever
O	escaped
O	.
O	I
O	sailed
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	when
O	we
O	landed
O	,
O	took
O	me
O	to
O	some
O	persons
O	whose
O	employment
O	was
O	to
O	gather
O	cocoanuts
O	.
O	We
O	all
O	took
O	up
O	stones
O	and
O	pelted
O	the
O	monkeys
O	that
O	were
O	at
O	the
O	very
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	cocoanut
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	these
O	animals
O	in
O	return
O	pelted
O	us
O	with
O	cocoanuts
O	.
O	When
O	we
O	had
O	obtained
O	as
O	many
O	as
O	we
O	could
O	carry
O	,
O	we
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	I
O	soon
O	obtained
O	a
O	considerable
O	sum
O	by
O	the
O	cocoanuts
O	I
O	thus
O	gathered
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	sailed
O	for
O	my
O	native
O	land
O	.
