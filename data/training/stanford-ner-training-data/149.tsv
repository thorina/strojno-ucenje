O	was
O	now
O	so

O	,
O	sometimes
O	,
O	to
O	carry
O	it
O	any
O	farther
O	.
O	But
O	his
O	limbs
O	were
O	strong
O	and
O	active
O	and
O	well
O	accustomed
O	to
O	exercise
O	.
O	He
O	walked
O	swiftly
O	along
O	,
O	thinking
O	of
O	King
O	Agenor
O	and
O	Queen
O	Telephassa
O	,
O	and

O	all

O	at

O	or
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	expected

O	see
O	them
O	any
O	more
O	.
O	Full
O	of
O	these
O	remembrances
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	within

O	of
O	a
O	lofty

O	,
O	which
O	the
O	people
O	thereabouts

O	On

O	was
O	the

O	Delphi
O	,
O	whither
O	Cadmus
O	was
O	going
O	.
O	This
O	Delphi
O	was

O	,
O	over
O	which
O	,
O	when

O	came
O	thither
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	rude
O	bower
O	of
O	branches
O	.
O	It
O	reminded
O	him
O	of

O	had
O	helped
O	to
O	build
O	for
O	Phoenix
O	and
O	Cilix
O	,
O	and
O	afterward
O	for
O	Thasus
O	.
O	In
O	later
O	times
O	,
O	when
O	multitudes
O	of

O	came
O	from
O	great
O	distances
O	to
O	put
O	questions
O	to
O	the
O	oracle
O	,
O	a
O	spacious
O	temple
O	of
O	marble
O	was
O	erected
O	over
O	the
O	spot
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	Cadmus
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	told
O	you
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	only
O	this
O	rustic
O	bower
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	abundance
O	of
O	green
O	foliage
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	tuft
O	of
O	shrubbery
O	,
O	that
O	ran
O	wild
O	over
O	the
O	mysterious
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	hillside
O	.
O	When
O	Cadmus
O	had
O	thrust
O	a
O	passage
O	through
O	the
O	tangled
O	boughs
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	into
O	the
O	bower
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	at
O	first
O	discern
O	the
O	half-hidden
O	cavity
O	.
O	But
O	soon
O	he
O	felt
O	a
O	cold
O	stream

O	air
O	rushing
O	out
O	of

O	,

O	force
O	that
O	it
O	shook

O	on

O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	hardly
O	had
O	time
O	to
O	swallow
O	.
O	But
O	Cadmus
O	was
O	so
O	enraged
O	at
O	the
O	destruction
O	of
O	his
O	friends
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	cared
O	neither
O	for
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	the
O	dragon
O	'
O	s
O	jaws
O	nor
O	for
O	his
O	hundreds
O	of
O	sharp
O	teeth
O	.
O	Drawing
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	he
O	rushed
O	at
O	the
O	monster
O	,
O	and
O	flung
O	himself
O	right
O	into
O	his
O	cavernous
O	mouth
O	.
O	This
O	bold
O	method
O	of
O	attacking
O	him
O	took
O	the
O	dragon
O	by
O	surprise;
O	for
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	Cadmus
O	had
O	leaped
O	so
O	far
O	down
O	into
O	his
O	throat
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	rows
O	of
O	terrible
O	teeth
O	could
O	not
O	close
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	nor
O	do
O	him
O	the
O	least
O	harm
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	struggle
O	was
O	a
O	tremendous
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	the
O	dragon
O	shattered
O	the
O	tuft
O	of
O	trees
O	into
O	small
O	splinters
O	by
O	the

O	,

O	before
O	the
O	scaly
O	wretch
O	bethought
O	himself
O	of
O	slipping
O	away
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	not
O	gone
O	his
O	length
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	brave
O	Cadmus
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	sword
O	thrust
O	that

O	of
O	the

O	wondering
O	what

O	He
O	had
O	waited

O	a
O	few

O	,
O	when
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	sight
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	as
O	great
O	a
O	marvel
O	as
O	the
O	most
O	marvellous
O	thing
O	I
O	ever
O	told
O	you
O	about
O	.
O	The
O	sun
O	was
O	shining
O	slantwise
O	over
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	all
O	the
O	moist
O	,
O	dark
O	soil
O	just
O	like
O	any
O	other
O	newly
O	planted
O	piece
O	of
O	ground
O	.
O	All
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	Cadmus
O	fancied
O	he
O	saw
O	something
O	glisten
O	very
O	brightly
O	,
O	first
O	at
O	one
O	spot
O	,
O	then
O	at
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	at
O	a
O	hundred
O	and
O	a
O	thousand
O	spots
O	together
O	.
O	Soon
O	he
O	perceived
O	them
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	steel
O	heads
O	of
O	spears
O	,
O	sprouting
O	up
O	everywhere
O	like
O	so
O	many
O	stalks
O	of
O	grain
O	,
O	and
O	continually
O	growing
O	taller
O	and
O	taller
O	.
O	Next
O	appeared
O	a
O	vast
O	number
O	of
O	bright
O	sword
O	blades
O	,
O	thrusting
O	themselves
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	way
O	.
O	A
O	moment
O	afterward
O	,
O	the
O	whole
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	ground
O	was
O	broken
O	up
O	by
O	a
O	multitude
O	of
O	polished
O	brass
O	helmets
O	,
O	coming
O	up
O	like
O	a
O	crop
O	of
O	enormous
O	beans
O	.
O	So
O	rapidly
O	did
O	they
O	grow
O	,
O	that
O	Cadmus
O	now

O	the
O	fierce

O	beneath
O	every
O	one
O	.
O	In
O	short
O	,

O	had
O	time
O	to
O	think
O	what
O	a
O	wonderful
O	affair
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	he
O	beheld
O	an
O	abundant
O	harvest
O	of
O	what
O	looked
O	like
O	human
O	beings
O	,
O	armed
O	with
O	helmets
O	and
O	breastplates
O	,
O	shields
O	,
O	swords
O	and
O	spears;
O	and
O	before
O	they
O	were
O	well
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	they
O	brandished
O	their
O	weapons
O	,
O	and
O	clashed
O	them
O	one
O	against
O	another
O	,
O	seeming
O	to
O	think
O	,
O	little
O	while
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	yet
O	lived
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	wasted
O	too
O	much
O	of

O	without
O	a

O	.
O	Every
O	tooth
O	of
O	the
O	dragon
O	had
O	produced
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	sons
O	of
O	deadly
O	mischief
O	.
O	Up
O	sprouted
O	,
O	also
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	trumpeters;
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	first
O	breath
O	that
O	they
O	drew
O	,
O	they
O	put
O	their
O	brazen
O	trumpets
O	to
O	their
O	lips
O	,
O	and
O	sounded
O	a
O	tremendous
O	and
O	ear-shattering
O	blast;
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	whole
O	space
O	,
O	just
O	now
O	so
O	quiet
O	and
O	solitary
O	,
O	reverberated
O	with
O	the
O	clash
O	and
O	clang
O	of
O	arms
O	,
O	the
O	bray
O	of
O	warlike
O	music
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	shouts
O	of
O	angry
O	men
O	.
O	So
O	enraged
O	did
O	they
O	all
O	look
O	,
O	that
O	Cadmus
O	fully
O	expected
O	them
O	to
O	put
O	the
