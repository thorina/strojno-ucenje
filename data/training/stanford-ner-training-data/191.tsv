O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	king
O	and
O	a
O	queen
O	who
O	grieved
O	sorely
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	no
O	children
O	.
O	When
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	queen
O	gave
O	birth
O	to
O	a
O	daughter
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	so
O	overjoyed
O	that
O	he
O	gave
O	a
O	great
O	christening
O	feast
O	,
O	the
O	like
O	of
O	which
O	had
O	never
O	before
O	been
O	known
O	.
O	He
O	asked
O	all
O	the
O	fairies
O	in
O	the
O	land--there
O	were
O	seven
O	all
O	told--to
O	stand
O	godmothers
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	princess
O	,
O	hoping
O	that
O	each
O	might
O	give
O	her
O	a
O	gift
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	she
O	should
O	have
O	all
O	imaginable
O	perfections
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	christening
O	,
O	all
O	the
O	company
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	where
O	a
O	great
O	feast
O	had
O	been
O	spread
O	for
O	the
O	fairy
O	godmothers
O	.
O	Before
O	each
O	was
O	set
O	a
O	magnificent
O	plate
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	gold
O	knife
O	and
O	a
O	gold
O	fork
O	studded
O	with
O	diamonds
O	and
O	rubies
O	.
O	Just
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	seating
O	themselves
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	there
O	entered
O	an
O	old
O	fairy
O	who
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	invited
O	because
O	more
O	than
O	fifty
O	years
O	ago
O	she
O	had
O	shut
O	herself
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	tower
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	supposed
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	either
O	dead
O	or
O	enchanted
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	ordered
O	a
O	cover
O	to
O	be
O	laid
O	for
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	a
O	massive
O	gold
O	one
O	like
O	the
O	others
O	,
O	for
O	only
O	seven
O	had
O	been
O	ordered
O	made
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	fairy
O	thought
O	herself
O	ill-used
O	and
O	muttered
O	between
O	her
O	teeth
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	fairies
O	,
O	overhearing
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	fancying
O	she
O	might
O	work
O	some
O	mischief
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	baby
O	,
O	went
O	and
O	hid
O	herself
O	behind
O	the
O	hangings
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	last
O	word
O	and
O	undo
O	any
O	harm
O	the
O	old
O	fairy
O	might
O	wish
O	to
O	work
O	.
O	The
O	fairies
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	endow
O	the
O	princess
O	.
O	The
O	youngest
O	,
O	for
O	her
O	gift
O	,
O	decreed
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	be
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	person
O	in
O	the
O	world;
O	the
O	next
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	have
O	the
O	mind
O	of
O	an
O	angel;
O	the
O	third
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	be
O	perfectly
O	graceful;
O	the
O	fourth
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	dance
O	admirably
O	well;
O	the
O	fifth
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	sing
O	like
O	a
O	nightingale;
O	the
O	sixth
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	play
O	charmingly
O	upon
O	every
O	musical
O	instrument
O	.
O	The
O	turn
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	fairy
O	had
O	now
O	come
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	declared
O	,
O	while
O	her
O	head
O	shook
O	with
O	malice
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	princess
O	should
O	pierce
O	her
O	hand
O	with
O	a
O	spindle
O	and
O	die
O	of
O	the
O	wound
O	.
O	This
O	dreadful
O	fate
O	threw
O	all
O	the
O	company
O	into
O	tears
O	of
O	dismay
O	,

O	castle
O	above
O	the
O	tops
O	of
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	what
O	castle
O	that
O	was
O	.
O	All
O	manner
O	of
O	answers
O	were
O	given
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	One
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	an
O	enchanted
O	castle
O	,
O	another
O	that
O	witches
O	lived
O	there
O	,
O	but
O	most
O	believed
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	occupied
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	ogre
O	which
O	carried
O	thither
O	all
O	the
O	children
O	he
O	could
O	catch
O	and
O	ate
O	them

O	""""
O	The
O	young
O	prince
O	at
O	these
O	words
O	felt
O	himself
O	on
O	fire
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	not
O	a
O	moment's
O	doubt
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	destined
O	to
O	this
O	great
O	adventure
O	,
O	and
O	full
O	of
O	ardour
O	he
O	determined
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	set
O	out
O	for
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	Scarcely
O	had
O	he
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	wood
O	when
O	all
O	the
O	trees
O	and
O	thorns
O	which
O	had
O	made
O	such
O	an
O	impenetrable
O	thicket
O	opened
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	to
O	offer
O	him
O	a
O	path
O	.
O	He
O	walked
O	toward
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	which
O	appeared
O	now
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	a
O	long
O	avenue
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	turned
O	to
O	,
O	look
O	for
O	his
O	followers
O	not
O	one
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen;
O	the
O	woods
O	had
O	closed
O	instantly
O	upon
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	passed
O	through
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	entirely
O	alone
O	,
O	and
O	utter
O	silence
O	was
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	entered
O	a
O	large
O	forecourt
O	and
O	stood
O	still
O	with
O	amazement
O	and
O	awe
O	.
O	On
O	every
O	side
O	were
O	stretched
O	the
O	bodies
O	of
O	men
O	and
O	animals
O	apparently
O	lifeless
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	faces
O	of
O	the
O	men
O	were
O	rosy
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	goblets
O	by
O	them
O	had
O	a
O	few
O	drops
O	of
O	wine
O	left
O	.
O	The
O	men
O	had
O	plainly
O	fallen
O	asleep
O	.
O	His
O	steps
O	resounded
O	as
O	he
O	passed
O	over
O	the
O	marble
O	pavement
O	and
O	up
O	the
O	marble
O	staircase
O	.
O	He
O	entered
O	the
O	guard-room;
O	there
O	the
O	guards
O	stood
O	drawn
O	up
O	in
O	line
O	with
O	carbines
O	at
O	their
O	shoulders
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	sound
O	asleep
O	.
O	He
O	passed
O	through
O	one
O	apartment
O	after
O	another
O	,
O	where
O	were
O	ladies
O	and
O	gentlemen
O	asleep
O	in
O	their
O	chairs
O	or
O	standing
O	.
O	He
O	entered
O	a
O	chamber
O	covered
O	with
O	gold
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	on
O	a
O	bed
O	,
O	the
O	curtains
O	of
O	which
O	were
O	drawn
O	,
O	the
O	most
O	lovely
O	sight
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	looked
O	upon--a
O	princess
O	,
O	who
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	about
O	fifteen
O	or
O	sixteen
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	fair
O	that
O	she
O	seemed
O	to
O	belong
O	to
O	another
O	world
O	.
O	He
O	drew
O	near
O	,
O	trembling
O	and
O	wondering
O	,
O	and
O	knelt
O	beside
O	her
O	.
O	Her
O	hand
O	lay
O	upon
O	her
O	breast
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	touched
O	his
O	lips
O	to
O	it
O	.
O	At
O	that
O	moment
O	,
O	the
O	enchantment
O	being
O	ended
O	,
O	the
O	princess
O	awoke
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	looking
O	drowsily
O	and
O	tenderly
O	at
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	said:
O	"""Have"
O	you
O	come
O	,
O	my
O	prince
O	?
O	I
O	have
O	waited
O	long
O	for
O	you
O	.
O	""""
O	The
O	prince
O	was
O	overjoyed
O	at
O	the
O	words
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	tender
O	voice
O	and
O	look
O	,
O	and
O	scarcely
O	knew
O	how
O	to
O	speak
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	managed
O	to
O	assure
O	her
O	of
O	his
O	love
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	soon
O	forgot
O	all
O	else
O	as
O	they
O	talked
O	and
O	talked
O	.
O	They
O	talked
O	for
O	four
O	hours
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	not
O	then
O	said
O	half
O	that
O	was
O	in
O	their
O	heads
O	to
O	say
O	.
O	Meanwhile
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	had
O	been
O	wakened
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	moment
O	as
O	the
O	princess
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	now
O	extremely
O	hungry
O	.
O	The
O	lady-in-waiting
O	became
O	very
O	impatient
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	announced
O	to
O	the
O	princess
O	that
O	they
O	all
O	waited
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	prince
O	took
O	the
O	princess
O	by
O	the
O	hand;
O	she
O	was
O	dressed
O	in
O	great
O	splendour
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	hint
O	that
O	she
O	looked
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	pictures
O	of
O	his
O	great-grandmother
O	look;
O	he
O	thought
O	her
O	all
O	the
O	more
O	charming
O	for
O	that
O	.
O	They
O	passed
O	into
O	a
O	hall
O	of
O	mirrors
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	supped
O	,
O	attended
O	by
O	the
O	officers
O	of
O	the
O	princess
O	.
O	The
O	violins
O	and
O	haut-boys
O	played
O	old
O	but
O	excellent
O	pieces
O	of
O	music
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	supper
O	,
O	to
O	lose
O	no
O	time
O	,
O	the
O	grand
O	almoner
O	married
O	the
O	royal
O	lovers
O	in
O	the
O	chapel
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	left
O	the
O	castle
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	prince's
O	home
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	followed
O	by
O	all
O	the
O	retinue
O	of
O	the
O	princess
O	.
O	They
O	marched
O	down
O	the
O	long
O	avenue
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wood
O	opened
O	again
O	to
O	let
O	them
O	pass
O	.
O	Outside
O	they
O	met
O	the
O	prince's
O	followers
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	overjoyed
O	to
O	see
O	their
O	master
O	.
O	He
O	turned
O	to
O	show
O	them
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	but
O	behold
O	!
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	castle
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	wood;
O	castle
O	and
O	wood
O	had
O	vanished
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	prince
O	and
O	princess
O	went
O	gayly
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	old
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	died
O	they
O	reigned
O	in
O	their
O	stead
O	.
