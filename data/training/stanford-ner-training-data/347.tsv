O	For
O	many
O	days
O	after
O	he
O	bad
O	left
O	the
O	hermitage
O	,
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	rode
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	no
O	such
O	adventures
O	as
O	had
O	befallen
O	him
O	on
O	other
O	quests
O	to
O	the
O	increase
O	of
O	his
O	fame
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	one
O	night-tide
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	shores
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	water
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	sleep;
O	but
O	as
O	he
O	slept
O	,
O	a
O	voice
O	called
O	on
O	him:
O	"""Launcelot"
O	,
O	arise
O	,
O	put
O	on
O	thine
O	armor
O	and
O	go
O	on
O	thy
O	way
O	until
O	thou
O	comest
O	to
O	a
O	ship
O	.
O	Into
O	that
O	thou
O	shalt
O	enter
O	.
O	""""
O	Immediately
O	,
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	started
O	from
O	his
O	sleep
O	to
O	obey
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	riding
O	along
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	came
O	presently
O	to
O	a
O	ship
O	beached
O	on
O	the
O	strand;
O	no
O	sooner
O	had
O	he
O	entered
O	it
O	,
O	than
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	launched--how
O	,
O	he
O	might
O	not
O	know
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	ship
O	sailed
O	before
O	the
O	wind
O	for
O	many
O	a
O	day
O	.
O	No
O	mortal
O	was
O	on
O	it
O	,
O	save
O	only
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	yet
O	were
O	all
O	his
O	needs
O	supplied
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	the
O	ship
O	ran
O	ashore
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	castle;
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	midnight
O	.
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	waited
O	not
O	for
O	the
O	dawn
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	his
O	sword
O	gripped
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	sprang
O	ashore
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	right
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	postern
O	where
O	the
O	gate
O	stood
O	open
O	indeed
O	,
O	but
O	two
O	grisly
O	lions
O	kept
O	the
O	way
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	would
O	have
O	rushed
O	upon
O	the
O	great
O	beasts
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	struck
O	from
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	voice
O	said:
O	"""Ah"
O	!
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	ever
O	is
O	thy
O	trust
O	in
O	thy
O	might
O	rather
O	than
O	thy
O	Maker
O	!
O	""""
O	Sore
O	ashamed
O	,
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	took
O	his
O	sword
O	and
O	thrust
O	it
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	sheath
O	,
O	and
O	going
O	forward
O	,
O	he
O	passed
O	unhurt
O	through
O	the
O	gateway
O	,
O	the
O	lions
O	that
O	kept
O	it
O	falling
O	back
O	from
O	his
O	path
O	.
O	So
O	without
O	more
O	adventure
O	,
O	Launcelot
O	entered
O	into
O	the
O	castle;
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	saw
O	how
O	every
O	door
O	stood
O	open
O	,
O	save
O	only
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	was
O	fast
O	barred
O	,
O	nor
O	,
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	force
O	,
O	might
O	he
O	open
O	it
O	.
O	Presently
O	from
O	the
O	chamber
O	within
O	came
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	a
O	sweet
O	voice
O	in
O	a
O	holy
O	chant
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	Launcelot
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	kneeling
O	humbly
O	,
O	he
O	prayed
O	that
O	to
O	him
O	might
O	be
O	shown
O	some
O	vision
O	of
O	that
O	he
O	sought
O	.
O	Forthwith
O	the
O	door
O	flew
O	open
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	chamber
O	blazed
O	a
O	light
O	such
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	known
O	before;
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	made
O	to
O	enter
O	,
O	a
O	voice
O	cried:
O	"""Launcelot"
O	,
O	forbear
O	,
O	""""
O	and
O	sorrowfully
O	he
O	withdrew
O	.
O	Then
O	where
O	he
O	knelt
O	,
O	far
O	even
O	from
O	the
O	threshold
O	of
O	the
O	wondrous
O	room
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	silver
O	table
O	and
O	,
O	on
O	it
O	,
O	covered
O	with
O	red
O	samite
O	,
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	.
O	At
O	sight
O	of
O	that
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	sought
O	so
O	long
O	,
O	his
O	joy
O	became
O	so
O	great
O	that
O	,
O	unmindful
O	of
O	the
O	warning
O	,
O	he
O	advanced
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	and
O	drew
O	nigh
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	table
O	itself
O	.
O	Then
O	on
O	the
O	instant
O	there
O	burst
O	between
O	him
O	and
O	it
O	a
O	blaze
O	of
O	light
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	lay
O	,
O	nor
O	might
O	he
O	move
O	nor
O	utter
O	any
O	sound;
O	only
O	he
O	was
O	aware
O	of
O	hands
O	busy
O	about
O	him
O	which
O	bore
O	him
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	chamber
O	.
O	For
O	four-and-twenty
O	days
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	lay
O	as
O	in
O	a
O	trance
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	that
O	time
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	those
O	about
O	him
O	that
O	had
O	tended
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	swoon
O	.
O	These
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	fresh
O	raiment
O	,
O	brought
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	aged
O	king--Pelles
O	was
O	his
O	name--that
O	owned
O	that
O	castle
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	entertained
O	him
O	right
O	royally
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	of
O	the
O	fame
O	of
O	Sir
O	Launcelot;
O	and
O	long
O	he
O	talked
O	with
O	him
O	of
O	his
O	quest
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	knights
O	who
O	followed
O	it
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	age
O	and
O	knew
O	much
O	of
O	men
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	four
O	days
O	he
O	spoke
O	to
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	bidding
O	him
O	return
O	to
O	Arthur's
O	court:
O	"""For"
O	,
O	""""
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	"""your"
O	quest
O	is
O	ended
O	here
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	that
O	ye
O	shall
O	see
O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	ye
O	have
O	seen
O	.
O	""""
O	So
O	Launcelot
O	rode
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	,
O	grieving
O	for
O	the
O	sin
O	that
O	hindered
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	perfect
O	vision
O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	,
O	but
O	thanking
O	God
O	for
O	that
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	.
O	So
O	in
O	time
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	Camelot
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	to
O	Arthur
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	befallen
O	him
O	.
