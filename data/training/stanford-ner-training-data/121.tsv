O	in

O	of
O	Greece
O	,
O	and
O	whose
O	followers
O	are
O	those
O	men
O	in
O	veils
O	of
O	blue
O	and

O	beat

O	and
O	create
O	a

O	Aristæus
O	was
O	a
O	shepherd
O	,
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	Cyrene
O	,
O	a
O	water
O	nymph
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	him
O	there
O	had
O	come
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	wild
O	bees
O	humming
O	amongst
O	the
O	wild
O	thyme
O	,
O	the
O	great
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	conquer
O	these
O	busy
O	workers
O	and
O	make
O	their
O	toil
O	his
O	gain
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	that
O	hollow
O	trees
O	or
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	a
O	rock
O	were
O	used
O	as
O	the
O	storage
O	houses
O	of
O	their
O	treasure
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	the
O	wily
O	shepherd
O	lad
O	provided
O	for
O	them
O	the
O	homes
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	covet
O	,
O	and
O	near
O	them
O	placed
O	all
O	the
O	food
O	that
O	they
O	most
O	desired
O	.
O	Soon
O	Aristæus
O	became
O	noted
O	as
O	a
O	tamer
O	of
O	bees
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	in
O	Olympus
O	they
O	spoke
O	of
O	his
O	honey
O	as
O	a
O	thing
O	that
O	was
O	food
O	for
O	the
O	gods
O	.
O	All
O	might
O	have
O	gone
O	well
O	with
O	Aristæus
O	had
O	there
O	not
O	come
O	for
O	him
O	the
O	fateful
O	day
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	beautiful
O	Eurydice
O	and
O	to
O	her
O	lost
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	She
O	fled
O	before
O	the
O	fiery
O	protestations
O	of
O	his
O	love
O	,
O	and
O	trod
O	upon
O	the
O	serpent
O	whose
O	bite
O	brought
O	her
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	Shades
O	.
O	The
O	gods
O	were
O	angry
O	with
O	Aristæus
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	punishment
O	they
O	slew
O	his
O	bees

O	His
