O	to

O	an
O	easy

O	seeing
O	that

O	any

O	where
O	a

O	While

O	came
O	a

O	And
O	because

O	,

O	ready
O	,
O	at
O	daybreak
O	they

O	down
O	to
O	the

O	.
O	A
O	ford
O	there

O	as
O	a
O	man
O	would
O	choose
O	save
O	in
O	the
O	greatest
O	need

O	The
O	King
O	,
O	having
O	with
O	him
O	the
O	main
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	army
O	,
O	crossed
O	amidst
O	a
O	great
O	sounding
O	of
O	horns
O	and
O	trumpets
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	noble
O	sight
O	to
O	see
O	,
O	and
O	nothing
O	in
O	it
O	nobler
O	and
O	more
O	admirable
O	than
O	the
O	King
O	himself
O	.
O	A
O	fairer
O	knight
O	there
O	never
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	stood
O	with
O	a
O	gilded
O	helmet
O	on
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	long
O	German
O	sword
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	being
O	by
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	shoulders
O	taller
O	than
O	the
O	crowd
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	knights
O	charged
O	the
O	Saracens
O	,
O	who
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	had
O	taken
O	a
O	stand
O	again
O	on
O	the
O	river
O	bank
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	feat
O	of
O	arms
O	.
O	No
O	man
O	drew
O	long-bow
O	that
O	day
O	or
O	plied
O	cross-bow
O	.
O	The
O	Crusaders
O	and
O	the
O	Saracens
O	fought
O	with
O	mace
O	and
O	sword
O	,
O	neither
O	keeping
O	their
O	ranks
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	being
O	confused
O	together
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	Crusaders
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	their
O	valour
O	,
O	could
O	scarce
O	hold
O	their
O	own
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	enemy
O	outnumbered
O	them
O	by
O	much
O	.
O	Also
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	division
O	of
O	counsel
O	among
O	them
O	.
O	Also
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	messenger
O	from
O	them
O	that
O	were
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	Mansoura
O	,
O	telling
O	the
O	King
O	how
O	hard
O	pressed
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	what
O	instant
O	need
O	of
O	succour
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	the
O	Sacarens
O	grew
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	confident
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	greatly
O	the
O	better
O	in
O	numbers;
O	and
O	if
O	,
O	man
O	for
O	man
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	matter
O	of
O	arms
O	and
O	armour
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	scarce
O	equal
O	to
O	the
O	Crusaders
O	,
O	yet
O	the
O	difference
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	great
O	.
O	They
O	pushed
O	on
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	and
O	drove
O	the
O	Christians
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	river
O	.
O	These
O	were
O	very
O	hard
O	pressed
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	were
O	for
O	swimming
O	across
O	the
O	river
O	to
O	the
O	camp
O	,
O	but
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	their
O	horses
O	were
O	weary
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	a
O	few
O	perished
O	by
O	drowning
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	as
O	time
O	passed
O	the
O	Crusaders
O	fared
O	somewhat
O	better
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	drew
O	more
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	enemy
O	,
O	seeing
O	that
O	they
O	still
O	held
O	their
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	being
O	themselves
O	not
O	a
O	little
O	weary
O	,
O	drew
O	back
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	end
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	such
O	of
O	the
O	chiefs
O	as
O	were
O	left
O	got
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	camp
O	.
O	Right
O	glad
O	they
O	were
O	to
O	rest
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	battle
O	had
O	been
O	long
O	and
O	fierce
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	had
O	but
O	little
O	peace
O	,
O	for
O	that
O	very
O	night
O	the
O	Saracens
O	made
O	an
O	attack
O	upon
O	the
O	camp
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	disturbance
O	they
O	made
O	,
O	and
O	most
O	unwelcome
O	to
O	men
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	fighting
O	all
O	the
O	day
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	work
O	much
O	harm
O	.
O	Many
O	valiant
O	deeds
O	were
O	done
O	by
O	the
O	Christians
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	Saracens
O	were
O	making
O	ready
O	for
O	attacking
O	the
O	camp
O	with
O	more
O	force
O	than
O	before
O	.
O	And
O	their
O	leader
O	could
O	be
O	seen
O	from
O	the
O	camp
O	,
O	taking
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	Crusaders
O	,
O	and
O	strengthening
O	his
O	battalions
O	where
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	the
O	King's
O	camp
O	might
O	be
O	most
O	conveniently
O	assailed
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	attack
O	was
O	made
O	on
O	the
O	Count
O	of
O	Anjou
O	.
O	He
O	held
O	that
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	camp
O	that
O	was
O	nearest
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Cairo
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	enemy
O	were
O	on
O	horseback
O	and
O	some
O	on
O	foot;
O	there
O	were
O	some
O	also
O	that
O	threw
O	Greek
O	fire
O	among
O	the
O	count's
O	men
O	.
O	Between
O	them
O	they
O	pressed
O	the
O	count
O	so
O	sorely
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	fain
O	to
O	send
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	for
O	help
O	.
O	This
O	the
O	King
O	gave
O	without
O	loss
O	of
O	time;
O	he
O	led
O	the
O	men
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	they
O	chased
O	the
O	Saracens
O	from
O	this
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	battle
O	was
O	over
O	the
O	King
O	called
O	the
O	barons
O	to
O	his
O	tent
O	,
O	and
O	thanked
O	them
O	for
O	all
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	done
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	them
O	great
O	encouragement
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	driven
O	back
O	the
O	Saracens
O	over
O	and
O	again
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	,
O	beyond
O	doubt
O	,
O	go
O	well
O	with
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	end
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	the
O	army
O	was
O	sore
O	distressed
O	for
O	want
O	both
O	of
O	food
O	and
O	of
O	water
O	.
O	In
O	Damietta
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	yet
O	stores
O	of
O	barley
O	,
O	rice
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	grains;
O	but
O	in
O	the
O	camp
O	scarce
O	anything
O	that
O	could
O	be
O	eaten
O	.
O	Some
O	small
O	fishes
O	were
O	caught
O	in
O	the
O	river;
O	but
O	these
O	were
O	very
O	ill
O	savoured
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	more
O	so--so
O	,
O	at
O	least
O	,
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	such
O	as
O	eat
O	them
O	under
O	constraint
O	of
O	hunger--because
O	they
O	fed
O	on
O	dead
O	bodies
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	many
O	were
O	thrown
O	into
O	the
O	river
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	while
O	some
O	portion
O	of
O	the
O	stores
O	that
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	were
O	carried
O	across
O	the
O	river
O	to
O	the
O	camp
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	the
O	Saracens
O	hindered
O	,
O	for
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	their
O	ships
O	had
O	the
O	mastery
O	over
O	the
O	ships
O	of
O	the
O	Christians
O	.
O	They
O	kept
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	suffering
O	nothing
O	to
O	pass
O	.
O	If
O	anything
O	was
O	carried
O	across
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	but
O	a
O	trifle
O	.
O	Some
O	things
O	the
O	country
O	people
O	brought
O	into
O	the
O	camp
O	,
O	but
O	these
O	were
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	purchased
O	save
O	for
O	large
O	sums
O	of
O	money
O	,
O	and
O	money
O	was
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	scarce
O	even
O	among
O	the
O	richer
O	sort
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	judged
O	expedient
O	that
O	the
O	King's
O	army
O	should
O	cross
O	the
O	river
O	again
O	and
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	camp
O	,
O	things
O	were
O	worse
O	rather
O	than
O	better
O	,
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	victuals
O	were
O	concerned
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	well
O	that
O	the
O	army
O	should
O	be
O	brought
O	together
O	,
O	both
O	for
O	attack
O	and
O	for
O	defence
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	the
O	greater
O	multitude
O	the
O	famine
O	grew
O	worse
O	and
O	worse
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	while
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	treating
O	for
O	peace
O	between
O	the

O	as
O	man
O	could
O	be
O	,
O	drinking
O	,
O	for
O	example
O	,
O	but
O	one
O	cup
O	of
O	wine
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	largely
O	mingled
O	with
O	water
O	.
O	In
O	all
O	things
O	wherein
O	great
O	men
O	ofttimes
O	offend
O	he
O	was
O	wholly
O	blameless
O	and
O	beyond
O	reproach
O	.
O	Of
O	all
O	men
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	any
O	knowledge
O	of
O	,
O	whether
O	by
O	sight
O	or
O	by
O	hearing
O	,
O	in
O	this
O	business
O	of
O	the
O	Crusades
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	one
O	who
O	could
O	be
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	named
O	in
O	comparison
O	with
O	King
O	Louis
O	.
O	To
O	King
O	Louis
O	religion
O	was
O	as
O	life
O	itself
O	.
O	It
O	filled
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	,
O	his
O	whole
O	soul;
O	he
O	judged
O	of
O	all
O	things
O	by
O	it;
O	he
O	hungered
O	and
O	thirsted
O	after
O	it
O	.
O	And
O	yet
O	of
O	all
O	who
O	bore
O	the
O	cross
O	this
O	man
O	,
O	being
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	so
O	much
O	the
O	most
O	faithful
O	to
O	his
O	vow
O	,
O	by
O	far
O	the
O	truest
O	cross-bearer
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	yet
O	failed
O	the
O	most
O	utterly
O	.
O	Of
O	such
O	things
O	I
O	have
O	not
O	the
O	wit
O	to
O	judge;
O	yet
O	this
O	,
O	methinks
O	,
O	is
O	manifest
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	Kingdom
O	of
O	God
O	is
O	not
O	set
O	forward
O	by
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	armies
O	.
O	I
O	do
O	believe
O	that
O	if
O	King
O	Louis
O	,
O	being
O	what
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	a
O	man
O	after
O	God's
O	own
O	heart
O	,
O	had
O	come
O	,
O	not
O	with
O	the
O	sword
O	,
O	but
O	preaching
O	the
O	truth
O	by
O	his
O	life
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	more
O	for
O	the
O	cause
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	at
O	heart
O	.
O	As
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	he
O	furthered
O	it
O	not
O	at
O	all
O	,
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	I
O	can
O	discern
O	,
O	but
O	rather
O	set
O	it
O	back
O	.
O	That
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	gain
O	for
O	Christendom
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	a
O	single
O	foot
O	of
O	earth
O	is
O	not
O	so
O	much
O	to
O	be
O	lamented
O	,
O	as
O	that
O	he
O	made
O	wider
O	the
O	breach
O	between
O	Christian
O	men
O	and
O	the
O	followers
O	of
O	Mahomet
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	he
O	did
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	very
O	truth
O	the
O	most
O	Christlike
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	men
O	that
O	I
O	have
O	ever
O	seen
O	.
