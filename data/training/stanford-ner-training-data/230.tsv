O	There
O	was
O	an

O	man
O	living
O	in
O	the
O	depth
O	of
O	a
O	forest
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	grandson
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	in
O	charge
O	when
O	quite
O	an
O	infant
O	.
O	The
O	child
O	had
O	no
O	parents
O	,
O	brothers
O	,
O	or
O	sisters;
O	they
O	had
O	all
O	been
O	destroyed
O	by
O	six
O	large
O	giants
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	informed
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	other
O	relative
O	living
O	beside
O	his
O	grandfather
O	.
O	The
O	band
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	belonged
O	had
O	put
O	up
O	their
O	children
O	on
O	a
O	wager
O	in
O	a
O	race
O	against
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	thus
O	lost
O	them
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	an
O	old
O	tradition
O	in
O	the
O	tribe
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	produce
O	a
O	great
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	would
O	wear
O	a
O	white
O	feather
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	would
O	astonish
O	every
O	one
O	by
O	his
O	feats
O	of
O	skill
O	and
O	bravery
O	.
O	The
O	grandfather
O	,
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	child
O	could
O	play
O	about
O	,
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	bow
O	and
O	arrows
O	to
O	amuse
O	himself
O	with
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	woods
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	rabbit;
O	but
O	not
O	knowing
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	he
O	ran
O	home
O	and
O	described
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	grandfather
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	him
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	its
O	flesh
O	was
O	good
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	shoot
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	arrows
O	into
O	its
O	body
O	he
O	would
O	kill
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	went
O	out
O	again
O	and
O	brought
O	home
O	the
O	little
O	animal
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	asked
O	his
O	grandfather
O	to
O	boil
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	feast
O	on
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	humored
O	the
O	boy
O	in
O	this
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	encouraged
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	in
O	acquiring
O	the
O	knowledge
O	of
O	hunting
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	could
O	kill
O	deer
O	and
O	the
O	larger
O	kinds
O	of
O	game;
O	and
O	he
O	became
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	grew
O	up
O	,
O	an
O	expert
O	hunter
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	lived
O	alone
O	,
O	and
O	away
O	from
O	other
O	Indians
O	,
O	the
O	curiosity
O	of
O	the

O	was
O	excited
O	to
O	know
O	what
O	was
O	passing
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	a
O	prairie
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	saw
O	ashes
O	like
O	those
O	at
O	his
O	grandfather
O	'
O	s
O	lodge
O	,
O	and
O	lodge-poles
O	left
O	standing
O	.
O	He
O	returned
O	,
O	and
O	inquired
O	whether
O	his
O	grandfather
O	had
O	put
O	up
O	the
O	poles
O	and
O	made
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	answered
O	,
O	No
O	.
O	Nor
O	did
O	he
O	believe
O	that
O	he
O	had

O	any

O	.
O	Tying
O	it
O	to

O	he
O	hastened
O	home
O	,
O	shouting
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	,
O	and
O	brandishing
O	the

O	he
O	reached
O	home
O	he
O	threw

O	the
O	custom
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	door

O	lodge
O	before
O	he
O	entered
O	.
O	After
O	being
O	seated
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	a
O	dry
O	cough
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	his
O	wife
O	bring
O	in
O	his
O	hunting
O	girdle
O	.
O	She
O	made
O	dispatch
O	to
O	obey

O	girdle
O	,
O	with
O	nothing
O	tied

O	finding
O	that
O	his
O	method
O	of
O	catching
O	beavers
O	had
O	been
O	discovered
O	,
O	went
O	to
O	a
O	wood
O	at
O	some
O	distance
O	,
O	and
O	broke
O	off
O	a
O	charred
O	limb
O	from
O	a
O	burned
O	tree
O	,
O	which
O	instantly
O	became
O	a
O	bear
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	,
O	who
O	appeared
O	to
O	have
O	lost
O	faith
O	in
O	his
O	hulla-balooing
O	,
O	had
O	again
O	watched
O	him
O	,
O	did
O	exactly
O	as
O	the
O	dog
O	had
O	done
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	a
O	bear

O	And
O	so
O	it
O	happened

O	.
O	Whatever

O	dog
O	undertook
O	,
O	prospered;
O	whatever

O	attempted

O	.
O	Every
O	day
O	the
O	youngest

O	had
O	reason
O	to
O	be
O	more
O	proud
O	of
O	the
O	poor
O	dog
O	she
O	had

O	and
O	every
O	day

O	aware
O	,

O	plume
O	were
O	not
O	the

O	noisy
O	giant
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	giant
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	determined
O	that

O	would
O	go
O	to
O	her
O	father
O	and
O	make
O	known
O	to
O	him
O	what
O	a
O	valuable
O	husband
O	she
O	had
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	he
O	furnished
O	her
O	lodge
O	with
O	a
O	great

O	of
O	sticks

O	,
O	which
O	he
O	would
O	pass
O	upon
O	her
O	for
O	bear
O	and

O	.
O	So
O	,

O	halloo
O	had
O	now
O	died
O	away
O	to
O	a
O	feeble

O	,
O	had
O	started
O	for
O	the
O	hunt
O	,
O	she
O	set
O	out
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	these
O	two
O	had
O	gone
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	neighborhood
O	,
O	the
O	dog
O	made
O	signs
O	to
O	his
O	mistress
O	to
O	sweat
O	him
O	after
O	the
O	manner
O	of
O	the
O	Indians
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	always
O	been
O	a
O	good
O	dog
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	willing
O	to
O	oblige
O	him
O	.
O	She
O	accordingly
O	made
O	a
O	lodge
O	just
O	large
O	enough
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	creep
O	in
O	.
O	She
O	then
O	put
O	in
O	heated
O	stones
O	,
O	and
O	poured
O	water
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	which
O	raised
O	a
O	vapor
O	that
O	filled
O	the
O	lodge
O	and
O	searched
O	with
O	its
O	warmth
O	to
O	the
O	very
O	heart
O	'
O	s
O	core
O	of
O	the
O	enchanted

O	.
O	When

O	been
O	kept
O	up
O	for
O	the
O	customary
O	time
O	,
O	the
O	enchanted
O	dog
O	was
O	completely
O	sweated
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	stead
O	,
O	as
O	might
O	have
O	been
O	expected
O	,
O	out
O	came
O	a
O	very
O	handsome
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	unhappily
O	,
O	without
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	speech
O	.
O	In
O	taking
O	away
O	the
O	dog
O	,
O	it
O	appears
O	that
O	the
O	sweating-lodge
O	had
O	also
O	carried
O	off
O	the
O	voice
O	with
O	it
O	.
O	Meantime
O	the
O	elder
O	sister
O	had
O	reached
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	much
O	circumstance
O	and
O	a
O	very
O	long
O	face
O	,
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	how
O	that
O	her
O	sister
O	was
O	supporting
O	an
O	idle
O	dog
O	,
O	and
O	entertaining
O	him
O	as
O	her
O	husband
O	.
O	In
O	her
O	anxiety
O	to
O	make
O	known
O	her
O	sister
O	'
O	s
O	affairs
O	and
O	the
O	great
O	scandal
O	she
O	was
O	bringing
O	upon
O	the
O	family
O	,
O	the
O	eldest
O	forgot
O	to
O	say
O	any
O	thing
O	of
O	the
O	sticks
O	and
O	stones
O	which
O	her
O	own
O	husband
O	brought
O	home
O	for
O	bears
O	and
O	beavers
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	man
O	suspecting
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	magic
O	about
O	her
O	house
O	,
O	sent
O	a
O	deputation
O	of
O	young
O	men
O	and
O	women
O	to
O	ask
O	his
O	youngest
O	daughter
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	bring
O	her
O	dog
O	along
O	with
O	her
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	deputation
O	reached
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	surprised
O	to
O	find
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	the
O	dog
O	,
O	a
O	fine
O	young
O	man;
O	and
O	on
O	announcing
O	their
O	message
O	,
O	they
O	all
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	old
O	chief
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	no
O	less
O	surprised
O	at
O	the
O	change
O	.
O	He
O	immediately
O	assembled
O	all
O	the
O	old
O	and
O	wise
O	heads
O	of
O	the
O	nation
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	be
O	witnesses
O	to
O	the
O	exploits
O	which
O	it
O	was
O	reported
O	that
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	could
O	perform
O	.
O	The
O	sixth
O	giant
O	,
O	although
O	neither
O	very
O	old
O	nor
O	very
O	wise
O	,
O	thrust
O	himself
O	in
O	among
O	the
O	relations
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	chief
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	assembled
O	and
O	seated
O	in
O	a
O	circle
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	chief
O	took
O	his
O	pipe
O	and
O	filled
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	passed
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	Indians
O	around
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	any
O	thing
O	would
O	happen
O	when
O	they
O	smoked
O	.
O	They
O	passed
O	it
O	on
O	until
O	it
O	came
O	around
O	to
O	the
O	Dog
O	,
O	who
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	that
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	handed
O	first
O	to
O	the
O	giant
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	done
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	giant
O	puffed
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	might
O	,
O	and
O	shook
O	the
O	white
O	feather
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	swelled
O	his
O	chest;
O	but
O	nothing
O	came
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	except
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	smoke
O	.
O	The
O	Dog
O	then
O	took
O	it
O	himself
O	.
O	He
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	to
O	them
O	to
O	put
O	the
O	white
O	feather
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	no
O	sooner
O	done
O	,
O	than
O	he
O	recovered
O	his
O	speech
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	beginning
O	to
O	draw
O	upon
O	the
O	pipe
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	moment
O	,
O	behold
O	,
O	immense
O	flocks
O	of
O	white
O	and
O	blue
O	pigeons
O	rushed
O	from
O	the
O	smoke
O	.
O	From
O	that
O	moment
O	the
O	sixth
O	giant
O	was
O	looked
O	upon
O	as
O	an
O	impostor
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	White
O	Feather
O	had
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	request
O	of
O	the
O	company
O	,
O	faithfully
O	recounted
O	his
O	history
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	chief
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	best-hearted
O	magicians
O	that
O	ever
O	lived
O	,
O	ordered
O	that
O	the
O	giant
O	should
O	be
O	transformed
O	into
O	a
O	dog
O	,
O	and
O	turned
O	into
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	boys
O	should
O	pelt
O	him
O	to
O	death
O	with
O	clubs;
O	which
O	being
O	done
O	,
O	the
O	whole
O	six
O	giants
O	were
O	at
O	an
O	end
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	troubled
O	that
O	neighborhood
O	again
O	,
O	forever
O	after
O	.
O	The
O	chief
O	then
O	gave
O	out
O	a
O	command
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	request
O	of
O	White
O	Feather
O	,
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	young
O	men
O	should
O	employ
O	themselves
O	four
O	days
O	in
O	making
O	arrows
O	.
O	White
O	Feather
O	also
O	asked
O	for
O	a
O	buffalo
O	robe
O	.
O	This
O	he
O	cut
O	into
O	thin
O	shreds
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	when
O	no
O	one
O	knew
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	sowed
O	them
O	about
O	the
O	prairie
O	in
O	every
O	direction
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	four
O	days
O	,
O	he
O	invited
O	them
O	to
O	gather
O	together
O	all
O	of
O	their
O	arrows
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	accompany
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	buffalo
O	hunt
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	got
O	out
O	upon
O	the
O	prairie
O	,
O	they
O	found
O	it
O	covered
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	herd
O	of
O	buffaloes
O	.
O	Of
O	these
O	they
O	killed
O	as
O	many
O	as
O	they
O	pleased
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	afterward
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	a
O	grand
O	festival
O	in
O	honor
O	of
O	White
O	Feather
O	'
O	s
O	triumph
O	over
O	the
O	giants
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	being
O	pleasantly
O	over
O	,
O	White
O	Feather
O	got
O	his
O	wife
O	to
O	ask
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	permission
O	to
O	go
O	with
O	him
O	on
O	a
O	visit
O	to
O	his
O	grandfather
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	chief
O	replied
O	to
O	this
O	application
O	,
O	that
O	a
O	woman
O	must
O	follow
O	her
O	husband
O	into
O	whatever
O	quarter
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	he
O	may
O	choose
O	to
O	go
O	.
O	Bidding
O	farewell
O	to
O	all
O	his
O	friends
O	,
O	White
O	Feather
O	placed
O	the
O	plume
O	in
O	his
O	frontlet
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	his
O	war-club
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	he
O	led
O	the
O	way
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	followed
O	by
O	his
O	faithful
O	wife
O	.
