O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time

O	lived
O	in
O	an
O	old
O	and
O	ruinous
O	house
O	by
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	the
O	wild
O	sea
O	,
O	a
O	widowed
O	nobleman
O	and
O	his
O	only
O	child
O	,
O	a
O	daughter
O	named
O	Isabella
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	very
O	poor
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	their
O	high
O	birth
O	,
O	so
O	poor
O	that
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	the
O	fields
O	and
O	woods
O	of
O	their
O	little
O	domain
O	had
O	been
O	sold
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	buy
O	the
O	bare
O	necessities
O	of
O	life
O	.
O	Knowing
O	that
O	his
O	death
O	would
O	leave
O	Isabella
O	quite
O	alone
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	and
O	practically
O	penniless
O	,
O	her
O	father
O	brought
O	her
O	up
O	more
O	like
O	a
O	boy
O	than
O	a
O	girl;
O	she
O	could
O	ride
O	a
O	horse
O	as
O	gracefully
O	as
O	an
O	Amazon
O	,
O	she
O	could
O	swim
O	like
O	a
O	born
O	mermaid
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	outdo
O	her
O	father
O	in
O	his
O	favorite
O	sport
O	of
O	fencing
O	.
O	Yet
O	so
O	sweet
O	was
O	the
O	gentle
O	nature
O	which
O	the
O	girl
O	had
O	inherited
O	from
O	her
O	mother
O	,
O	that
O	this
O	strange
O	upbringing
O	never
O	spoiled
O	her
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	.
O	Late
O	one
O	October
O	evening
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	fierce
O	gusts
O	of
O	wind
O	from
O	the
O	sea
O	shook
O	the
O	old
O	house
O	to
O	its
O	very
O	foundation
O	and
O	set
O	the
O	ragged
O	tapestries
O	swaying
O	on
O	the
O	walls
O	,
O	Isabella's
O	father
O	died
O	,
O	leaving
O	her
O	only
O	the
O	ruinous
O	house
O	,
O	a
O	handful
O	of
O	copper
O	pence
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	single
O	golden
O	florin
O	.
O	The
O	sum
O	of
O	money
O	was
O	enough
O	to
O	keep
O	body
O	and
O	soul
O	together
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	weeks
O	,
O	but
O	what
O	was
O	Isabella
O	to
O	do
O	when
O	the
O	little
O	pittance
O	was
O	gone
O	?
O	Her
O	father
O	had
O	once
O	counseled
O	her
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	ask
O	for
O	his
O	protection;
O	but
O	the
O	King's
O	castle
O	was
O	hundreds
O	of
O	miles
O	distant
O	,
O	and
O	Isabella
O	shrank
O	from
O	begging
O	or
O	the
O	highway
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	brave
O	girl
O	resolved
O	to
O	make
O	her
O	own
O	way
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	Taking
O	the
O	golden
O	florin
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	a
O	neighboring
O	town
O	,
O	and
O	purchased
O	a
O	suit
O	of
O	clothes
O	such
O	as
O	pages
O	and
O	squires
O	wear
O	who
O	are
O	in
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	noblemen
O	.
O	She
O	then
O	caused
O	her
O	black
O	hair
O	to
O	be
O	cut
O	short
O	,
O	boy-fashion
O	,
O	put
O	on
O	the
O	boy's
O	clothes
O	she
O	had
O	purchased
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	market-place
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	a
O	situation
O	in
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	some
O	great
O	family
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	custom
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	for
O	masters
O	and
O	servants
O	to
O	meet
O	by
O	a
O	fountain
O	in
O	the
O	market-place
O	,
O	the
O	masters
O	who
O	were
O	in
O	need
O	of
O	servants
O	standing
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	fountain
O	,
O	the
O	servants
O	who
O	were
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	masters
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	When
O	Isabella
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	market-place
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	one
O	standing
O	on
O	the
O	masters'
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	fountain
O	,
O	but
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	,
O	ready
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	master
O	who
O	should
O	appear
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	group
O	of
O	noisy
O	and
O	impudent
O	squires
O	and
O	pages
O	.
O	Isabella
O	,
O	or
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	now
O	called
O	herself
O	,
O	Florian
O	,
O	strode
O	boldly
O	over
O	and
O	joined
O	this
O	group
O	,
O	her
O	heart
O	beating
O	high
O	with
O	the
O	thrill
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	adventure
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	a
O	black
O	knight
O	,
O	mounted
O	on
O	a
O	black
O	horse
O	and
O	leading
O	another
O	horse
O	by
O	the
O	bridle
O	,
O	clattered
O	over
O	the
O	cobble-stones
O	of
O	the
O	square
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	his
O	place
O	by
O	the
O	fountain
O	,
O	called
O	on
O	the
O	pages
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	In
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	horseman's
O	summons
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	pages
O	paid
O	no
O	attention
O	to
O	him
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	Curious
O	to
O	know
O	the
O	reason
O	of
O	this
O	disdain
O	,
O	Florian
O	questioned
O	a
O	fellow
O	page
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	told
O	that
O	the
O	knight
O	was
O	no
O	other
O	than
O	the
O	Enchanter
O	of
O	the
O	Black
O	Rock
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	no
O	page
O	or
O	squire
O	would
O	take
O	service
O	with
O	him
O	because
O	his
O	castle
O	was
O	haunted
O	by
O	goblins
O	,
O	ghosts
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	manner
O	of
O	terrifying
O	spirits
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	Florian
O	was
O	no
O	coward
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	saying
O	is
O	,
O	beggars
O	cannot
O	be
O	choosers
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	much
O	to
O	the
O	astonishment
O	of
O	the
O	pages
O	,
O	Florian
O	walked
O	over
O	to
O	the
O	Enchanter
O	,
O	who
O	sat
O	fuming
O	with
O	anger
O	and
O	impatience
O	,
O	and
O	offered
O	to
O	go
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	Knight
O	bade
O	Florian
O	mount
O	the
O	horse
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	holding;
O	and
O	amid
O	the
O	cat-calls
O	and
O	hooting
O	of
O	the
O	pages
O	,
O	master
O	and
O	boy
O	galloped
O	away
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	long
O	they
O	rode
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	near
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	afternoon
O	Florian
O	found
O	himself
O	at
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	a
O	wild
O	and
O	desolate
O	moor
O	.
O	Within
O	the
O	great
O	circle
O	of
O	the
O	horizon
O	,
O	under
O	the
O	pale
O	sky
O	,
O	not
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	not
O	a
O	house
O	,
O	not
O	a
O	shepherd's
O	hut
O	even
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen--nothing
O	but
O	the
O	great
O	barren
O	waste
O	rolling
O	,
O	rising
O	and
O	falling
O	to
O	the
O	very
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	Lower
O	and
O	lower
O	sank
O	the
O	sun;
O	it
O	grew
O	cold
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	blue
O	mist
O	fell
O	.
O	Twilight
O	came
O	,
O	a
O	green
O	,
O	mysterious
O	twilight
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	from
O	a
O	hillock
O	of
O	the
O	moor
O	,
O	Florian
O	beheld
O	afar
O	the
O	enchanted
O	dwelling
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	sunken
O	marsh
O	lay
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	beginning
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	hill
O	and
O	stretching
O	away
O	,
O	league
O	after

O	,
O	till
O	its
O	farther
O	shore
O	was
O	hidden
O	in
O	the
O	gathering
O	darkness
O	.
O	The
O	autumn
O	wind
O	stirred
O	the
O	dead
O	sedges
O	at
O	its
O	brim
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	the
O	dying
O	twilight
O	was
O	still
O	gleaming
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	the
O	great
O	bog
O	had
O	caught
O	little
O	of
O	its

O	,
O	and

O	full
O	of

O	,

O	quagmires
O	,
O	and

O	A
O	dreadful
O	moaning
O	cry
O	,
O	uttered
O	by
O	some
O	demon

O	through
O	the

O	,
O	chilling

O	in

O	veins;

O	the
O	cry

O	thousands
O	upon

O	and
O	force
O	him
O	,
O	willy
O	nilly
O	,
O	to
O	accept
O	her
O	ugly
O	daughter
O	.
O	Into
O	her
O	trap
O	poor
O	Florizel
O	had
O	walked
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	witch
O	,
O	hoping
O	to
O	bend
O	him
O	to
O	her
O	will
O	by
O	terrifying
O	him
O	,
O	had
O	thrown
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	deep
O	dungeon
O	.
O	The
O	ugly
O	daughter
O	had
O	immediately
O	peeked
O	through
O	the
O	key-hole
O	of
O	the
O	prison
O	,
O	and
O	fallen
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	Florizel
O	at
O	first
O	sight
O	.
O	The
O	witch
O	was
O	just
O	considering
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	next
O	,
O	when
O	her
O	lion-headed
O	servitors
O	informed
O	her
O	that
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	company
O	had
O	resisted
O	her
O	enchantment
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	wandering
O	about
O	the
O	garden
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	witch
O	put
O	on
O	her
O	cloak
O	of
O	invisibility
O	,
O	and
O	going
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	garden
O	,
O	found
O	poor
O	Florian
O	wandering
O	disconsolately
O	under
O	the
O	trees
O	.
O	She
O	saw
O	at
O	once
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	little
O	golden
O	bird
O	which
O	had
O	protected
O	him
O	from
O	her
O	magic;
O	and
O	being
O	afraid
O	of
O	the
O	charm
O	and
O	yet
O	unable
O	to
O	work
O	the
O	poor
O	lad
O	any
O	harm
O	while
O	the
O	bird
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	possession
O	,
O	she
O	decided
O	to
O	rid
O	herself
O	of
O	Florian
O	by
O	transporting
O	her
O	castle
O	,
O	gardens
O	and
O	all
O	,
O	over
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	So
O	she
O	uttered
O	a
O	spell
O	,
O	and
O	everything
O	disappeared
O	.
O	When
O	Florian
O	woke
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	castle
O	was
O	gone
O	,
O	his
O	heart
O	sank
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	despair
O	,
O	but
O	taking
O	from
O	his
O	pocket
O	the
O	little
O	scarlet
O	ball
O	which
O	his
O	master
O	the
O	Enchanter
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	put
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	it
O	guide
O	him
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	Enchanted
O	Garden
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	ball
O	immediately
O	began
O	rolling
O	ahead
O	at
O	Florian's
O	own
O	pace;
O	at
O	night
O	it
O	glowed
O	with
O	a
O	scarlet
O	fire
O	.
O	Day
O	after
O	day
O	,
O	month
O	after
O	month
O	,
O	the
O	scarlet
O	ball
O	rolled
O	on;
O	it
O	led
O	Florian
O	over
O	hill
O	and
O	down
O	dale
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	men
O	who
O	have
O	only
O	one
O	eye
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	country
O	of
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	valley
O	of
O	the
O	talking
O	trees
O	,
O	never
O	stopping
O	till
O	it
O	reached
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	witch's
O	garden
O	.
O	A
O	year
O	,
O	meanwhile
O	,
O	had
O	gone
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	during
O	that
O	year
O	the
O	witch
O	had
O	done
O	everything
O	she
O	could
O	to
O	induce
O	Prince
O	Florizel
O	to
O	accept
O	her
O	ugly
O	daughter
O	.
O	First
O	she
O	had
O	tried
O	frightening
O	him
O	,
O	then
O	she
O	had
O	tried
O	to
O	win
O	him
O	by
O	giving
O	splendid
O	fetes
O	,
O	then
O	she
O	had
O	tried
O	terrifying
O	him
O	again;
O	but
O	as
O	the
O	Prince
O	was
O	neither
O	to
O	be
O	terrified
O	nor
O	cajoled
O	,
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	her
O	wits'
O	end
O	.
O	Finally
O	she
O	told
O	the
O	Prince
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	not
O	willing
O	to
O	accept
O	her
O	daughter
O	in
O	marriage
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	turn
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	hare
O	and
O	set
O	her
O	dogs
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	made
O	no
O	answer
O	to
O	her
O	terrible
O	threat
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	witch
O	went
O	ahead
O	and
O	made
O	preparation
O	for
O	the
O	grandest
O	of
O	weddings
O	.
O	On
O	that
O	night
O	,
O	Florian
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	garden
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	late
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	moon
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	quarter
O	full
O	,
O	had
O	disappeared
O	behind
O	a
O	bank
O	of
O	clouds
O	,
O	Florian
O	crept
O	unobserved
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	Florizel's
O	prison;
O	for
O	the
O	witch
O	had
O	locked
O	him
O	up
O	so
O	securely
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	taken
O	the
O	trouble
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	watchman
O	.
O	Alas
O	!
O	the
O	poor
O	Prince
O	lay
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	high
O	tower
O	,
O	and
O	twenty
O	different
O	doors
O	,
O	each
O	one
O	opened
O	by
O	a
O	different
O	key
O	,
O	stood
O	between
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	But
O	Florian
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	daunted
O	,
O	and
O	drawing
O	from
O	his
O	bosom
O	the
O	key
O	which
O	the
O	Enchanter
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	opened
O	one
O	door
O	after
O	the
O	other
O	till
O	he
O	arrived
O	in
O	the
O	cell
O	occupied
O	by
O	the
O	Prince
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	Prince
O	lay
O	chained
O	on
O	a
O	bed
O	of
O	straw
O	,
O	trying
O	to
O	read
O	a
O	book
O	by
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	a
O	single
O	candle
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	very
O	unhappy
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	resolved
O	to
O	let
O	himself
O	be
O	torn
O	in
O	pieces
O	rather
O	than
O	marry
O	the
O	ugly
O	witch
O	maiden
O	.
O	You
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	he
O	was
O	glad
O	to
O	see
O	Florian
O	.
O	"""Dear"
O	Florian
O	,
O	""""
O	said
O	the
O	unhappy
O	Prince
O	,
O	"""if"
O	I
O	had
O	only
O	obeyed
O	your
O	counsel
O	,
O	all
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	well
O	.
O	""""
O	And
O	he
O	begged
O	Florian
O	to
O	tell
O	him
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	all
O	the
O	long
O	year
O	.
O	So
O	Florian
O	told
O	the
O	Prince
O	of
O	his
O	adventures
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	the
O	chains
O	which
O	the
O	Prince
O	wore
O	were
O	riveted
O	cruelly
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	since
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	lock
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	the
O	magic
O	key
O	was
O	of
O	no
O	avail
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	Florizel
O	managed
O	to
O	work
O	them
O	off;
O	but
O	in
O	doing
O	so
O	,
O	he
O	injured
O	his
O	foot
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	to
O	his
O	dismay
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	only
O	limp
O	along
O	.
O	Little
O	by
O	little
O	the
O	freshened
O	air
O	and
O	the
O	stir
O	of
O	leaves
O	began
O	to
O	foretell
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	the
O	dawn
O	.
O	Finally
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	dawn-star
O	began
O	to
O	pale
O	,
O	Florizel
O	and
O	Florian
O	hurried
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	prison
O	through
O	the
O	twenty
O	doors
O	,
O	and
O	fled
O	to
O	the
O	highroad
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	had
O	traveled
O	only
O	a
O	few
O	miles
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	wicked
O	witch
O	discovered
O	Florizel's
O	flight
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	dreadfully
O	enraged
O	,
O	commanded
O	that
O	her
O	dragon
O	car
O	be
O	got
O	ready
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	go
O	in
O	pursuit
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	car
O	was
O	brought
O	forth
O	,
O	and
O	into
O	it
O	the
O	witch
O	leaped
O	,
O	and
O	mounted
O	into
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	Hearing
O	the
O	hissing
O	and
O	roaring
O	of
O	the
O	dragons
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	Florian
O	and
O	Florizel
O	tried
O	to
O	hide
O	under
O	some
O	trees;
O	but
O	the
O	witch
O	instantly
O	saw
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	pronounced
O	a
O	spell
O	to
O	turn
O	them
O	into
O	hares
O	.
O	But
O	though
O	the
O	hate
O	of
O	the
O	witch
O	was
O	quick
O	,
O	the
O	woman's
O	heart
O	of
O	Isabella
O	was
O	quicker
O	,
O	and
O	sacrificing
O	herself
O	for
O	the
O	man
O	she
O	loved
O	,
O	she
O	threw
O	the
O	chain
O	and
O	the
O	golden
O	bird
O	over
O	the
O	Prince's
O	head
O	.
O	An
O	instant
O	later
O	she
O	had
O	turned
O	into
O	a
O	little
O	gray
O	hare
O	crouching
O	at
O	Florizel's
O	feet
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	same
O	moment
O	,
O	the
O	cruel
O	witch
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	arrived
O	at
O	her
O	castle
O	,
O	let
O	loose
O	her
O	pack
O	of
O	fierce
O	hunting
O	dogs
O	,
O	who
O	soon
O	took
O	up
O	the
O	trail
O	of
O	the
O	hare
O	and
O	came
O	bounding
O	toward
O	her
O	in
O	full
O	cry
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	Prince
O	picked
O	up
O	the
O	hare
O	and
O	hobbled
O	forward
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	go
O	,
O	forgetting
O	the
O	dreadful
O	pain
O	it
O	caused
O	him;
O	but
O	the
O	dogs
O	were
O	running
O	a
O	hundred
O	times
O	faster
O	than
O	he
O	.
O	Nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	came
O	the
O	pack
O	,
O	their
O	red
O	tongues
O	lolling
O	from
O	their
O	black
O	throats
O	.
O	By
O	good
O	fortune
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	leader
O	of
O	the
O	pack
O	was
O	not
O	more
O	than
O	fifty
O	feet
O	away
O	,
O	Isabella
O	had
O	wit
O	enough
O	to
O	remember
O	the
O	promise
O	which
O	the
O	Enchanter
O	had
O	made
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	Immediately
O	a
O	strong
O	glass
O	wall
O	,
O	as
O	high
O	as
O	a
O	castle
O	tower
O	,
O	shot
O	up
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	behind
O	Isabella
O	and
O	the
O	Prince;
O	and
O	the
O	pack
O	,
O	hurrying
O	forward
O	,
O	found
O	themselves
O	baulked
O	of
O	their
O	prey
O	.
O	Snarling
O	and
O	yelling
O	,
O	they
O	threw
O	themselves
O	against
O	the
O	magic
O	wall;
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	In
O	another
O	instant
O	,
O	the
O	Enchanter
O	himself
O	stood
O	before
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	touching
O	the
O	hare
O	with
O	his
O	wand
O	,
O	restored
O	Isabella
O	to
O	her
O	human
O	form
O	.
O	She
O	still
O	wore
O	the
O	garments
O	of
O	Florian
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Prince
O	still
O	thought
O	her
O	a
O	boy
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	a
O	shadow
O	fell
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	near
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	up
O	,
O	all
O	beheld
O	the
O	wicked
O	witch
O	and
O	her
O	ugly
O	daughter
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	ridden
O	out
O	in
O	the
O	dragon
O	car
O	to
O	enjoy
O	Florizel's
O	cruel
O	death
O	.
O	The
O	Enchanter
O	immediately
O	caused
O	the
O	dragon
O	car
O	to
O	vanish
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	witch
O	and
O	her
O	daughter
O	fell
O	tumbling
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	into
O	a
O	pond
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	changed
O	into
O	ugly
O	little
O	fishes
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Enchanter
O	carried
O	Florizel
O	and
O	Florian
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	witch's
O	castle
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	tables
O	spread
O	and
O	the
O	dinner
O	being
O	prepared
O	which
O	was
O	to
O	celebrate
O	the
O	wedding
O	of
O	Florizel
O	and
O	the
O	witch's
O	daughter
O	.
O	Last
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	he
O	released
O	Florizel's
O	company
O	from
O	the
O	witch's
O	spell
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	ladies
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	heard
O	how
O	the
