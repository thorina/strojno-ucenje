O	.
O	By
O	avoiding
O	the
O	highroad
O	,
O	resting
O	only
O	at
O	the
O	most
O	sequestered
O	cottages--and
O	then
O	but
O	for
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	so--and
O	riding
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	as
O	hard
O	as
O	she
O	might
O	,
O	she
O	reached
O	Edinburgh
O	in
O	safety
O	early
O	next
O	morning
O	.
O	It
O	remains
O	only
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	the
O	time
O	thus
O	won
O	by
O	this
O	devoted
O	girl
O	was
O	enough
O	to
O	gain
O	the
O	end
O	for
O	which

O	Father

O	plied
O	the
O	ear
O	of
O	King

O	so
O	importunately
O	that
O	at

O	the
O	order
O	was
O	signed
O	for
O	Sir
O	John
O	Cochrane's
O	pardon
O	.
O	The
O	state

O	rendered
O	it
O	prudent
O	for
O	many
O	years
O	that
O	this
O	action
O	of
O	Grizel
O	Cochrane's
O	should
O	be
O	kept
O	secret;
O	but
O	after
O	the
O	Revolution
O	,
O	when
O	men
O	could
O	speak
O	more
O	freely
O	,
O	her

O	known
O	and
O	applauded
O	.
O	She

O	Ker
O	,
O	of
O	Morriston
O	,
O	in

O	,
O	and
O	doubtless
O	was
O	as
