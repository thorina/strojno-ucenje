O	said
O	Horn
O	,
O	"""in"
O	my
O	travels
O	I
O	met

O	Horn
O	.
O	He
O	gave
O	me
O	this
O	ring
O	to
O	bring
O	to
O	you;
O	it
O	was
O	on
O	shipboard
O	I
O	met
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	lay
O	dying
O	.
O	""""
O	He
O	said
O	this
O	to
O	prove
O	if
O	her
O	love
O	were
O	still
O	constant
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	Rimenhild
O	believed
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	heard
O	him
O	say
O	that
O	Horn
O	was
O	dead
O	,
O	became
O	as
O	one
O	mad
O	with
O	grief
O	.
O	Then
O	Horn
O	,
O	seeing
O	how
O	strong
O	was
O	her
O	love
O	,
O	threw
O	off
O	his
O	palmer's
O	cloak
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	her
O	the
O	false
O	stain
O	on
O	his
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	very
O	truth
O	Horn
O	,
O	her
O	lover
O	.
O	When
O	their
O	first
O	joy
O	at
O	meeting
O	again
O	was
O	over
O	,
O	Horn
O	told
O	the
O	princess
O	of
O	the
O	men
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	with
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	ship
O	.
O	Secretly
O	they
O	sent
O	for
O	Athulf
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	too
O	had
O	learnt
O	all
O	Horn's
O	tidings
O	,
O	a
O	message
O	was
O	sent
O	to
O	the
O	men
O	in
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	who
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	speedily
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	admitted
O	by
O	a
O	private
O	door
O	.
O	Then
O	all
O	the
O	company
O	of
O	them
O	broke
O	suddenly
O	into
O	the
O	banquet-hall
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	upon
O	those
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	slew
O	many;

O	Modi

O	escaped
