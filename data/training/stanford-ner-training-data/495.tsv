O	In
O	the
O	days
O	when
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	one
O	living
O	in
O	this
O	country
O	but
O	the
O	Indians
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	houses;
O	there
O	were
O	only
O	Indian
O	wigwams
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	no
O	roads
O	and
O	no
O	streets
O	,
O	but
O	Indian
O	trails
O	.
O	At
O	that
O	time
O	there
O	grew
O	a
O	wonderful
O	chestnut
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	Indians
O	used
O	in
O	their
O	cooking
O	.
O	A
O	very
O	small
O	bit
O	of
O	this
O	chestnut
O	grated
O	into
O	a
O	kettle
O	would
O	make
O	a
O	potful
O	of
O	porridge
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	certain
O	wigwam
O	lived
O	Deerheart
O	and
O	Sky
O	Elk
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	little
O	son
O	Greedy
O	Fawn
O	.
O	The
O	mother
O	was
O	called
O	Deerheart
O	because
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	loving
O	,
O	and
O	gentle
O	,
O	and
O	kind
O	.
O	The
O	father
O	was
O	named
O	Sky
O	Elk
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	strong
O	and
O	fleet
O	of
O	foot
O	.
O	Greedy
O	Fawn
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	came
O	rightly
O	by
O	his
O	name
O	.
O	You
O	will
O	soon
O	know
O	why
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	Deerheart
O	and
O	Sky
O	Elk
O	went
O	on
O	a
O	long
O	trail
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	left
O	the
O	wigwam
O	,
O	they
O	said
O	to
O	Greedy
O	Fawn
O	,
O	""""

O	down
O	the
O	western

O	put
O	some

O	he

O	the
O	chestnut
O	.
O	He
O	grated
O	a

O	chestnut
O	into

O	Beads
