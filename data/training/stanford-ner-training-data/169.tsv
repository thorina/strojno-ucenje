O	--HOW
O	THE
O	AGRICULTURAL
O	SYSTEM
O	OF

O	SOUTHWEST
O	WIND
O	,
O	ESQUIRE
O	In
O	a
O	secluded
O	and
O	mountainous
O	part
O	of
O	Stiria
O	there
O	was
O	,
O	in
O	old
O	time
O	,
O	a
O	valley
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	surprising
O	and
O	luxuriant
O	fertility
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	surrounded
O	,
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	,
O	by
O	steep
O	and
O	rocky
O	mountains
O	,
O	rising
O	into
O	peaks
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	always
O	covered
O	with
O	snow
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	which
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	torrents
O	descended
O	in
O	constant
O	cataracts
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	these
O	fell
O	westward
O	,
O	over
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	a
O	crag
O	so
O	high
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	sun
O	had
O	set
O	to
O	everything
O	else
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	below
O	was
O	darkness
O	,
O	his
O	beams
O	still
O	shone
O	full
O	upon
O	this
O	waterfall
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	shower
O	of
O	gold
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	called
O	by
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	,
O	the
O	Golden
O	River
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	strange
O	that
O	none
O	of
O	these
O	streams
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	valley
O	itself
O	.
O	They
O	all
O	descended
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	mountains
O	,
O	and
O	wound
O	away
O	through
O	broad
O	plains
O	and
O	by
O	populous
O	cities
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	clouds
O	were
O	drawn
O	so
O	constantly
O	to
O	the
O	snowy
O	hills
O	,
O	and
O	rested
O	so

O	in
O	the
O	circular
O	hollow
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	time

O	drought
O	and
O	heat

O	when
O	all
O	the
O	country
O	round
O	was
O	burnt
O	up

O	there
O	was
O	still
O	rain
O	in
O	the
O	little
O	valley;
O	and
O	its
O	crops
O	were
O	so
O	heavy
O	,

O	its
O	hay
O	so

O	red

O	blue

O	so
O	rich
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	honey
O	so
O	sweet
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	marvel
O	to
O	everyone
O	who
O	beheld
O	it
O	,

O	was
O	commonly

O	exhausted
O	him
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	scaled
O	the
O	first
O	range
O	of
O	the
O	green
O	and
O	low
O	hills
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	,
O	moreover
O	,
O	surprised
O	,
O	on
O	surmounting
O	them
O	,
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	a
O	large
O	glacier
O	,
O	of
O	whose
O	existence
O	,
O	notwithstanding
O	his
O	previous
O	knowledge
O	of
O	the
O	mountains
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	absolutely
O	ignorant
O	,
O	lay
O	between
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	source
O	of
O	the
O	Golden
O	River
O	.
O	He
O	entered
O	on
O	it
O	with
O	the
O	boldness
O	of
O	a
O	practised
O	mountaineer;
O	yet
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	traversed
O	so
O	strange
O	or
O	so
O	dangerous
O	a
O	glacier
O	in
O	his
O	life
O	.
O	The
O	ice
O	was
O	excessively
O	slippery
O	,
O	and
O	out
O	of
O	all
O	its
O	chasms
O	came
O	wild
O	sounds
O	of
O	gushing
O	water;
O	not
O	monotonous
O	or
O	low;
O	but
O	changeful
O	and
O	loud
O	,
O	rising
O	occasionally
O	into
O	drifting
O	passages
O	of
O	wild
O	melody
O	,
O	then
O	breaking
O	off
O	into
O	short
O	melancholy
O	tones
O	,
O	or
O	sudden
O	shrieks
O	,
O	resembling
O	those
O	of
O	human
O	voices
O	in
O	distress
O	or
O	pain
O	.
O	The
O	ice
O	was
O	broken
O	into
O	thousands
O	of
O	confused
O	shapes
O	,
O	but
O	none
O	,
O	Hans
O	thought
O	like
O	the
O	ordinary
O	forms
O	of
O	splintered
O	ice
O	.
O	There
O	seemed
O	a
O	curious
O	_expression_
O	about
O	all
O	their
O	outlines--a
O	perpetual
O	resemblance
O	to
O	living
O	features
O	,
O	distorted
O	and
O	scornful
O	.
O	Myriads
O	of
O	deceitful
O	shadows
O	,
O	and
O	lurid
O	lights
O	,
O	played
O	and
O	floated
O	about
O	and
O	through
O	the
O	pale-blue
O	pinnacles
O	,
O	dazzling
O	and
O	confusing
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	traveller;
O	while
O	his
O	ears
O	grew
O	dull
O	and
O	his
O	head
O	giddy
O	with
O	the
O	constant
O	gush
O	and
O	roar
O	of
O	the
O	concealed
O	waters
O	.
O	These
O	painful
O	circumstances
O	increased
O	upon
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	advanced;
O	the
O	ice
O	crashed
O	and
O	yawned
O	into
O	fresh
O	chasms
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	,
O	tottering
O	spires
O	nodded
O	around
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	thundering
O	across

O	path;
O	and
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	had
O	repeatedly
O	faced
O	these
O	dangers
O	on
O	the
O	most
O	terrific

O	in

O	it
O	was
O	with
O	a
O	new
O	and
O	oppressive
O	feeling
O	of
O	panic
O	terror
O	that
O	he
O	leaped
O	the

O	chasm
O	,
O	and
O	flung
O	himself
O	,
O	exhausted
O	and
O	shuddering
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	firm
O	turf
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	compelled
O	to
O	abandon
O	his
O	basket
O	of
O	food
O	,
O	which
O	became
O	a
O	perilous
O	incumbrance
O	on
O	the
O	glacier
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	now
O	no
O	means
O	of
O	refreshing
O	himself
O	but
O	by
O	breaking
O	off
O	and
O	eating
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	pieces
O	of

O	.
O	This
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	relieved

O	,
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	indomitable
O	spirit
O	of
O	avarice
O	,
O	he
O	resumed
O	his
O	laborious
O	journey
O	.
O	His
O	way
O	now
O	lay
O	straight
O	up
O	a

O	bare
O	red

O	an

O	apparently
O	in

O	Its

O	held
O	in

O	He

O	spurned
O	the

O	with

O	And
O	he
O	did
O	not

O	how
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	thought

O	a
O	strange
O	shadow
O	had
O	suddenly
O	come
O	across
O	the
O	blue
O	sky
O	.
O	The
O	path
O	became
O	steeper
O	and
O	more
O	rugged
O	every

O	and
O	the
O	high
O	hill
O	air
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	refreshing
O	him
O	,
O	seemed
O	to
O	throw
O	his
O	blood
O	into
O	a
O	fever
O	.
O	The
O	noise
O	of
O	the
O	hill

O	sounded
O	like
O	mockery
O	in
O	his
O	ears;
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	distant
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	thirst
O	increased
O	every

O	.
O	Another
O	hour
O	passed
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	again
O	looked
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	flask
O	at
O	his
O	side;
O	it
O	was
O	half
O	empty;
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	much
O	more
O	than
O	three
O	drops
O	in

O	stopped

O	its
O	eyes
O	closed
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	lips
O	parched
O	and

O	.
O	Hans
O	eyed
O	it
O	deliberately
O	,
O	drank
O	,
O	and
O	passed
O	on
O	.
O	And
O	a
O	dark-gray
O	cloud
O	came
O	over
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	and
O	long
O	,

O	the
O	leaden

O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	air

O	brow

O	he
O	should
O	have
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	gold
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	.
O	But
O	Gluck
O	only
O	begged
O	he
O	would
O	go
O	and
O	see
O	what
O	had
O	become
O	of
O	Hans
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	Schwartz
O	had
O	heard
O	that
O	Hans
O	had
O	stolen
O	the
O	holy
O	water
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	to
O	himself
O	that
O	such
O	a
O	proceeding
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	considered
O	altogether
O	correct
O	by
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	the
O	Golden
O	River
O	,
O	and
O	determined
O	to
O	manage
O	matters
O	better
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	took
O	some
O	more
O	of
O	Gluck's
O	money
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	a
O	bad
O	priest
O	who
O	gave
O	him
O	some
O	holy
O	water
O	very
O	readily
O	for
O	it
O	.
O	Then
O	Schwartz
O	was
O	sure
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	quite
O	right
O	.
O	So
O	Schwartz
O	got
O	up
O	early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	before
O	the
O	sun
O	rose
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	some
O	bread
O	and
O	wine
O	in
O	a
O	basket
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	his
O	holy
O	water
O	in
O	a
O	flask
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	off
O	for
O	the
O	mountains
O	.
O	Like
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	much
O	surprised
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	glacier
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	great
O	difficulty
O	in
O	crossing
O	it
O	,
O	even
O	after
O	leaving
O	his
O	basket
O	behind
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	day
O	was
O	cloudless
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	bright:
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	heavy
O	purple
O	haze
O	hanging
O	over
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hills
O	looked
O	lowering
O	and
O	gloomy
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	Schwartz
O	climbed
O	the
O	steep
O	rock
O	path
O	,
O	the
O	thirst
O	came
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	had
O	upon
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	lifted
O	his
O	flask
O	to
O	his
O	lips
O	to
O	drink
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	fair
O	child
O	lying
O	near
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	cried
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	moaned
O	for
O	water
O	.
O	"""Water"

O	went
O	he
O	thought
O	the
O	sunbeams
O	grew
O	more
O	dim
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	low

O	of

O	rising
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	west;

O	,

O	Then

O	climbed
O	for
O	another
