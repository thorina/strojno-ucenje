O	Three

O	parents
O	,
O	at
O	an
O	early

O	.
O	The

O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	able
O	to
O	provide
O	fully
O	for
O	their
O	support
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	all
O	that

O	could
O	in
O	hunting;
O	and
O	with
O	this
O	aid
O	,

O	of
O	provisions
O	already
O	laid
O	by
O	in
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	they
O	managed
O	to
O	keep
O	along
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	no
O	neighbors
O	to
O	lend
O	them
O	a
O	helping
O	hand
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	father

O	withdrawn
O	many
O	years
O	before
O	from
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	had
O	lived
O	ever
O	since
O	in
O	a
O	solitary
O	place
O	.
O	The

O	had
O	no
O	idea
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	human
O	being
O	near

O	.
O	They
O	did
O	not

O	been;
O	for
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	their
O	death
O	,
O	the
O	eldest
O	was
O	too
O	young
O	to
O	remember
O	it
O	.
O	Forlorn
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	they
O	however
O	kept
O	a
O	good
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	use
O	of
O	every
O	chance
O	,
O	in
O	course
O	of
O	time
O	they
O	all
O	acquired
O	a
O	knowledge
O	of
O	hunting
O	and
O	the
O	pursuit
O	of
O	game
O	.
O	The
O	eldest
O	became
O	expert
O	in
O	the
O	craft
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	successful
O	in
O	procuring
O	food
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	noted
O	for
O	his
O	skill
O	in
O	killing
O	buffalo
O	,
O	elk
O	,
O	and
O	moose;
O	and
O	he
O	instructed
O	his
O	brothers
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	each
O	should
O	become
O	a
O	master
O	over
O	a
O	particular
O	animal
O	which
O	was
O	assigned
O	to
O	him
O	.

O	they
O	had
O	become
O	able
O	to
O	hunt
O	and
O	to
O	take
O	care
O	of
O	themselves
O	,
O	the
O	elder
O	proposed
O	to
O	leave
O	them
O	and
O	to
O	go
O	in

O	of
O	the
O	world

O	to
O	return
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	procure
O	them
O	wives
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	intention
O	he
O	was
O	overruled
O	by
O	his
O	brothers
O	,
O	who
O	said
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	part
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	Jeekewis
O	,
O	the
O	second
O	,
O	was
O	loud
O	in
O	disapproval
O	of
O	the
O	scheme
O	,
O	saying:
O	"""What"

O	so
O	long

O	,
O	we
O	can
O	still
O	do
O	without

O	.
O	""""
O	This
O	counsel
O	prevailed
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	the
O	three
O	brothers
O	continued
O	together
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	they
O	agreed
O	to
O	kill
O	each
O	a
O	male
O	of
O	that
O	kind
O	of
O	animal
O	,
O	which
O	each
O	was
O	most
O	expert
O	in
O	hunting
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	purpose
O	of
O	making
O	quivers
O	from
O	their
O	skins
O	.
O	When
O	these
O	quivers
O	were
O	prepared
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	straightway
O	filled
O	,
O	with
O	arrows;
O	for
O	they
O	all
O	had
O	a
O	presentiment
O	that
O	something
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	happen
O	which
O	called
O	upon
O	them
O	to
O	be
O	ready
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	they
O	hunted
O	on
O	a
O	wager
O	to
O	see
O	who
O	should
O	come
O	in
O	first
O	with
O	game
O	,
O	and
O	have
O	the
O	privilege
O	of
O	acting
O	as
O	entertainer
O	to
O	the
O	others
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	to
O	shoot
O	no
O	other
O	beast
O	or
O	bird
O	than
O	such
O	as
O	each
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	killing
O	.
O	They
O	set
O	out
O	on
O	different
O	paths
O	.
O	Maidwa
O	,
O	the
O	youngest
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	gone
O	far
O	before
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	bear
O	,
O	an
O	animal
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	kill
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	agreement
O	.
O	He
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	followed
O	him
O	closely
O	,
O	and
O	driving
O	an
O	arrow
O	through
O	and
O	through
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	brought
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Although
O	contrary
O	to
O	the
O	engagement
O	with
O	his
O	brothers
O	,
O	Maidwa
O	commenced
O	skinning
O	him
O	,
O	when
O	suddenly
O	something
O	red
O	tinged
O	the
O	air
O	all
O	around
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	rubbed
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	thinking
O	he
O	was
O	perhaps
O	deceived;
O	but
O	rub
O	as
O	hard
O	as
O	he
O	would
O	,
O	the
O	red
O	hue
O	still
O	crimsoned
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	and
O	tinged
O	every
O	object
O	that
O	he
O	looked
O	on--the
O	tree-tops
O	,
O	the
O	river
O	that
O	flowed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	deer
O	that
O	glided
O	away
O	along
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	forest--with
O	its
O	delicate
O	splendor
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	stood
O	musing
O	on
O	this
O	fairy
O	spectacle
O	,
O	a
O	strange
O	noise
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	ear
O	from
O	a
O	distance
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	it
O	seemed
O	like
O	a
O	human
O	voice
O	.
O	After
O	following
O	the
O	sound
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	a
O	lake
O	.
O	Floating
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	upon
O	its
O	waters
O	sat
O	a
O	most
O	beautiful
O	Red
O	Swan
O	,
O	whose
O	plumage
O	glittered
O	in
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	it
O	lifted
O	up
O	its
O	neck
O	,
O	it
O	uttered
O	the
O	peculiar
O	tone
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	within
O	long
O	bow-shot
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	drawing
O	the
O	arrow
O	to
O	his
O	ear
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	a
O	careful
O	aim
O	and
O	discharged
O	the
O	shaft
O	.
O	It
O	took
O	no
O	effect
O	.
O	The
O	beautiful
O	bird
O	sat
O	proudly
O	on
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	still
O	pouring
O	forth
O	its
O	peculiar
O	chant
O	,
O	and
O	still
O	spreading
O	the
O	radiance
O	of
O	its
O	plumage
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	,
O	and
O	lighting
O	up
O	the
O	whole
O	world
O	,
O	beneath
O	the
O	eye
O	of
O	Maidwa
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	ruby
O	splendors
O	.
O	He
O	shot
O	again
O	and
O	again
O	,
O	till
O	his
O	quiver
O	was
O	empty
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	longed
O	to
O	possess
O	so
O	glorious
O	a
O	creature
O	.
O	Still
O	the
O	swan
O	did
O	not
O	spread
O	its
O	wings
O	to
O	fly
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	circling
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	,
O	stretched
O	its
O	long
O	neck
O	and
O	dipped
O	its
O	bill
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	indifferent
O	to
O	mortal
O	shafts
O	.
O	Maidwa
O	ran
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	bringing
O	all
O	the
O	arrows
O	in
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	shot
O	them
O	away
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	stood
O	with
O	his
O	bow
O	dropped
O	at
O	his
O	side
O	,
O	lost
O	in
O	wonder
O	,
O	gazing
O	at
O	the
O	beautiful
O	bird
O	.
O	While
O	standing
O	thus
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	heart
O	beating
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	eagerly
O	every
O	moment
O	for
O	the
O	possession
O	of
O	this
O	fair
O	swan
O	,
O	Maidwa
O	remembered
O	the
O	saying
O	of
O	his
O	elder
O	brother
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	their
O	deceased
O	father's
O	medicine-sack
O	were
O	three
O	magic
O	arrows;
O	but
O	his
O	brother
O	had
O	not
O	told
O	Maidwa
O	that
O	their
O	father
O	,
O	on
O	his
O	death-bed
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	alone
O	had
O	attended
O	,
O	had
O	especially
O	bequeathed
O	the
O	arrows
O	to
O	his
O	youngest
O	son
O	,
O	Maidwa
O	,
O	from
O	whom
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	wrongfully
O	kept
O	.
O	The
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	magic
O	arrows
O	put
O	heart
O	in
O	Maidwa
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	hastened
O	with
O	all
O	speed
O	to
O	secure
O	them
O	.
O	At
O	any
O	other
O	time
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	shrunk
O	from
O	opening
O	his
O	father's
O	medicine-sack
O	,
O	but
O	something
O	prompted
O	him
O	to
O	believe
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	wrong
O	now
O	,
O	and
O	snatching
O	them
O	forth
O	he
O	ran
O	back
O	,
O	not
O	staying
O	to
O	restore
O	the
O	other
O	contents
O	to
O	the
O	sack
O	,
O	but

O	them
O	scattered
O	,
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	about
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	He
O	feared
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	returned
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	swan
O	must
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	have
O	taken
O	wing;
O	but
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	emerged
O	from
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	delight

O	and

O	still
O	sat
O	the
O	glorious
O	Red
O	Swan
O	.

O	trembling

O	shot
O	the
O	first
O	of
O	his
O	magic
O	shafts:
O	it
O	grazed
O	a
O	wing
O	.
O	The
O	second
O	came
O	closer
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	away
O	a
O	few
O	of
O	the
O	bright
O	red
O	feathers
O	,
O	which
O	fluttered
O	and
O	fell
O	like

O	in
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	The
O	third

O	carefully
O	aimed
O	and
O	drew
O	home
O	upon

O	Maidwa

O	He
O	entered

O	one
O	conscious

O	,

O	to

O	,
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	laid

O	at

O	feet;
O	but
O	just
O	then
O	the
O	talking
O	kettle
O	stepped
O	forward
O	and
O	spoke
O	such
O	words
O	of
O	wisdom
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	singing
O	kettle
O	trolled
O	forth
O	such
O	a
O	soothing
O	little
O	song
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	guilty
O	brothers
O	were
O	so
O	contrite
O	and
O	keenly
O	repentant
O	of
O	their
O	intended
O	wrong
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Red
O	Swan
O	was
O	so
O	radiant
O	and
O	forgiving
O	,
O	the
O	silent
O	kettle
O	straightway
O	served

O	up
O	so
O	hearty
O	and
O	wholesome
O	a
O	meal
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	frisky
O	little
O	kettle
O	was
O	so
O	joyful
O	and
O	danced
O	about
O	so
O	merrily
O	,
O	that
O	when
O	the

O	no
