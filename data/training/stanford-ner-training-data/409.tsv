O	The
O	next
O	day
O	they
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	Sancho
O	had
O	left
O	the
O	boughs
O	strewn
O	along
O	his
O	path
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	told
O	them
O	they
O	were
O	near
O	to
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	better
O	get
O	dressed
O	.
O	For
O	they
O	had
O	told
O	Sancho
O	part
O	of
O	their
O	plan
O	to
O	take
O	away
O	his
O	master
O	from
O	this
O	wretched
O	penance
O	he
O	was
O	performing
O	,
O	and
O	warned
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	tell
O	the
O	knight
O	who
O	they
O	were
O	.
O	They
O	also
O	said
O	that
O	if
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	asked
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	sure
O	he
O	would
O	,
O	whether
O	he
O	had
O	delivered
O	his
O	letter
O	to
O	Dulcinea
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	so;
O	but
O	as
O	his
O	lady
O	could
O	not
O	read
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	sent
O	a
O	message
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	her
O	.
O	Sancho
O	listened
O	to
O	all
O	this
O	talk
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	he
O	would
O	remember
O	everything
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	anxious
O	that
O	his
O	master
O	should
O	give
O	up
O	penances
O	and
O	go
O	forth
O	again
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	islands
O	.
O	He
O	also
O	suggested
O	that
O	it
O	were
O	best
O	he
O	should
O	go
O	on
O	in
O	advance
O	,
O	as
O	perhaps
O	the
O	message
O	from
O	Dulcinea
O	would
O	of
O	itself
O	be
O	enough
O	to
O	bring
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	mountains
O	.
O	With
O	that
O	,
O	Sancho
O	went
O	off
O	into
O	the
O	mountain
O	gorges
O	,
O	leaving
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	behind
O	by
O	a
O	stream
O	overhung
O	with
O	pleasant
O	trees
O	and
O	rocks
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	hottest
O	days
O	of
O	August
O	,
O	when
O	in
O	those
O	parts
O	the
O	heat
O	is
O	very
O	great
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	about
O	three
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	when
O	Sancho
O	left
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	were
O	resting
O	in
O	the
O	shade
O	at
O	their
O	ease
O	when
O	they
O	heard
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	a
O	voice
O	,
O	not
O	accompanied
O	by
O	any
O	instrument
O	,
O	but
O	singing
O	very
O	sweetly
O	and
O	melodiously
O	.
O	The
O	song
O	surprised
O	them
O	not
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	for
O	this
O	did
O	not
O	seem
O	the
O	place
O	in
O	which
O	to
O	find
O	so
O	good
O	a
O	singer
O	.
O	The
O	singer
O	finished
O	his
O	song
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	barber
O	and
O	curate
O	,
O	in
O	wonder
O	and
O	delight
O	,
O	listened
O	for
O	more
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	silence
O	continued
O	,
O	they
O	agreed
O	to
O	go
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	this
O	strange
O	musician
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	were
O	moving
O	away
O	he
O	again
O	burst
O	into
O	song
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	this
O	,
O	uttered
O	a
O	deep
O	sigh
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	music
O	was
O	changed
O	into
O	sobs
O	and
O	heartrending
O	moans
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	not
O	gone
O	far
O	in

O	search
O	when
O	,
O	in
O	turning
O	the
O	corner
O	of
O	a
O	rock
O	,
