O	THE
O	WHITE
O	COCKADE
O	IT
O	was
O	Fergus
O	Mac-Ivor
O	himself
O	who
O	welcomed
O	Edward
O	within
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	Holyrood
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	adventurous
O	Prince
O	now
O	kept
O	his
O	court
O	.
O	Hardly
O	would
O	he
O	allow
O	Edward
O	even
O	to
O	ask
O	news
O	of
O	Flora
O	,
O	before
O	carrying
O	him
O	off
O	into
O	the
O	presence-chamber
O	to
O	be
O	presented
O	.
O	Edward
O	was
O	deeply
O	moved
O	by
O	the
O	Chevalier's
O	grace
O	and
O	dignity
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	moved
O	by
O	the
O	reception
O	he
O	received
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	praised
O	the
O	deeds
O	of
O	his
O	ancestors
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	upon
O	him
O	to
O	emulate
O	them
O	.
O	He
O	also
O	showed
O	him
O	a
O	proclamation
O	in
O	which
O	his
O	name
O	was
O	mentioned
O	along
O	with
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	rebels
O	as
O	guilty
O	of
O	high
O	treason
O	.
O	Edward's
O	heart
O	was
O	melted
O	.
O	This
O	princely
O	kindness
O	,
O	so
O	different
O	from
O	the
O	treatment
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	received
O	at
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	English
O	government
O	,
O	the
O	direct
O	appeal
O	of
O	the
O	handsome
O	and
O	gallant
O	young
O	Chevalier
O	,
O	perhaps
O	also
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	pleasing
O	Flora
O	in
O	the
O	only
O	way
O	open
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	all
O	overwhelmed
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	sudden
O	burst
O	of
O	resolve
O	,
O	he
O	knelt
O	down
O	and
O	devoted
O	his
O	life
O	and
O	his
O	sword
O	to
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	King
O	James
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	raised
O	and
O	embraced
O	Waverley
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	words
O	confided
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	English
O	general
O	,
O	having
O	declined
O	battle
O	and
O	gone
O	north
O	to
O	Aberdeen
O	,
O	had
O	brought
O	his
O	forces
O	back
O	to
O	Dunbar
O	by
O	sea
O	.
O	Here
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	Prince's
O	instant
O	intention
O	to
O	attack
O	him
O	.
O	Before
O	taking
O	leave
O	he
O	presented
O	Edward
O	with
O	the
O	splendid
O	silver-hilted
O	sword
O	which
O	he
O	wore
O	,
O	itself
O	an
O	heirloom
O	of
O	the
O	Stuarts
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	gave
O	him
O	over
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	Fergus
O	Mac-Ivor
O	,
O	who
O	forthwith
O	proceeded
O	to
O	make
O	Waverley
O	into
O	a
O	true
O	son
O	of
O	Ivor
O	by
O	arraying
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	tartan
O	of
O	the
O	clan
O	,
O	with
O	plaid
O	floating
O	over
O	his
O	shoulder
O	and
O	buckler
O	glancing
O	upon
O	his
O	arm
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	came
O	the
O	Baron
O	of
O	Bradwardine
O	,
O	anxious
O	about
O	the
O	honour
O	of
O	his
O	young
O	friend
O	Edward
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	desired
O	to
O	know
O	the
O	truth
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	manner
O	in
O	which
O	Captain
O	Waverley
O	had
O	lost
O	his
O	commission
O	in
O	Colonel
O	Gardiner's
O	dragoons
O	,
O	--so
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	should
O	hear
O	his
O	honour
O	called
O	in
O	question
O	,
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	defend
O	it
O	,
O	--which
O	,
O	no
O	doubt
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	performed
O	as
O	stoutly
O	and
O	loyally
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	previously
O	done
O	upon
O	the
O	sulky
O	person
O	of
O	the
O	Laird
O	of
O	Balmawhapple
O	.
O	The
O	morrow
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	day
O	of
O	battle
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	in
O	keeping
O	with
O	the
O	gay
O	character
O	of
O	the
O	adventurer-prince
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	evening
O	should
O	be
O	spent
O	in
O	a
O	hall
O	in
O	the
O	ancient
O	palace
O	of
O	Holyrood
O	.
O	Here
O	Edward
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	new
O	full
O	dress
O	as
O	a
O	Highlander
O	and
O	a
O	son
O	of
O	Ivor
O	,
O	shone
O	as
O	the
O	handsomest
O	and
O	the
O	boldest
O	of
O	all
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	marked
O	coldness
O	with
O	which
O	Flora
O	treated
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	to
O	make
O	amends
O	,
O	Rose
O	Bradwardine
O	,
O	close
O	by
O	her
O	friend's
O	side
O	,
O	watched
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	sigh
O	on
O	her
O	lip
O	,
O	and
O	colour
O	on
O	her
O	cheek--yet
O	with
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	pride
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	the
O	first
O	to
O	discover
O	what
O	a
O	gallant
O	and
O	soldierly
O	youth
O	he
O	was
O	.
O	Jacobite
O	or
O	Hanoverian
O	,
O	she
O	cared
O	not
O	.
O	At
O	Tully-Veolan
O	or
O	at
O	a
O	court
O	ball
O	,
O	she
O	was
O	equally
O	proud
O	of
O	Edward
O	Waverley
O	.
O	Next
O	morning
O	our
O	hero
O	was
O	awakened
O	by
O	the
O	screaming
O	of
O	the
O	warpipes
O	outside
O	his
O	bedroom
O	,
O	and
O	Callum
O	Beg
O	,
O	his
O	attendant
O	,
O	informed
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	hurry
O	if
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	come
O	up
O	with
O	Fergus
O	and
O	the
O	Clan
O	Ivor
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	marched
O	out
O	with
O	the
O	Prince
O	when
O	the
O	morning
O	was
O	yet
O	grey
O	.
O	Thus
O	spurred
O	,
O	Edward
O	proved
O	himself
O	no
O	laggard
O	.
O	On
O	they
O	went
O	,
O	threading
O	their
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	ranks
O	of
O	the
O	Highland
O	army
O	,
O	now
O	getting
O	mixed
O	up
O	with
O	Balmawhapple's
O	horsemen
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	careless
O	of
O	discipline
O	,
O	went
O	spurring
O	through
O	the
O	throng
O	amid
O	the
O	curses
O	of
O	the
O	Highlanders
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	Edward
O	saw
O	with
O	astonishment
O	that
O	more
O	than
O	half
O	the
O	clansmen
O	were
O	poorly
O	armed
O	,
O	many
O	with
O	only
O	a
O	scythe
O	on
O	a
O	pole
O	or
O	a
O	sword
O	without
O	a
O	scabbard
O	,
O	while
O	some
O	for
O	a
O	weapon
O	had
O	nothing
O	better
O	than
O	their
O	dirks
O	,
O	or
O	even
O	a
O	stake
O	pulled
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	hedge
O	.
O	Then
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	Edward
O	,
O	who
O	hitherto
O	had
O	only
O	seen
O	the
O	finest
O	and
O	best
O	armed
O	men
O	whom
O	Fergus
O	could
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	harbour
O	doubts
O	as
O	to
O	whether
O	this
O	unmilitary
O	array
O	could
O	defeat
O	a
O	British
O	army
O	,
O	and
O	win
O	the
O	crown
O	of
O	three

O	the
O	young
O	Prince
O	with
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	rashly
O	cast
O	in
O	his
O	lot
O	.
O	But
O	his
O	dismal
O	and
O	foreboding
O	thoughts
O	were
O	quickly
O	changed
O	to
O	pride

O	plaids
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	couch
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	they
O	lay
O	,
O	with
O	Callum
O	Beg
O	watching
O	at
O	their
O	heads
O	.
O	Before
O	three
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	summoned
O	to
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	the
O	Prince
O	.
O	They
O	found
O	him
O	giving
O	his
O	final
O	directions
O	to
O	the
O	chiefs
O	.
O	A
O	guide
O	had
O	been
O	found
O	who
O	would
O	guide
O	the
O	army
O	across
O	the
O	morass
O	.
O	They
O	would
O	then
O	turn
O	the
O	enemy's
O	flank
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	that
O	the
O	Highland
O	yell
O	and
O	the
O	Highland
O	claymore
O	must
O	do
O	the
O	rest
O	.
O	The
O	mist
O	of
O	the
O	morning
O	was
O	still
O	rolling
O	thick
O	through
O	the
O	hollow
O	between
O	the
O	armies
O	when
O	Clan
O	Ivor
O	got
O	the
O	word
O	to
O	charge
O	.
O	Prestonpans
O	was
O	no
O	midnight
O	surprise
O	.
O	The
O	English
O	army
O	,
O	regularly
O	ranked
O	,
O	stood
O	ready
O	,
O	waiting
O	.
O	But
O	their
O	cavalry
O	,
O	suddenly
O	giving
O	way
O	,
O	proved
O	themselves
O	quite
O	unable
O	to
O	withstand
O	the
O	furious
O	onslaught
O	of
O	the
O	Highlanders
O	.
O	Edward
O	charged
O	with
O	the
O	others
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	soon
O	in
O	the
O	thickest
O	of
O	the
O	fray
O	.
O	It
O	happened
O	that
O	while
O	fighting
O	on
O	the
O	battle
O	line
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	save
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	a
O	distinguished
O	English
O	officer
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	hilt
O	of
O	his
O	broken
O	sword
O	yet
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	stood
O	by
O	the
O	artillery
O	from
O	which
O	the
O	gunners
O	had
O	run
O	away
O	,
O	disdaining
O	flight
O	and
O	waiting
O	for
O	death
O	.
O	The
O	victory
O	of
O	the
O	Highlanders
O	was
O	complete
O	.
O	Edward
O	even
O	saw
O	his
O	old
O	commander
O	,
O	Colonel
O	Gardiner
O	,
O	struck
O	down
O	,
O	yet
O	was
O	powerless
O	to
O	save
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	long
O	after
O	,
O	the
O	reproach
O	in
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	the
O	dying
O	soldier
O	haunted
O	him
O	.
O	Yet
O	it
O	expressed
O	more
O	sorrow
O	than
O	anger--sorrow
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	place
O	and
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	dress
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	was
O	soon
O	forgotten
O	when
O	the
O	prisoner
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	,
O	and
O	whom
O	the
O	policy
O	of
O	the
O	Prince
O	committed
O	to
O	his
O	care
O	and
O	custody
O	,
O	declared
O	himself
O	as
O	none
O	other
O	than
O	Colonel
O	Talbot
O	,
O	his
O	uncle's
O	dearest
O	and
O	most
O	intimate
O	friend
O	.
O	He
O	informed
O	Waverley
O	that
O	on
O	his
O	return
O	from
O	abroad
O	he
O	had
O	found
O	both
O	Sir
O	Everard
O	and
O	his
O	brother
O	in
O	custody
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	Edward's
O	reported
O	treason
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	immediately
O	started
O	for
O	Scotland
O	to
O	endeavour
O	to
O	bring
O	back
O	the
O	truant
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	seen
O	Colonel
O	Gardiner
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	found
O	him
O	,
O	after
O	having
O	made
O	a
O	less
O	hasty
O	inquiry
O	into
O	the
O	mutiny
O	of
O	Edward's
O	troop
O	,
O	much
O	softened
O	toward
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	.
O	All
O	would
O	have
O	come
O	right
O	,
O	concluded
O	Colonel
O	Talbot
O	,
O	had
O	it
O	not
O	been
O	for
O	our
O	hero's
O	joining
O	openly
O	with
O	the
O	rebels
O	in
O	their
O	mad
O	venture
O	.
O	Edward
O	was
O	smitten
O	to
O	the
O	heart
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	of
O	his
O	uncle's
O	sufferings
O	,
O	believing
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	on
O	his
O	account
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	was
O	somewhat
O	comforted
O	when
O	Colonel
O	Talbot
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	through
O	his
O	influence
O	Sir
O	Everard
O	had
O	been
O	allowed
O	out
O	under
O	heavy
O	bail
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	Mr
O	.
O	Richard
O	Waverley
O	was
O	with
O	him
O	at
O	Waverley-Honour
O	.
O	Yet
O	more
O	torn
O	with
O	remorse
O	was
O	Edward
O	when
O	,
O	having
O	once
O	more
O	arrived
O	in
O	Edinburgh
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	leather
O	valise
O	which
O	contained
O	the
O	packet
O	of
O	letters
O	Alice
O	Bean
O	Lean
O	had
O	placed
O	among
O	his
O	linen
O	.
O	From
O	these
O	he
O	learned
O	that
O	Colonel
O	Gardiner
O	had
O	thrice
O	written
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	once
O	indeed
O	sending
O	the
O	letter
O	by
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Edward's
O	own
O	troop
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	instructed
O	by
O	the
O	pedlar
O	to
O	go
O	back
O	and
O	tell
O	the
O	Colonel
O	that
O	his
O	officer
O	had
O	received
O	them
O	in
O	person
O	.
O	Instead
O	of
O	being
O	delivered
O	to
O	Waverley
O	,
O	the
O	letters
O	had
O	been
O	given
O	to
O	a
O	certain
O	Mr
O	.
O	William
O	Ruffin
O	,
O	or
O	Riven
O	,
O	or
O	Ruthven
O	,
O	whom
O	Waverley
O	saw
O	at
O	once
O	could
O	be
O	none
O	other
O	than
O	Donald
O	Bean
O	Lean
O	himself
O	.
O	Then
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	remembering
O	the
O	business
O	of
O	the
O	robber
O	cave
O	,
O	he
O	understood
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	seal
O	,
O	and
O	poor
O	Houghton's
O	dying
O	reproach
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	not
O	have
O	left
O	the
O	lads
O	of
O	his
O	troop
O	so
O	long
O	by
O	themselves
O	.
O	Edward
O	now
O	saw
O	clearly
O	how
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	of
O	weakness
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	a
O	great
O	and
O	fatal
O	mistake
O	by
O	joining
O	with
O	the
O	Jacobites
O	.
O	But
O	his
O	sense
O	of
O	honour
O	was
O	such
O	that
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	all
O	Colonel
O	Talbot
O	could
O	say
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	go
O	back
O	on
O	his
O	word
O	.
O	His
O	own
O	hastiness
O	,
O	the
O	clever
O	wiles
O	of
O	Fergus
O	Mac-Ivor
O	,
O	Flora's
O	beauty
O	,
O	and
O	most
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	rascality
O	of
O	Donald
O	Bean
O	Lean
O	had
O	indeed
O	brought
O	his
O	neck
O	,
O	as
O	old
O	Major
O	Melville
O	had
O	prophesied
O	,
O	within
O	the
O	compass
O	of
O	the
O	hangman's
O	rope
O	.
O	The
O	best
O	Edward
O	could
O	now
O	do
O	was
O	to
O	send
O	a
O	young
O	soldier
O	of
O	his
O	troop
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	taken
O	at
O	Prestonpans
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	uncle
O	and
O	his
O	father
O	with
O	letters
O	explaining
O	all
O	the
O	circumstances
O	.
O	By
O	Colonel
O	Talbot's
O	advice
O	and
O	help
O	this
O	messenger
O	was
O	sent
O	aboard
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	English
O	vessels
O	cruising
O	in
O	the
O	Firth
O	,
O	well
O	furnished
O	with
O	passes
O	which
O	would
O	carry
O	him
O	in
O	safety
O	all
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	Waverley-Honour
O	.
O	Still
O	the
O	days
O	went
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	nothing
O	was
O	done
O	.
O	Still
O	the
O	Prince
O	halted
O	in
O	Edinburgh
O	waiting
O	for
O	reinforcements
O	which
O	never
O	came
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	always
O	hopeful
O	that
O	more
O	clans
O	would
O	declare
O	for
O	him
O	or
O	that
O	other
O	forces
O	would
O	be
O	raised
O	in
O	the
O	Lowlands
O	or
O	in
O	England
O	.
O	And
O	meanwhile
O	,
O	chiefly
O	because
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	for
O	them
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	plans
O	and
O	plots
O	were
O	being
O	formed
O	.
O	Quarrellings
O	and
O	jealousies
O	became
O	the
O	order
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	among
O	the
O	troops
O	of
O	the
O	White
O	Cockade
O	.
O	One
O	morning
O	Fergus
O	Mac-Ivor
O	came
O	in
O	to
O	Edward's
O	lodgings
O	,
O	furious
O	with
O	anger
O	because
O	the
O	Prince
O	had
O	refused
O	him
O	two
O	requests
O	,
O	--one
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	good
O	his
O	right
O	to
O	be
O	an
O	Earl
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	to
O	give
O	his
O	consent
O	to
O	his
O	marriage
O	with
O	Rose
O	Bradwardine
O	.
O	Fergus
O	must
O	wait
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	,
O	the
O	Prince
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	,
O	because
O	that
O	would
O	offend
O	a
O	chief
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	name
O	and
O	of
O	greater
O	power
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	still
O	hesitating
O	whether
O	or
O	not
O	to
O	declare
O	for
O	King
O	James
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	Rose
O	Bradwardine
O	,
O	neither
O	must
O	he
O	think
O	of
O	her
O	.
O	Her
O	affections
O	were
O	already
O	engaged
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	knew
O	this
O	privately
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	had
O	promised
O	already
O	to
O	favour
O	the
O	match
O	upon
O	which
O	her
O	heart
O	was
O	set
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	Edward
O	himself
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	about
O	this
O	time
O	to
O	think
O	less
O	and
O	less
O	of
O	the
O	cruelty
O	of
O	Flora
O	Mac-Ivor
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	have
O	the
O	moon
O	,
O	that
O	was
O	clear--and
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	child
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	crying
O	for
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	evident
O	,
O	also
O	,
O	that
O	Rose
O	Bradwardine
O	liked
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	marked
O	favour
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	desire
O	to
O	be
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	had
O	their
O	effect
O	upon
O	a
O	heart
O	still
O	sore
O	from
O	Flora's
O	repeated
O	and
O	haughty
O	rejections
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	the
O	last
O	things
O	Edward
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	do
O	in
O	Edinburgh
O	,
O	was
O	to
O	obtain
O	from
O	the
O	Prince
O	the
O	release
O	of
O	Colonel
O	Talbot
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	saw
O	safely
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	London
O	from
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	Leith
O	.
O	After
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	with
O	actual
O	relief
O	that
O	Edward
O	found
O	the
O	period
O	of
O	waiting
O	in
O	Edinburgh
O	at
O	last
O	at
O	an
O	end
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Prince's
O	army
O	to
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	six
O	thousand
O	men
O	marching
O	southward
O	into
O	England
O	.
O	All
O	was
O	now
O	to
O	be
O	hazarded
O	on
O	the
O	success
O	of
O	a
O	bold
O	push
O	for
O	London
O	.
O	The
O	Highlanders
O	easily
O	escaped
O	a
O	superior
O	army
O	encamped
O	on
O	the
O	borders
O	.
O	They
O	attacked
O	and
O	took
O	Carlisle
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	first
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	a
O	clear
O	path
O	to
O	the
O	capital
O	before
O	them
O	.
O	Fergus
O	,
O	who
O	marched
O	with
O	his
O	clan
O	in
O	the
O	van
O	of
O	the
O	Prince's
O	army
O	,
O	never
O	questioned
O	their
O	success
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	.
O	But
O	Edward's
O	clearer
O	eye
O	and
O	greater
O	knowledge
O	of
O	the
O	odds
O	made
O	no
O	such
O	mistake
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	that
O	few
O	joined
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	those
O	men
O	of
O	no
O	great
O	weight
O	,
O	while
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	the
O	forces
O	of
O	King
O	George
O	were
O	daily
O	increasing
O	.
O	Difficulties
O	of
O	every
O	kind
O	arose
O	about
O	them
O	the
O	farther
O	they
O	marched
O	from
O	their
O	native
O	land
O	.
O	Added
O	to
O	which
O	there
O	were

O	the
