O	There
O	was
O	,
O	some
O	time
O	ago
O	,
O	a
O	gentleman
O	who
O	was
O	very
O	rich
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	fine
O	town
O	and
O	country
O	houses
O	,
O	his
O	dishes
O	and
O	plates
O	were
O	all
O	of
O	gold
O	or
O	silver
O	,
O	his
O	rooms
O	were
O	hung
O	with
O	damask
O	,
O	his
O	chairs
O	and
O	sofas
O	were
O	covered
O	with
O	the
O	richest
O	silks
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	carriages
O	were
O	all
O	gilt
O	with
O	gold
O	in
O	a
O	grand
O	style
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	this
O	gentleman
O	had
O	a
O	blue
O	beard
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	so
O	very
O	frightful
O	and
O	ugly
O	,
O	that
O	none
O	of
O	the
O	ladies
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	parts
O	where
O	he
O	lived
O	,
O	would
O	venture
O	to
O	go
O	into
O	his
O	company
O	.
O	Now
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	certain
O	lady
O	of
O	rank
O	,
O	who
O	lived
O	very
O	near
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	two
O	daughters
O	,
O	both
O	of
O	them
O	of
O	very
O	great
O	beauty
O	.
O	Blue
O	Beard
O	asked
O	her
O	to
O	bestow
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	upon
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	it
O	to
O	herself
O	to
O	choose
O	which
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	.
O	But
O	both
O	the
O	young
O	ladies
O	again
O	and
O	again
O	said
O	they
O	would
O	never
O	marry
O	Blue
O	Beard;
O	yet
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	as
O	civil
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	,
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	said
O	,
O	the
O	only
O	reason
O	why
O	she
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	him
O	was
O	,
O	because
O	she
O	was
O	loath
O	to
O	hinder
O	her
O	sister
O	from
O	the
O	match
O	,
O	which
O	would
O	be
O	such
O	a
O	good
O	one
O	for
O	her
O	.
O	Still
O	the
O	truth
O	of
O	the
O	matter
O	was
O	,
O	they
O	could
O	neither
O	of
O	them
O	bear
O	the
O	thoughts
O	of
O	having
O	a
O	husband
O	with
O	a
O	blue
O	beard;
O	and
O	besides
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	heard
O	of
O	his
O	having
O	been
O	married
O	to
O	several
O	wives
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	nobody
O	could
O	tell
O	what
O	had
O	ever
O	become
O	of
O	any
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	As
O	Blue
O	Beard
O	wished
O	very
O	much
O	to
O	gain
O	their
O	favour
O	,
O	he
O	asked
O	the
O	lady
O	and
O	her
O	daughters
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	ladies
O	who
O	were
O	on
O	a
O	visit
O	at
O	their
O	house
O	,
O	to
O	go
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	country
O	seats
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	spent
O	a
O	whole
O	week
O	,
O	during
O	which
O	they
O	passed
O	all
O	their
O	time
O	in
O	nothing
O	but
O	parties
O	for
O	hunting
O	and
O	fishing
O	,
O	music
O	,
O	dancing
O	,
O	and
O	feasts
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	even
O	thought
O	of
O	going
O	to
O	bed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	nights
O	were
O	passed
O	in
O	merry-makings
O	of
O	all
O	kinds
O	.
O	In
O	short
O	,
O	the
O	time
O	rolled
O	on
O	in
O	so
O	much
O	pleasure
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	youngest
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	sisters
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	the
O	beard
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	much
O	afraid
O	of
O	,
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	very
O	blue
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	gentleman
O	who
O	owned
O	it
O	was
O	vastly
O	civil
O	and
O	pleasing
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	their
O	return
O	home
O	,
O	she
O	told
O	her
O	mother
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	longer
O	any
O	dislike
O	to
O	accept
O	of
O	Blue
O	Beard
O	for
O	her
O	husband;
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	short
O	time
O	they
O	were
O	married
O	.
O	About
O	a
O	month
O	after
O	the
O	marriage
O	had
O	taken
O	place
O	,
O	Blue
O	Beard
O	told
O	his
O	wife
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	forced
O	to
O	leave
O	her
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	weeks
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	some
O	affairs
O	to
O	attend
O	to
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	He
O	desired
O	her
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	to
O	indulge
O	herself
O	in
O	every
O	kind
O	of
O	pleasure
O	,
O	to
O	invite
O	as
O	many
O	of
O	her
O	friends
O	as
O	she
O	liked
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	treat
O	them
O	with
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	dainties
O	,
O	that
O	her
O	time
O	might
O	pass
O	pleasantly
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	back
O	again

O	would
O	be
O	to
O	leave
O	her
O	guests

O	she
O	slipped
O	away
O	down

O	that
O	led
O	to
O	this

O	falling
O	down
O	stairs

O	.
O	When
O	she
O	reached
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	closet

O	she
O	stopped
O	for
O	a
O	few

O	did
O	not
O	obey
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	very
O	curious
O	to
O	know
O	what
O	was
O	inside
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	made
O	up
O	her
O	mind
O	to
O	venture
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	every
O	thing
O	.
O	She
O	then
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	trembling
O	hand
O	,
O	put
O	the
O	key
O	into
O	the
O	lock
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	door
O	straight
O	flew
O	open
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	window
O	shutters
O	were
O	closed
O	,
O	she
O	at
O	first
O	could
O	see
O	nothing;
O	but
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	she
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	floor
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	clotted
O	blood
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	bodies
O	of
O	several
O	dead
O	women
O	were
O	lying
O	.
O	These
O	were
O	all
O	the
O	wives
O	whom
O	Blue
O	Beard
O	had
O	married
O	,
O	and
O	killed
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	sight
O	she
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	sink
O	with
O	fear
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	key
O	of
O	the
O	closet
O	door
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	held
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	fell
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	little
O	got
O	the
O	better
O	of
O	her
O	fright
O	,
O	she
O	took
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	locked
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	haste
O	back
O	to
O	her
O	own
O	room
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	have
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	a
O	humour
O	to
O	amuse
O	her
O	company;
O	but
O	this
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	do
O	,
O	so
O	great
O	was
O	her
O	fright
O	at
O	what
O	she
O	had
O	seen
O	.
O	As
O	she
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	key
O	of
O	the
O	closet
O	had
O	got
O	stained
O	with
O	blood
O	in
O	falling
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	she
O	wiped
O	it
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	times
O	over
O	to
O	clean
O	it;
O	yet
O	still
O	the
O	blood
O	kept
O	on
O	it
O	the
O	same
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	She
O	next
O	washed
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	blood
O	did
O	not
O	move
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	She
O	then
O	scoured
O	it
O	with
O	brickdust
