O	And
O	the

O	grew
O	cold
O	,
O	very
O	cold
O	!
O	The
O	Duckling
O	was
O	forced

O	the
O	water
O	,
O	to
O	prevent

O	entirely;
O	but
O	every
O	night
O	the
O	hole
O	in

O	it
O	swam

O	froze

O	At

O	quite
O	still
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	froze
O	fast
O	into
O	the
O	ice
O	.
O	Early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	a
O	peasant
O	came
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	wooden
O	shoe
O	,
O	broke
O	the
O	ice-crust
O	to
O	pieces
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	the
O	Duckling
O	home
O	to
O	his
O	wife
O	.
O	Then
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	itself
O	again
O	.
O	The
O	children
O	wanted
O	to
O	play
O	with
O	it;
O	but
O	the
O	Duckling
O	thought
O	they
O	wanted
O	to
O	hurt
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	its
O	terror
O	fluttered
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	milk-pan
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	milk
O	spurted
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	The
O	woman
O	clasped
O	her
O	hands
O	,
O	at

O	the
O	Duckling
O	flew
O	down
O	into

O	and
O	out
O	again
O	.
O	How
O	it
O	looked
O	then
O	!
O	The
O	woman
O	screamed
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	at
O	it
O	with
O	the
O	fire-tongs;
O	the
O	children
O	tumbled
O	over
O	one
O	another
O	in
O	their
O	efforts
O	to
O	catch
O	the
O	Duckling;
O	and
O	they
O	laughed
O	and
O	they
O	screamed
O	!
O	--well
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	the
O	door
O	stood
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	poor
O	creature
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	slip
O	out
O	between
O	the
O	shrubs
O	into
O	the
O	newly-fallen
O	snow--there
O	it
O	lay
O	quite
O	exhausted
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	too
O	melancholy
O	if
O	I
O	were
O	to
O	tell
O	all
O	the
O	misery
O	and
O	care
O	which
O	the
O	Duckling
O	had
O	to
O	endure
O	in
O	the
O	hard
O	winter
O	.
O	It
O	lay
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	moor
O	among
O	the
O	reeds

O	when
O	the
O	sun
O	began
O	to
O	shine
O	again
O	and
O	the
O	larks
O	to
O	sing
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	beautiful
O	spring
O	.
O	Then
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	the
O	Duckling
O	could
O	flap
O	its
O	wings
O	.
O	They
O	beat
O	the
O	air
O	more
O	strongly
O	than
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	bore
O	it
O	strongly
O	away;

O	before
O	it
O	well
O	knew
O	how
O	all
O	this

O	the

O	smelt
