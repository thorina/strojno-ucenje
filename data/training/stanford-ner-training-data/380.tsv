O	Charles
O	and
O	his
O	host
O	rode
O	hard
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	not
O	rein
O	until
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	mountain
O	top
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	Valley
O	of
O	Roncesvalles
O	.
O	They
O	blew
O	the
O	clarions
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	sound
O	,
O	neither
O	any
O	that
O	answered
O	save
O	the
O	ringing
O	mountain
O	sides
O	.
O	Then
O	down
O	through
O	gloom
O	and
O	mist
O	they
O	rode
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	field;
O	saw
O	Roland
O	dead
O	,
O	and
O	Oliver;
O	the
O	archbishop
O	and
O	the
O	twelve
O	valiant
O	peers
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	man
O	of
O	the
O	twenty
O	thousand
O	chosen
O	guard;
O	saw
O	how
O	fiercely
O	they
O	had
O	fought
O	,
O	how
O	hard
O	they
O	died
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	not
O	one
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	king's
O	host
O	but
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	voice
O	and
O	wept
O	for
O	pity
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	they
O	saw
O	.
O	But
O	Charles
O	the
O	king
O	is
O	fallen
O	on
O	his
O	face
O	on
O	Roland's
O	body
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	and
O	exceeding
O	bitter
O	cry
O	.
O	No
O	word
O	lie
O	spake
O	,
O	but
O	only
O	lay
O	and
O	moaned
O	upon
O	the
O	dead
O	that
O	was
O	so
O	passing
O	dear
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	Charles
O	was
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	when
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	babe
O	Roland
O	from
O	his
O	mother's
O	arms
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	up
O	and
O	nourished
O	him
O	,
O	had
O	taught
O	him
O	war
O	,
O	and
O	watched
O	him
O	grow
O	the
O	bravest
O	knight
O	,
O	the
O	stanchest
O	captain
O	of
O	his
O	host
O	.
O	Right
O	gladly
O	would
O	he
O	have
O	given
O	Spain
O	and
O	the
O	fruits
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	seven
O	years'
O	war
O	to
O	have
O	Roland
O	back
O	again
O	.
O	Tears
O	came
O	,
O	but
O	brought
O	no
O	words;
O	and
O	God
O	sent
O	sleep
O	to
O	comfort
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	heaviness
O	.
O	Then
O	having
O	watered
O	and
O	pastured
O	their
O	horses
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	left
O	four
O	good
O	knights
O	in
O	Roncesvalles
O	to
O	guard
O	the
O	dead
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	in
O	chase
O	of
O	the
O	pagans
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	Vale
O	of
O	Tenebrus
O	the
O	Franks
O	overtook
O	them
O	,
O	hard
O	by
O	the
O	broad
O	,
O	swift
O	river
O	Ebro
O	.
O	There
O	being
O	hemmed
O	in
O	,
O	the
O	river
O	in
O	front
O	and
O	the
O	fierce
O	Franks
O	behind
O	,
O	the
O	pagans
O	were
O	cut
O	to
O	pieces;
O	Not
O	one
O	escaped
O	,
O	save
O	Marsilius
O	and
O	a
O	little
O	band
O	who
O	had
O	taken
O	another
O	way
O	and
O	got
O	safe
O	to
O	Zaragoz
O	.
O	Thence
O	Marsilius
O	sent
O	letters
O	to
O	Baligant
O	,
O	King
O	of
O	Babylon
O	,
O	who
O	ruled
O	forty
O	kingdoms
O	,
O	praying
O	him
O	to
O	come
O	over
O	and
O	help
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	Baligant
O	gathered
O	a
O	mighty
O	great
O	army
O	and
O	put
O	off
O	to
O	sea
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	Marsilius
O	.
O	But
O	King
O	Charles
O	went
O	straightway
O	back
O	to
O	Roncesvalles
O	to
O	bury
O	the
O	dead
O	.
O	He
O	summoned
O	thither
O	his
O	bishops
O	and
O	abbots
O	and
O	canons
O	to
O	say
O	mass
O	for
O	the
O	souls
O	of
O	his
O	guard
O	and
O	to
O	burn
O	incense
O	of
O	myrrh
O	and
O	antimony
O	round
O	about
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	would
O	by
O	no
O	means
O	lay
O	Roland
O	and
O	Oliver
O	and
O	Turpin
O	in
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	Wherefore
O	he
O	caused
O	their
O	bodies
O	to
O	be
O	embalmed
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	have
O	them
O	ever
O	before
O	his
O	eyes;
O	and
O	he
O	arrayed
O	them
O	in
O	stuffs
O	of
O	great
O	price
O	and
O	laid
O	them
O	in
O	three
O	coffins
O	of
O	white
O	marble
O	,
O	and
O	chose
O	out
O	the
O	three
O	richest
O	chariots
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	and
O	placed
O	the
O	coffins
O	in
O	them
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	go
O	with
O	him
O	whithersoever
O	he
O	went
O	.
O	Now
O	after
O	this
O	Marsilius
O	and
O	Baligant
O	came
O	out
O	to
O	battle
O	with
O	King
O	Charles
O	before
O	the
O	walls
O	of
O	Zaragoz
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	king
O	utterly
O	destroyed
O	the
O	pagans
O	there
O	and
O	slew
O	King
O	Baligant
O	and
O	King
O	Marsilius
O	,
O	and
O	brake
O	down
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	Zaragoz
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	conquered
O	Spain
O	and
O	avenged
O	himself
O	for
O	Roland
O	and
O	his
O	guard

O	But
O	when
O	King
O	Charles
O	would
O	go
O	back
O	again
O	to
