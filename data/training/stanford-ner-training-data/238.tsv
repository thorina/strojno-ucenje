O	The

O	a
O	mouthful

O	the
O	bear's
O	meat
O	,

O	had
O	no

O	began
O	to
O	taste
O	it

O	it
O	changed
O	into
O	a
O	dry
O	powder
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	him
O	coughing
O	.
O	It
O	appeared
O	as
O	bitter
O	as
O	ashes
O	.
O	The
O	moose
O	was
O	affected
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	brought
O	on
O	such
O	a
O	dry
O	cough

O	family

O	to

O	the
O	bear's
O	meat

O	very

O	.

O	the
O	visitors
O	had
O	too
O	high
O	a
O	sense
O	of
O	what
O	was
O	due
O	to
O	decorum
O	and
O	good
O	manners

O	keenly
O	set
O	and

O	by

O	look

O	until
O	Manabozho
O	,
O	exerting
O	the
O	magical
O	gift
O	which
O	he
O	found
O	he
O	retained
O	,
O	changed
O	them
O	all
O	into
O	squirrels;

O	to
O	this
O	day
O	the
O	squirrel
O	suffers
O	from
O	the
O	same
O	dry
O	cough
O	which
O	was
O	brought
O	on
O	by
O	attempting
O	to
O	sup

O	when
O	Manabozho
O	lacked

O	for

O	hunt

O	a
O	supply

O	which
O	never
O	failed
O	him
O	,

O	,

O	thus
O	laid
O	the
