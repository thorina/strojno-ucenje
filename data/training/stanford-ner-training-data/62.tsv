O	.
O	When
O	the
O	visitor
O	had
O	gone
O	,
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Bertram
O	,
O	the
O	mother
O	of
O	the
O	baby
O	boy
O	,
O	was
O	very
O	anxious
O	to
O	read
O	the
O	paper
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	superstitious
O	lady;
O	but
O	after
O	a
O	struggle
O	with
O	her
O	curiosity
O	,
O	she
O	contented
O	herself
O	with
O	making
O	a
O	small
O	velvet
O	bag
O	,
O	into
O	which
O	she
O	sewed
O	the
O	paper
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	whole
O	was
O	then
O	hung
O	as
O	a
O	charm
O	round
O	the
O	neck
O	of
O	her
O	young
O	child
O	.
O	Time
O	rolled
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	little
O	Harry
O	Bertram
O	grew
O	to
O	be
O	four
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	already
O	a
O	great
O	favourite
O	with
O	Dominie
O	Sampson
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	acted
O	as
O	his
O	tutor
O	and
O	was
O	his
O	constant
O	companion
O	.
O	But
O	just
O	about
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	Laird
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	was
O	appointed
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	magistrates
O	of
O	the
O	county;
O	and
O	shortly
O	after
O	his
O	appointment
O	he
O	began
O	,
O	little
O	by
O	little
O	,
O	to
O	become
O	very
O	unpopular
O	with
O	the
O	gipsies
O	,
O	with
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	before
O	been
O	such
O	a
O	favourite
O	.
O	He
O	thought
O	it
O	his
O	duty
O	now
O	to
O	punish
O	and
O	exterminate
O	all
O	amongst
O	them
O	who
O	were
O	poachers
O	and
O	trespassers
O	,
O	and
O	caused
O	even
O	the
O	poor
O	beggars
O	at
O	his
O	door
O	to
O	be
O	sent
O	to
O	the
O	workhouse
O	.
O	One
O	tribe
O	of
O	these
O	gipsies
O	,
O	amongst
O	whom
O	Meg
O	Merrilies
O	was
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	queen
O	,
O	had
O	lived
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	unmolested
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	huts
O	in
O	a
O	glen
O	upon
O	the
O	estate
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	,
O	at
O	a
O	place
O	called
O	Derncleugh
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	miserable
O	and
O	squalid
O	village
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	all
O	that
O	Mr
O	.
O	Bertram
O	was
O	determined
O	to
O	evict
O	them
O	and
O	all
O	their
O	poor
O	belongings
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	no
O	doubt
O	doing
O	as
O	the
O	law
O	directed
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	concerned
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	of
O	Derncleugh
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	acting
O	with
O	great
O	harshness
O	,
O	for
O	Meg
O	Merrilies
O	had
O	all
O	along
O	shown
O	a
O	strong
O	affection
O	for
O	his
O	boy
O	,
O	little
O	Harry
O	Bertram
O	.
O	The
O	day
O	of
O	eviction
O	came
O	at
O	length
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	large
O	body
O	of
O	men
O	under
O	the
O	direction
O	of
O	Frank
O	Kennedy
O	,
O	a
O	custom-house
O	officer
O	,
O	made
O	their
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	miserable
O	village
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	gipsies
O	refusing
O	to
O	leave
O	peaceably
O	,
O	proceeded
O	to
O	unroof
O	their
O	cottages
O	and
O	pull
O	down
O	the
O	wretched
O	doors
O	and
O	windows
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	resistance
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	work
O	was
O	ended
O	,
O	the
O	now
O	homeless
O	tribe
O	gathered
O	together
O	the
O	remnants
O	of
O	their
O	property
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	forth
O	with
O	sullen
O	and
O	revengeful
O	thoughts
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	a
O	new
O	settlement
O	.
O	Mr
O	.
O	Bertram
O	had
O	been
O	some
O	distance
O	from
O	home
O	on
O	the
O	day
O	of
O	the
O	eviction;
O	but
O	on
O	returning
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	he
O	met
O	the
O	troop
O	of
O	gipsies
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	men
O	muttered
O	angry
O	remarks
O	as
O	he
O	passed
O	them
O	on
O	the
O	road
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	best
O	to
O	make
O	no
O	answer
O	.
O	Meg
O	Merrilies
O	had
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	lagged
O	behind
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	standing
O	alone
O	on
O	a
O	high
O	bank
O	above
O	the
O	road
O	as
O	the
O	laird
O	went
O	by
O	.
O	Her
O	dress
O	was
O	even
O	stranger
O	than
O	usual
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	black
O	hair
O	hung
O	loose
O	about
O	her
O	,
O	while
O	her
O	dark
O	eyes
O	flashed
O	angrily
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	a
O	light
O	sapling
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	laird
O	looked
O	up
O	to
O	where
O	she
O	stood
O	,
O	she

O	A
O	sloop
O	of

O	in

O	,
O	looking
O	out
O	,
O	saw
O	that
O	Hatteraick
O	was
O	likely
O	to
O	escape
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	got
O	his
O	vessel
O	round
O	a
O	headland
O	called
O	Warroch
O	Point
O	,
O	where
O	it
O	was
O	concealed
O	from
O	the
O	sloop
O	,
O	unless
O	someone
O	went
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	Point
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	signal
O	to

O	pursuers
O	.
O	He
O	accordingly
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	galloped
O	off
O	.
O	On
O	his
O	way
O	he
O	happened
O	to
O	meet
O	little
O	Bertram

O	who
O	was
O	walking
O	with
O	the
O	dominie
O	,

O	had
O	often
O	promised
O	to
O	give
O	the
O	child
O	a
O	ride
O	,

O	took
O	him
O	up
O	on
O	his
O	nag
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	off
O	towards
O	the
O	Point
O	.
O	Shortly
O	afterwards
O	the
O	discharges
O	of
O	several
O	cannon
O	were
O	heard
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	an
O	interval
O	a
O	still
O	louder
O	explosion
O	,
O	as
O	of
O	a
O	vessel
O	blown
O	up
O	.
O	As
O	evening
O	came
O	on
O	,
O	Mr

O	Bertram
O	were
O	expecting

O	as
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	return
O	,
O	became
O	very
O	uneasy
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	After
O	waiting
O	for
O	him
O	in
O	anxiety
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	the
O	news
O	came
O	in
O	that
O	Kennedy
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	had
O	come
O	back
O	riderless
O	to
O	its
O	stable
O	.
O	All
O	was
O	now
O	bustle
O	at
O	Ellangowan
O	.
O	The
O	laird
O	and
O	his
O	servants
O	rushed
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	wood
O	of
O	Warroch;
O	but
O	they
O	searched
O	long
O	and
O	in
O	vain
O	for
O	any
O	trace
O	of
O	Kennedy
O	or
O	the
O	boy
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	already
O	growing
O	dark
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	shrill
O	and
O	piercing
O	shout
O	was
O	heard
O	from
O	the
O	sea-
O	shore
O	under
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	hurrying
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	Mr
O	.
O	Bertram
O	was
O	horrified
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	dead
O	body
O	of
O	Frank
O	Kennedy
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	right
O	under
O	a
O	high
O	precipice
O	of
O	rocks
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	wild
O	dismay
O	and
O	terror
O	for
O	his
O	child
O	,
O	and
O	remembering
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	Meg
O	Merrilies
O	,
O	the
O	laird
O	hurried
O	away
O	to
O	Derncleugh
O	,
O	hoping
O	to
O	get
O	some
O	news
O	of
O	him
O	from
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	gipsies
O	who
O	might
O	still
O	be
O	lingering
O	round
O	the
O	place
O	.
O	He
O	wandered
O	amongst
O	the
O	ruins
O	of
O	the
O	cottages
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	found
O	no
O	one
O	,
O	although
O	he
O	noticed
O	the
O	remains
O	of
O	a
O	fire
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	huts
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	servants
O	came
O	running
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	to
O	come
O	home
O	at
O	once--
O	that
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Bertram
O	was
O	dying
O	.
O	Half
O	stupefied
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	back;
O	but
O	only
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	his
O	wife
O	was
O	dead
O	,
O	that
O	a
O	little
O	daughter
O	had
O	been
O	born
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	his
O	boy
O	was
O	gone
O	.
O	The
O	sheriff
O	of
O	the
O	county
O	arrived
O	next
O	morning
O	and
O	opened
O	an
O	inquiry
O	.
O	The
O	wood
O	was
O	again
O	searched
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	result
O	that
O	traces
O	of
O	a
O	struggle
O	were
O	found
O	near
O	the
O	top
O	of

O	,
O	over
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	Kennedy
O	'
O	s
O	body
O	was
O	found
O	lying
O	.
O	Footprints
O	of
O	men
O	and
O	of
O	a
O	small
O	boy
O	were
O	seen
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	.
O	Witnesses
O	who
O	were
O	examined
O	said
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	smuggler
O	'
O	s
O	ship
O	grounding
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	blowing
O	up
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	explosion;
O	but
O	no
O	one
O	could
O	say
O	what
O	had
O	become
O	of
O	its
O	crew
O	.
O	The
O	gipsies
O	were
O	suspected
O	,
O	and
O	Meg
O	Merrilies
O	was
O	arrested;
O	but
O	when
O	questioned
O	she
O	denied
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	at
O	the
O	place
O	.
O	They
O	found
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	a
O	cut
O	upon
O	her
O	arm;
O	and
O	on
O	removing
O	the
O	handkerchief
O	with
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	it
O	bounda
O	it
O	was
O	found
O	to
O	be
O	marked
O	with
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Harry
O	Bertram
O	.
O	No
O	further
O	evidence
O	could
O	be
O	procured
O	of
O	her
O	guilt
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	at
O	length
O	set
O	free
O	,
O	under
O	sentence
O	of
O	banishment
O	from
O	the
O	county
O	.
O	For
O	many
O	years
O	after
O	this
O	Mr
O	.
O	Bertram
O	continued
O	to
O	live
O	a
O	solitary
O	and
O	mournful
O	life
O	at
O	Ellangowan
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	dominie
O	never
O	ceased
O	to
O	blame
O	himself
O	for
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	the
O	boy
O	,
O	as
O	Harry
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	charge
O	on
O	the
O	day
O	on
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	disappeared;
O	but
O	he
O	still
O	lived
O	with
O	the
O	laird
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	chiefly
O	employed
O	in
O	teaching
O	Bertram
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	,
O	little
O	Lucy
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	now
O	growing
O	up
O	into
O	a
O	gentle
O	and
O	bonny
O	girl
O	.
O	The
O	laird
O	had
O	been
O	always
O	a
O	bad
O	man
O	of
O	business
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	his
O	wife
O	'
O	s
O	death
O	he
O	got
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	a
O	scheming
O	and
O	dishonest
O	attorney
O	named
O	Glossin
O	,
O	who
O	in
O	the
O	end
O	craftily
O	succeeded
O	in
O	making
O	himself
O	rich
O	at
O	the
O	expense
O	of
O	his
O	employer
O	.
O	The
O	debts
O	of
O	the
O	laird
O	became
O	at
O	length
O	so
O	many
O	that
O	the
O	property
O	at
O	Ellangowan
O	had
O	to
O	be
O	mortgaged
O	,
O	and
O	things
O	ultimately
O	went
O	so
O	badly
O	with
O	the
O	poor
O	owner
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	men
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	owed
O	so
O	much
O	money
O	determined
O	to
O	insist
O	on
O	the
O	estate
O	being
O	sold
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	furniture
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	rumoured
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	amongst
O	the
O	country-folk
O	that
O	Glossin
O	was
O	the
O	man
O	,
O	of
O	all
O	others
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	most
O	eager
O	to
O	turn
O	the
O	Bertrams
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	house
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	buy
O	the
O	property
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	become
O	the
O	Laird
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	property
O	in
O	Ellangowan
O	had
O	been
O	what
O	is
O	called
O	""""
O	settled
O	""""
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	way
O	that
O	it
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	sold
O	if
O	Mr
O	.
O	Bertram
O	had
O	a
O	son
O	living
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	therefore
O	likely
O	to
O	be
O	disposed
O	of
O	very
O	cheap
O	,
O	as
O	no
O	one
O	knew
O	for
O	certain
O	that
O	young
O	Bertram
O	was
O	dead;
O	while
O	if
O	he
O	should
O	happen
O	to
O	be
O	alive
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	still
O	a
O	chance
O	of
O	his
O	coming
O	back
O	and
O	claiming
O	the
O	estates
O	.
O	When
O	Glossin
O	,
O	the
O	attorney
O	,
O	found
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	more
O	to
O	be
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	client
O	in
O	the
O	way
O	of
O	money
O	,
O	he
O	commenced
O	openly
O	to
O	show
O	the
O	wickedness
O	of
O	his
O	bad
O	and
O	cruel
O	nature;
O	and
O	the
O	very
O	sight
O	of
O	him
O	became
O	hateful
O	to
O	the
O	unhappy
O	Godfrey
O	Bertram
O	.
O	So
O	things
O	went
O	on
O	until
O	Lucy
O	Bertram
O	was
O	seventeen
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	father
O	had
O	become
O	a
O	weak
O	and
O	poor
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	Glossin
O	determined
O	to
O	play
O	his
O	last
O	card
O	.
O	The
O	estates
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	were
O	advertised
O	to
O	be
O	sold
O	to
O	the
O	highest
O	bidder
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	was
O	fixed
O	for
O	the
O	auction
O	.
O	Before
O	describing
O	how
O	the
O	sale
O	took
O	place
O	,
O	it
O	will
O	be
O	necessary
O	to
O	tell
O	something
O	of
O	Guy
O	Mannering
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	as
O	will
O	be
O	remembered
O	,
O	had
O	left
O	Ellangowan
O	shortly
O	after
O	the
O	day
O	that
O	young
O	Harry
O	Bertram
O	was
O	born
O	.
O	He
O	became
O	a
O	soldier;
O	and
O	having
O	served
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	in
O	India
O	,
O	was
O	appointed
O	colonel
O	of
O	his
O	regiment
O	.
O	His
O	wife
O	and
O	daughter
O	were
O	with
O	him
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	become
O	very
O	intimate
O	with
O	a
O	young
O	officer
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	regiment
O	,
O	called
O	Vanbeest
O	Brown
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	supposed
O	,
O	had
O	came
O	from
O	Holland
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	previously
O	been
O	engaged
O	in
O	trade
O	of
O	some
O	kind
O	.
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	,
O	for
O	some
O	reason
O	,
O	never
O	cared
O	for
O	Brown
O	,
O	but
O	chiefly
O	because
O	he
O	had
O	foolishly
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	dishonourable
O	suggestions
O	of
O	a
O	friend
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	for
O	reasons
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	had
O	secretly
O	poisoned
O	his
O	mind
O	against
O	the
O	young
O	officer
O	.
O	The
O	dislike
O	ripened
O	after
O	some
O	time
O	into
O	an
O	open
O	quarrel
O	,
O	followed
O	by
O	a
O	duel
O	between
O	the
O	colonel
O	and
O	his
O	subaltern
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	,
O	after
O	exchanging
O	shots
O	,
O	Mannering
O	believed
O	he
O	killed
O	his
O	adversary
O	.
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Mannering
O	died
O	shortly
O	after
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	colonel
O	and
O	his
O	daughter
O	returned
O	to
O	England
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	so
O	happened
O	that
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	village
O	of
O	Kippletringan
O	a
O	day
O	or
O	two
O	before
O	the
O	time
O	at
O	which
O	the
O	sale
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	was
O	to
O	take
O	place
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	much
O	distressed
O	at
O	hearing
O	the
O	pitiable
O	account
O	that
O	was
O	given
O	to
O	him
O	of
O	his
O	old
O	friend
O	,
O	Godfrey
O	Bertram;
O	and
O	the
O	idea
O	at
O	once
O	occurred
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	buy
O	the
O	property
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	doing
O	so
O	help
O	the
O	laird
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	day
O	of
O	the
O	auction
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	Ellangowan
O	House
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	told
O	,
O	on
O	inquiry
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	old
O	laird
O	was
O	dangerously
O	ill
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	up
O	at
O	the
O	ruined
O	castle
O	in
O	company
O	with
O	his
O	daughter
O	.
O	Thither
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	went
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	old
O	Mr
O	.
O	Bertram
O	sitting
O	in
O	an
O	easy-
O	chair
O	on
O	the
O	slope
O	beside
O	the
O	castle
O	with
O	his
O	feet
O	wrapped
O	in
O	blankets
O	,
O	and
O	beside
O	him
O	his
O	daughter
O	and
O	the
O	dominie
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	handsome
O	young
O	man
O	whom
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	recognise
O	,
O	but
O	who
O	,
O	he
O	afterwards
O	learned
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	gentleman
O	called
O	Charles
O	Hazlewood
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	deeply
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	Miss
O	Bertram
O	.
O	Mannering
O	was
O	much
O	affected
O	when
O	the
O	old
O	laird
O	failed
O	to
O	remember
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	forgotten
O	his
O	hospitable
O	kindness
O	many
O	years
O	before
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	night
O	when
O	little
O	Harry
O	was
O	born
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	was
O	engaged
O	in
O	conversation
O	with
O	Miss
O	Bertram
O	and
O	her
O	companion
O	,
O	a
O	voice
O	was
O	heard
O	close
O	by
O	,
O	which
O	Lucy
O	at
O	once
O	recognised
O	as
O	that
O	of
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	enemy
O	,
O	Glossin
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	sent
O	the
O	dominie
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	away
O	.
O	The
O	sound
O	of
O	the
O	voice
O	had
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	also
O	reached
O	the
O	old

O	He

O	up
O	on

O	that

O	a
O	drunken
O	post-boy
O	reached

O	from
O	the
O	colonel
O	,
O	containing
O	instructions

O	It
O	had

O	delayed

O	way
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	now

O	Poor
O	Lucy
O	Bertram
O	now
O	found
O	herself
O	an
O	orphan
O	without
O	house
O	or
O	home;
O	but
O	the
O	kindness
O	of
O	some
O	neighbours
O	named
O	Mac-Morlan
O	,
O	to
O	some
O	extent
O	,
O	assuaged
O	the
O	misery
O	of
O	her
O	position
O	.
O	They
O	insisted
O	on
O	her
O	coming
O	to
O	live
O	with
O	them
O	and
O	Mr
O	.
O	Mac-Morlan
O	even
O	offered
O	the
O	dominie
O	a
O	clerkship
O	in
O	his
O	establishment
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	might
O	still

O	,
O	to

O	in
O	spite
O	of

O	He
O	received
O	one

O	very

O	,
O	from
O	a
O	great

O	of

O	who

O	This

O	Mervyn

O	in
O	reference
O	to
O	the

O	which
O	,
O	as

O	The

O	Colonel

O	,
O	however
O	,
O	no
O	idea
O	that
O	Brown
O	was
O	still
O	alive
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	daughter
O	was
O	afraid
O	to
O	tell
O	her
O	father
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	.
O	Captain
O	Brown
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	now
O	known
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	handsome

O	gallant
O	young

O	and
O	,
O	having
O	returned
O	to

O	with

O	,
O	and
O	being
O	still
O	deeply
O	devoted
O	to
O	Miss
O	Mannering
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	lost
O	no
O	time
O	in
O	making
O	his

O	where
O	she
O	was

O	When
O	Mannering
O	arrived
O	at
O	Mr
O	.
O	Mervyn
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	very
O	little
O	about
O	the
O	information
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	his
O	return;
O	but
O	he
O	told
O	his
O	daughter
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	a
O	place
O	near
O	Kippletringan
O	,
O	called
O	Woodbourne
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	meant
O	to
O	reside
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	.
O	He
O	also
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	a
O	pleasant
O	companion
O	in
O	Lucy
O	Bertram

O	the

O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	Woodbourne
O	was
O	made
O	ready
O	to
O	receive
O	them
O	,
O	the

O	Julia
O	took
O	up
O	their
O	residence
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	Lucy
O	Bertram
O	became
O	their
O	guest
O	.
O	Another

O	of
O	the

O	he
O	became
O	almost

O	Lucy

O	Hazlewood
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	a
O	gun
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	had
O	offered
O	his
O	arm
O	to
O	Miss
O	Mannering
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	tired
O	after
O	skating
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	walked
O	towards
O	home
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	proceeded
O	some
O	little
O	distance
O	in
O	this
O	way
O	,
O	Brown
O	happened
O	to
O	meet
O	them
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	wearing
O	the
O	rough
O	suit
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	spent
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	gipsy
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	,
O	having
O	been
O	unable
O	to
O	procure
O	a
O	change
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	portmanteau
O	having
O	been
O	stolen
O	.
O	Julia
O	Mannering
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	had
O	no
O	intimation
O	that
O	her
O	old
O	lover
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	district
O	,
O	uttered
O	a
O	scream
O	when
O	she
O	suddenly
O	saw
O	him
O	standing
O	before
O	her;
O	and
O	Hazlewood
O	,
O	fancying
O	from
O	the
O	rough
O	appearance
O	of
O	the
O	stranger
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	either
O	a
O	gipsy
O	or
O	a
O	tramp
O	,
O	pointed
O	his
O	gun
O	towards
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	ordered
O	him
O	to
O	keep
O	off
O	.
O	Brown
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	fit
O	of
O	jealousy
O	,
O	and
O	fearing
O	that
O	the
O	gun
O	might
O	go
O	off
O	,
O	rushed
O	upon
O	Hazlewood
O	and
O	seized
O	the
O	fowling-piece
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	the
O	struggle
O	which
O	ensued
O	between
O	them
O	it
O	was
O	discharged
O	by
O	accident
O	,
O	and
O	young
O	Hazlewood
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	wounded
O	in
O	the
O	shoulder
O	.
O	Brown
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	what
O	had
O	occurred
O	,
O	became
O	frightened
O	at
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	dangers
O	of
O	his
O	position
O	.
O	He
O	bounded
O	over
O	a
O	hedge
O	which
O	divided
O	the
O	footpath
O	from
O	the
O	plantation
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	not
O	heard
O	of
O	again
O	for
O	a
O	considerable
O	time
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	news
O	of
O	Hazlewood
O	'
O	s
O	being
O	wounded
O	getting
O	abroad
O	,
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	was
O	thrown
O	into
O	a
O	ferment
O	of
O	indignation
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	circumstances
O	of
O	the
O	occurrence
O	were
O	exaggerated
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	universally
O	believed
O	that
O	the
O	attacking
O	party
O	was
O	a
O	smuggler
O	or
O	a
O	gipsy
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	attempted
O	in
O	broad
O	daylight
O	to
O	murder
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	stated
O	that
O	the
O	assailant
O	had
O	been
O	seen
O	earlier
O	in
O	the
O	day
O	wearing
O	a
O	smuggler
O	'
O	s
O	cutlass;
O	and
O	the
O	purse
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	left
O	at
O	the
O	inn
O	was
O	opened
O	and
O	found
O	to
O	contain
O	property
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	previously
O	stolen
O	.
O	Charles
O	Hazlewood
O	himself
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	continued
O	to
O	protest
O	that
O	the
O	wounding
O	was
O	accidental;
O	while
O	the
O	only
O	person
O	who
O	could
O	give
O	any
O	real
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	mysterious
O	stranger
O	,
O	namely
O	Julia
O	Mannering
O	,
O	for
O	reasons
O	best
O	known
O	to
O	herself
O	,
O	never
O	pretended
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	any
O	idea
O	who
O	he
O	was
O	.
O	Amongst
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	most
O	active
O	in
O	their
O	endeavours
O	to
O	capture
O	the
O	missing
O	Brown
O	was
O	Glossin
O	,
O	the
O	new
O	Laird
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	plain
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	some
O	other
O	motive
O	for
O	apprehending
O	him
O	than
O	merely
O	the
O	desire
O	to
O	do
O	his
O	duty
O	as
O	a
O	magistrate
O	of
O	the
O	county
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	now
O	become
O	.
O	On
O	returning
O	to
O	his
O	house
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	informed
O	that
O	Mac-
O	Guffog
O	,
O	the
O	thief-taker
O	,
O	had
O	made
O	a
O	prisoner
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	waiting
O	with
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	prisoner
O	was
O	introduced
O	to
O	the
O	magistrate
O	'
O	s
O	room
O	,
O	Glossin
O	at
O	once
O	recognised
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	Dirck
O	Hatteraick
O	,
O	the
O	smuggler
O	captain
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	interview
O	which
O	took
O	place
O	between
O	them
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	else
O	being
O	present
O	,
O	it
O	transpired
O	that
O	Glossin
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	partner
O	with
O	the
O	smuggler
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	Kennedy
O	'
O	s
O	murder
O	and
O	the
O	disappearance
O	of
O	young
O	Harry
O	Bertram
O	.
O	Dirck
O	Hatteraick
O	told
O	him
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	very
O	plainly
O	,
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	condemned
O	he
O	would
O	let
O	the
O	secret
O	out
O	and
O	ruin
O	Glossin
O	.
O	Glossin
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	much
O	terrified
O	at
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	being
O	discovered
O	,
O	then
O	arranged
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	villain
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	to
O	imprison
O	Hatteraick
O	for
O	that
O	night
O	in
O	a
O	room
O	in
O	the
O	old
O	castle
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	give
O	him
O	a
O	small
O	file
O	with
O	which
O	he
O	might
O	rid
O	himself
O	of
O	his
O	handcuffs
O	and
O	escape
O	.
O	During
O	the
O	interview
O	between
O	them
O	,
O	Hatteraick
O	also
O	told
O	the
O	attorney
O	that
O	young
O	Bertram
O	was
O	still
O	alive
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	Kippletringan
O	.
O	Glossin
O	'
O	s
O	situation
O	was
O	therefore
O	perilous
O	in
O	the
O	extreme
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	schemes
O	of
O	a
O	life
O	of
O	villainy
O	seemed
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	be
O	crumbling
O	around
O	and
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	Hatteraick
O	was
O	accordingly
O	then
O	sent
O	to
O	his
O	place
O	of
O	confinement
O	in
O	the
O	old
O	castle
O	.
O	At
O	midnight
O	Glossin
O	looked
O	out
O	from
O	his
O	bedroom
O	towards
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	watching
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	an
O	agony
O	of
O	guilty
O	suspense
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	dark
O	form
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	knew
O	to
O	be
O	Hatteraick
O	,
O	drop
O	from
O	the
O	prison
O	window
O	and
O	make
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	succeeded
O	in
O	shoving
O	out
O	a
O	boat
O	which
O	was
O	lying
O	there
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	after
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	hoisted
O	the
O	sail
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	disappeared
O	round
O	the
O	Point
O	of
O	Warroch
O	.
O	Great
O	was
O	the
O	alarm
O	and
O	confusion
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	discovered
O	that
O	the
O	smuggler
O	had
O	escaped
O	from
O	prison
O	.
O	Constables
O	were
O	sent
O	out
O	in
O	every
O	direction
O	to
O	search
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	Glossin
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	send
O	them
O	to
O	places
O	where
O	they
O	would
O	be
O	least
O	likely
O	to
O	find
O	him
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	he
O	himself
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	a
O	cave
O	by
O	the
O	seashore
O	near
O	the
O	Point
O	of
O	Warroch
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	arranged
O	with
O	Hatteraick
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	the
O	day
O	after
O	his
O	escape
O	.
O	Glossin
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	near
O	this
O	spot
O	since
O	the
O	day
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	Kennedy
O	was
O	murdered;
O	and
O	the
O	terrible
O	scene
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	mind
O	with
O	all
O	its
O	accompaniments
O	of
O	horror
O	as
O	he
O	stealthily
O	approached
O	the
O	cavern
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	reached
O	it
O	and
O	went
O	in
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	Hatteraick
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	and
O	shivering
O	with
O	cold
O	.
O	During
O	the
O	conversation
O	that
O	ensued
O	between
O	them
O	he
O	learned
O	from
O	the
O	smuggler
O	what
O	had
O	become
O	of
O	young
O	Bertram
O	after
O	Kennedy
O	'
O	s
O	murder
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	taken
O	to
O	Holland
O	,
O	Hatteraick
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	with
O	an
O	old
O	merchant
O	named
O	Vanbeest
O	Brown
O	,
O	who
O	took
O	a
O	fancy
O	to
O	the
O	boy
O	and
O	called
O	him
O	by
O	his
O	own
O	name
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	afterwards
O	been
O	sent
O	to
O	India;
O	but
O	the
O	smuggler
O	knew
O	nothing
O	of
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	time
O	he
O	went
O	there
O	.
O	Bertram
O	had
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	been
O	seen
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	before
O	,
O	among
O	the
O	hills
O	by
O	a
O	gipsy
O	named
O	Gabriel
O	.
O	Glossin
O	then
O	discovered
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	young
O	Bertram
O	,
O	in
O	reality
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	wounded
O	Hazlewood
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	terror
O	at
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	losing
O	his
O	property
O	at
O	Ellangowan
O	if
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	be
O	known
O	that
O	Harry
O	Bertram
O	was
O	alive
O	,
O	yet
O	at
O	all
O	times
O	fertile
O	in
O	every
O	kind
O	of
O	villainous
O	device
O	,
O	Glossin
O	now
O	hit
O	upon
O	a
O	new
O	plan
O	to
O	get
O	rid
O	of
O	the
O	man
O	who
O	stood
O	between
O	him
O	and
O	his
O	peace
O	of
O	mind
O	.
O	By
O	making
O	large
O	promises
O	to
O	Hatteraick
O	he
O	induced
O	the
O	smuggler
O	to
O	agree
O	to
O	come
O	by
O	night
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	large
O	body
O	of
O	his
O	men
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	prison
O	where
O	Bertram
O	would
O	be
O	confined
O	for
O	his
O	attack
O	on
O	Hazlewood
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	break
O	open
O	the
O	doors
O	and
O	carry
O	him
O	off
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	the
O	soldiers
O	withdrawn
O	on
O	some
O	pretence
O	or
O	other
O	,
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	rescue
O	more
O	certain;
O	and
O	having
O	completed
O	the
O	details
O	of
O	this
O	desperate
O	and
O	lawless
O	piece
O	of
O	villainy
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	Ellangowan
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	is
O	time
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	Brown
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	now
O	a
O	fugitive
O	from
O	justice
O	in
O	consequence
O	of
O	the
O	unlucky
O	accident
O	of
O	which
O	his
O	rashness
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	cause
O	.
O	He
O	determined
O	to
O	make
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	England
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	wait
O	there
O	until
O	he
O	received
O	letters
O	from
O	friends
O	in
O	his
O	regiment
O	establishing
O	his
O	identity
O	,
O	in
O	possession
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	could
O	again
O	show
O	himself
O	at
O	Kippletringan
O	,
O	and
O	offer
O	to
O	young
O	Hazlewood
O	any
O	explanation
O	or
O	satisfaction
O	he
O	might
O	require
O	.
O	He
O	accordingly
O	took
O	ship
O	for
O	Cumberland
O	.
O	He
O	chanced
O	on
O	board
O	to
O	meet
O	a
O	man
O	whose
O	daughter
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	in
O	Colonel
O	Mannering
O	'
O	s
O	service
O	at
O	Woodbourne
O	and
O	by
O	his
O	means
O	contrived
O	to
O	get
O	a
O	letter
O	delivered
O	to
O	Miss

O	in

O	to
O	forgive
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	rash
O	conduct
O	towards
O	Hazlewood
O	.
O	Having
O	landed
O	on
O	the
O	English
O	coast
O	,
O	he
O	wrote
O	to
O	the
O	colonel
O	of

O	regiment
O	for
O	such
O	testimony
O	of

O	in
O	the

O	as
O	should
O	place
O	his

O	as
O	a
O	gentleman
O	and
O	an
O	officer
O	beyond
O	question;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	now
O	reduced
O	to
O	great
O	straits
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	funds
O	,
O	he
O	wrote
O	to
O	his
O	sturdy
O	farmer
O	friend
O	,
O	Dandie
O	Dinmont
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	loan
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	money
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	delay
O	of
O	some
O	days
O	,
O	he
O	received
O	a
O	short
O	letter
O	from
O	Miss
O	Mannering
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	she
O	upbraided
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	thoughtless
O	conduct
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	good-bye
O	,
O	telling
O	him
O	on
O	no
O	account
O	to
O	come
O	back
O	to
O	Woodbourne
O	.
O	On
O	reading
O	it
O	over
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	somehow
O	to
O	the
O	conclusion
O	that
O	Miss
O	Mannering
O	meant
O	the
O	opposite
O	of
O	all
O	she
O	had
O	written
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	this
O	belief
O	he
O	set
O	sail
O	at
O	once
O	for
O	Kippletringan
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	rough
O	and
O	dangerous
O	voyage
O	by
O	night
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	the

O	coast
O	.
O	The

O	cape
O	,
O	that
O	stretched
O	into
O	the

O	,

O	some
O	little

O	from
O	the
O	vessel;
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	answer
O	to
O	Brown
O	'
O	s
O	inquiries
O	,
O	the
O	boatman
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	it

O	Close
O	beside

O	at

O	ashore
O	for
O	the
O	purpose
O	of

O	more

O	The
O	boatman
O	readily
O	acceded
O	to

O	landed
O	him
