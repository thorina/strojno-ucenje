O	that
O	a

O	sea
O	,
O	now
O	sinking
O	to

O	was
O	sweeping
O	up
O	on
O	the

O	,
O	a
O	little

O	in

O	,
O	on
O	a

O	of

O	and

O	lay
O	a
O	most
O	beautiful
O	babe
O	,
O	who
O	smiled
O	in
O	his
O	sleep
O	.
O	That
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	Odin
O	they
O	had
O	no
O	doubt
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	made
O	him
O	their

O	and

O	faithfully
O	and
O	loyally
O	for
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	his
O	life
O	.
O	A
O	worthy
O	and
O	a
O	noble
O	king
O	was
O	King
O	Scyld
O	Scefing
O	,
O	a
O	ruler
O	on
O	land
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	even
O	as
O	an
O	infant
O	he
O	had
O	had
O	no
O	fear
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	many
O	years
O	had
O	come
O	and

O	,
O	and
O	when
O	Scyld

O	he
O	called
O	his
O	nobles
O	to

O	told
O	them
O	in
O	what
O	manner
O	he
O	fain
O	would
O	pass
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	did
O	as
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	ship
O	they
O	built
O	a
O	funeral

O	,
O	and
O	on
O	it
O	laid
O	a
O	sheaf
O	of

O	.
O	Then
O	with
O	very
O	great
O	pain
O	and
O	labour
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	old
O	and
O	Death's
O	hand
O	lay
O	heavy
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	climbed
O	into
O	the
O	ship
O	and
O	stretched
O	out
O	his
O	limbs
O	on
O	the
O	pyre
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	farewell
O	to
O	all
O	his
O	faithful
O	people
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	ship
O	drifted
O	out
O	with
O	the
O	tide
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	the
O	watchers
O	were
O	heavy
O	as
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	sails
O	of
O	the
O	vessel
O	that
O	bore
O	him
O	vanish
O	into
O	the
O	grey
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	that
O	their
O	king
O	had
O	gone
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	from
O	whence
O	he
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	look
O	on
O	his
O	face
O	no
O	more
O	.
O	Behind
O	him
O	Scyld
O	left
O	descendants
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	after
O	the
O	other
O	reigned
O	over
O	Denmark
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	reign
O	of
O	his
O	great-grandson
O	,
O	Hrothgar
O	,
O	that
O	there
O	took
O	place
O	those
O	things
O	that
O	are
O	told
O	in

O	story
O	of

O	.
O	A

O	was
O	Hrothgar
O	,
O	and
O	far
O	across
O	the
O	northern
O	seas
O	his
O	fame
O	spread
O	wide
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	warriors
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	that
O	he
O	ruled
O	were
O	proud
O	to
O	serve
O	under
O	him
O	in
O	peace
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	war
O	to
O	die
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	During
O	his
O	long
O	life
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	men
O	never
O	went
O	forth
O	in
O	their
O	black-prowed
O	ships
O	without
O	returning
O	with
O	the
O	joyous
O	shouts
O	of
O	the
O	victor
O	,
O	with
O	for
O	cargo
O	the
O	rich
O	spoil
O	they
O	had
O	won
O	from
O	their
O	enemies
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	grew
O	old
O	,
O	Hrothgar
O	determined
O	to
O	raise
O	for
O	himself
O	a
O	mighty
O	monument
O	to
O	the
O	magnificence
O	of
O	his
O	reign
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	there
O	was
O	builded
O	for
O	him
O	a
O	vast
O	hall
O	with
O	majestic
O	towers
O	and
O	lofty
O	pinnacles--the
O	finest
O	banqueting-hall
O	that
O	his
O	skilled
O	artificers
O	could
O	dream
O	of
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	at
O	length
O	the
O	hall
O	was
O	completed
O	,
O	Hrothgar
O	gave
O	a
O	feast
O	to
O	all
O	his
O	thanes
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	days
O	and
O	for

O	on
O	end
O	the
O	great
O	rafters
O	of
O	Heorot--as
O	his

O	the
O	shouts
O	and
O	laughter
O	of
O	the
O	mighty
O	warriors
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	music
O	of
O	the
O	minstrels
O	and
O	the
O	songs
O	that
O	they
O	sang
O	.
O	A
O	proud
O	man
O	was
O	Hrothgar
O	on
O	the
O	night
O	that
O	the
O	banquet
O	was
O	ended
O	amidst

O	blood-stains
O	behind
O	.
O	Terrible
O	indeed
O	was
O	the
O	grief
O	of
O	Hrothgar
O	,
O	but
O	still
O	more
O	terrible
O	was
O	his
O	anger
O	.
O	He
O	offered
O	a
O	royal
O	reward
O	to
O	any
O	man
O	who
O	would
O	slay
O	the
O	Grendel
O	,
O	and
O	full
O	gladly
O	ten
O	of
O	his
O	warriors
O	pledged
O	themselves
O	to
O	sleep
O	that
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	hall
O	and
O	to
O	slay
O	the
O	Grendel
O	ere
O	morning
O	came
O	.
O	But
O	dawn
O	showed
O	once
O	more
O	a
O	piteous
O	sight
O	.
O	Again
O	there
O	were
O	only
O	trampled
O	and
O	blood-stained
O	rushes
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	loathsome
O	smell
O	of
O	unclean
O	flesh
O	.
O	Again
O	the
O	foul
O	tracks
O	of
O	the
O	monster
O	were
O	found
O	where
O	it
O	had
O	padded
O	softly
O	back
O	to
O	its
O	noisome
O	fens
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	many
O	brave
O	men
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Hrothgar
O	the
O	Dane
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	again
O	did
O	they
O	strive
O	to
O	maintain
O	the
O	dignity
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	hall
O	,
O	Heorot
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	uphold
O	the
O	honour
O	of
O	their
O	king
O	.
O	But
O	through
O	twelve
O	dismal
O	years
O	the
O	Grendel
O	took
O	its
O	toll
O	of
O	the
O	bravest
O	in
O	the
O	realm
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	sleep
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	that
O	Hrothgar
O	had
O	built
O	as
O	monument
O	to
O	his
O	magnificent
O	supremacy
O	,
O	ever
O	meant
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	sleeper
O	,
O	shameful
O	death
O	.
O	Well
O	content
O	was
O	the
O	Grendel
O	,
O	that
O	grew
O	fat
O	and
O	lusty
O	amongst
O	the
O	grey
O	mists
O	of
O	the
O	black
O	marshes
O	,
O	unknowing
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	Goths
O	there
O	was
O	growing
O	to
O	manhood
O	one
O	whose
O	feet
O	already
O	should
O	be
O	echoing
O	along
O	that
O	path
O	from
O	which
O	Death
O	was
O	to
O	come
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	realm
O	of
O	the
O	Goths
O	,
O	Hygelac
O	was
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	no

O	hero
O	lived
O	in
O	his
O	kingdom
O	than
O	Beowulf
O	,
O	his
O	own
O	sister's
O	son
O	.
O	From
O	the
O	age
O	of
O	seven
O	Beowulf
O	was
O	brought
O	up
O	at
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	his
O	uncle
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	,
O	fair
O	,
O	blue-eyed
O	lad
O	was
O	Beowulf
O	,
O	lazy
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	slow
O	to
O	wrath
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	at
O	last
O	become
O	a
O	yellow-haired
O	giant
O	,
O	of
O	wondrous
O	good-temper
O	,
O	and
O	leisurely
O	in
O	movement
O	,
O	the
O	other
O	young
O	warriors
O	of
O	Gothland
O	had
O	mocked
O	at
O	him
O	as
O	at
O	one
O	who
O	was
O	only
O	a
O	very
O	huge
O	,
O	very
O	amiable
O	child
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	like
O	others
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	descent
O	,
O	Beowulf's
O	anger
O	,
O	if
O	slow
O	to

O	,
O	was
O	a
O	terrible
O	fire
O	once
O	it
O	began
O	to
O	flame
O	.
O	A
O	few
O	of
O	those
O	flares-up
O	had
O	shown
O	the
O	folk
O	of
O	his
O	uncle's
O	kingdom
O	that
O	no
O	mean
O	nor
O	evil
O	deed
O	might
O	lightly
O	be
O	done
O	,
O	nor
O	evil
O	word
O	spoken
O	in
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	Beowulf
O	.
O	In
O	battle
O	against
O	the
O	Swedes
O	,
O	no
O	sword
O	had
O	hewn
O	down
O	more
O	men
O	than
O	the
O	sword
O	of
O	Beowulf
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	champion
O	swimmer
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	Goths
O	challenged
O	the
O	young
O	giant
O	Beowulf
O	to
O	swim
O	a
O	match
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	five
O	whole
O	days
O	they
O	swam
O	together
O	.
O	A
O	tempest
O	driving
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	twilight
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	ice
O	and

O	parted
O	them
O	then
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	who
O	had

O	champion
O	was
O	driven
O	ashore
O	and
O	thankfully

O	on
O	to
O	the

O	of

O	dear
O	country
O	once
O	again
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	foaming
O	seas
O	cast
O	Beowulf
O	on
O	some
O	jagged
O	cliffs
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	fain
O	have
O	battered
O	his
O	body
O	into
O	broken
O	fragments
O	against
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	fought
O	and

O	to
O	resist
O	their
O	raging
O	cruelty
O	,

O	with

O	waves
O	and
O	strove
O	to
O	wrest
O	his
O	life
O	from
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	while
O	with
O	one
O	hand
O	he
O	held
O	on
O	to
O	a
O	sharp
O	rock
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	he
O	dealt
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	stark
O	blows
O	on
O	those
O	children
O	of
O	the
O	deep
O	who
O	would
O	fain
O	have
O	devoured
O	him
O	.
O	Their
O	bodies
O	,
O	deep-gashed
O	and
O	dead
O	,
O	floated
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	Gothland
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	all
O	those
O	who
O	looked
O	for
O	the
O	corpse
O	of
O	Beowulf
O	saw

O	,
O	amazed
O	.
O	Then
O	at
O	length
O	came
O	Beowulf
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	great
O	gladness
O	was
O	he
O	welcomed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	his
O	uncle
O	,
O	gave
O	him
O	his
O	treasured
O	sword
O	,
O	Nägeling
O	,
O	in
O	token
O	of
O	his
O	valour
O	.
O	In

O	of
O	Hrothgar
O	,
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	brave
O	warriors
O	ever
O	grew
O	smaller
O	.
O	One
O	man
O	only
O	had
O	witnessed
O	the
O	terrible
O	slaughter
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	those
O	black
O	nights
O	and
O	yet
O	had
O	kept
O	his
O	life
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	bard--a
O	scald--and
O	from
O	the
O	land
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	such
O	grim
O	horror
O	,
O	he
O	fled
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	Goths
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	he
O	sang
O	the
O	gloomy
O	tale
O	of
O	the
O	never-ending
O	slaughter
O	of
O	noble
O	warriors
O	by
O	the
O	foul
O	Grendel
O	of
O	the
O	fens
O	and
O	moors
O	.
O	Beowulf
O	listened
O	,
O	enthralled
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	song
O	.
O	But
O	those
O	who
O	knew
O	him
O	saw
O	his
O	eyes
O	gleam
O	as
O	the
O	good
O	steel
O	blade
O	of
O	a
O	sword
O	gleams
O	when
O	it
O	is
O	drawn
O	for
O	battle
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	asked
O	his
O	uncle
O	to
O	allow
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	of

O	with
O	no
O	surprise
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	very
O	well
O	content
O	.
O	So
O	it
O	came
O	to

O	The

O	was
O	riding
O	his

O	one
O	morning

O	beheld
