O	always
O	more

O	that
O	gold

O	An

O	,
O	and
O	timidly
O	plunged
O	in
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	shoulders
O	.
O	Almost
O	he
O	expected
O	to
O	feel
O	the
O	harsh
O	grit
O	of
O	golden
O	water
O	,
O	but
O	instead
O	there
O	was
O	the
O	joy
O	he
O	had
O	known
O	as
O	a
O	peasant
O	boy
O	when
O	he
O	laved
O	his
O	face
O	and
O	drank
O	at
O	a
O	cool
O	spring
O	when
O	his
O	day's
O	toil
O	was
O	ended
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	raised
O	his
O	face
O	from
O	the
O	pool
O	,
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	his
O	hateful
O	power
O	had
O	passed
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	under
O	the
O	water
O	he
O	saw
O	grains
O	of
O	gold
O	glittering
O	in
O	the
O	sand
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	that
O	time
O	forth
O	the
O	river
O	Pactolus
O	was
O	noted
O	for
O	its
O	gold
O	.
O	One
O	lesson
O	the
O	peasant
O	king
O	had
O	learnt
O	by
O	paying
O	in
O	suffering
O	for
O	a
O	mistake
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	yet
O	more
O	suffering
O	in
O	store
O	for
O	the
O	tragic
O	comedian
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	now
O	no
O	wish
O	for
O	golden
O	riches
O	,
O	nor
O	even
O	for

O	it

O	the

O	headdress
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	But
O	although
O	much
O	gold
O	had
O	bought
O	his
O	silence
O	,
O	the
O	court
O	barber
O	was
O	unquiet
O	of
O	heart
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	and
O	all
O	through
O	the
O	night
O	he
O	was
O	tormented
O	by
O	his
O	weighty
O	secret
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	,
O	at
O	length
O	,
O	silence
O	was
O	to
O	him
O	a
O	torture
O	too
O	great
O	to
O	be
O	borne;
O	he
O	sought
O	a
O	lonely
O	place
O	,
O	there
O	dug
O	a
O	deep
O	hole
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	kneeling
O	by
O	it
O	,
O	softly
O	whispered
O	to
O	the
O	damp
O	earth:
O	"""King"
O	Midas
O	has
O	ass's
O	ears
O	.
O	""""
O	Greatly
O	relieved
O	,
O	he
O	hastened
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	well
O	content
O	until
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	his
O	secret
O	lay
O	buried
O	,
O	rushes
O	grew
O	up
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	winds
O	blew
O	through
O	them
O	,
O	the
O	rushes
O	whispered
O	for
O	all
O	those
O	who
O	passed
O	by
O	to
O	hear:
O	"""King"
O	Midas
O	has
O	ass's
O	ears
O	!
O	King
O	Midas
O	has
O	ass's
O	ears
O	!
O	""""
O	Those
O	who
O	listen
O	very
O	carefully
O	to
O	what
O	the
O	green
O	rushes
O	in
O	marshy
O	places
O	whisper
O	as
O	the
O	wind
O	passes
O	through
O	them
O	,
O	may
O	hear
O	the
O	same
O	thing
O	to
O	this
O	day
O	.
O	And
O	those
O	who
O	hear
O	the
O	whisper
O	of
O	the
O	rushes
O	may
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	give
O	a
O	pitying
O	thought
O	to
O	Midas--the

O	.
