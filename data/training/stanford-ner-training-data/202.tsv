O	stair
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	tower
O	chamber
O	where
O	the
O	sleeping
O	Princess
O	lay
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	moment
O	he
O	stood
O	and
O	gazed
O	in
O	wonder
O	at
O	her
O	lovely
O	face;
O	then
O	he
O	sank
O	on
O	his
O	knees
O	beside
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	kissed
O	her
O	as
O	she
O	lay
O	asleep
O	.
O	Instantly
O	the
O	spell
O	was
O	broken
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	and
O	Queen
O	awoke
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	courtiers
O	with
O	them;
O	the
O	horses
O	neighed
O	in
O	the
O	stables
O	,
O	and
O	shook
O	their
O	glossy
O	manes;
O	the
O	pigeons
O	cooed
O	upon
O	the
O	roof;
O	the
O	flies
O	on
O	the
O	wall
O	moved
O	again;
O	the
O	fire
O	burnt
O	up
O	brightly;
O	and
O	the
O	meat
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen
O	began
O	to
O	frizzle
O	once
O	more
O	as
O	the
O	spit
O	turned
O	round
O	.
O	The
O	cook
O	gave
O	the
O	kitchen
O	boy
O	the
O	tremendous
O	box
O	on
O	the
O	ear
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	started
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	ago
O	,
O	and
O	everything
O	and
O	everybody
O	went
O	on
O	just
O	as
O	usual
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	nothing
O	at
O	all
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	common
O	had
O	occurred
O	.
O	And
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	tower
O	chamber
O	the
O	Princess
O	opened
O	her
O	eyes
O	to
O	meet
O	the
O	gaze
O	of
O	the
O	Prince
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	dared
O	to
O	risk
O	his
O	life
O	for
O	her
O	sake
O	.
O	What
O	they
O	said
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	nobody
O	quite
O	knows
O	,
O	for
O	nobody
O	was
O	there
O	to
O	hear
O	or
O	see
O	.
O	But
O	whatever
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	it
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	something
O	very
O	satisfactory;
O	for
O	very
O	soon
O	after
O	they
O	were
O	married
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	happily
O	ever
O	afterwards
O	.
