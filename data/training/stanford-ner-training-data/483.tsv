O	The
O	land
O	was
O	lean
O	and
O	hungry
O	.
O	The
O	Old
O	Man
O	of
O	the
O	North
O	Lodge
O	had
O	breathed
O	upon
O	the
O	valley
O	.
O	His
O	breath
O	had
O	frozen
O	the
O	corn
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	bread
O	for
O	the
O	people
O	.
O	The
O	Indian
O	hunters
O	took
O	to
O	the
O	chase
O	.
O	They
O	followed
O	every
O	track
O	of
O	deer
O	or
O	rabbit
O	.
O	If
O	their
O	arrows
O	brought
O	them
O	meat
O	,
O	they
O	threw
O	it
O	over
O	their
O	shoulders
O	and
O	ran
O	to
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	hungry
O	women
O	and
O	children
O	might
O	eat
O	.
O	But
O	one
O	Indian
O	remained
O	in
O	his
O	wigwam
O	.
O	He
O	sat
O	by
O	the
O	fire
O	with
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	child
O	,
O	and
O	waited
O	for
O	the
O	hunters
O	to
O	bring
O	game
O	.
O	This
O	man
O	refused
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	the
O	hunt
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	lazy
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	he
O	sat
O	by
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	smoked
O	his
O	pipe
O	.
O	Once
O	in
O	a

O	,
O	he
O	would
O	stir
O	the
O	water
O	in

O	kettle

O	he
O	kept
O	boiling
O	for
O	the
O	meat
O	that
O	he
O	hoped
O	the
O	hunters
O	might
O	bring
O	.
O	Whenever
O	the
O	child
O	,
O	his
