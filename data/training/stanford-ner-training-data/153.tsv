O	It

O	I
O	do

O	The
O	old
O	Hellenes
O	said
O	that
O	it
O	hung
O	in
O	Colchis
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	call
O	the
O	Circassian
O	coast
O	,
O	nailed
O	to
O	a
O	beech
O	tree
O	in
O	the
O	war-god
O	'
O	s
O	wood;
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	fleece
O	of
O	the
O	wondrous
O	ram
O	,
O	who
O	bore
O	Phrixus
O	and
O	Helle
O	across
O	the
O	Euxine
O	Sea
O	.
O	For
O	Phrixus
O	and
O	Helle
O	were
O	the
O	children
O	of
O	the
O	cloud
O	nymph
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	Athamas
O	the
O	Minuan
O	king
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	a
O	famine
O	came
O	upon
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	their
O	cruel
O	stepmother
O	,
O	Ino
O	,
O	wished
O	to
O	kill
O	them
O	,
O	that
O	her
O	own
O	children
O	might
O	reign
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	they
O	must
O	be
O	sacrificed
O	on
O	an
O	altar
O	,
O	to
O	turn
O	away
O	the
O	anger
O	of
O	the
O	gods
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	poor
O	children
O	were
O	brought
O	to
O	the
O	altar
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	priest
O	stood
O	ready
O	with
O	his
O	knife
O	,
O	when
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	clouds
O	came
O	the
O	Golden
O	Ram
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	them
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	vanished
O	.
O	Then
O	madness
O	came
O	upon
O	that
O	foolish
O	king
O	Athamas
O	,
O	and
O	ruin
O	upon
O	Ino
O	and
O	her
O	children
O	.
O	For
O	Athamas
O	killed
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	in
O	his
O	fury
O	,
O	and
O	Ino
O	fled
O	from
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	leaped
O	from
O	a
O	cliff
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	changed
O	into
O	a
O	dolphin
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	you
O	have
O	seen
O	,
O	which
O	wanders
O	over
O	the
O	waves
O	forever
O	sighing
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	little
O	one
O	clasped
O	to
O	its
O	breast
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	people
O	drove
O	out
O	King
O	Athamas
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	had
O	killed
O	his
O	child;
O	and
O	he
O	roamed
O	about
O	in
O	his
O	misery
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	Oracle
O	in
O	Delphi
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Oracle
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	wander
O	for
O	his
O	sin
O	,
O	till
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	should
O	feast
O	him
O	as
O	their
O	guest
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	in
O	hunger
O	and
O	sorrow
O	for
O	many
O	a
O	weary
O	day
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	pack
O	of
O	wolves
O	.
O	The
O	wolves
O	were
O	tearing
O	a
O	sheep;
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	Athamas
O	they
O	fled
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	sheep
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	ate
O	of
O	it;
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	oracle
O	was
O	fulfilled
O	at
O	last
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	wandered
O	no
O	more;
O	but
O	settled
O	,
O	and
O	built
O	a
O	town
O	,
O	and
O	became
O	a
O	king
O	again
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	ram
O	carried
O	the
O	two
O	children
O	far
O	away
O	over
O	land
O	and
O	sea
O	,
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	Thracian
O	Chersonese
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	Helle
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	So
O	those
O	narrow
O	straits
O	are
O	called
O	""""
O	Hellespont
O	,
O	""""
O	after
O	her;
O	and
O	they
O	bear
O	that
O	name
O	until
O	this
O	day
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	ram
O	flew
O	on
O	with
O	Phrixus
O	to
O	the
O	northeast
O	across
O	the
O	sea
O	which
O	we
O	call
O	the
O	Black
O	Sea
O	now;
O	but
O	the
O	Hellenes
O	called
O	it
O	Euxine
O	.
O	And
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	they
O	say
O	,
O	he
O	stopped
O	at
O	Colchis
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	steep
O	Circassian
O	coast;
O	and
O	there
O	Phrixus
O	married
O	Chalchiope
O	,
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	Aietes
O	the
O	king;
O	and
O	offered
O	the
O	ram
O	in
O	sacrifice;
O	and
O	Aietes
O	nailed
O	the
O	ram
O	'
O	s
O	fleece
O	to
O	a
O	beech
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	grove
O	of
O	Ares
O	the
O	war
O	god
O	.
O	And
O	after
O	awhile
O	Phrixus
O	died
O	,
O	and
O	was

O	but
O	his

O	wondrous
O	cures
O	on

O	he
O	used
O	to

O	And

O	which

O	And
O	Peleus
O	had
O	married
O	a

O	nymph
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	wedding
O	is
O	famous
O	to
O	this

O	And
O	AEneas

O	And
O	Jason
O	looked
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	plains
O	of
O	Thessaly
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	Lapithai

O	their

O	Pelion
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	stood
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	looked
O	east
O	and
O	saw
O	the

O	,
O	which
O	stretched
O	away
O	forever
O	toward
O	the

O	Then
O	he
O	looked
O	south

O	a

O	pious
O	,
O	and
O	wiser
O	than
O	all

O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	a
O	cliff
O	,
O	and
O	prayed
O	for
O	them
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	come
O	home
O	safe
O	and
O	well;
O	while
O	the
O	heroes
O	rowed
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	watched

O	standing
O	on

O	,
O	and

O	,

O	feasted

O	and
O	stored
O	their

O	at

O	lay

O	came
O	down
O	on

O	in

O	for
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	six
O	arms
O	,

O	they
O	fought
O	with
O	young

O	Heracles
O	killed
O	them

O	,
O	among

O	And
O	they
O	wept
O	over

O	host
O	,
O	and
O	laid
O	him
O	on
O	a

O	,
O	and
O	heaped
O	a
O	huge

O	over
O	him

O	and
O	offered
O	black

O	at

O	,

O	Orpheus
O	sang
O	a

O	song
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	that
O	his

O	And
O	then
O	they
O	held

O	at

O	,
O	after
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	Jason
O	gave
O	prizes
O	to
O	each
O	winner
O	.
O	To
O	Ancæus
O	he
O	gave
O	a
O	golden
O	cup
O	,
O	for

O	wrestled

O	to
O	Heracles
O	a
O	silver
O	one
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	strongest
O	of
O	all;
O	and
O	to
O	Castor
O	,
O	who
O	rode
O	best
O	,
O	a
O	golden
O	crest;
O	and
O	Polydeuces
O	the

O	had
O	a

O	,
O	and
O	to

O	for
O	his

O	,
O	a
O	sandal
O	with
O	golden

O	.
O	But
O	Jason
O	himself

O	the
O	best
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	archers
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Minuai
O	crowned

O	so
O	,
O	the
O	songs

O	,
O	the
O	soul
O	of
O	good
O	Cyzicus
O	was
O	appeased
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	heroes
O	went
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	in
O	peace
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	Cyzicus
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	heard
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	dead
O	,
O	she
O	died
O	likewise
O	of
O	grief;
O	and
O	her
O	tears
O	became
O	a
O	fountain
O	of
O	clear
O	water
O	,
O	which
O	flows
O	the
O	whole
O	year
O	round
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	rowed
O	away
O	,
O	the
O	songs

O	,
O	along
O	the
O	Mysian
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	past
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	Rhindacus
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	found
O	a
O	pleasant

O	,

O	by
O	the
O	long
O	ridges
O	of
O	Arganthus
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	high
O	walls
O	of

O	.
O	And
O	there
O	they
O	ran
O	the
O	ship
O	ashore
O	upon
O	the
O	yellow
O	sand
O	,
O	and
O	furled
O	the
O	sail
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	mast
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	lashed
O	it
O	in
O	its
O	crutch
O	.
O	And
O	next
O	they
O	let
O	down
O	the
O	ladder
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	ashore
O	to
O	sport
O	and
O	rest
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	Heracles
O	went
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	bow
O	in
O	hand
O	,
O	to
O	hunt
O	wild
O	deer;
O	and
O	Hylas
O	the
O	fair
O	boy
O	slipt
O	away
O	after
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	followed
O	him
O	by
O	stealth
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	lost
O	himself
O	among
O	the
O	glens
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	weary
O	to
O	rest
O	himself
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	a
O	lake;
O	and
O	there
O	the
O	water
O	nymphs
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	loved
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	him
O	down
O	under
O	the
O	lake
O	to
O	be
O	their
O	playfellow
O	,
O	forever
O	happy
O	and
O	young
O	.
O	And
O	Heracles
O	sought
O	for
O	him
O	in
O	vain
O	,
O	shouting
O	his
O	name
O	till
O	all
O	the
O	mountains
O	rang;
O	but
O	Hylas
O	never
O	heard
O	him
O	,
O	far
O	down
O	under
O	the
O	sparkling
O	lake
O	.
O	So

O	behind
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	saw
O	the
