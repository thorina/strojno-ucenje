O	A
O	STORY
O	OF
O	CHRISTOPHER
O	COLUMBUS
O	FOR
O	LITTLE
O	CHILDREN
O	By
O	Elizabeth
O	Harrison
O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	far
O	across
O	the
O	great
O	ocean
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	little
O	boy
O	named
O	Christopher
O	.
O	The
O	city
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	lived
O	was
O	called
O	Genoa
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	time
O	that
O	little
O	Christopher
O	could
O	first
O	remember
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	boats
O	come
O	and
O	go
O	across
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	I
O	doubt
O	not
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	little
O	boats
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	which
O	he
O	tried
O	to
O	sail
O	,
O	or
O	paddle
O	about
O	on
O	the
O	small
O	pools
O	near
O	his
O	home
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	he
O	was
O	old
O	enough
O	to
O	read
O	books
O	,
O	which
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	were
O	very
O	scarce
O	and
O	very
O	much
O	valued
O	,
O	he
O	got
O	hold
O	of
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	wonderful
O	travels
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	named
O	Marco
O	Polo
O	.
O	Over
O	and
O	over
O	again
O	little
O	Christopher
O	read
O	the
O	marvelous
O	stories
O	told
O	by
O	this
O	old
O	traveler
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	strange
O	cities
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	dark-colored
O	people
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	met;
O	of
O	the
O	queer
O	houses;
O	of
O	the
O	wild
O	and
O	beautiful
O	animals
O	he
O	had
O	encountered;
O	of
O	the
O	jewels
O	and
O	perfumes
O	and
O	flowers
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	across
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	long
O	the
O	thoughts
O	of
O	little
O	Christopher
O	were
O	busy
O	with
O	this
O	strange
O	far-away
O	land
O	which
O	Marco
O	Polo
O	described
O	.
O	All
O	night
O	long
O	he
O	dreamed
O	of
O	the
O	marvelous
O	sights
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	on
O	those
O	distant
O	shores
O	.
O	Many
O	a
O	time
O	he
O	went
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	water
O	'
O	s
O	edge
O	to
O	watch
O	the
O	queer
O	ships
O	as
O	they
O	slowly
O	disappeared
O	in
O	the
O	dim
O	distance
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	sky
O	seemed
O	to
O	meet
O	.
O	He
O	listened
O	eagerly
O	to
O	everything
O	about
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	the
O	voyages
O	of
O	adventure
O	,
O	or
O	of
O	trade
O	which
O	were
O	told
O	by
O	the
O	sailors
O	near
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	was
O	fourteen
O	years
O	old
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	sea
O	with
O	an
O	uncle
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	commander
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	vessels
O	that
O	came
O	and
O	went
O	from
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	Genoa
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	years
O	he
O	thus
O	lived
O	on
O	a
O	vessel
O	,
O	learning
O	everything
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	about
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	At
O	one
O	time
O	the
O	ship
O	on
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	sailing
O	had
O	a
O	desperate
O	fight
O	with
O	another
O	ship;
O	both
O	took
O	fire
O	and
O	were
O	burned
O	to
O	the
O	water
O	'
O	s
O	edge
O	.
O	Christopher
O	Columbus
O	,

O	was
O	his
O	full
O	name
O	,
O	only
O	escaped
O	,
O	as
O	did
O	the
O	other
O	sailors
O	,
O	by
O	jumping
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	swimming
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	Still
O	this
O	did
O	not
O	cure
O	him
O	of
O	his
O	love
O	for
O	the
O	ocean
O	life
O	.

O	after

O	a
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	,
O	whose
O	father
O	had
O	collected
O	a
O	rich
O	store
O	of
O	maps
O	and
O	charts
O	,
O	which
O	showed
O	what
O	was
O	then
O	supposed
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	and
O	told
O	of
O	strange
O	and
O	wonderful
O	voyages
O	which
O	brave
O	sailors
O	had
O	from
O	time
O	to
O	time
O	dared
O	to
O	make
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	then
O	unknown
O	sea
O	.
O	Most
O	people
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	certain
O	death
O	to
O	any
O	one
O	who
O	ventured
O	very
O	far
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	ocean
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	queer
O	and
O	absurd
O	ideas
O	afloat
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	Some
O	people
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	round
O	like
O	a
O	pancake
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	waters
O	which
O	surrounded
O	the
O	land
O	gradually
O	changed
O	into
O	mist
O	and
O	vapor
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	who
O	ventured
O	out
O	into
O	these
O	vapors
O	fell
O	through
O	the
O	mist
O	and
O	clouds
O	down
O	into--they
O	knew
O	not
O	where
O	.
O	Others
O	believed
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	huge
O	monsters
O	living
O	in
O	the
O	distant
O	waters
O	ready
O	to
O	swallow
O	any
O	sailor
O	who
O	was
O	foolish
O	enough
O	to
O	venture
O	near
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	Christopher
O	Columbus
O	had
O	grown
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	very
O	wise
O	and
O	thoughtful
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	all
O	he
O	could
O	learn
O	from
O	the
O	maps
O	of
O	his
O	father-in-law
O	and
O	the
O	books
O	which
O	he
O	read
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	long
O	talks
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	with
O	some
O	other
O	learned
O	men
O	,
O	he
O	grew
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	certain
O	that
O	the
O	world
O	was
O	round
O	like
O	an
O	orange
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	by
O	sailing
O	westward
O	from
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	Portugal
O	one
O	could
O	gradually
O	go
O	round
O	the
O	world
O	and
O	find
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	wonderful
O	land
O	of
O	_Cathay_
O	,
O	the
O	strange
O	country
O	which
O	lay
O	far
O	beyond
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	the
O	accounts
O	of
O	which
O	had
O	so
O	thrilled
O	him
O	as
O	a
O	boy
O	.
O	We
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	know
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	right
O	in
O	his
O	belief
O	concerning
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	but
O	people
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	laughed
O	him
O	to
O	scorn
O	when
O	he
O	spoke
O	of
O	making
O	a
O	voyage
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	vast
O	and
O	fearful
O	ocean
O	.
O	In
O	vain
O	he
O	talked
O	and
O	reasoned
O	and
O	argued
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	maps
O	to
O	explain
O	matters
O	.
O	The
O	more
O	he
O	proved
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	satisfaction
O	that
O	this
O	must
O	be
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	the
O	more
O	other
O	people
O	shook
O	their
O	heads
O	and
O	called
O	him
O	crazy
O	.
O	He
O	remembered
O	in
O	his
O	readings
O	of
O	the
O	book
O	of
O	Marco
O	Polo
O	'
O	s
O	travels
O	that
O	the
O	people
O	whom
O	Polo
O	had
O	met
O	were
O	heathen
O	who
O	knew
O	little
O	about
O	the
O	God
O	who
O	had
O	made
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	nothing
O	at
O	all
O	about
O	His
O	Son
O	,
O	Christ
O	Jesus
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	Christopher
O	Columbus
O	loved
O	very
O	dearly
O	the
O	Christian
O	religion
O	,
O	his
O	mind
O	became
O	filled
O	with
O	a
O	longing
O	to
O	carry
O	it
O	across
O	the
O	great
O	seas
O	to
O	this
O	far-away
O	country
O	.
O	The
O	more
O	he
O	thought
O	about
O	it
O	the
O	more
O	he
O	wanted
O	to
O	go
O	,
O	until
O	his
O	whole
O	life
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	the
O	one
O	thought
O	of
O	how
O	to
O	get
O	hold
O	of
O	some
O	ships
O	to
O	prove
O	that
O	the
O	earth
O	was
O	round
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	these
O	far-away
O	heathens
O	could
O	be
O	reached
O	.
O	Through
O	some
O	influential
O	friends
O	he
O	obtained
O	admission
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Portugal
O	.
O	Eagerly
O	he
O	told
O	the
O	rich
O	monarch
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	enterprise
O	which
O	filled
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	of
O	little
O	or
O	no
O	use
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	busy
O	with
O	other
O	affairs
O	,
O	and
O	only
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	Columbus
O	as
O	one
O	might
O	listen
O	to
O	the
O	wind
O	.
O	Year
O	after
O	year
O	passed
O	by
O	,
O	Columbus
O	'
O	wife
O	had
O	died
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	one
O	little
O	son
O	,
O	Diego
O	,
O	had
O	grown
O	to
O	be
O	quite
O	a
O	boy
O	.
O	Finally
O	Columbus
O	decided
O	he
O	would
O	leave
O	Portugal
O	and
O	would
O	go
O	over
O	to
O	Spain
O	,
O	a
O	rich
O	country
O	near
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	see
O	if
O	the
O	Spanish
O	monarchs
O	would
O	not
O	give
O	him
O	boats
O	in
O	which
O	to
O	make
O	his
O	longed-for
O	voyage
O	.
O	The
O	Spanish
O	king
O	was
O	named
O	Ferdinand
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Spanish
O	queen
O	was
O	a
O	beautiful
O	woman
O	named
O	Isabella
O	.
O	When
O	Columbus
O	told
O	them
O	of
O	his
O	belief
O	that
O	the
O	world
O	was
O	round
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	his
O	desire
O	to
O	help
O	the
O	heathen
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	this
O	far-off
O	country
O	,
O	they
O	listened
O	attentively
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	both
O	King
O	Ferdinand
O	and
O	Queen
O	Isabella
O	were
O	very
O	earnest
O	people
O	and
O	very
O	desirous
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	should
O	become
O	Christians;
O	but
O	their
O	ministers
O	and
O	officers
O	of
O	state
O	persuaded
O	them
O	that
O	the
O	whole
O	thing
O	was
O	a
O	foolish
O	dream
O	of
O	an
O	enthusiastic
O	,
O	visionary
O	man;
O	and
O	again
O	Columbus
O	was
O	disappointed
O	in
O	his
O	hope
O	of
O	getting
O	help
O	.
O	Still
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	give
O	up
O	in
O	despair
O	.
O	_The
O	thought
O	was
O	too
O	great
O	for
O	that_
O	.
O	He
O	sent
O	his
O	brother
O	over
O	to
O	England
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	the
O	English
O	king
O	would
O	not
O	listen
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	give
O	the
O	necessary
O	help
O	,
O	but
O	again
O	he
O	was
O	doomed
O	to
O	disappointment
O	.
O	Only
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	could
O	he
O	find
O	any
O	one
O	who
O	believed
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	possible
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	sail
O	round
O	the
O	earth
O	and
O	reach
O	the
O	land
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	.
O	Long
O	years
O	passed
O	by
O	.
O	Columbus
O	grew
O	pale
O	and
O	thin
O	with
O	waiting
O	and
O	hoping
O	,
O	with
O	planning
O	arid
O	longing
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	as
O	he
O	walked
O	along
O	the
O	streets
O	of
O	the
O	Spanish
O	capital
O	people
O	would
O	point
O	their
O	fingers
O	at
O	him
O	and
O	say:
O	""""
O	There
O	goes
O	the
O	crazy
O	old
O	man
O	who
O	thinks
O	the
O	world
O	is
O	round
O	.
O	""""
O	Again
O	and
O	again
O	Columbus
O	tried
O	to
O	persuade
O	the
O	Spanish
O	king
O	and
O	queen
O	that
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	aid
O	him
O	,
O	his
O	discoveries
O	would
O	bring
O	great
O	honor
O	and
O	riches
O	to
O	their
O	kingdom
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	also
O	become
O	the
O	benefactors
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	by
O	helping
O	to
O	spread
O	the
O	knowledge
O	of
O	Christ
O	and
O	His
O	religion
O	.
O	Nobody
O	believed
O	in
O	his
O	theory
O	.
O	Nobody
O	was
O	interested
O	in
O	his
O	plan
O	.
O	He
O	grew
O	poorer
O	and
O	poorer
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	turned
O	his
O	back
O	on
O	the
O	great
O	Spanish
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	silent
O	despair
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	little
O	son
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	and
O	walked
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	to
O	a
O	small
O	seaport
O	called
O	Palos
O	,
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	queer
O	old
O	convent
O	in
O	which
O	strangers
O	were
O	often
O	entertained
O	by
O	the
O	kind
O	monks
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	it
O	.
O	Weary
O	and
O	footsore
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	convent
O	.
O	Knocking
O	upon
O	it
O	he
O	asked
O	the
O	porter
O	,
O	who
O	answered
O	the
O	summons
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	give
O	little
O	Diego
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	bread
O	and
O	a
O	drink
O	of
O	water
O	.
O	While
O	the
O	two
O	tired
O	travelers
O	were
O	resting
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	little
O	boy
O	ate
O	his
O	dry
O	crust
O	of
O	bread
O	,
O	the
O	prior
O	of
O	the
O	convent
O	,
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	thought
O	and
O	learning
O	,
O	whose
O	name
O	was
O	Juan
O	Perez
O	,
O	came
O	by
O	and
O	at
O	once
O	saw
O	that
O	these
O	two
O	were
O	no
O	common
O	beggars
O	.
O	He
O	invited
O	them
O	in
O	and
O	questioned
O	Columbus
O	closely
O	about
O	his
O	past
O	life
O	.
O	He
O	listened
O	quietly
O	and
O	thoughtfully
O	to
O	Columbus
O	and
O	his
O	plan
O	of
O	crossing
O	the
O	ocean
O	and
O	converting
O	the
O	heathen
O	to
O	Christianity
O	.
O	Juan
O	Perez
O	had
O	at
O	one
O	time
O	been
O	a
O	very

O	friend
O	of
O	Queen
O	Isabella;
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	the
O	priest
O	to
O	whom
O	she
O	told
O	all
O	her
O	sorrows
O	and
O	troubles
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	quiet
O	man
O	and
O	talked
O	but
O	little
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	long
O	conference
O	with
O	Columbus
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	convinced
O	that
O	Columbus
O	was
O	right
O	,
O	he
O	borrowed
O	a
O	mule
O	and
O	getting
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	rode
O	for
O	many
O	miles
O	across
O	the
O	open
O	country
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	queen
O	was
O	then
O	staying
O	.
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	he
O	convinced
O	her
O	of
O	the
O	truth
O	of
O	Columbus
O	'
O	plan
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	the
O	ministers
O	and
O	courtiers
O	and
O	statesmen
O	about
O	her
O	considered
O	it
O	the
O	absurdly
O	foolish
O	and
O	silly
O	dream
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	man;
O	but
O	,
O	somehow
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	returned
O	on
O	his
O	mule
O	to
O	the
O	old
O	convent
O	at
O	Palos
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	Columbus
O	to
O	go
O	back
O	once
O	more
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	Spain
O	and

O	him
O	money
O	with

O	to
O	make

O	The
O	state
O	treasurer
O	said
O	the
O	queen
O	had
O	no
O	money
O	to

O	,
O	but
O	this

O	woman
O	,
O	who
O	now
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	first

O	,
O	realized

O	a
O	grand
O	and
O	glorious
O	thing
O	Columbus
O	wished

O	much
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	,
O	as
O	queens
O	were
O	scarcely
O	considered
O	dignified
O	or
O	respectable
O	if
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	wear
O	crowns
O	of
O	gold
O	inlaid
O	with
O	bright
O	jewels
O	on
O	all
O	public
O	occasions
O	,
O	but
O	Queen
O	Isabella
O	cared
O	far
O	more
O	to
O	send
O	the
O	gospel
O	of
O	Christ
O	over
O	to
O	the
O	heathen
O	than
O	how
O	she
O	might
O	look
O	,
O	or
O	what
O	other
O	people
O	might
O	say
O	about
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	jewels
O	were
O	pawned
O	and
O	the
O	money
O	was
O	given
O	to
O	Columbus
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	glad
O	heart
O	he
O	hastened
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	town
O	of
O	Palos
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	his
O	young
O	son
O	with
O	the
O	kind
O	priest
O	Juan
O	Perez
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	a
O	new
O	difficulty
O	arose
O	.
O	Enough
O	sailors
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	found
O	who
O	would
O	venture
O	their
O	lives
O	by
O	going
O	out
O	on
O	this
O	unknown
O	voyage
O	with
O	a
O	crazy
O	old
O	man
O	such
O	as
O	Columbus
O	was
O	thought
O	to
O	be
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	convicts
O	from
O	the
O	prisons
O	were
O	given
O	liberty
O	by
O	the
O	queen
O	on
O	condition
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	go
O	with
O	the
O	sailors
O	and
O	Columbus
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	you
O	see
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	altogether
O	a
O	very
O	nice
O	crew
O	,
O	still
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	best
O	he
O	could
O	get
O	,
O	and
O	Columbus
O	'
O	heart
O	was
O	so
O	filled
O	with
O	the
O	great
O	work
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	willing
O	to
O	undertake
O	the
O	voyage
O	no
O	matter
O	how
O	great
O	or
O	how
O	,
O	many
O	the
O	difficulties
O	might
O	be
O	.
O	The
O	ships
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	food
O	and
O	other
O	provisions
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	,
O	long
O	voyage
O	.
O	Nobody
O	knew
O	how
O	long
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	before
O	the
O	land
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	could
O	be
O	reached
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	people
O	thought
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	possible
O	hope
O	of
O	its
O	ever
O	being
O	found
O	.
O	Early
O	one
O	summer
O	morning
O	,
O	even
O	before
O	the
O	sun
O	had
O	risen
O	,
O	Columbus
O	bade
O	farewell
O	to
O	the
O	few
O	friends
O	who
O	had
O	gathered
O	at
O	the
O	little
O	seaport
O	of
O	Palos
O	to
O	say
O	good-bye
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	ships
O	spread
O	their
O	sails
O	and
O	started
O	on
O	the
O	great
O	untried
O	voyage
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	three
O	boats
O	,
O	none
O	of
O	which
O	we
O	would
O	think
O	,
O	nowadays
O	,
O	was
O	large
O	enough
O	or
O	strong
O	enough
O	to
O	dare
O	venture
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	and
O	help
O	of
O	land
O	and
O	run
O	the
O	risk
O	of
O	encountering
O	the
O	storms
O	of
O	mid-ocean
O	.
O	The
O	names
O	of
O	the
O	boats
O	were
O	the
O	_Santa
O	Maria_
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	one
O	that
O	Columbus
O	himself
O	commanded
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	smaller
O	boats
O	,
O	one
O	named
O	the
O	_Pinta_
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	the
O	_Nina_
O	.
O	Strange
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	must
O	the
O	sailors
O	have
O	felt
O	,
O	as
O	hour
O	after
O	hour
O	they
O	drifted
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	great
O	unknown
O	waters
O	,
O	which
O	no
O	man
O	ever
O	ventured
O	into
O	before
O	.
O	Soon
O	all
O	land
O	faded
O	from
O	their
O	sight
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	they
O	went
O	,
O	not
O	knowing
O	where
O	or
O	how
O	the
O	voyage
O	would
O	end
O	.
O	Columbus
O	alone
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	hope
O	,
O	feeling
O	quite
O	sure
O	that
O	in
O	time
O	he
O	would
O	reach
O	the
O	never
O	before
O	visited
O	shores
O	of
O	a
O	New
O	World
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	thus
O	be
O	the
O	means
O	of
O	bringing
O	the
O	Christian
O	religion
O	to
O	these
O	poor
O	,
O	ignorant
O	people
O	.
O	On
O	and
O	on
O	they
O	sailed
O	,
O	day
O	after
O	day--far
O	beyond
O	the
O	utmost
O	point
O	which
O	sailors
O	had
O	ever
O	before
O	reached
O	.
O	Many
O	of
O	the
O	men
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	a
O	strange
O	dread
O	and
O	begged
O	and
O	pleaded
O	to
O	return
O	home
O	.
O	Still
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	they
O	went
O	,
O	each
O	day
O	taking
O	them
O	further
O	and
O	further
O	from
O	all
O	they
O	had
O	ever
O	known
O	or
O	loved
O	before
O	.
O	Day
O	after
O	day
O	passed
O	,
O	and
O	week
O	after
O	week
O	until
O	two
O	months
O	had
O	elapsed
O	.
O	The
O	provisions
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	brought
O	with
O	them
O	were
O	getting
O	scarce
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	men
O	now
O	dreaded
O	starvation
O	.
O	They
O	grew
O	angry
O	with
O	Columbus
O	,
O	and
O	threatened
O	to
O	take
O	his
O	life
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	command
O	the
O	ships
O	to
O	be
O	turned
O	back
O	toward
O	Spain
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	patience
O	did
O	not
O	give
O	out
O	,
O	nor
O	was
O	his
O	faith
O	one
O	whit
O	the
O	less
O	.
O	He
O	cheered
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	the
O	men
O	as
O	best
O	he
O	could
O	,
O	often
O	telling
O	them
O	droll
O	,
O	funny
O	stories
O	to
O	distract
O	their
O	thoughts
O	from
O	the
O	terrible
O	dread
O	which
O	now
O	filled
O	all
O	minds
O	.
O	He
O	promised
O	a
O	rich
O	reward
O	to
O	the
O	first
O	man
O	who
O	should
O	discover
O	land
O	ahead
O	.
O	This
O	somewhat
O	renewed
O	their
O	courage
O	,
O	and
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	watches
O	were
O	set
O	and
O	the
O	western
O	horizon
O	before
O	them
O	was
O	scanned
O	at
O	all
O	hours
O	.
O	Time
O	and
O	again
O	they
O	thought
O	they
O	saw
O	land
O	ahead
O	,
O	only
O	to
O	find
O	they
O	had
O	mistaken
O	a
O	cloud
O	upon
O	the
O	horizon
O	for
O	the
O	longed-for
O	shore
O	.
O	Flocks
O	of
O	birds
O	flying
O	westward
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	This
O	gave
O	some
O	ground
O	for
O	hope
O	.
O	For
O	surely
O	the
O	birds
O	must
O	be
O	flying
O	toward
O	some
O	land
O	where
O	they
O	could
O	find
O	food
O	,
O	and
O	trees
O	in
O	which
O	to
O	build
O	their
O	nests
O	.
O	Still
O	fear
O	was
O	great
O	in
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	Columbus
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	keep
O	the
O	men
O	much
O	longer
O	in
O	suspense
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	if
O	land
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	soon
O	they
O	would
O	compel
O	him
O	to
O	turn
O	around
O	and
O	retrace
O	his
O	steps
O	whether
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	or
O	not
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	benighted
O	heathen
O	who
O	had
O	never
O	heard
O	of
O	God
O	'
O	s
O	message
O	of
O	love
O	to
O	man
O	through
O	Christ
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	prayed
O	almost
O	incessantly
O	that
O	courage
O	might
O	be
O	given
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	.
O	Hour
O	after
O	hour
O	he
O	looked
O	across
O	the
O	blue
O	water
O	,
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	,
O	longing
O	for
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	land
O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	he
O	watched
O	so
O	incessantly
O	that
O	his
O	eyesight
O	became
O	injured
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	scarcely
O	see
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	one
O	night
O	as
O	he
O	sat
O	upon
O	the
O	deck
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	sure
O	that
O	a
O	faint
O	light
O	glimmered
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	in
O	the
O	distant
O	darkness
O	ahead
O	.
O	Where
O	there
O	is
O	a
O	light
O	there
O	must
O	be
O	land
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	.
O	Still
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	sure
O	,
O	as
O	his
O	eyesight
O	had
O	become
O	so
O	dim
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	called
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	more
O	faithful
O	sailors
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	what
O	he
O	saw
O	.
O	The
O	sailor
O	exclaimed:
O	""""
O	A
O	light

O	Another
O	sailor

O	by
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	light
O	had
O	disappeared
O	and
O	the
O	sailor
O	saw
O	nothing
O	,
O	and
O	Columbus
O	'
O	hopes
O	again
O	sank
O	.
O	Still
O	he
O	felt
O	they
O	must
O	be
O	nearing
O	land
O	.
O	About
O	two

O	that
O	night
O	the
O	commander
O	of
O	one
O	of

O	how
O	the

O	rushed
O	to
O	the

O	Early

O	with
O	him
O	across
O	the
O	water
O	next
O	planted
O	the
O	flag
O	of
O	Spain
O	upon
O	the
O	unknown
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	claimed
O	the
O	newly
O	discovered
O	country
O	in
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	King
O	Ferdinand
O	and
O	Queen
O	Isabella
O	of
O	Spain
O	.
O	Wonderful
O	,
O	wonderful
O	indeed
O	were
O	the
O	things
O	which
O	Columbus
O	and
O	the
O	sailors
O	now
O	saw
O	!
O	Strange
O	naked
O	men
O	and
O	women
O	of
O	a
O	copper
O	,
O	or
O	bronze
O	color
O	,
O	strange
O	new
O	birds
O	with
O	gorgeous
O	tails
O	that
O	glittered
O	like
O	gems
O	such
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	before;
O	beautiful
O	and
O	unknown
O	fruits
O	and
O	flowers
O	met
O	their
O	gaze
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	.
O	The
O	savages
O	were
O	kind
O	and
O	gentle
O	and
O	brought
O	them
O	food
O	and
O	water
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	little
O	else
O	to
O	offer
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	no
O	houses
O	,
O	nor
O	streets
O	,
O	nor
O	carriages
O	,
O	nor
O	cars
O	,
O	nor
O	conveniences
O	of
O	any
O	kind
O	.
O	Do
O	you
O	know
O	,
O	my
O	dear
O	children
O	,
O	that
O	this
O	strange
O	,
O	wild
O	savage
O	country
O	which
O	Columbus
O	had
O	traveled
O	so
O	far
O	and
O	so
O	long
O	to
O	discover
O	was
O	_our
O	country
O	,
O	America
O	?
O	_
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	after
O	Columbus
O	had
O	gone
O	back
O	to
O	Europe
O	and
O	told
O	the
O	people
O	there
O	of
O	the
O	wonderful
O	things
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	in
O	this
O	far
O	,
O	far
O	away
O	land
O	that
O	ship-loads
O	of
O	white
O	people
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	educated
O	and
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	taught
O	to
O	love
O	God
O	and
O	to
O	keep
O	His
O	commandments
O	,
O	came
O	over
O	and
O	settled
O	in
O	this
O	wild
O	,
O	new
O	country
O	.
O	They
O	plowed
O	the
O	land
O	and
O	planted
O	seed;
O	they
O	built
O	houses
O	for
O	themselves
O	,
O	their
O	wives
O	,
O	and
O	little
O	ones
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	time
O	they
O	made
O	school-houses
O	for
O	the
O	children
O	,
O	and
O	churches
O	in
O	which
O	to
O	worship
O	God
O	.
O	Long
O	and
O	hard
O	was
O	the
O	struggle
O	which
O	these
O	first
O	white
O	men
O	had
O	to
O	make
O	in
O	this
O	strange
O	,
O	new
O	country
O	.
O	Year
O	after
O	year
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	white
O	men
O	came
O	.
O	These
O	new
O	settlers
O	prospered
O	,
O	and
O	new
O	towns
O	were
O	built
O	,
O	and
O	roads
O	were
O	made
O	from
O	one
O	town
O	to
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	stores
O	and
O	manufactories
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	little
O	handful
O	of
O	people
O	had
O	grown
O	so
O	strong
O	that
O	they
O	established
O	a
O	government
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	,
O	which
O	welcomed
O	all
O	newcomers
O	,
O	providing
O	they
O	were
O	law-abiding
O	citizens
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	and
O	oppressed
O	,
O	the
O	persecuted
O	and
O	discouraged
O	in
O	other
O	lands
O	came
O	to
O	this
O	new
O	shore
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	found
O	wealth
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	willing
O	to
O	work
O	for
O	it
O	.
O	Here
O	they
O	need
O	no
O	longer
O	fear
O	the
O	persecutions
O	from
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	suffered
O	.
O	Here
O	they
O	gained
O	new
O	hope
O	and
O	became
O	honored
O	and
O	respected
O	citizens
O	.
O	Little
O	by
O	little
O	the
O	small
O	country
O	grew
O	into
O	a
O	great
O	nation
O	,
O	the
O	greatest
O	on
O	earth
O	,
O	because
O	it
O	is
O	the
O	freest
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	citizen
O	in
O	it
O	has
O	his
O	rights
O	respected
O	.
O	But
O	for
O	the
O	courage
O	and
O	determination
O	and
O	self-sacrifice
O	of
O	Columbus
O	this
