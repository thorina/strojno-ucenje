O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	prince
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	courteous
O	,
O	so
O	kind
O	a
O	little
O	lad
O	that
O	Prince
O	Horn
O	was
O	always
O	called
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	.
O	For
O	hend
O	or
O	hynde
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	long
O	ago
O	meant
O	just
O	all
O	the
O	beautiful
O	things
O	which
O	these
O	words
O	,
O	courteous
O	,
O	kind
O	,
O	mean
O	in
O	these
O	days
O	.
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	lived
O	a
O	happy
O	life
O	in
O	his
O	home
O	in
O	the
O	distant
O	East
O	.
O	For
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	bright
O	glowing
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	that
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	King
O	Allof
O	,
O	reigned
O	.
O	The
O	Queen
O	Godylt
O	loved
O	her
O	little
O	son
O	too
O	well
O	to
O	spoil
O	him
O	.
O	She
O	wished
O	him
O	to
O	learn
O	to
O	share
O	his
O	toys
O	,
O	to
O	play
O	his
O	games
O	with
O	other
O	boys
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	much
O	to
O	the
O	delight
O	of
O	little
O	Prince
O	Horn
O	,
O	two
O	boys
O	,
O	almost
O	as
O	old
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	came
O	to
O	live
O	with
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	Athulph
O	and
O	Fykenyld
O	were
O	their
O	names
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	merry
O	playmates
O	for
O	the
O	little
O	prince
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	years
O	rolled
O	by
O	,
O	Athulph
O	and
O	Fykenyld
O	thought
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	one
O	to
O	equal
O	their
O	prince
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	.
O	They
O	would
O	serve
O	him
O	loyally
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	king
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	men
O	.
O	All
O	went
O	well
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	this
O	far-off
O	eastern
O	land
O	until
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	was
O	fifteen
O	years
O	of
O	age
O	.
O	Then
O	war
O	came
O	,
O	without
O	warning
O	,
O	into
O	this
O	country
O	of
O	blue
O	sky
O	and
O	blazing
O	sun
O	.
O	Mury
O	,
O	King
O	of
O	the
O	Turks
O	,
O	landed
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	King
O	Allof
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	all
O	unprepared
O	for
O	fight
O	.
O	And
O	King
O	Mury
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	fierce
O	soldiers
O	,
O	pillaged
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	killed
O	the
O	good
O	King
O	Allof
O	,
O	seized
O	his
O	crown
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	it
O	on
O	his
O	own
O	head
O	.
O	Then
O	poor
O	Queen
O	Godylt
O	fled
O	from
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	taking
O	with
O	her
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	and
O	his
O	two
O	playmates
O	Prince
O	Athulph
O	and
O	Prince
O	Fykenyld
O	.
O	I
O	cannot
O	tell
O	you
O	what
O	became
O	of
O	the
O	beautiful
O	queen
O	,
O	but
O	Mury
O	,
O	the
O	cruel
O	king
O	,
O	captured
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	and
O	made
O	him
O	and
O	his
O	two
O	playfellows
O	prisoners
O	.
O	What
O	should
O	he
O	do
O	with
O	Prince
O	Horn
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	heir
O	to
O	the
O	kingdom
O	he
O	had
O	seized
O	?
O	Should
O	he
O	kill
O	the
O	lad
O	,
O	he
O	wondered
O	.
O	Yet
O	cruel
O	as
O	King
O	Mury
O	was
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	do
O	so
O	dastardly
O	a
O	deed
O	.
O	But
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	was
O	tall
O	and
O	strong
O	,
O	and
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	was
O	loved
O	by
O	the
O	people
O	.
O	He
O	must
O	certainly
O	be
O	sent
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	So
O	King
O	Mury
O	planned
O	,
O	and
O	King
O	Mury
O	plotted
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	a
O	way
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	he
O	hoped
O	to
O	be
O	for
O	ever
O	rid
O	of
O	the
O	gallant
O	prince
O	and
O	his
O	two
O	companions
O	.
O	He
O	ordered
O	the
O	prisoners
O	to
O	be
O	brought
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	the
O	lads
O	were
O	thrust
O	into
O	an
O	open
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	pushed
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	as
O	though
O	they
O	must
O	perish
O	,
O	for
O	King
O	Mury
O	had
O	given
O	orders
O	that
O	no
O	provisions
O	were
O	to
O	be
O	placed
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	neither
O	helm
O	nor
O	oar
O	for
O	the
O	little
O	craft
O	.
O	The
O	lads
O	could
O	do
O	nothing
O	to
O	guide
O	her
O	on
O	her
O	dangerous
O	course
O	.
O	Now
O	they
O	would
O	drift
O	gently
O	on
O	the
O	swell
O	of
O	the
O	quiet
O	sea
O	,
O	now
O	they
O	would
O	whirl
O	giddily
O	on
O	the
O	crest
O	of
O	a
O	storm-tossed
O	wave
O	.
O	Faint
O	and
O	weary
O	grew
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	and
O	his
O	two
O	companions
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	to
O	them
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	perish
O	from
O	hunger
O	or
O	be
O	devoured
O	by
O	the
O	storm
O	.
O	Yet
O	every
O	day
O	the
O	little
O	boat
O	was
O	drifted
O	by
O	soft
O	breezes
O	or
O	driven
O	by
O	wild
O	storm-clouds
O	westward
O	and
O	always
O	westward
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	one
O	day
O	a
O	great
O	wave
O	came
O	and
O	lifted
O	it
O	high
O	up
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	coast
O	.
O	The
O	boys
O	had
O	reached
O	Scotland
O	,
O	the
O	country
O	over
O	which
O	King
O	Alymer
O	ruled
O	.
O	Now
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
O	King
O	Alymer
O	was
O	passing
O	along
O	the
O	sea-coast
O	,
O	and
O	seeing
O	the
O	lads
O	lying
O	there
O	,
O	pale
O	and
O	bruised
O	,
O	he
O	ordered
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	be
O	carried
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	be
O	fed
O	and
O	that
O	their
O	wounds
O	might
O	be
O	bathed
O	.
O	So
O	carefully
O	were
O	they
O	tended
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	King
O	Alymer
O	that
O	soon
O	roses
O	bloomed
O	again
O	on
O	the
O	cheeks
O	of
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	and
O	his
O	two
O	companions
O	,
O	strength
O	crept
O	back
O	to
O	their
O	bruised
O	bodies
O	.
O	Ere
O	many
O	weeks
O	had
O	passed
O	all
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	loved
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	and
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	prince
O	worthy
O	of
O	his
O	name
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	prince
O	was
O	well
O	,
O	King
O	Alymer
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	story
O	the
O	lad
O	had
O	to
O	tell
O	,
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	his
O	ruined
O	home
O	,
O	his
O	lost
O	kingdom
O	,
O	his
O	suffering
O	at
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	cruel
O	King
O	Mury
O	.
O	And
O	King
O	Alymer
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	gentle
O	at
O	heart
O	,
O	shed
O	a
O	tear
O	as
O	he
O	heard
O	.
O	'
O	Thou
O	shalt
O	stay
O	at
O	our
O	court
O	,
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	and
O	learn
O	all
O	that
O	a
O	prince
O	should
O	learn
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	when
O	thou
O	art
O	older
O	,
O	thou
O	shalt
O	go
O	to
O	war
O	with
O	Mury
O	,
O	the
O	cruel
O	king
O	of
O	the
O	Turks
O	.
O	Thou
O	shalt
O	win
O	back
O	thine
O	own
O	kingdom
O	and
O	rule
O	over
O	it
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	the
O	king
O	called
O	for
O	Athelbras
O	,
O	his
O	steward
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	care
O	for
O	Prince
O	Horn
O	and
O	his
O	two
O	companions
O	.
O	A
O	suite
O	of
O	rooms
O	was
O	given
O	to
O	the
O	prince
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	here
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	playfellows
O	were
O	trained
O	in
O	all
O	courtly
O	ways
O	.
O	When
O	his
O	studies
O	were
O	over
O	,
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	would
O	go
O	out
O	to
O	hawk
O	and
O	hunt
O	.
O	Often
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	wrestle
O	and
O	tilt
O	with
O	his
O	companions
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	in
O	days
O	to
O	come
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	take
O	his
O	place
O	in
O	battle
O	and
O	in
O	tournament
O	.
O	But
O	one
O	day
O	King
O	Alymer
O	heard
O	the
O	young
O	prince
O	'
O	s
O	voice
O	as
O	he
O	sang
O	.
O	So
O	pure
O	,
O	so
O	sweet
O	rang
O	the
O	voice
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	said
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	'
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	shall
O	be
O	trained
O	by
O	the
O	best
O	harpist
O	in
O	our
O	land
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	happy
O	days
O	began
O	for
O	the
O	young
O	prince
O	.
O	Rather
O	would
O	he
O	sing
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	touched
O	softly
O	the
O	cords
O	of
O	the
O	harp
O	,
O	than
O	would
O	he
O	fight
O	or
O	tilt;
O	rather
O	would
O	he
O	sing
O	and
O	play
O	,
O	than
O	go
O	to
O	hunt
O	and
O	hawk
O	.
O	Yet
O	well
O	had
O	he
O	loved
O	these
O	sports
O	in
O	former
O	days
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	King
O	Alymer
O	had
O	one
O	daughter
O	,
O	the
O	Princess
O	Jean
O	.
O	Dearly
O	did
O	the
O	king
O	love
O	his
O	daughter
O	,
O	and
O	ofttimes
O	he
O	stroked
O	her
O	hair
O	and
O	wished
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	playfellow
O	to
O	cheer
O	her
O	in
O	his
O	absence
O	.
O	For
O	when
O	the
O	king
O	would
O	journey
O	from
O	city
O	to
O	city
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	justice
O	and
O	right
O	ruled
O	throughout
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	his
O	child
O	was
O	left
O	alone
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	that
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	and
O	his
O	companions
O	had
O	come
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	Princess
O	Jean
O	would
O	no
O	longer
O	be
O	dull
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	away
O	.
O	She
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	early
O	days
O	after
O	the
O	prince
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	would
O	ride
O	to
O	hunt
O	and
O	hawk
O	,
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	by
O	her
O	side
O	.
O	And
O	later
O	she
O	would
O	listen
O	as
O	he
O	talked
O	to
O	her
O	of
O	his
O	beautiful
O	home
O	under
O	the
O	eastern
O	sky
O	,
O	of
O	his
O	dear
O	lost
O	mother
O	,
O	Godylt
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	King
O	Allof
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	slain
O	by
O	the
O	cruel
O	Mury
O	.
O	She
O	would
O	listen
O	,
O	her
O	eyes
O	dim
O	with
O	tears
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	how
O	well
O	he
O	had
O	loved
O	his
O	home
O	in
O	the
O	far-off
O	East
O	.
O	But
O	her
O	eyes
O	would
O	flash
O	as
O	he
O	told
O	of
O	the
O	cruel
O	King
O	Mury
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	how
O	one
O	day
O	he
O	would
O	go
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	kingdom
O	and
O	win
O	it
O	from
O	the
O	hand
O	of
O	the
O	evil
O	king
O	.
O	Her
O	eyes
O	would
O	flash
O	and
O	her
O	heart
O	would
O	beat
O	,
O	yet
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	alone
O	she
O	would
O	weep
O	.
O	For
O	what
O	would
O	she
O	do
O	if
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	went
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	far
O	East
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	left
O	alone
O	?
O	To
O	the
O	Princess
O	Jean
O	it
O	seemed
O	that
O	the
O	palace
O	would
O	be
O	empty
O	were
O	Prince
O	Horn
O	no
O	longer
O	dwelling
O	there
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	the
O	years
O	rolled
O	on
O	and
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	a
O	boy
O	,
O	Princess
O	Jean
O	no
O	longer
O	a
O	girl
O	.
O	They
O	both
O	had
O	changed
O	in
O	many
O	ways
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	one
O	way
O	both
O	were
O	still
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	boy
O	and
O	girl
O	together
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	loved
O	each
O	other
O	then
O	,
O	they
O	loved
O	each
O	other
O	now
O	.
O	So
O	well
O	did
O	they
O	love
O	one
O	another
O	that
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	King
O	Alymer
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	they
O	wished
O	to
O	marry
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	without
O	delay
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	well
O	pleased
O	that
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	should
O	marry
O	his
O	beautiful
O	daughter
O	the
O	Princess
O	Jean
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	willing
O	that
O	the
O	wedding
O	should
O	be
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	'
O	Thou
O	must
O	wait
O	,
O	my
O	daughter
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king;
O	'
O	thou
O	must
O	wait
O	to
O	wed
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	until
O	he
O	has
O	journeyed
O	to
O	the
O	far
O	East
O	and
O	won
O	back
O	the
O	kingdom
O	Mury
O	so
O	unjustly
O	wrested
O	from
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	has
O	shown
O	himself
O	as
O	brave
O	as
O	he
O	is
O	courteous
O	,
O	then
O	shall
O	the
O	wedding
O	be
O	without
O	delay
O	.
O	'
O	Thus
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	later
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	and
O	Princess
O	Jean
O	stood
O	together
O	to
O	say
O	farewell
O	one
O	to
O	another
O	.
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	was
O	going
O	away
O	to
O	win
O	his
O	spurs
O	,
O	to
O	show
O	himself
O	worthy
O	of
O	the
O	lady
O	whom
O	he
O	loved
O	.
O	Before
O	he
O	left
O	her
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	her
O	a
O	beautiful
O	silver
O	wand
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	wand
O	were
O	perched
O	seven
O	living
O	larks
O	.
O	They
O	would
O	warble
O	to
O	the
O	Princess
O	Jean
O	when
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	near
O	to
O	sing
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	as
O	had
O	been
O	his
O	wont
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	soft
O	sweet
O	voice
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Princess
O	Jean
O	drew
O	from
O	her
O	own
O	finger
O	a
O	ring
O	,
O	and
O	seven
O	diamonds
O	shone
O	therein
O	.
O	She
O	placed
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	finger
O	of
O	her
O	dear
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	As
O	long
O	as
O	the
O	diamonds
O	in
O	this
O	ring
O	flash
O	bright
O	,
O	thou
O	wilt
O	know
O	I
O	love
O	thee
O	as
O	I
O	do
O	now
O	.
O	Should
O	the
O	gleam
O	of
O	the
O	diamonds
O	fade
O	and
O	grow
O	dim
O	,
O	thou
O	wilt
O	know
O	,
O	not
O	that
O	my
O	love
O	grows
O	less
O	,
O	for
O	that
O	may
O	never
O	be
O	,
O	but
O	thou
O	wilt
O	know
O	that
O	evil
O	hath
O	befallen
O	me
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	sadly
O	they
O	parted
O	and
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	,
O	the
O	ring
O	on
O	his
O	finger
O	,
O	hastened
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	Swiftly
O	he
O	embarked
O	in
O	the
O	ship
O	that
O	awaited
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	sailed
O	away
O	.
O	On
O	and
O	on
O	for
O	many
O	a
O	long
O	day
O	he
O	sailed
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	kingdom
O	which
O	Mury
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	seized
O	when
O	he
O	killed
O	King
O	Allof
O	.
O	Here
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	warred
O	against
O	King
O	Mury
O	until
O	he
O	overcame
O	him
O	and
O	won
O	again
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	the
O	East
O	for
O	himself
O	,
O	the
O	rightful
O	heir
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	people
O	over
O	whom
O	he
O	ruled
O	rejoiced
O	,
O	for
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	no
O	longer
O	was
O	prince
O	but
O	king
O	,
O	did
O	not
O	forget
O	his
O	kind
O	and
O	courteous
O	ways
O	.
O	For
O	seven
O	years
O	King
O	Horn
O	ruled
O	in
O	this
O	distant
O	land
O	,
O	doing
O	many
O	a
O	deed
O	of
O	daring
O	meanwhile
O	,
O	and
O	winning
O	both
O	gold
O	and
O	glory
O	for
O	himself
O	.
O	Ofttimes
O	during
O	these
O	long
O	years
O	he
O	would
O	glance
O	at
O	the
O	diamond
O	ring
O	which
O	the
O	Princess
O	Jean
O	had
O	given
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	always
O	the
O	diamonds
O	flashed
O	back
O	bright
O	.
O	Then
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	when
O	his
O	work
O	was
O	over
O	and
O	he
O	knew
O	he
O	was
O	free
O	to
O	go
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	princess
O	,
O	his
O	heart
O	wellnigh
O	stopped
O	for
O	fear
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	looked
O	downward
O	at
O	his
O	ring
O	,
O	and
O	lo
O	!
O	the
O	diamonds
O	were
O	dull
O	and
O	dim
O	.
O	Their
O	lustre
O	had
O	vanished
O	.
O	The
O	Princess
O	Jean
O	must
O	be
O	in
O	trouble
O	,
O	or
O	already
O	evil
O	had
O	befallen
O	her
O	.
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	hastened
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	hired
O	a
O	ship
O	to
O	sail
O	speedily
O	to
O	Scotland
O	,
O	where
O	King
O	Alymer
O	ruled
O	.
O	The
O	ship
O	sailed
O	swiftly
O	,
O	yet
O	the
O	days
O	seemed
O	long
O	to
O	King
O	Horn
O	.
O	Oft
O	he
O	would
O	gaze
O	at
O	his
O	ring
O	,
O	but
O	only
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	diamonds
O	growing
O	always
O	more
O	dull
O	,
O	more
O	dim
O	.
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	longed
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	longed
O	before
O	to
O	be
O	once
O	more
O	beside
O	the
O	Princess
O	Jean
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	guard
O	her
O	from
O	all
O	harm
O	.
O	Fair
O	blew
O	the
O	wind
O	,
O	onward
O	sailed
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	saw
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	drawing
O	near
O	to
O	Scotland
O	.
O	A
O	little
O	later
O	he
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	coast
O	and
O	had
O	begun
O	his
O	journey
O	towards
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	hastened
O	on
O	,
O	King
O	Horn
O	met
O	a
O	beggar
O	man
O	.
O	'
O	Old
O	man
O	,

O	secure

O	.
O	To
O	be
O	sure
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	there
O	is
O	rejoicing
O	.
O	The
O	feast
O	has
O	already
O	been
O	spread
O	for
O	forty
O	days
O	and
O	more
O	.
O	To-day
O	is
O	the
O	wedding-day
O	of
O	the
O	king

O	s
O	daughter

O	the
O	Princess
O	Jean
O	.
O	'
O	Ah
O	,
O	now
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	understood
O	why
O	his
O	diamonds
O	had
O	grown
O	dull
O	and
O	dim
O	.
O	His
O	beautiful
O	princess
O	had
O	not
O	forgotten
O	him
O	.
O	Of
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	sure
O	.
O	But
O	King
O	Alymer
O	and
O	his
O	people
O	had
O	grown
O	weary
O	of
O	waiting
O	for
O	his
O	return
O	.
O	Seven
O	years
O	had
O	seemed
O	a
O	long
O	,
O	long
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	anxious
O	that

O	did
O	not
O	know
O	,
O	Fykenyld
O	,
O	his
O	old

O	dressed
O	as
O	a

O	reached
O	the

O	gate
O	,
O	the

O	on

O	soon
O	be
O	wedded
O	to
O	the

O	in
O	days

O	he
O	would
O	reign
O	with
O	her
O	over
O	King
O	Alymer
O	'

O	wide
O	domains
O	.
O	Fykenyld
O	had
O	no
O	thought
O	to
O	spare
O	for
O	his
O	old
O	playmate
O	,
O	save
O	to
O	be
O	glad
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	returned
O	from
O	the
O	far
O	East
O	to
O	claim
O	his

O	But
O	though
O	seven

O	rolled
O	away
O	,
O	Princess
O	Jean
O	had
O	not

O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	.
O	Forgotten
O	!
O	Nay
O	,
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	her
O	thought
O	,
O	in
O	her
O	heart
O	.
O	Yet
O	was
O	she
O	sure
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	never
O	now
O	return
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	true
O	that
O	in
O	her
O	despair
O	she
O	had
O	yielded
O	to
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	wishes;

O	had
O	promised
O	to
O	wed
O	Prince
O	Fykenyld
O	that
O	very
O	day
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	no
O	wonder
O	then
O	that
O	she
O	sat
O	on
O	the
O	throne
O	sad
O	at
O	heart
O	,
O	pale
O	of
O	face
O	.
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	had
O	knocked
O	at
O	the
O	palace
O	gate
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	no
O	humble
O	beggar
O	'
O	s
O	rap
O	he
O	gave
O	,
O	but
O	a
O	bold
O	,
O	impatient
O	knock
O	.
O	King
O	Horn
O	had
O	forgotten
O	for
O	the
O	moment
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	only
O	a
O	beggar
O	man
O	.
O	The
O	palace
O	gate

O	flung
O	wide
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	the
O	noble
O	guests
O	had
O	arrived
O	,
O	thought
O	the
O	porter
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	beggar
O	standing
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	wellnigh
O	slammed
O	the
O	gate
O	in
O	the
O	poor
O	man
O	'
O	s
O	face
O	.
O	Before
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	this
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	spoke
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	voice
O	made
O	the
O	porter
O	pause
O	to
O	listen
O	,
O	so
O	sweet
O	,
O	so
O	soft
O	it
O	was
O	.
O	It
O	brought
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	rough
O	old
O	man

O	thought
O	of
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	,

O	had
O	been
O	used
O	to
O	speak
O	in
O	just
O	such
O	a
O	tone
O	.
O	The
O	porter
O	cleared
O	his
O	voice
O	,
O	wiped
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	,
O	as
O	all
O	others

O	dwelt
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	,

O	,

O	for

O	absence
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	Hynde
O	Horn
O	it
O	was
