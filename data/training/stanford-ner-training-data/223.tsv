O	a

O	He
O	had
O	withdrawn

O	a

O	the

O	fixed
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	while

O	Early

O	The

O	hollow

O	noise
O	,
O	in
O	the

O	beneath
O	him
O	,
O	like

O	looked
O	attentively

O	that
O	the
O	figure
O	was
O	walking
O	in
O	a
O	wide
O	beaten
O	path
O	in
O	a
O	prairie
O	,
O	leading
O	from
O	a
O	dusky

O	to
O	a
O	lake
O	,
O	whose

O	were
O	black

O	.
O	To

O	,
O	this

O	,

O	Her
O	path
O	to

O	the

O	by
O	the
O	striking
O	of

O	walking
O	staff
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	The
O	top
O	of

O	She
O	entered
O	her
O	lodge

O	laid

O	of
O	the
O	scalps
O	of
O	women
O	.
O	Before
O	folding

O	shook
O	it
O	several

O	at
O	every

O	the
O	scalps
O	uttered
O	loud
O	shouts

O	laughter
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	the

O	The

O	uttered
O	no

O	by

O	cloak
O	,
O	she
O	came
O	directly
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	Looking
O	at

O	steadily
O	,

O	of
O	the

O	him
O	.
O	Early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	he
O	left
O	the
O	lodge
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	woman
O	who
O	makes
O	war
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	clouded
O	in
O	a
O	heavy
O	brackish
O	fog
O	,
O	so
O	thick
O	and
O	heavy
O	to
O	breathe
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	with
O	difficulty
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	forth

O	When

O	turned
O	to
O	look
O	back
O	for
O	it
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	gone
O	.
O	He
O	took
O	the
O	hard
O	beaten
O	path
O	to
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	lake
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	for
O	the

O	at
O	a
O	point
O	directly
O	opposite
O	the
O	Red

O	lodge
O	.
O	Where
O	he
O	now
O	stood
O	it
O	was
O	beautiful
O	day
O	.
O	The
O	heavens
O	were
O	clear
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sun
O	shone
O	out
O	as
O	brightly
O	to
O	Strong
O	Desire
O	as
O	on
O	the
O	first
O	morning
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	put
O	forth
O	his
O	little
O	head
O	from
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	his
O	father's
O	lodge
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	long
O	there
O	,
O	sauntering
O	along
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	displayed
O	the
O	glittering
O	bowl
O	by
O	dipping
O	water
O	from
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	Very
O	soon
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	canoes
O	came
O	off
O	from
O	the
O	island
O	.
O	The
O	men
O	admired
O	his
O	dress
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	charmed
O	with
O	his
O	beauty
O	,
O	and
O	almost
O	with
O	one
O	voice
O	they
O	all
O	made
O	proposals
O	of
O	marriage
O	.
O	These
O	,
O	Strong
O	Desire
O	promptly
O	declined
O	.
O	When
O	this
O	was
O	reported
O	to
O	Red
O	Head
O	,
O	he
O	ordered
O	his
O	royal
O	bark
O	to
O	be
O	launched
O	by
O	his
O	chosen
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	oar
O	,
O	and
O	crossed
O	over
O	to
O	see
O	this
O	wonderful
O	girl
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	approached
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	Strong
O	Desire
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	ribs
O	of
O	the
O	sorcerer's
O	canoe
O	were
O	formed
O	of
O	living
O	rattlesnakes
O	,
O	whose
O	heads
O	pointed
O	outward
O	to
O	guard
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	enemies
O	.
O	Being
O	invited
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	stepped
O	into
O	the
O	canoe
O	,
O	than
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	hiss
O	and
O	rattle
O	furiously
O	,
O	which
O	put
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	fright;
O	but
O	the
O	magician
O	spoke
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	became
O	pacified
O	and
O	quiet
O	.
O	Shortly
O	after
O	they
O	were
O	at
O	the
O	landing
O	upon
O	the
O	island
O	.
O	The
O	marriage
O	took
O	place
O	immediately;
O	and
O	the
O	bride
O	made
O	presents
O	of
O	various
O	valuables
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	furnished
O	her
O	by
O	the
O	old
O	witch
O	who
O	inhabited
O	the
O	cloudy
O	lodge
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	were
O	sitting
O	in
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	surrounded
O	by
O	the
O	friends
O	and
O	relatives
O	,
O	the
O	mother
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Head
O	regarded
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	her
O	new
O	daughter-in-law
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	with
O	fixed
O	attention
O	.
O	From
O	this
O	scrutiny
O	she
O	was
O	convinced
O	that
O	this
O	singular
O	and
O	hasty
O	marriage
O	boded
O	no
O	good
O	to
O	her
O	son
O	.
O	She
O	drew
O	him
O	aside
O	,
O	and
O	disclosed
O	to
O	him
O	her
O	suspicions
O	.
O	This
O	can
O	be
O	no
O	female
O	,
O	said
O	she;
O	she
O	has
O	the
O	figure
O	and
O	manners
O	,
O	the
O	countenance
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	especially
O	the
O	eyes
O	,
O	are
O	beyond
O	a
O	doubt
O	those
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	.
O	Her
O	husband
O	rejected
O	her
O	suspicions
O	,
O	and
O	rebuked
O	her
O	severely
O	for
O	entertaining
O	such
O	notions
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	daughter-in-law
O	.
O	She
O	still
O	urged
O	her
O	doubts
O	,
O	which
O	so
O	vexed
O	the
O	husband
O	that
O	he
O	broke
O	his
O	pipe-stem
O	in
O	her
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	her
O	an
O	owl
O	.
O	This
O	act
O	astonished
O	the
O	company
O	,
O	who
O	sought
O	an
O	explanation;
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	sooner
O	given
O	,
O	than
O	the
O	mock
O	bride
O	,
O	rising
O	with
O	an
O	air
O	of
O	offended
O	dignity
O	,
O	informed
O	the
O	Red
O	Head
O	that
O	after
O	receiving
O	so
O	gross
O	an
O	affront
O	from
O	his
O	relatives
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	think
O	of
O	remaining
O	with
O	him
O	as
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	but
O	should
O	forthwith
O	return
O	to
O	her
O	own

O	.
O	With
O	a

O	,

O	to
O	the

O	the
O	island
O	,
O	near
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	they
O	had
O	first
O	landed
O	.
O	Red
O	Head
O	entreated
O	him
O	to
O	remain
O	,
O	urging
O	every
O	motive
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	all
O	sorts

O	magnificent
O	promises--none

O	village
O	.
O	He
O	secretly
O	hid
O	his
O	precious
O	trophy
O	.
O	On
O	entering
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	his
O	parents
O	had
O	returned
O	from
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	their
O	spring
O	encampment
O	by
O	the
O	wood-side
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	heavy
O	sorrowing
O	for
O	their
O	son
O	,
O	whom
O	they
O	supposed
O	to
O	be
O	lost
O	.
O	One
O	and
O	another
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	men
O	had
O	presented
O	themselves
O	to
O	the
O	disconsolate
O	parents
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	"""Look"
O	up
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	your
O	"son;"""
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	looked
O	up
O	,
O	they
O	beheld
O	not
O	the
O	familiar
O	face
O	of
O	Strong
O	Desire
O	.
O	Having
O	been
O	often
O	deceived
O	in
O	this
O	manner
O	,
O	when
O	their
O	own
O	son
O	in
O	truth
O	presented
O	himself
O	they
O	sat
O	with
O	their
O	heads
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	their
O	eyes
O	nearly
O	blinded
O	with
O	weeping
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	some
O	time
O	before
O	they
O	could
O	be
O	prevailed
O	upon
O	to
O	bestow
O	a
O	glance
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	still
O	longer
O	before
O	they
O	could
O	recognize
O	him
O	as
O	their
O	son
O	who
O	had
O	refused
O	to
O	draw
O	water
O	from
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	countenance
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	timid
O	stripling;
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	has
O	seen
O	and
O	done
O	great
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	has
O	the
O	heart
O	to
O	do
O	greater
O	still
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	recounted
O	his
O	adventures
O	they
O	believed
O	him
O	mad
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	men
O	laughed
O	at
O	him--him
O	,
O	Strong
O	Desire--who
O	feared
O	to
O	walk
O	to
O	the
O	river
O	at
O	night-time
O	.
O	He
O	left
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	and
O	ere
O	their
O	laughter
O	had
O	ceased
O	,
O	returned
O	with
O	his
O	trophy
O	.
O	He
O	held
O	aloft
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Sorcerer
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	great
O	ghastly
O	leer
O	which
O	lighted
O	it
O	up
O	before
O	his
O	last
O	sleep
O	,
O	at
O	prospect
O	of
O	a
O	thousand
O	future
O	murders
O	,
O	fresh
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	easily
O	recognized
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	young
O	men
O	who
O	had
O	scoffed
O	at
O	Strong
O	Desire
O	shrunk
O	into
O	the
O	corners
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	.
O	Strong
O	Desire
O	had
O	conquered
O	the
O	terrible
O	Red
O	Head
O	!
O	All
O	doubts
O	of
O	the
O	truth
O	of
O	his
O	adventures
O	were
O	dispelled
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	greeted
O	with
O	joy
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	among
O	the
O	first
O	warriors
O	of
O	the
O	nation
O	.
O	He
O	finally
O	became
O	a
O	chief
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	family
O	were
O	ever
O	after
O	respected
O	and
O	esteemed
O	.
