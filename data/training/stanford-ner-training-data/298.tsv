O	all
O	his

O	Then
O	there
O	were
O	made
O	great
O	preparations
O	in
O	London
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	lands
O	south
O	of

O	,
O	with
O	sharpening
O	of
O	swords

O	,
O	making
O	of
O	harness
O	and
O	beating
O	of
O	smiths'
O	hammers
O	on
O	anvils
O	.
O	Men's
O	minds
O	were
O	in
O	sore
O	distress
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	faces
O	of
O	the
O	citizens
O	were
O	long
O	and
O	white
O	with
O	dismay
O	.
O	Daily
O	the
O	quarrel
O	caused
O	other
O	quarrels
O	.
O	Many
O	a
O	group
O	of
O	knights
O	came
O	to
O	high
O	words
O	,
O	some
O	taking
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	and
O	others
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	.
O	Often
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	blows
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	or
O	other
O	of
O	their
O	number
O	would
O	be
O	left
O	writhing
O	and
O	groaning
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Families
O	broke
O	up
O	in
O	bad
O	blood
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	sons
O	would
O	avow
O	their
O	intent
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	enlist
O	with
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	fathers
O	,
O	in
O	high
O	anger
O	at
O	such
O	disloyalty
O	to
O	Arthur
O	,
O	would
O	send
O	their
O	tall
O	sons
O	away
O	,
O	bidding
O	them
O	never
O	to
O	look
O	upon
O	their
O	faces
O	again
O	.
O	Women
O	sorrowed
O	and
O	wept
O	,
O	for
O	whichever
O	side
O	they
O	took
O	,
O	it
O	meant
O	that
O	one
O	or
O	other
O	of
O	their
O	dear
O	ones
O	was
O	opposed
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	go
O	to
O	battle
O	,
O	fighting
O	against
O	those
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	kin
O	and
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	hearths
O	.
O	Towards
O	midsummer
O	the
O	host
O	was
O	ready
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	road
O	to
O	the
O	north
O	.
O	The
O	quarrel
O	had
O	been
O	noised
O	abroad
O	throughout
O	Britain
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	kings
O	,
O	dukes
O	and
O	barons
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	Arthur
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	his
O	army
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	multitude
O	.
O	Yet
O	many
O	others
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	in
O	his
O	castle
O	of
O	Joyous
O	Gard
O	,
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	Carlisle
O	.
O	Thither
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	month
O	of
O	July
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	husbandmen
O	were
O	looking
O	to
O	their
O	ripening
O	fields
O	and
O	thinking
O	of
O	harvest
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	and
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	drew
O	with
O	their
O	army
O	and
O	laid
O	a
O	siege
O	against
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	Joyous
O	Gard
O	,
O	and
O	against
O	the
O	walled
O	town
O	which
O	it
O	protected
O	.
O	But
O	for
O	all
O	their
O	engines
O	of
O	war
O	,
O	catapults
O	which
O	threw
O	great
O	stones
O	,
O	and
O	ramming
O	irons
O	which
O	battered
O	the
O	walls
O	,
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	make
O	a
O	way
O	into
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	lay
O	about
O	it
O	until
O	harvest
O	time
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	as
O	Queen
O	Gwenevere
O	stood
O	at
O	a
O	window
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	she
O	looked
O	down
O	at
O	the
O	tents
O	of
O	the
O	besieging
O	host
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	gaze
O	lingered
O	on
O	the
O	purple
O	tent
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	banner
O	of
O	the
O	red
O	dragon
O	on
O	the
O	pole
O	above
O	it
O	.
O	As
O	she
O	looked
O	,
O	she
O	saw
O	her
O	husband
O	issue
O	from
O	the
O	tent
O	and
O	begin
O	to
O	walk
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	alone
O	in
O	a
O	place
O	apart
O	.
O	Very
O	moody
O	did
O	he
O	seem
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	strode
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	with
O	bent
O	head
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	he
O	looked
O	towards
O	Joyous
O	Gard
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	his
O	face
O	had
O	a
O	sad
O	expression
O	upon
O	it
O	which
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	queen's
O	heart
O	.
O	She
O	went
O	to
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	and
O	said:
O	'Sir

O	a
O	knight
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur's

O	spies
O	brought

O	at
O	a
O	council
O	of

O	,
O	the

O	take
O	back

O	peace
O	with
O	Sir
O	Lancelot;
O	but
O	that
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	had
O	fiercely

O	or

O	Indeed
O	,

O	followed

O	,
O	that

O	reason

O	hatred

O	out
O	of

O	other
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	addressed
O	his
O	men
O	and
O	charged
O	all
O	his
O	knights
O	to
O	save
O	King
O	Arthur
O	from
O	death
O	or
O	wounds
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	their
O	old
O	friendship
O	with
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	to
O	avoid
O	battle
O	with
O	him
O	also
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	hurtling
O	and
O	crashing
O	,
O	the
O	knights
O	ran
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	much
O	people
O	were
O	there
O	slain
O	.
O	The
O	knights
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	did
O	great
O	damage
O	among
O	the
O	king's
O	people
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	fierce
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	burned
O	to
O	revenge
O	themselves
O	for
O	the
O	evil
O	names
O	they
O	had
O	heard
O	.
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	raged
O	like
O	a
O	lion
O	through
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	seeking
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	knights
O	did
O	he
O	slay
O	or
O	overthrow
O	.
O	Once
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	dashing
O	through
O	the
O	fight
O	,
O	came
O	upon
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	.
O	'Now
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	cried
O	,
O	'defend
O	thee
O	,
O	for
O	thou
O	art
O	the
O	causer
O	of
O	this
O	civil
O	war
O	.
O	'
O	At
O	these
O	words
O	he
O	struck
O	at
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	with
O	his
O	sword;
O	but
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	took
O	no
O	means
O	to
O	defend
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	down
O	his
O	own
O	sword
O	and
O	shield
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	put
O	up
O	arms
O	against
O	his
O	king
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	abashed
O	and
O	put
O	down
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	sorrowfully
O	upon
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	surging
O	tide
O	of
O	battle
O	poured
O	between
O	them
O	and
O	separated
O	them
O	,
O	until
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	saw
O	King
O	Arthur
O	at
O	a
O	little
O	distance
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	spear
O	the
O	knight
O	rushed
O	at
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	fierce
O	was
O	his
O	stroke
O	and
O	hardy
O	his
O	blow
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	stricken
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	leapt
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	and
O	ran
O	towards
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	But
O	some
O	one
O	called
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	up
O	he
O	saw
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	riding
O	swiftly
O	towards
O	him
O	.
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	held
O	the
O	king
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	by
O	the
O	nose-piece
O	of
O	his
O	helm
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	other
O	hand
O	he
O	held
O	his
O	naked
O	sword
O	.
O	Looking
O	up
O	to
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	he
O	cried
O	in
O	a
O	fierce
O	voice:
O	'Cousin
O	,
O	shall
O	I
O	make
O	an
O	end
O	of
O	this
O	war
O	?
O	'Twere
O	easy
O	done
O	.
O	'
O	He
O	meant
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	the
O	king
O	were
O	slain
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	would
O	lose
O	half
O	his
O	forces
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	hope
O	to
O	keep
O	up
O	the
O	war
O	against
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	singlehanded
O	.
O	'Nay
O	,
O	nay
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	'on
O	peril

O	'
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	leaping
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	went
O	and
O	raised
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	the
O	stirrup
O	of
O	his
O	horse
O	while
O	the
O	king
O	mounted
O	again
O	.
O	'My
O	lord

O	'
O	King
O	Arthur
O	looked
O	upon
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	how
O	nobly
O	courteous
O	was
O	he
O	more
O	than
O	any
O	other
O	knight
O	.
O	The
O	tears
O	burst
O	from
O	the
O	king's
O	eyes
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	speak
O	,
O	and
O	sorrowfully
O	he
O	rode
O	away
O	and
O	would
O	fight
O	no
O	more
O	,
O	but
O	commanded
O	the
O	trumpets
O	to
O	cease
O	battle
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	also
O	drew
O	off
O	his
O	forces
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dead
O	were
O	buried
O	and
O	the
O	wounded
O	were
O	tended
O	.
O	Next
O	morning
O	the
O	battle
O	was
O	joined
O	again
O	.
O	Very
O	fiercely
O	fought
O	the
O	king's
O	party
O	,
O	for
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	had
O	commanded
O	that
O	no
O	quarter
O	should
O	be
O	given
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	whoever
O	slew
O	a
O	knight
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot's
O	should
O	have
O	his
O	helm
O	filled
O	with
O	gold
O	.
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	himself
O	raged
O	like
O	a
O	lion
O	about
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	his
O	spear
O	in
O	rest
O	.
O	He
O	sought
O	for
O	Sir
O	Lancelot;
O	but
O	that
O	knight
O	always
O	avoided
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	was
O	Gawaine's
O	rage
O	and
O	scorn
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	saw
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	from
O	afar
O	,
O	and
O	spurred
O	across
O	the
O	field
O	towards
O	him
O	.
O	'Ha

O	This
O	was
O	truth
O	.
O	Often
O	in
O	the
O	jousting
O	of
O	earlier
O	days
O	,
O	when
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	had
O	come
O	in
O	disguise
O	and
O	had
O	been
O	compelled
O	to
O	fight
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	the
O	latter
O	had
O	had
O	the
O	worst
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	loving
O	his
O	old
O	brother-in-arms
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	,
O	had
O	in
O	later
O	years
O	avoided
O	the
O	assault
O	with
O	Sir
O	Gawaine;
O	yet
O	the
O	greater
O	prowess
O	and
O	skill
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	were
O	doubted
O	by
O	none
O	.
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	raged
O	greatly
O	at
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	they
O	were
O	true
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	had
O	wished
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	.
O	'Thy
O	vaunting

O	Then
O	they
O	set
O	spurs
O	to

O	together
O	so
O	furiously

O	to
O	see
O	how
O	many
O	dead
O	there
O	were--dead
O	of
O	whom
O	many
O	may
O	have
O	been
O	slain
O	by
O	their
O	own
O	kindred
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	how
O	the
O	horses
O	of
O	his
O	knights
O	were
O	splashed
O	with
O	the
O	blood
O	that
O	lay
O	in
O	pools
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	grief
O	was
O	heavy
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	Sir
O	Palom
O	,
O	a
O	very
O	valiant
O	knight
O	,
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	'See
O	,
O	lord
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	cried
O	,
O	'how
O	our
O	foes
O	flinch
O	from
O	the
O	fierce
O	hurtling
O	of
O	our
O	knights
O	.
O	They
O	are
O	dispirited
O	by
O	the
O	wounding
O	of
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	.
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	is

O	wounded
O	,

O	ye
O	gather
O	all
O	your
O	forces
O	,

O	I
O	think

O	great
O	dash
O	together
O	ye
O	should
O	scatter
O	their
O	wavering
O	knights

O	won
O	.

O	'Alas
O	!

O	said
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	'I

O	'
O	But
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	moved
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	pity
O	he
O	ordered
O	the
O	trumpeters
O	to
O	sound
O	the
O	retreat
O	.
O	King
O	Arthur
O	did
O	likewise
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	party
O	retired
O	in
O	the
O	twilight
O	from
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	wounded
O	lay
O	groaning
O	till
O	death
O	or
O	succour
O	came;
O	and
O	the
O	dead
O	lay
O	still
O	and
O	pale
O	,
O	until
O	the
O	kindly
O	earth
O	was
O	thrown
O	over
O	them
O	.
O	Some
O	weeks
O	passed
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	armies
O	did
O	not
O	meet;
O	for
O	the
O	host
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	was
O	not
O	now
O	so
O	proud
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	,
O	seeing
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	lost
O	many
O	good
O	knights;
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	would
O	not
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	will
O	sally
O	out
O	from
O	his
O	castle
O	to
O	fall
O	upon
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	But
O	ever
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	tried
O	to
O	inflame
O	the
O	mind
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	and
O	his
O	kinsmen
O	against
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	advised
O	them
O	to
O	join
O	battle
O	with
O	their
O	enemy
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	lands
O	of
O	his
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Lothian
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	was
O	now
O	king
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	his
O	dead
O	father
O	,
O	King
O	Lot
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	body
O	of
O	young
O	knights
O	and
O	men-at-arms
O	came;
O	and
O	the
O	king's
O	party
O	began
O	to
O	recover
O	their
O	courage
O	.
O	Many
O	began
O	daily
O	to
O	ride
O	to
O	the
O	walls
O	of
O	Joyous
O	Gard
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	insult
O	and
O	evil
O	names
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	tempt
O	forth
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	.
O	Soon
O	the
O	young
O	knights
O	clamoured
O	to
O	King
O	Arthur
O	and
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	to
O	permit
O	them
O	to
O	attack
O	the
O	walls
O	,
O	and
O	reluctantly
O	the
O	king
O	consented
O	to
O	call
O	his
O	council
O	for
O	next
O	day
O	to
O	devise
O	some
O	means
O	of
O	breaking
O	down
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	Headstrong
O	was
O	the
O	counsel
O	given
O	by
O	the
O	young
O	knights
O	at
O	that
O	meeting
O	,
O	and
O	greatly
O	did
O	King
O	Arthur
O	sorrow
O	to
O	feel
O	that
O	,
O	for
O	love
O	of
O	his
O	nephew
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	compelled
O	to
O	yield
O	to
O	their
O	wild
O	demands
O	for
O	further
O	battle
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	hall
O	where
O	sate
O	the
O	council
O	was
O	opened
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	porter
O	of
O	the
O	gate
O	appeared
O	and
O	approached
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	'My
O	lord
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	'the
O	holy
O	Bishop
O	of
O	London
O	and
O	King
O	Geraint
O	of
O	Devon

O	audience
O	of
O	you
O	.
O	'
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	fierce
O	young
O	knights
O	scowled
O	at
O	the
O	names
O	and
O	uttered
O	cries
O	of
O	disgust
O	.
O	The
O	king's
O	face
O	brightened
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	any
O	could
O	advise
O	him
O	against
O	his
O	will
O	,
O	he
O	said:
O	'Bid
O	them
O	enter
O	instantly
O	.
O	'
O	'The
O	meddling
O	priest
O	and
O	the
O	petty
O	king
O	that
O	knoweth
O	not

O	mind
O	!
O	'
O	sneered
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	looking
O	fiercely
O	about
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	'I
O	pray
O	thee
O	,
O	uncle
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'listen
O	not
O	to
O	their
O	womanish
O	persuasions
O	,
O	if
O	thou
O	lovest
O	me
O	.
O	'
O	King
O	Arthur
O	did
O	not
O	answer
O	,
O	but
O	looked
O	towards
O	the
O	door
O	impatiently
O	.
O	Through
O	this
O	there
O	came
O	first
O	three
O	priests
O	and
O	three
O	armed
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	behind
O	them
O	stepped
O	an
O	old
O	and
O	reverend
O	man
O	,
O	the
O	hair
O	beside
O	his
O	tonsure
O	white
O	as
O	driven
O	snow
O	,
O	and
O	falling
O	over
O	his
O	white
O	robe
O	edged
O	with
O	red
O	,
O	that
O	showed
O	his
O	rank
O	as
O	bishop
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	towering
O	above
O	him
O	,
O	a
O	noble
O	knightly
O	figure
O	,
O	came
O	Geraint
O	of
O	Devon
O	,
O	grown
O	nobler
O	still
O	since
O	those
O	noble
O	days
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	proved
O	himself
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	strong
O	leader
O	indeed
O	,
O	while
O	men
O	had
O	thought
O	him
O	soft
O	and
O	foolish
O	.
O	All
O	rose
O	to
O	their
O	feet
O	in
O	reverence
O	to
O	the
O	bishop
O	,
O	and
O	fondly
O	did
O	King
O	Arthur
O	welcome
O	Geraint
O	,
O	for
O	this
O	wise
O	knight
O	had
O	from
O	the
O	first
O	opposed
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	in
O	this
O	war
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	refused
O	to
O	fight
O	against
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	abated
O	not
O	his
O	service
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	Dark
O	was
O	the
O	look
O	which
O	Gawaine
O	darted
O	at
O	Geraint
O	,
O	but
O	quiet
O	yet
O	fearless
O	was
O	Geraint's
O	answering
O	gaze
O	.
O	'What
O	ye
O	have
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Gawaine
O	angrily
O	,
O	'say

O	'Gawaine

O	King

O	At

O	Sir

O	started
O	forward
O	,
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	as

O	went
O	on
O	the
O	bishop
O	,
O	his
O	grave
O	voice
O	and

O	quiet
O	look

O	for

O	took
O	the
O	king's
O	assurance
O	,
O	sealed
O	with
O	his
O	great
O	seal
O	,
O	whereby

O	the
O	king
O	at
O	his
O	hall
O	at

O	But
O	in
O	that
O	parchment
O	was
O	no
O	word
O	of
O	reconciliation
O	with
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	.
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	fiercely
O	told
O	the
O	king
O	that
O	the
O	day
O	on
O	which
O	he
O	,
O	the
O	king

O	So
O	deep
O	and

O	was
O	the
O	hatred

O	Gawaine
O	bore
O	Sir
