O	The
O	empire
O	of
O	Blefuscu
O	is
O	an
O	island
O	,
O	situated
O	to
O	the
O	northeast
O	side
O	of
O	Lilliput
O	,
O	from
O	whence
O	it
O	is
O	parted
O	only
O	by
O	a
O	channel
O	of
O	eight
O	hundred
O	yards
O	wide
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	not

O	seen
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	upon
O	this
O	notice
O	of
O	an

O	,
O	I
O	avoided
O	appearing
O	on
O	that
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	coast
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	being
O	discovered
O	by
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	enemy
O	'
O	s
O	ships
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	received
O	no
O	intelligence
O	of
O	me
O	,
O	all
O	intercourse
O	between
O	the
O	two
O	empires
O	having
O	been
O	strictly
O	forbidden
O	during
O	the
O	war
O	,
O	upon
O	pain
O	of
O	death
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	embargo
O	laid
O	by
O	our
O	emperor
O	upon
O	all
O	vessels
O	whatsoever
O	.
O	I
O	communicated
O	to
O	his
O	Majesty
O	a
O	project
O	I
O	had
O	formed
O	of
O	seizing
O	the
O	enemy
O	'
O	s
O	whole
O	fleet;
O	which
O	,
O	as
O	our
O	scouts
O	assured
O	us
O	,
O	lay
O	at
O	anchor
O	in
O	the
O	harbor
O	ready
O	to
O	sail
O	with
O	the
O	first
O	fair
O	wind
O	.
O	I
O	consulted
O	the
O	most
O	experienced
O	seamen
O	upon
O	the
O	depth
O	of
O	the
O	channel
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	often
O	plumbed
O	,
O	who
O	told
O	me
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	,
O	at
O	high
O	water
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	seventy
O	_glumgluffs_
O	deep
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	about
O	six
O	feet
O	of
O	European
O	measure;
O	and
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	it
O	fifty
O	_glumgluffs_
O	at
O	most
O	.
O	I
O	walked
O	towards
O	the
O	northeast
O	coast
O	,
O	over
O	against
O	Blefuscu;
O	where
O	,
O	lying
O	down
O	behind
O	a
O	hillock
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	out
O	my
O	small
O	perspective
O	glass
O	,
O	and
O	viewed
O	the
O	enemy
O	'
O	s
O	fleet
O	at
O	anchor
O	,
O	consisting
O	of
O	about
O	fifty
O	men-of-war
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	transports;
O	I
O	then
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	my
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	order
O	(
O	for
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	warrant
O	)
O	for
O	a
O	great
O	quantity
O	of
O	the
O	strongest
O	cable
O	and
O	bars
O	of
O	iron
O	.
O	The
O	cable
O	was
O	about
O	as
O	thick
O	as
O	packthread
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bars
O	of
O	the
O	length
O	and
O	size
O	of
O	a
O	knitting
O	needle
O	.
O	I
O	trebled
O	the
O	cable
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	stronger
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	same
O	reason
O	,
O	I
O	twisted
O	three
O	of
O	the
O	iron
O	bars
O	together
O	,
O	binding
O	the
O	extremities
O	into
O	a
O	hook
O	.
O	Having
O	thus
O	fixed
O	fifty
O	hooks
O	to
O	as
O	many
O	cables
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	northeast
O	coast
O	,
O	and
O	putting
O	off
O	my
O	coat
O	,
O	shoes
O	,
O	and
O	stockings
O	,
O	walked
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	in
O	my
O	leathern
O	jerkin
O	,
O	about
O	an
O	hour
O	before
O	high
O	water
O	.
O	I
O	waded
O	with
O	what
O	haste
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	swam
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	about
O	thirty
O	yards
O	,
O	till
O	I
O	felt
O	ground;
O	I
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	fleet
O	in
O	less
O	than
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	.
O	The
O	enemy
O	was
O	so
O	frighted
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	me
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	leaped
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	ships
O	,
O	and
O	swam
O	to
O	shore
O	,
O	where
O	there
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	fewer
O	than
O	thirty
O	thousand
O	souls
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	took
O	my
O	tackling
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	fastening
O	a
O	hook
O	to
O	the
O	hole
O	at
O	the
O	prow
O	of
O	each
O	,
O	I
O	tied
O	all
O	the
O	cords
O	together
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	.
O	While
O	I
O	was
O	thus
O	employed
O	,
O	the
O	enemy
O	discharged
O	several
O	thousand
O	arrows
O	,
O	many
O	of
O	which
O	stuck
O	in
O	my
O	hands
O	and
O	face;
O	and
O	,
O	besides
O	the
O	excessive
O	smart
O	,
O	gave
O	me
O	much
O	disturbance
O	in
O	my
O	work
O	.
O	My
O	greatest
O	apprehension
O	was
O	for
O	mine
O	eyes
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	infallibly
O	lost
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	suddenly
O	thought
O	of
O	an
O	expedient
O	.
O	I
O	kept
O	among
O	other
O	little
O	necessaries
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	spectacles
O	in
O	a
O	private
O	pocket
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	observed
O	before
O	,
O	had
O	escaped
O	the
O	emperor
O	'
O	s
O	searchers
O	.
O	These
O	I
O	took
O	out
O	and
O	fastened
O	as
O	strongly
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	upon
O	my
O	nose
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	thus
O	armed
O	,
O	went
O	on
O	boldly
O	with
O	my
O	work
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	enemy
O	'
O	s
O	arrows
O	,
O	many
O	of
O	which
O	struck
O	against
O	the
O	glasses
O	of
O	my
O	spectacles
O	,
O	but
O	without
O	any
O	other
O	effect
O	,
O	further
O	than
O	a
O	little
O	to
O	discompose
O	them
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	now
O	fastened
O	all
O	the
O	hooks
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	taking
O	the
O	knot
O	in
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	pull
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	a
O	ship
O	would
O	stir
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	too
O	fast
O	held
O	by
O	their
O	anchors
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	boldest
O	part
O	of
O	my
O	enterprise
O	remained
O	.
O	I
O	therefore
O	let
O	go
O	the
O	cord
O	,
O	and
O	leaving
O	the
O	hooks
O	fixed
O	to
O	the
O	ships
O	,
O	I
O	resolutely
O	cut
O	with
O	my
O	knife
O	the
O	cables
O	that
O	fastened
O	the
O	anchors
O	,
O	receiving
O	above
O	two
O	hundred
O	shots
O	in
O	my
O	face
O	and
O	hands;
O	then
O	I
O	took
O	up
O	the
O	knotted
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	cables
O	to
O	which
O	my
O	hooks
O	were
O	tied
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	great
O	ease
O	drew
O	fifty
O	of
O	the
O	enemy
O	'
O	s
O	largest
O	men-of-war
O	after
O	me
O	.
O	The
O	Blefuscudians
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	not
O	the
O	least
O	imagination
O	of
O	what
O	I
O	intended
O	,
O	were
O	at
O	first
O	confounded
O	with
O	astonishment
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	seen
O	me
O	cut
O	the
O	cables
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	my
O	design
O	was
O	only
O	to
O	let
O	the
O	ships
O	run
O	adrift
O	,
O	or
O	fall
O	foul
O	on
O	each
O	other;
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	perceived
O	the
O	whole
O	fleet
O	moving
O	in
O	order
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	me
O	pulling
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	,
O	they
O	set
O	up
O	such
O	a
O	scream
O	of
O	grief
O	and
O	despair
O	that
O	it
O	is
O	almost
O	impossible
O	to
O	describe
O	or
O	conceive
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	danger
O	,
O	I
O	stopped
O	a
O	while
O	to
O	pick
O	out
O	the
O	arrows
O	that
O	stuck
O	in
O	my
O	hands
O	and
O	face;
O	and
O	rubbed
O	on
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	ointment
O	that
O	was
O	given
O	me
O	at
O	my
O	first
O	arrival
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	formerly
O	mentioned
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	took
O	off
O	my
O	spectacles
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	waiting
O	about
O	an
O	hour
O	till
O	the
O	tide
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	fallen
O	,
O	I
O	waded
O	through
O	the
O	middle
O	with
O	my
O	cargo
O	,
O	and
O	arrived
O	safe
O	at
O	the
O	royal
O	port
O	of
O	Lilliput
O	.
O	The
O	emperor
O	and
O	his
O	whole
O	court
O	stood
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	expecting
O	the
O	issue
O	of
O	this
O	great
O	adventure
O	.
O	They
O	saw
O	the
O	ships
O	move
O	forward
O	in
O	a
O	large
O	half-moon
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	discern
O	me
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	up
O	to
O	my
O	breast
O	in
O	water
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	advanced
O	to
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	channel
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	yet
O	in
O	more
O	pain
O	,
O	because
O	I
O	was
O	under
O	water
O	to
O	my
O	neck
O	.
O	The
O	emperor
O	concluded
O	me
O	to
O	be
O	drowned
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	enemy
O	'
O	s
O	fleet
O	was
O	approaching
O	in
O	a
O	hostile
O	manner;
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	soon
O	eased
O	of
O	his
O	fears
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	channel
O	growing
O	shallower
O	every
O	step
O	I
O	made
O	,
O	I
O	came
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	within
O	hearing
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	holding
O	up
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	cable
O	by
O	which
O	the
O	fleet
O	was
O	fastened
O	,
O	I
O	cried
O	in
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	,
O	""""
O	Long
O	live
O	the
O	most
O	puissant
O	Emperor
O	of
O	Lilliput
O	!
O	""""
O	This
O	great
O	prince
O	received
O	me
O	at
O	my
O	landing
O	with
O	all
O	possible
O	encomiums
O	,
O	and
O	created
O	me
O	a
O	_nardac_
O	upon
O	the
O	spot
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	the
O	highest
O	title

O	honor
O	among
O	them

O	His
O	Majesty
O	desired

O	take
O	some

O	opportunity
O	of
O	bringing
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	his
O	enemy
O	'
O	s
O	ships
O	into
O	his
O	ports
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	unmeasurable
O	is
O	the
O	ambition
O	of
O	princes
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	seemed
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	nothing
O	less
O	than
O	reducing
O	the
O	whole
O	empire
O	of
O	Blefuscu
O	into
O	a
O	province
O	,
O	and
O	governing
O	it
O	by
O	a
O	viceroy;
O	of
O	destroying
O	the
O	Bigendian
O	exiles
O	and
O	compelling
O	that
O	people
O	to
O	break
O	the
O	smaller
O	end
O	of
O	their
O	eggs
O	,
O	by

O	would
O	remain
O	the
O	sole
O	monarch
O	of
O	the
O	whole
O	world
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	endeavored
O	to
O	divert
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	design
O	,
O	by
O	many
O	arguments
O	drawn
O	from
O	the
O	topics
O	of
O	policy
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	justice;
O	and
O	I
O	plainly
O	protested
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	would
O	never
O	be
O	an
O	instrument
O	of
O	bringing
O	a
O	free
O	and
O	brave
O	people
O	into
O	slavery
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	matter
O	was
O	debated
O	in
O	council
O	,
O	the
O	wisest
O	part
O	of
O	the

O	were
O	of
O	my
O	opinion
O	.
O	This
O	open
O	bold
O	declaration
O	of
O	mine
O	was
O	so
O	opposite
O	to
O	the
O	schemes
O	and
O	politics
O	of
O	his
O	Imperial
O	Majesty
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	never
O	forgive
O	me;
O	he
O	mentioned
O	it
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	artful
O	manner
O	at
O	council
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	was
O	told
O	that
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	wisest
O	appeared
O	,
O	at
O	least
O	,
O	by
O	their
O	silence
O	,
O	to
O	be

O	but
O	others
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	my
O	secret
O	enemies
O	,
O	could
O	not
O	forbear
O	some
O	expressions
O	,
O	which
O	by
O	a
O	side-wind
O	reflected
O	on
O	me
O	.
O	And
O	from
O	this
O	time
O	began
O	an
O	intrigue
O	between
O	his
O	Majesty
O	and
O	a
O	junto
O	of
O	ministers
O	maliciously
O	bent
O	against
O	me
O	,
O	which
O	broke
O	out
O	in
O	less
O	than
O	two
O	months
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	like
O	to
O	have
O	ended
O	in
O	my
O	utter
O	destruction
O	.
O	Of
O	so
O	little
O	weight
O	are
O	the
O	greatest
O	services
O	to
O	princes
O	,
O	when
O	put
O	into
O	the
O	balance
O	with
O	a
O	refusal
O	to
O	gratify
O	their
O	passions
O	.
O	About
O	three
O	weeks
O	after
O	this
O	exploit
O	,
O	there
O	arrived
O	a
O	solemn
O	embassy
O	from
O	Blefuscu
O	,
O	with
O	humble
O	offers
O	of
O	a
O	peace;
O	which
O	was
O	soon
O	concluded
O	upon
O	conditions
O	very
O	advantageous
O	to
O	our
O	emperor
O	,
O	wherewith
O	I
O	shall
O	not
O	trouble
O	the
O	reader
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	six
O	ambassadors
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	train
O	of
O	about
O	five
O	hundred
O	persons
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	entry
O	was
O	very
O	magnificent
O	,
O	suitable
O	to
O	the
O	grandeur
O	of
O	their
O	master
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	importance
O	of
O	their
O	business
O	.
O	When
O	their
O	treaty
O	was
O	finished
O	,
O	wherein
O	I
O	did
O	them
O	several
O	good
O	offices
O	by
O	the
O	credit
O	I
O	now
O	had
O	,
O	or
O	at
O	least
O	appeared
O	to
O	have
O	at
O	court
O	,
O	their
O	Excellencies
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	privately
O	told
O	how
O	much
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	their
O	friend
O	,
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	visit
O	in
O	form
O	.
O	They
O	began
O	with
O	many
O	compliments
O	upon
O	my
O	valor
O	and
O	generosity
O	,
O	invited
O	me
O	to
O	that
O	kingdom
O	in
O	the
O	emperor
O	their
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	name
O	,
O	and
O	desired
O	me
O	to
O	show
O	them
O	some
O	proofs
O	of
O	my
O	prodigious
O	strength
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	heard
O	so
O	many
O	wonders;
O	wherein
O	I
O	readily
O	obliged
O	them
O	,
O	but
O	shall
O	not
O	trouble
O	the
O	reader
O	with
O	the
O	particulars
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	entertained
O	their
O	Excellencies
O	to
O	their
O	infinite
O	satisfaction
O	and
O	surprise
O	,
O	I
O	desired
O	they
O	would
O	do
O	me
O	the
O	honor
O	to
O	present
O	my
O	most
O	humble
O	respects
O	to
O	the
O	emperor
O	their
O	master
O	,
O	the
O	renown
O	of
O	whose
O	virtues
O	had
O	so
O	justly
O	filled
O	the
O	whole
O	world
O	with
O	admiration
O	,
O	and
O	whose
O	royal
O	person
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	attend
O	before
O	I
O	returned
O	to
O	my
O	own
O	country;
O	accordingly
O	the
O	next
O	time
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	honor
O	to
O	see
O	our
O	emperor
O	,
O	I
O	desired
O	his
O	general
O	licence
O	to
O	wait
O	on
O	the
O	Blefuscudian
O	monarch
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	pleased
O	to
O	grant
O	me
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	plainly
O	perceive
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	cold
O	manner;
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	guess
O	the
O	reason
O	,
O	till
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	whisper
O	from
O	a
O	certain
O	person
O	,
O	that
O	Flimnap
O	and
O	Bolgolam
O	had
O	represented
O	my
O	intercourse
O	with
O	these
O	ambassadors
O	as
O	a
O	mark
O	of
O	disaffection
O	,
O	from
O	which
O	I
O	am
O	sure
O	my
O	heart
O	was
O	wholly
O	free
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	conceive
O	some
O	imperfect
O	idea
O	of
O	courts
O	and
O	ministers
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	observed
O	,
O	that
O	these
O	ambassadors
O	spoke
O	to
O	me
O	by
O	an
O	interpreter
O	,
O	the
O	languages
O	of
O	both
O	empires
O	differing
O	as
O	much
O	from
O	each
O	other
O	as
O	any
O	two
O	in
O	Europe
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	nation
O	priding
O	itself
O	upon
O	the
O	antiquity
O	,
O	beauty
O	,
O	and
O	energy
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	tongues
O	,
O	with
O	an
O	avowed
O	contempt
O	for
O	that
O	of
O	their
O	neighbor;
O	yet
O	our
O	emperor
O	,
O	standing
O	upon
O	the
O	advantage
O	he
O	had
O	got
O	by
O	the
O	seizure
O	of
O	their
O	fleet
O	,
O	obliged
O	them
O	to
O	deliver
O	their
O	credentials
O	and
O	make
O	their
O	speech
O	in
O	the
O	Lilliputian
O	tongue
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	confessed
O	that
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	great
O	intercourse
O	of
O	trade
O	and
O	commerce
O	between
O	both
O	realms
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	continual
O	reception
O	of
O	exiles
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	mutual
O	among
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	custom
O	in
O	each
O	empire
O	to
O	send
O	their
O	young
O	nobility
O	and
O	richer
O	gentry
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	polish
O	themselves
O	by
O	seeing
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	understanding
O	men
O	and
O	manners
O	,
O	there
O	are
O	few
O	persons
O	of
O	distinction
O	,
O	or
O	merchants
O	,
O	or
O	seamen
O	,
O	who
O	dwell
O	in
O	the
O	maritime
O	parts
O	,
O	but
O	what
O	can
O	hold
O	conversation
O	in
O	both
O	tongues;
O	as
O	I
O	found
O	some
O	weeks
O	after
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	pay
O	my
O	respects
O	to
O	the
O	Emperor
O	of
O	Blefuscu
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	great
O	misfortunes
O	through
O	the
O	malice
O	of
O	my
O	enemies
O	,
O	proved
O	a
O	very
O	happy
O	adventure
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	shall
O	relate
O	in
O	its
O	proper
O	place
O	.
O	The
O	reader
O	may
O	remember
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	signed
O	those
O	articles
O	upon
O	which
O	I
O	recovered
O	my
O	liberty
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	some
O	which
O	I
O	disliked
O	upon
O	account
O	of
O	their
O	being
O	too
O	servile
O	,
O	neither
O	could
O	anything
O	but
O	an
O	extreme
O	necessity
O	have
O	forced
O	me
O	to
O	submit
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	being
O	now
O	a
O	_nardac_
O	of
O	the
O	highest
O	rank
O	in
O	that
O	empire
O	,
O	such
O	offices
O	were
O	looked
O	down
O	upon
O	as
O	below
O	my
O	dignity
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	emperor
O	(
O	to
O	do
O	him
O	justice
O	)
O	never
O	once
O	mentioned
O	them
O	to
O	me
O	.
