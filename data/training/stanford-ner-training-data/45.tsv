O	Having
O	now
O	brought
O	my
O	mind
O	a
O	little
O	to
O	relish
O	my
O	condition
O	,
O	and
O	given
O	over
O	looking
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	I
O	could
O	spy
O	a
O	ship--I
O	say
O	,
O	giving
O	over
O	these
O	things
O	,
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	apply
O	myself
O	to
O	arrange
O	my
O	way
O	of
O	living
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	make
O	things
O	as
O	easy
O	to
O	me
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	.
O	My
O	habitation
O	was
O	a
O	tent
O	under
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	surrounded
O	with
O	a
O	strong
O	pale
O	of
O	posts
O	and
O	cables;
O	but
O	I
O	might
O	now
O	rather
O	call
O	it
O	a
O	wall
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	raised
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	wall
O	up
O	against
O	it
O	of
O	turfs
O	,
O	about
O	two
O	feet
O	thick
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	outside;
O	and
O	after
O	some
O	time
O	(
O	I
O	think
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	year
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	)
O	I
O	raised
O	rafters
O	from
O	it
O	,
O	leaning
O	to
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	thatched
O	or
O	covered
O	it
O	with
O	boughs
O	of
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	such
O	things
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	get
O	,
O	to
O	keep
O	out
O	the
O	rain;
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	at
O	some
O	times
O	of
O	the
O	year
O	very
O	violent
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	already
O	observed
O	how
O	I
O	brought
O	all
O	my
O	goods
O	into
O	this
O	pale
O	,
O	and
O	into
O	the
O	cave
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	made
O	behind
O	me
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	must
O	observe
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	that
O	at
O	first
O	this
O	was
O	a
O	confused
O	heap
O	of
O	goods
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	lay
O	in
O	no
O	order
O	,
O	so
O	they
O	took
O	up
O	all
O	my
O	place--I
O	had
O	no
O	room
O	to
O	turn
O	myself;
O	so
O	I
O	set
O	myself
O	to
O	enlarge
O	my
O	cave
O	,
O	and
O	work
O	farther
O	into
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	loose
O	sandy
O	rock
O	,
O	which
O	yielded
O	easily
O	to
O	the
O	labor
O	I
O	bestowed
O	on
O	it;
O	and
O	so
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	I
O	was
O	pretty
O	safe
O	as
O	to
O	beasts
O	of
O	prey
O	,
O	I
O	worked
O	sideways
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	right
O	hand
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	rock;
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	turning
O	to
O	the
O	right
O	again
O	,
O	worked
O	quite
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	door
O	to
O	come
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	outside
O	of
O	my
O	pale
O	or
O	fortification
O	.
O	This
O	gave
O	me
O	not
O	only
O	egress
O	and
O	regress
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	back
O	way
O	to
O	my
O	tent
O	and
O	to
O	my
O	storehouse
O	,
O	but
O	gave
O	me
O	room
O	to
O	store
O	my
O	goods
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	apply
O	myself
O	to
O	make
O	such
O	necessary
O	things
O	as
O	I
O	found
O	I
O	most
O	wanted
O	,
O	particularly
O	a
O	chair
O	and
O	a
O	table;
O	for
O	without
O	these
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	enjoy
O	the
O	few
O	comforts
O	I
O	had
O	in
O	the
O	world--
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	write
O	or
O	eat
O	,
O	or
O	do
O	several
O	things
O	,
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	pleasure
O	without
O	a
O	table;
O	so
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	work
O	.
O	And
O	here
O	I
O	must
O	needs
O	observe
O	that
O	,
O	as
O	reason
O	is
O	the
O	substance
O	and
O	origin
O	of
O	the
O	mathematics
O	,
O	so
O	by
O	stating
O	and
O	squaring
O	everything
O	by
O	reason
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	making
O	the
O	most
O	rational
O	judgment
O	of
O	things
O	,
O	every
O	man
O	may
O	be
O	,
O	in
O	time
O	,
O	master
O	of
O	every
O	mechanic
O	art
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	never
O	handled
O	a
O	tool
O	in
O	my
O	life;
O	and
O	yet
O	,
O	in
O	time
O	,
O	by
O	labor
O	,
O	application
O	,
O	and
O	contrivance
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	at
O	last
O	that
O	I
O	wanted
O	nothing
O	but
O	I
O	could
O	have
O	made
O	it
O	,
O	especially
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	had
O	tools
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	I
O	made
O	abundance
O	of
O	things
O	,
O	even
O	without
O	tools;
O	and
O	some
O	with
O	no
O	more
O	tools
O	than
O	an
O	adze
O	and
O	a
O	hatchet
O	,
O	which
O	perhaps
O	were
O	never
O	made
O	that
O	way
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	with
O	infinite
O	labor
O	.
O	For
O	example
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	wanted
O	a
O	board
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	other
O	way
O	but
O	to
O	cut
O	down
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	set
O	it
O	on
O	an
O	edge
O	before
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	hew
O	it
O	flat
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	with
O	my
O	axe
O	,
O	till
O	I
O	brought
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	thin
O	as
O	a
O	plank
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	dub
O	it
O	smooth
O	with
O	my
O	adze
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	true
O	,
O	by
O	this
O	method
O	I
O	could
O	make
O	but
O	one
O	board
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	whole
O	tree;
O	but
O	this
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	remedy
O	for
O	but
O	patience
O	,
O	any
O	more
O	than
O	I
O	had
O	for
O	the
O	prodigious
O	deal
O	of
O	time
O	and
O	labor
O	which
O	it
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	plank
O	or
O	board;
O	but
O	my
O	time
O	or
O	labor
O	was
O	little
O	worth
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	well
O	employed
O	one
O	way
O	as
O	another
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	I
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	table
O	and
O	a
O	chair
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	observed
O	above
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	place;
O	and
O	this
O	I
O	did
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	short
O	pieces
O	of
O	boards
O	that
O	I
O	brought
O	on
O	my
O	raft
O	from
O	the
O	ship
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	I
O	had
O	wrought
O	out
O	some
O	boards
O	as
O	above
O	,
O	I
O	made
O	large
O	shelves
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	breadth
O	of
O	a
O	foot
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	,
O	one
O	over
O	another
O	all
O	along
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	my
O	cave
O	,
O	to
O	lay
O	all
O	my
O	tools
O	,
O	nails
O	,
O	and
O	ironwork
O	on;
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	to
O	separate
O	everything
O	at
O	large
O	into
O	their
O	places
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	might
O	come
O	easily
O	at
O	them
O	.
O	I
O	knocked
O	pieces
O	into
O	the
O	wall
O	of
O	the
O	rock
O	to
O	hang
O	my
O	guns
O	and
O	all
O	things
O	that
O	would
O	hang
O	up;
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	had
O	my
O	cave
O	been
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	,
O	it
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	general
O	magazine
O	of
O	all
O	necessary
O	things;
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	everything
O	so
O	ready
O	at
O	my
O	hand
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	pleasure
O	to
O	me
O	to
O	see
O	all
O	my
O	goods
O	in
O	such
O	order
O	,
O	and
O	especially
O	to
O	find
O	my
O	stock
O	of
O	all
O	necessaries
O	so
O	great
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	keep
O	a
O	journal
O	of
O	every
O	day's
O	employment;
O	for
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	at
O	first
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	too
O	much
O	hurry
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	only
O	hurry
O	as
O	to
O	labor
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	too
O	much
O	discomposure
O	of
O	mind;
O	and
O	my
O	journal
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	full
O	of
O	many
O	dull
O	things
O	.
O	You
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	my
O	thoughts
O	ran
O	many
O	times
O	upon
O	the
O	prospect
O	of
O	land
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	seen
O	from
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	island;
O	and
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	without
O	secret
O	wishes
O	that
O	I
O	were
O	on
O	shore
O	there
O	,
O	fancying
O	that
O	,
O	seeing
O	the
O	mainland
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	inhabited
O	country
O	,
O	I
O	might
O	find
O	some
O	way
O	or
O	other
O	to
O	convey
O	myself
O	further
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	at
O	last
O	find
O	some
O	means
O	of
O	escape
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	this
O	while
O	I
O	made
O	no
O	allowance
O	for
O	the
O	dangers
O	of
O	such
O	an
O	undertaking
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	I
O	might
O	fall
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	savages
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	such
O	as
O	I
O	might
O	have
O	reason
O	to
O	think
O	far
O	worse
O	than
O	the
O	lions
O	and
O	tigers
O	of
O	Africa:
O	that
O	if
O	I
O	once
O	came
O	in
O	their
O	power
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	run
O	a
O	hazard
O	of
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	thousand
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	being
O	killed
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	of
O	being
O	eaten;
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	heard
O	that
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	Caribbean
O	coast
O	were
O	cannibals
O	or
O	man-eaters
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	knew
O	by
O	the
O	latitude
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	far
O	from
O	that
O	shore
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	supposing
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	cannibals
O	,
O	yet
O	they
O	might
O	kill
O	me
O	,
O	as
O	many
O	Europeans
O	who
O	had
O	fallen
O	into
O	their
O	hands
O	had
O	been
O	served
O	,
O	even
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	ten
O	or
O	twenty
O	together--much
O	more
O	I
O	,
O	that
O	was
O	but
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	make
O	little
O	or
O	no
O	defence;
O	all
O	these
O	things
O	,
O	I
O	say
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	ought
O	to
O	have
O	considered
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	come
O	into
O	my
O	thoughts
O	afterwards
O	,
O	yet
O	gave
O	me
O	no
O	apprehensions
O	at
O	first
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	head
O	ran
O	mightily
O	upon
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	getting
O	over
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	Now
O	I
O	wished
O	for
O	my
O	boy
O	Xury
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	longboat
O	with
O	shoulder-of-
O	mutton
O	sail
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	I
O	sailed
O	above
O	a
O	thousand
O	miles
O	on
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	Africa;
O	but
O	this
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	thought
O	I
O	would
O	go
O	and
O	look
O	at
O	our
O	ship's
O	boat
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	said
O	,
O	was
O	blown
O	up
O	upon
O	the
O	shore
O	a
O	great
O	way
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	storm
O	,
O	when
O	we
O	were
O	first
O	cast
O	away
O	.
O	She
O	lay
O	almost
O	where
O	she
O	did
O	at
O	first
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	quite;
O	and
O	was
O	turned
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	force
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	and
O	the
O	winds
O	,
O	almost
O	bottom
O	upward
O	,
O	against
O	a
O	high
O	ridge
O	of
O	beachy
O	,
O	rough
O	sand
O	,
O	but
O	no
O	water
O	about
O	her
O	.
O	If
O	I
O	had
O	had
O	hands
O	to
O	have
O	refitted
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	have
O	launched
O	her
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	the
O	boat
O	would
O	have
O	done
O	well
O	enough
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	might
O	have
O	gone
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	Brazils
O	with
O	her
O	easily
O	enough;
O	but
O	I
O	might
O	have
O	foreseen
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	no
O	more
O	turn
O	her
O	and
O	set
O	her
O	upright
O	upon
O	her
O	bottom
O	than
O	I
O	could
O	remove
O	the
O	island;
O	however
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	levers
O	and
O	rollers
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	resolving
O	to
O	try
O	what
O	I
O	could
O	do;
O	suggesting
O	to
O	myself
O	that
O	if
O	I
O	could
O	but
O	turn
O	her
O	down
O	,
O	I
O	might
O	repair
O	the
O	damage
O	she
O	had
O	received
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	might
O	go
O	to
O	sea
O	in
O	her
O	very
O	easily
O	.
O	I
O	spared
O	no
O	pains
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	in
O	this
O	piece
O	of
O	fruitless
O	toil
O	,
O	and
O	spent
O	,
O	I
O	think
O	,
O	three
O	or
O	four
O	weeks
O	about
O	it;
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	finding
O	it
O	impossible
O	to
O	heave
O	it
O	up
O	with
O	my
O	little
O	strength
O	,
O	I
O	fell
O	to
O	digging
O	away
O	the
O	sand
O	,
O	to
O	undermine
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	fall
O	down
O	,
O	setting
O	pieces
O	of
O	wood
O	to
O	thrust
O	and
O	guide
O	it
O	right
O	in
O	the
O	fall
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	I
O	had
O	done
O	this
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	unable
O	to
O	stir
O	it
O	up
O	again
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	get
O	under
O	it
O	,
O	much
O	less
O	to
O	move
O	it
O	forward
O	towards
O	the
O	water;
O	so
O	I
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	give
O	it
O	over;
O	and
O	yet
O	,
O	though
O	I
O	gave
O	over
O	the
O	hopes
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	my
O	desire
O	to
O	venture
O	over
O	to
O	the
O	mainland
O	increased
O	,
O	rather
O	than
O	decreased
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	means
O	for
O	it
O	seemed
O	impossible
O	.
O	This
O	at
O	length
O	put
O	me
O	upon
O	thinking
O	whether
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	possible
O	to
O	make
O	myself
O	a
O	canoe
O	,
O	or
O	periagua
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	the
O	natives
O	of
O	those
O	climates
O	make
O	,
O	even
O	without
O	tools
O	,
O	or
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	might
O	say
O	,
O	without
O	hands
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	trunk
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	tree
O	.
O	This
O	I
O	not
O	only
O	thought
O	possible
O	,
O	but
O	easy
O	,
O	and
O	pleased
O	myself
O	extremely
O	with
O	the
O	thoughts
O	of
O	making
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	my
O	having
O	much
O	more
O	convenience
O	for
O	it
O	than
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	negroes
O	or
O	Indians;
O	but
O	not
O	at
O	all
O	considering
O	the
O	particular
O	inconvenience
O	which
O	I
O	lay
O	under
O	more
O	than
O	the
O	Indians
O	did
O	,
O	viz
O	.
O	,
O	want
O	of
O	hands
O	to
O	move
O	it
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	made
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	water--a
O	difficulty
O	much
O	harder
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	surmount
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	consequences
O	of
O	want
O	of
O	tools
O	could
O	be
O	to
O	them;
O	for
O	what
O	was
O	it
O	to
O	me
O	if
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	had
O	chosen
O	a
O	vast
O	tree
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	much
O	trouble
O	cut
O	it
O	down
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	able
O	with
O	my
O	tools
O	to
O	hew
O	and
O	dub
O	the
O	outside
O	into
O	the
O	proper
O	shape
O	of
O	a
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	burn
O	or
O	cut
O	out
O	the
O	inside
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	hollow
O	,
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	boat
O	of
O	it--if
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	this
O	,
O	I
O	must
O	leave
O	it
O	just
O	there
O	where
O	I
O	found
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	launch
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	?
O	One
O	would
O	have
O	thought
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	have
O	had
O	the
O	least
O	reflection
O	upon
O	my
O	mind
O	of
O	my
O	circumstances
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	making
O	this
O	boat
O	but
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	immediately
O	thought
O	how
O	I
O	should
O	get
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	sea;
O	but
O	my
O	thoughts
O	were
O	so
O	intent
O	upon
O	my
O	voyage
O	over
O	the
O	sea
O	in
O	it
O	that
O	I
O	never
O	once
O	considered
O	how
O	I
O	should
O	get
O	it
O	off
O	the
O	land;
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	really
O	,
O	in
O	its
O	own
O	nature
O	,
O	more
O	easy
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	guide
O	it
O	over
O	forty-five
O	miles
O	of
O	sea
O	than
O	about
O	forty-five
O	fathoms
O	of
O	land
O	,
O	where
O	it
O	lay
O	,
O	to
O	set
O	it
O	afloat
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	work
O	upon
O	this
O	boat
O	the
O	most
O	like
O	a
O	fool
O	that
O	ever
O	man
O	did
O	who
O	had
O	any
O	of
O	his
O	senses
O	awake
O	.
O	I
O	pleased
O	myself
O	with
O	the
O	design
O	,
O	without
O	determining
O	whether
O	I
O	was
O	ever
O	able
O	to
O	undertake
O	it;
O	not
O	but
O	that
O	the
O	difficulty
O	of
O	launching
O	my
O	boat
O	came
O	often
O	into
O	my
O	head
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	put
O	a
O	stop
O	to
O	my
O	inquiries
O	into
O	it
O	by
O	this
O	foolish
O	answer
O	which
O	I
O	gave
O	"myself--""Let"
O	me
O	first
O	make

O	I
O	will
O	find

O	or
O	other
O	to
O	get
O	it
O	along
O	when
O	it
O	is
O	done
O	.
O	""""
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	most
O	preposterous
O	method;
O	but
O	the
O	eagerness
O	of
O	my
O	fancy
O	prevailed
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	work
O	I
O	went
O	.
O	I
O	felled
O	a
O	cedar-tree
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	question
O	much
O	whether
O	Solomon
O	ever
O	had
O	such
O	a
O	one
O	for
O	the
O	building
O	of
O	the
O	Temple
O	of
O	Jerusalem;
O	it
O	was
O	five
O	feet
O	ten
O	inches
O	diameter
O	at
O	the
O	lower
O	part
O	next
O	the
O	stump
O	,
O	and
O	four
O	feet
O	eleven
O	inches
O	diameter
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	twenty-two
O	feet;
O	after
O	which
O	it
O	lessened
O	for
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	parted
O	into
O	branches
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	without
O	infinite
O	labor
O	that
O	I
O	felled
O	this
O	tree;
O	I
O	was
O	twenty
O	days
O	hacking
O	and
O	hewing
O	at
O	it
O	at
O	the
O	bottom;
O	I
O	was
O	fourteen
O	more
O	getting
O	the
O	branches
O	and
O	limbs
O	and
O	the
O	vast
O	spreading
O	head
O	cut
O	off
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	hacked
O	and
O	hewed
O	through
O	with
O	axe
O	and
O	hatchet
O	,
O	and
O	inexpressible
O	labor;
O	after
O	this
O	,
O	it
O	cost
O	me
O	a
O	month
O	to
O	shape
O	it
O	and
O	dub
O	it
O	to
O	a
O	proportion
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	something
O	like
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	a
O	boat
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	might
O	swim
O	upright
O	as
O	it
O	ought
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	It
O	cost
O	me
O	near
O	three
O	months
O	more
O	to
O	clear
O	the
O	inside
O	,
O	and
O	work
O	it
O	out
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	make
O	an
O	exact
O	boat
O	of
O	it;
O	this
O	I
O	did
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	without
O	fire
O	,
O	by
O	mere
O	mallet
O	and
O	chisel
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	dint
O	of
O	hard
O	labor
O	,
O	till
O	I
O	had
O	brought
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	very
O	handsome
O	periagua
O	,
O	and
O	big
O	enough
O	to
O	have
O	carried
O	six-and-
O	twenty
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	consequently
O	big
O	enough
O	to
O	have
O	carried
O	me
O	and
O	all
O	my
O	cargo
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	gone
O	through
O	this
O	work
O	I
O	was
O	extremely
O	delighted
O	with
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	boat
O	was
O	really
O	much
O	bigger
O	than
O	ever
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	canoe
O	or
O	periagua
O	,
O	that
O	was
O	made
O	of
O	one
O	tree
O	,
O	in
O	my
O	life
O	.
O	Many
O	a
O	weary
O	stroke
O	it
O	had
O	cost
O	,
O	you
O	may
O	be
O	sure;
O	and
O	had
O	I
O	gotten
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	I
O	make
O	no
O	question
O	but
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	begun
O	the
O	maddest
O	voyage
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	most
O	unlikely
O	to
O	be
O	performed
O	,
O	that
O	ever
O	was
O	undertaken
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	my
O	devices
O	to
O	get
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	failed
O	me;
O	though
O	they
O	cost
O	me
O	infinite
O	labor
O	,
O	too
O	.
O	It
O	lay
O	about
O	one
O	hundred
O	yards
O	from
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	more;
O	but
O	the
O	first
O	inconvenience
O	was
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	up
O	hill
O	towards
O	the
O	creek
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	to
O	take
O	away
O	this
O	discouragement
O	,
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	dig
O	into
O	the
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	make
O	a
O	declivity:
O	this
O	I
O	began
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	cost
O	me
O	a
O	prodigious
O	deal
O	of
O	pains
O	(
O	but
O	who
O	grudge
O	pains
O	who
O	have
O	their
O	deliverance
O	in
O	view
O	?
O	)
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	this
O	was
O	worked
O	through
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	difficulty
O	managed
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	still
O	much
O	the
O	same
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	could
O	no
O	more
O	stir
O	the
O	canoe
O	than
O	I
O	could
O	the
O	other
O	boat
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	measured
O	the
O	distance
O	of
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	resolved
O	to
O	cut
O	a
O	dock
O	or
O	canal
O	,
O	to
O	bring
O	the
O	water
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	canoe
O	,
O	seeing
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	bring
O	the
O	canoe
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	I
O	began
O	this
O	work;
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	enter
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	calculate
O	how
O	deep
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	dug
O	,
O	how
O	broad
O	,
O	how
O	the
O	stuff
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	thrown
O	out
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	hands
O	I
O	had
O	,
O	being
O	none
O	but
O	my
O	own
O	,
O	it
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	ten
O	or
O	twelve
O	years
O	before
O	I
O	could
O	have
O	gone
O	through
O	with
O	it;
O	for
O	the
O	shore
O	lay
O	so
O	high
O	,
O	that
O	at
O	the
O	upper
O	end
O	it
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	at
O	least
O	twenty
O	feet
O	deep;
O	so
O	at
O	length
O	,
O	though
O	with
O	great
O	reluctancy
O	,
O	I
O	gave
O	this
O	attempt
O	over
O	also
O	.
O	This
O	grieved
O	me
O	heartily;
O	and
O	now
O	I
O	saw
O	,
O	though
O	too
O	late
O	,
O	the
O	folly
O	of
O	beginning
O	a
O	work
O	before
O	we
O	count
O	the
O	cost
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	we
O	judge
O	rightly
O	of
O	our
O	own
O	strength
O	to
O	go
O	through
O	with
O	it
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	this
O	work
O	I
O	finished
O	my
O	fourth
O	year
O	in
O	this
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	kept
O	my
O	anniversary
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	devotion
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	as
O	much
O	comfort
O	as
O	ever
O	before
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	first
O	place
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	removed
O	from
O	all
O	the
O	wickedness
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	here;
O	I
O	had
O	neither
O	the
O	lusts
O	of
O	the
O	flesh
O	,
O	the
O	lusts
O	of
O	the
O	eye
O	,
O	nor
O	the
O	pride
O	of
O	life
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	covet
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	all
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	now
O	capable
O	of
O	enjoying;
O	I
O	was
O	lord
O	of
O	the
O	whole
O	manor;
O	or
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	pleased
O	,
O	I
O	might
O	call
O	myself
O	king
O	or
O	emperor
O	over
O	the
O	whole
O	country
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	possession
O	of:
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	rivals;
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	competitor
O	,
O	none
O	to
O	dispute
O	sovereignty
O	or
O	command
O	with
O	me;
O	I
O	might
O	have
O	raised
O	ship-loadings
O	of
O	corn
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	use
O	for
O	it;
O	so
O	I
O	let
O	as
O	little
O	grow
O	as
O	I
O	thought
O	enough
O	for
O	my
O	occasion
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	tortoise
O	or
O	turtle
O	enough
O	,
O	but
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	one
O	was
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	put
O	to
O	any
O	use;
O	I
O	had
O	timber
O	enough
O	to
O	have
O	built
O	a
O	fleet
O	of
O	ships;
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	grapes
O	enough
O	to
O	have
O	made
O	wine
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	have
O	cured
O	into
O	raisins
O	,
O	to
O	have
O	loaded
O	that
O	fleet
O	when
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	built
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	I
O	could
O	make
O	use
O	of
O	was
O	all
O	that
O	was
O	valuable:
O	I
O	had
O	enough
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	supply
O	my
O	wants
O	,
O	and
O	what
O	was
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	to
O	me
O	?
O	If
O	I
O	killed
O	more
O	flesh
O	than
O	I
O	could
O	eat
O	,
O	the
O	dog
O	must
O	eat
O	it
O	,
O	or
O	vermin;
O	if
O	I
O	sowed
O	more
O	corn
O	than
O	I
O	could
O	eat
O	,
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	spoiled;
O	the
O	trees
O	that
O	I
O	cut
O	down
O	were
O	lying
O	to
O	rot
O	on
O	the
O	ground;
O	I
O	could
O	make
O	no
O	more
O	use
O	of
O	them
O	but
O	for
O	fuel
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	occasion
O	for
O	but
O	to
O	dress
O	my
O	food
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	the
O	nature
O	and
O	experience
O	of
O	things
O	dictated
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	upon
O	just
O	reflection
O	,
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	good
O	things
O	of
O	this
O	world
O	are
O	no
O	farther
O	good
O	to
O	us
O	than
O	they
O	are
O	for
O	our
O	use;
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	whatever
O	we
O	may
O	heap
O	up
O	to
O	give
O	others
O	,
O	we
O	enjoy
O	just
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	we
O	can
O	use
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	more
O	.
O	The
O	most
O	covetous
O	,
O	griping
O	miser
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	cured
O	of
O	the
O	vice
O	of
O	covetousness
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	in
O	my
O	case;
O	for
O	I
O	possessed
O	infinitely
O	more
O	than
O	I
O	knew
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	.
