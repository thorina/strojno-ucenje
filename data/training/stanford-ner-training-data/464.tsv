O	questioner
O	in
O	that
O	language
O	that
O	historical
O	works
O	were
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	relied
O	upon
O	.
O	And
O	on
O	being
O	asked
O	his
O	opinion
O	of
O	Mahomet
O	,
O	he
O	replied
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	acquainted
O	with
O	the
O	father
O	of
O	the
O	prophet
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	dwelt
O	at
O	Ormuz
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	Mahomet
O	,
O	he
O	believed
O	him
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	intelligence;
O	once
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	prophet
O	deny
O	that
O	Christ
O	was
O	crucified
O	,
O	he
O	answered
O	abruptly
O	by
O	telling
O	him
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	witness
O	to
O	the
O	truth
O	of
O	that
O	event
O	.
O	He
O	related
O	also
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	Rome
O	when
O	Nero
O	set
O	it
O	on

O	he
O	had
O	known
O	Saladin
O	,
O	Tamerlane
O	,
O	Bajazeth
O	,
O	Eterlane
O	,

O	could
O	give

O	details
O	of
O	the
O	history
O	of
O	the
O	Crusades
O	.
O	Whether

O	found
O	out
O	in
O	London
O	or
O	not
