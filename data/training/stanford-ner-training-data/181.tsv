O	had
O	eaten
O	all
O	the
O	provisions
O	the
O	genie
O	had
O	brought;
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	Aladdin
O	,
O	who
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	the
O	thoughts
O	of
O	hunger
O	,
O	putting
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	silver
O	dishes
O	tinder
O	his

O	went
O	out
O	early
O	to
O	sell
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	addressing
O	himself
O	to
O	a
O	Jew
O	whom
O	he
O	met
O	in
O	the
O	streets
O	,
O	took
O	him
O	aside
O	,
O	and
O	pulling
O	out
O	the
O	plate
O	,
O	asked
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	buy
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	cunning
O	Jew
O	took
O	the
O	dish
O	,
O	examined
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	good
O	silver
O	,
O	asked
O	Aladdin
O	at
O	how
O	much
O	he
O	valued
O	it
O	.
O	Aladdin
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	used
O	to
O	such
O	traffic
O	,
O	told
O	him
O	he
O	would
O	trust
O	to
O	his
O	judgment
O	and
O	honour
O	.
O	The
O	Jew
O	was
O	somewhat
O	confounded
O	at
O	this
O	plain
O	dealing;
O	and
O	doubting
O	whether
O	Aladdin
O	understood
O	the
O	material
O	or
O	the
O	full
O	value
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	offered
O	to
O	sell
O	,
O	took
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	gold
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	purse
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	him
O	,
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	but
O	the
O	sixtieth
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	worth
O	of
O	the
O	plate
O	.
O	Aladdin
O	,
O	taking
O	the
O	money
O	very
O	eagerly
O	,
O	retired
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	haste
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	Jew
O	,
O	not
O	content
O	with
O	the
O	exorbitancy
O	of
O	his
O	profit
O	,
O	was
O	vexed
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	penetrated
O	into
O	his
O	ignorance
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	run
O	after
O	him
O	,
O	to
O	endeavour
O	to
O	get
O	some
O	change
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	piece
O	of
O	gold;
O	but
O	he
O	ran
O	so
O	fast
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	got
O	so
O	far
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	impossible
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	overtake
O	him
O	.
O	Before
O	Aladdin
O	went
O	home
O	,
O	he
O	called
O	at
O	a
O	baker
O	'
O	s
O	,
O	bought
O	some
O	cakes
O	of
O	bread
O	,
O	changed
O	his
O	money
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	his
O	return
O	gave
O	the
O	rest
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	who
O	went
O	and
O	purchased
O	provisions
O	enough
O	to
O	last
O	them
O	some
O	time
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	manner
O	they
O	lived
O	,
O	till
O	Aladdin
O	had
O	sold
O	the
O	twelve
O	dishes
O	singly
O	,
O	as
O	necessity
O	pressed
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	Jew
O	,
O	for
O	the

O	money;
O	who
O	,
O	after
O	the
O	first

O	,
O	durst
O	not
O	offer
O	him

O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	losing
O	so
O	good
O	a
O	bargain
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	sold
O	the
O	last
O	dish
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	recourse
O	to
O	the
O	tray
O	,
O	which
O	weighed
O	ten
O	times
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	the
O	dishes
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	carried
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	old
O	purchaser
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	too
O	large
O	and
O	cumbersome;
O	therefore
O	he
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	bring
O	him
O	home
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	'

O	,
O	where
O	,

O	Jew
O	had
O	examined
O	the

O	OF
O	THE
O	FORTY
O	ROBBERS

O	lived
O	in

O	of

O	two
O	brothers

O	named

O	and

O	.
O	Their
O	father
O	divided
O	a
O	small

O	equally
O	between
O	them
O	.
O	Cassim
O	married
O	a
O	very
O	rich
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	became
O	a
O	wealthy
O	merchant
O	.
O	Ali
O	Baba
O	married
O	a
O	woman
O	as
O	poor
O	as
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	by
O	cutting
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	bringing
O	it
O	upon
O	three
O	asses
O	into
O	the

O	,
O	to

O	a

O	cloud
O	of
O	dust
O	,
O	which
O	seemed
O	to
O	approach
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	observed
O	it
O	with
O	attention
O	,
O	and
O	distinguished
O	soon
O	after
O	a
O	body
O	of
O	horsemen
O	,
O	who
O	he
O	suspected
O	might
O	be
O	robbers
O	.
O	He
O	determined
O	to
O	leave
O	his
O	asses
O	to
O	save
O	himself
O	.
O	He
O	climbed
O	up
O	a

O	,

O	,

O	were
O	thick
O	enough
O	to

O	to

O	and
O	showing
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	guide
O	,
O	asked
O	him
O	which

O	it
O	was
O	,
O	that

O	or
O	the
O	first
O	.
O	The
O	guide
O	was
O	so
O	confounded
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	answer
O	to
O	make;
O	but
O	still
O	more
O	puzzled
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	saw
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	houses
O	similarly
O	marked
O	.
O	He
O	assured
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	with
O	an
O	oath
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	marked
O	but
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	who
O	had
O	chalked
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	distinguish
O	the
O	house
O	which
O	the
O	cobbler
O	had
O	stopped
O	at
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	,
O	finding
O	that
O	their
O	design
O	had
O	proved
O	abortive
O	,
O	went
O	directly
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	meeting
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	his
O	troop
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	lost
O	their
O	labour
O	,
O	and
O	must
O	return
O	to
O	their
O	cave
O	.
O	He
O	himself
O	set
O	them
O	the
O	example
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	all
O	returned
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	troop
O	was
O	all
O	got
O	together
O	,
O	the
O	captain
O	told
O	them
O	the
O	reason
O	of
O	their
O	returning;
O	and
O	presently
O	the
O	conductor
O	was
O	declared
O	by
O	all
O	worthy
O	of
O	death
O	.
O	He
O	condemned
O	himself
O	,
O	acknowledging
O	that
O	he
O	ought
O	to
O	have
O	taken
O	better
O	precaution
O	,
O	and
O	prepared
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	stroke
O	from
O	him
O	who
O	was
O	appointed
O	to
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	the
O	safety
O	of
O	the
O	troop
O	required
O	the
O	discovery
O	of
O	the
O	second
O	intruder
O	into
O	the
O	cave
O	,
O	another
O	of
O	the
O	gang
O	,
O	who
O	promised
O	himself
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	succeed
O	better
O	,
O	presented
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	offer
O	being
O	accepted
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	corrupted
O	Baba
O	Mustapha
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	other
O	had
O	done;
O	and
O	being
O	shown
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	marked
O	it
O	in
O	a
O	place
O	more
O	remote
O	from
O	sight
O	,
O	with
O	red
O	chalk
O	.
O	Not
O	long
O	after
O	,
O	Morgiana
O	,
O	whose
O	eyes
O	nothing
O	could
O	escape
O	,
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	seeing
O	the
O	red
O	chalk
O	,
O	and
O	arguing
O	with
O	herself
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	done
O	before
O	,
O	marked
O	the
O	other
O	neighbours
O	'
O	houses
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	place
O	and
O	manner
O	.
O	The
O	robber
O	,
O	at
O	his
O	return
O	to
O	his
O	company
O	,
O	valued
O	himself
O	much
O	on
O	the
O	precaution
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	looked
O	upon
O	as
O	an
O	infallible
O	way
O	of
O	distinguishing
O	Ali
O	Baba
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	from
O	the
O	others;
O	and
O	the
O	captain
O	and
O	all
O	of
O	them
O	thought
O	it
O	must
O	succeed
O	.
O	They
O	conveyed
O	themselves
O	into
O	the
O	town
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	precaution
O	as
O	before;
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	robber
O	and
O	his
O	captain
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	street
O	,
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	same
O	difficulty;
O	at
O	which
O	the
O	captain
O	was
O	enraged
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	robber
O	in
O	as
O	great
O	confusion
O	as
O	his
O	predecessor
O	.
O	Thus
O	the
O	captain
O	and
O	his
O	troop
O	were
O	forced
O	to
O	retire
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	much
O	more
O	dissatisfied;
O	while
O	the
O	robber
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	author
O	of
O	the
O	mistake
O	underwent
O	the
O	same
O	punishment
O	,
O	to
O	which
O	he
O	willingly
O	submitted
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	,
O	having
O	lost
O	two
O	brave
O	fellows
O	of
O	his
O	troop
O	,
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	diminishing
O	it
O	too
O	much
O	by
O	pursuing
O	this
O	plan
O	to
O	get
O	information
O	of
O	the
O	residence
O	of
O	their
O	plunderer
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	by
O	their
O	example
O	that
O	their
O	heads
O	were
O	not
O	so
O	good
O	as
O	their
O	hands
O	on
O	such
O	occasions;
O	and
O	therefore
O	resolved
O	to
O	take
O	upon
O	himself
O	the
O	important
O	commission
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	addressed
O	himself
O	to
O	Baba
O	Mustapha
O	,
O	who
O	did
O	him
O	the
O	same
O	service
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	robbers
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	set
O	any
O	particular
O	mark
O	on
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	but
O	examined
O	and
O	observed
O	it
O	so
O	carefully
O	,
O	by
O	passing
O	often
O	by
O	it
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	impossible
