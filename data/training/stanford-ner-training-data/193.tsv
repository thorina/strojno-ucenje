O	of
O	the
O	sheep
O	and
O	oxen
O	in
O	the

O	,
O	he
O	used
O	to

O	with

O	battles
O	,

O	,
O	and

O	He
O	was
O	above

O	hardly
O	any

O	could
O	equal
O	him
O	at
O	wrestling;
O	or
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	met
O	with
O	a
O	match
O	for
O	himself
O	in
O	strength
O	,
O	his
O	skill
O	and
O	address
O	always
O	made

O	.
O	In

O	the
O	main

O	,
O	a
O	huge
O	giant
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	eighteen
O	feet
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	three
O	yards
O	round;
O	and
O	his
O	fierce
O	and
O	savage
O	looks
O	were
O	the
O	terror
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	neighbours
O	.
O	He
O	dwelt
O	in
O	a
O	gloomy
O	cavern
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	top
O	of

O	When

O	the

O	had
O	glutted
O	his
O	appetite
O	upon

O	cattle
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	throw
O	half-a-dozen
O	oxen
O	upon
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	tie
O	three

O	therefore

O	at

O	he
O	had
O	dug
O	a

O	twenty-two

O	the

O	by
