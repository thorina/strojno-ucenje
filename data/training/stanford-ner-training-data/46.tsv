O	It
O	would
O	have
O	made
O	a
O	Stoic
O	smile
O	to
O	have
O	seen
O	me
O	and
O	my
O	little
O	family
O	sit
O	down
O	to
O	dinner
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	my
O	majesty
O	,
O	the
O	prince
O	and
O	lord
O	of
O	the
O	whole
O	island;
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	lives
O	of
O	all
O	my
O	subjects
O	at
O	my
O	absolute
O	command;
O	I
O	could
O	hang
O	,
O	draw
O	,
O	give
O	liberty
O	,
O	and
O	take
O	it
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	rebels
O	among
O	all
O	my
O	subjects
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	like
O	a
O	king
O	I
O	dined
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	all
O	alone
O	,
O	attended
O	by
O	my
O	servants
O	!
O	Poll
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	my
O	favorite
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	person
O	permitted
O	to
O	talk
O	to
O	me
O	.
O	My
O	dog
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	now
O	grown
O	old
O	,
O	sat
O	always
O	at
O	my
O	right
O	hand;
O	and
O	two
O	cats
O	,
O	one
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	table
O	and
O	one
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	expecting
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	a
O	bit
O	from
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	mark
O	of
O	especial
O	favor
O	.
O	With
O	this
O	attendance
O	and
O	in
O	this
O	plentiful
O	manner
O	I
O	lived;
O	neither
O	could
O	I
O	be
O	said
O	to
O	want
O	anything
O	but
O	society;
O	and
O	of
O	that
O	,
O	some
O	time
O	after
O	this
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	likely
O	to
O	have
O	too
O	much
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	something
O	impatient
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	observed
O	,
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	use
O	of
O	my
O	boat
O	,
O	though
O	very
O	loath
O	to
O	run
O	any
O	more
O	hazards;
O	and
O	therefore
O	sometimes
O	I
O	sat
O	contriving
O	ways
O	to
O	get
O	her
O	about
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	other
O	times
O	I
O	sat
O	myself
O	down
O	contented
O	enough
O	without
O	her
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	strange
O	uneasiness
O	in
O	my
O	mind
O	to
O	go
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	the
O	island:
O	this
O	inclination
O	increased
O	upon
O	me
O	every
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	travel
O	thither
O	by
O	land
O	,
O	following
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	I
O	did
O	so;
O	but
O	had
O	any
O	one
O	in
O	England
O	met
O	such
O	a
O	man
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	,
O	it
O	must
O	either
O	have
O	frightened
O	him
O	,
O	or
O	raised
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	laughter;
O	and
O	as
O	I
O	frequently
O	stood
O	still
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	myself
O	,
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	but
O	smile
O	at
O	the
O	notion
O	of
O	my
O	travelling
O	through
O	Yorkshire
O	with
O	such
O	an
O	equipage
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	dress
O	.
O	Be
O	pleased
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	sketch
O	of
O	my
O	figure
O	,
O	as
O	follows:
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	great
O	high
O	shapeless
O	cap
O	,
O	made
O	of
O	a
O	goat's
O	skin
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	flap
O	hanging
O	down
O	behind
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	sun
O	from
O	me
O	as
O	to
O	shoot
O	the
O	rain
O	off
O	from
O	running
O	into
O	my
O	neck
O	,
O	nothing
O	being
O	so
O	hurtful
O	in
O	these
O	climates
O	as
O	the
O	rain
O	upon
O	the
O	flesh
O	under
O	the
O	clothes
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	short
O	jacket
O	of
O	goat's
O	skin
O	,
O	the
O	skirts
O	coming
O	down
O	to
O	about
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	thighs
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	open-kneed
O	breeches
O	of
O	the
O	same;
O	the
O	breeches
O	were
O	made
O	of
O	the
O	skin
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	he-goat
O	,
O	whose
O	hair
O	hung
O	down
O	such
O	a
O	length
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	that
O	,
O	like
O	pantaloons
O	,
O	it
O	reached
O	to
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	my
O	legs;
O	stockings
O	and
O	shoes
O	I
O	had
O	none
O	,
O	but
O	had
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	somethings
O	,
O	I
O	scarce
O	knew
O	what
O	to
O	call
O	them
O	,
O	like
O	buskins
O	,
O	to
O	flap
O	over
O	my
O	legs
O	,
O	and
O	lace
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	like
O	spatterdashes
O	,
O	but
O	of
O	a
O	most
O	barbarous
O	shape
O	,
O	as
O	indeed
O	were
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	my
O	clothes
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	on
O	a
O	broad
O	belt
O	of
O	goat's
O	skin
O	dried
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	drew
O	together
O	with
O	two
O	thongs
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	instead
O	of
O	buckles
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	a
O	frog
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	of
O	this
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	a
O	sword
O	and
O	dagger
O	,
O	hung
O	a
O	little
O	saw
O	and
O	a
O	hatchet
O	,
O	one
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	and
O	one
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	another
O	belt
O	not
O	so
O	broad
O	,
O	and
O	fastened
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	,
O	which
O	hung
O	over
O	my
O	shoulder
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	under
O	my
O	left
O	arm
O	,
O	hung
O	two
O	pouches
O	,
O	both
O	made
O	of
O	goat's
O	skin
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	which
O	hung
O	my
O	powder
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	other
O	my
O	shot
O	.
O	At
O	my
O	back
O	I
O	carried
O	my
O	basket
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	my
O	shoulder
O	my
O	gun
O	,
O	and
O	over
O	my
O	head
O	a
O	great
O	clumsy
O	,
O	ugly
O	,
O	goat's-skin
O	umbrella
O	,
O	but
O	which
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	necessary
O	thing
O	I
O	had
O	about
O	me
O	next
O	to
O	my
O	gun
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	the
O	color
O	of
O	it
O	was
O	really
O	not
O	so
O	mulatto-like
O	as
O	one
O	might
O	expect
O	from
O	a
O	man
O	not
O	at
O	all
O	careful
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	living
O	within
O	nine
O	or
O	ten
O	degrees
O	of
O	the
O	equinox
O	.
O	My
O	beard
O	I
O	had
O	once
O	suffered
O	to
O	grow
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	about
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	a
O	yard
O	long;
O	but
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	both
O	scissors
O	and
O	razors
O	sufficient
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	cut
O	it
O	pretty
O	short
O	,
O	except
O	what
O	grew
O	on
O	my
O	upper
O	lip
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	trimmed
O	into
O	a
O	large
O	pair
O	of
O	Mahometan
O	whiskers
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	seen
O	worn
O	by
O	some
O	Turks
O	at
O	Sallee
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	Moors
O	did
O	not
O	wear
O	such
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	Turks
O	did;
O	of
O	these
O	mustachios
O	,
O	or
O	whiskers
O	,
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	say
O	they
O	were
O	long
O	enough
O	to
O	hang
O	my
O	hat
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	of
O	a
O	length
O	and
O	shape
O	monstrous
O	enough
O	,
O	and
O	such
O	as
O	in
O	England
O	would
O	have
O	passed
O	for
O	frightful
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	this
O	is
O	by
O	the
O	by;
O	for
O	as
O	to
O	my
O	figure
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	so
O	few
O	to
O	observe
O	me
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	of
O	no
O	manner
O	of
O	consequence
O	,
O	so
O	I
O	say
O	no
O	more
O	of
O	that
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	kind
O	of
O	dress
O	I
O	went
O	my
O	new
O	journey
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	out
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	days
O	.
O	I
O	travelled
O	first
O	along
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	directly
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	first
O	brought
O	my
O	boat
O	to
O	an
O	anchor
O	to
O	get
O	upon
O	the
O	rocks;
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	no
O	boat
O	now
O	to
O	take
O	care
O	of
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	over
O	the
O	land
O	a
O	nearer
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	same
O	height
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	upon
O	before
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	looking
O	forward
O	to
O	the
O	points
O	of
O	the
O	rocks
O	which
O	lay
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	double
O	with
O	my
O	boat
O	,
O	as
O	is
O	said
O	above
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	sea
O	all
O	smooth
O	and
O	quiet--no
O	rippling
O	,
O	no
O	motion
O	,
O	no
O	current
O	,
O	any
O	more
O	there
O	than
O	in
O	other
O	places
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	at
O	a
O	strange
O	loss
O	to
O	understand
O	this
O	,
O	and
O	resolved
O	to
O	spend
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	the
O	observing
O	it
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	nothing
O	from
O	the
O	sets
O	of
O	the
O	tide
O	had
O	occasioned
O	it;
O	but
O	I
O	was
O	presently
O	convinced
O	how
O	it
O	was;
O	viz
O	.
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	tide
O	of
O	ebb
O	setting
O	from
O	the
O	west
O	,
O	and
O	joining
O	with
O	the
O	current
O	of
O	waters
O	from
O	some
O	great
O	river
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	must
O	be
O	the
O	occasion
O	of
O	this
O	current
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	according
O	as
O	the
O	wind
O	blew
O	more
O	forcibly
O	from
O	the
O	west
O	or
O	from
O	the
O	north
O	,
O	this
O	current
O	came
O	nearer
O	or
O	went
O	farther
O	from
O	the
O	shore;
O	for
O	,
O	waiting
O	thereabouts
O	till
O	evening
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	rock
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	the
O	tide
O	of
O	ebb
O	being
O	made
O	,
O	I
O	plainly
O	saw
O	the
O	current
O	again
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	only
O	that
O	it
O	ran
O	farther
O	off
O	,
O	being
O	near
O	half
O	a
O	league
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	whereas
O	in
O	my
O	case
O	it
O	set
O	close
O	upon
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	hurried
O	me
O	and
O	my
O	canoe
O	along
O	with
O	it
O	,
O	which
O	at
O	another
O	time
O	it
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	done
O	.
O	This
O	observation
O	convinced
O	me
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	to
O	observe
O	the
O	ebbing
O	and
O	the
O	flowing
O	of
O	the
O	tide
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	might
O	very
O	easily
O	bring
O	my
O	boat
O	about
O	the
O	island
O	again;
O	but
O	when
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	putting
O	it
O	in
O	practice
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	such
O	terror
O	upon
O	my
O	spirits
O	at
O	the
O	remembrance
O	of
O	the
O	danger
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	in
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	again
O	with
O	any
O	patience
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	contrary
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	up
O	another
O	resolution
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	more
O	safe
O	,
O	though
O	more
O	laborious--
O	and
O	this
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	would
O	build
O	,
O	or
O	rather
O	make
O	,
O	me
O	another
O	perigaua
O	or
O	canoe
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	have
O	one
O	for
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	for
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	You
O	are
O	to
O	understand
O	that
O	now
O	I
O	had
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	may
O	call
O	it
O	,
O	two
O	plantations
O	in
O	the
O	island--one
O	my
O	little
O	fortification
O	or
O	tent
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	wall
O	about
O	it
O	,
O	under
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	cave
O	behind
O	me
O	,
O	which
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	I
O	had
O	enlarged
O	into
O	several
O	apartments
O	or
O	caves
O	,
O	one
O	within
O	another
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	these
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	driest
O	and
O	largest
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	door
O	out
O	beyond
O	my
O	wall
O	or
O	fortification--that
O	is
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	beyond
O	where
O	my
O	wall
O	joined
O	to
O	the
O	rock--was
O	all
O	filled
O	up
O	with
O	the
O	large
O	earthen
O	pots
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	have
O	given
O	an
O	account
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	fourteen
O	or
O	fifteen
O	great
O	baskets
O	,
O	which
O	would
O	hold
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	bushels
O	each
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	laid
O	up
O	my
O	stores
O	of
O	provisions
O	,
O	especially
O	my
O	corn
O	,
O	some
O	in
O	the
O	ear
O	,
O	cut
O	off
O	short
O	from
O	the
O	straw
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	rubbed
O	out
O	with
O	my
O	hand
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	my
O	wall
O	,
O	made
O	,
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	with
O	long
O	stakes
O	or
O	piles
O	,
O	those
O	piles
O	grew
O	all
O	like
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	grown
O	so
O	big
O	,
O	and
O	spread
O	so
O	very
O	much
O	,
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	the
O	least
O	appearance
O	,
O	to
O	any
O	one's
O	view
O	,
O	of
O	any
O	habitation
O	behind
O	them
O	.
O	Near
O	this
O	dwelling
O	of
O	mine
O	,
O	but
O	a
O	little
O	farther
O	within
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	upon
O	lower
O	ground
O	,
O	lay
O	my
O	two
O	pieces
O	of
O	corn
O	land
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	kept
O	duly
O	cultivated
O	and
O	sowed
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	duly
O	yielded
O	me
O	their
O	harvest
O	in
O	its
O	season;
O	and
O	whenever
O	I
O	had
O	occasion
O	for
O	more
O	corn
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	more
O	land
O	adjoining
O	as
O	fit
O	as
O	that
O	.
O	Besides
O	this
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	my
O	country-seat
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	now
O	a
O	tolerable
O	plantation
O	there
O	also;
O	for
O	,
O	first
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	my
O	little
O	bower
O	as
O	I
O	called
O	it
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	kept
O	in
O	repair--that
O	is
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	I
O	kept
O	the
O	hedge
O	which
O	encircled
O	it
O	in
O	constantly
O	fitted
O	up
O	to
O	its
O	usual
O	height
O	,
O	the
O	ladder
O	standing
O	always
O	in
O	the
O	inside
O	.
O	I
O	kept
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	which
O	at
O	first
O	were
O	no
O	more
O	than
O	stakes
O	,
O	but
O	were
O	now
O	grown
O	very
O	firm
O	and
O	tall
O	,
O	always
O	cut
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	spread
O	and
O	grow
O	thick
O	and
O	wild
O	,
O	and
O	make
O	the
O	more
O	agreeable
O	shade
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	did
O	effectually
O	to
O	my
O	mind
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	this
O	I
O	had
O	my
O	tent
O	always
O	standing
O	,
O	being
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	a
O	sail
O	spread
O	over
O	poles
O	,
O	set
O	up
O	for
O	that
O	purpose
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	never
O	wanted
O	any
O	repair
O	or
O	renewing;
O	and
O	under
O	this
O	I
O	had
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	squab
O	or
O	couch
O	with
O	the
O	skins
O	of
O	the
O	creatures
O	I
O	had
O	killed
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	other
O	soft
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	blanket
O	laid
O	on
O	them
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	belonged
O	to
O	our
O	sea-bedding
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	saved;
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	watch-coat
O	to
O	cover
O	me
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	,
O	whenever
O	I
O	had
O	occasion
O	to
O	be
O	absent
O	from
O	my
O	chief
O	seat
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	up
O	my
O	country
O	habitation
O	.
O	Adjoining
O	to
O	this
O	I
O	had
O	my
O	enclosures
O	for
O	my
O	cattle
O	,
O	that
O	is
O	to
O	say
O	my
O	goats
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	taken
O	an
O	inconceivable
O	deal
O	of
O	pains
O	to
O	fence
O	and
O	enclose
O	this
O	ground
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	so
O	anxious
O	to
O	see
O	it
O	kept
O	entire
O	,
O	lest
O	the
O	goats
O	should
O	break
O	through
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	never
O	left
O	off
O	till
O	,
O	with
O	infinite
O	labor
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	stuck
O	the
O	outside
O	of
O	the
O	hedge
O	so
O	full
O	of
O	small
O	stakes
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	near
O	to
O	one
O	another
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	rather
O	a
O	pale
O	than
O	a
O	hedge
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	scarce
O	room
O	to
O	put
O	a
O	hand
O	through
O	between
O	them;
O	which
O	afterwards
O	,
O	when
O	those
O	stakes
O	grew
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	all
O	did
O	in
O	the
O	next
O	rainy
O	season
O	,
O	made
O	the
O	enclosure
O	strong
O	like
O	a
O	wall
O	,
O	indeed
O	stronger
O	than
O	any
O	wall
O	.
O	This
O	will
O	testify
O	for
O	me
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	idle
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	spared
O	no
O	pains
O	to
O	bring
O	to
O	pass
O	whatever
O	appeared
O	necessary
O	for
O	my
O	comfortable
O	support
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	considered
O	the
O	keeping
O	up
O	a
O	breed
O	of
O	tame
O	creatures
O	thus
O	at
O	my
O	hand
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	living
O	magazine
O	of
O	flesh
O	,
O	milk
O	,
O	butter
O	,
O	and
O	cheese
O	for
O	me
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	I
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	to
O	be
O	forty
O	years;
O	and
O	that
O	keeping
O	them
O	in
O	my
O	reach
O	depended
O	entirely
O	upon
O	my
O	perfecting
O	my
O	enclosures
O	to
O	such
O	a
O	degree
O	that
O	I
O	might
O	be
O	sure
O	of
O	keeping
O	them
O	together;
O	which
O	by
O	this
O	method
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	I
O	so
O	effectually
O	secured
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	these
O	little
O	stakes
O	began
O	to
O	grow
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	planted
O	them
O	so
O	very
O	thick
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	pull
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	up
O	again
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	place
O	also
O	I
O	had
O	my
O	grapes
O	growing
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	principally
O	depended
O	on
O	for
O	my
O	winter
O	store
O	of
O	raisins
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	I
O	never
O	failed
O	to
O	preserve
O	very
O	carefully
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	best
O	and
O	most
O	agreeable
O	dainty
O	of
O	my
O	whole
O	diet;
O	and
O	indeed
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	only
O	agreeable
O	,
O	but
O	medicinal
O	,
O	wholesome
O	,
O	nourishing
O	,
O	and
O	refreshing
O	to
O	the
O	last
O	degree
O	.
O	As
O	this
O	was
O	also
O	about
O	half-way
O	between
O	my
O	other
O	habitation
O	and
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	laid
O	up
O	my
O	boat
O	,
O	I
O	generally
O	stayed
O	and
O	lay
O	here
O	in
O	my
O	way
O	thither
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	used
O	frequently
O	to
O	visit
O	my
O	boat;
O	and
O	I
O	kept
O	all
O	things
O	about
O	or
O	belonging
O	to
O	her
O	in
O	very
O	good
O	order
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	I
O	went
O	out
O	in
O	her
O	to
O	divert
O	myself
O	,
O	but
O	no
O	more
O	hazardous
O	voyages
O	would
O	I
O	go
O	,
O	scarcely
O	ever
O	above
O	a
O	stone's
O	cast
O	or
O	two
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	so
O	apprehensive
O	of
O	being
O	hurried
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	knowledge
O	again
O	by
O	the
O	currents
O	or
O	winds
O	,
O	or
O	any
O	other
O	accident
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	I
O	come
O	to
O	a
O	new
O	scene
O	of
O	my
O	life
O	.
O	It
O	happened
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	about
O	noon
O	,
O	going
O	towards
O	my
O	boat
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	exceedingly
O	surprised
O	with
O	the
O	print
O	of
O	a
O	man's
O	naked
O	foot
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	very
O	plain
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	on
O	the
O	sand
O	.
O	I
O	stood
O	like
O	one
O	thunderstruck
O	,
O	or
O	as
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	seen
O	an
O	apparition
O	.
O	I
O	listened
O	,
O	I
O	looked
O	round
O	me
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	could
O	hear
O	nothing
O	,
O	nor
O	see
O	anything;
O	I
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	a
O	rising
O	ground
O	to
O	look
O	farther;
O	I
O	went
O	up
O	the
O	shore
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	one;
O	I
O	could
O	see
O	no
O	other
O	impression
O	but
O	that
O	one
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	it
O	again
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	there
O	were
O	any
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	observe
O	if
O	it
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	my
O	fancy;
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	room
O	for
O	that
O	,
O	for
O	there
O	was
O	exactly
O	the
O	print
O	of
O	a
O	foot--
O	toes
O	,
O	heel
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	part
O	of
O	a
O	foot
O	.
O	How
O	it
O	came
O	thither
O	I
O	knew
O	not
O	,
O	nor
O	could
O	I
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	imagine;
O	but
O	after
O	innumerable
O	fluttering
O	thoughts
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	man
O	perfectly
O	confused
O	and
O	out
O	of
O	myself
O	,
O	I
O	came
O	home
O	to
O	my
O	fortification
O	,
O	not
O	feeling
O	,
O	as
O	we
O	say
O	,
O	the
O	ground
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	,
O	but
O	terrified
O	to
O	the
O	last
O	degree
O	,
O	looking
O	behind
O	me
O	at
O	every
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	steps
O	,
O	mistaking
O	every
O	bush
O	and
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	fancying
O	every
O	stump
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	man
O	.
O	Nor
O	is
O	it
O	possible
O	to
O	describe
O	how
O	many
O	various
O	shapes
O	my
O	affrighted
O	imagination
O	represented
O	things
O	to
O	me
O	in
O	,
O	how
O	many
O	wild
O	ideas
O	were
O	found
O	every
O	moment
O	in
O	my
O	fancy
O	,
O	and
O	what
O	strange
O	,
O	unaccountable
O	whimsies
O	came
O	into
O	my
O	thoughts
O	by
O	the
O	way
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	my
O	castle
O	(
O	for
O	so
O	I
O	think
O	I
O	called
O	it
O	ever
O	after
O	this
O	)
O	,
O	I
O	fled
O	into
O	it
O	like
O	one
O	pursued
O	.
O	Whether
O	I
O	went
O	over
O	by
O	the
O	ladder
O	,
O	as
O	first
O	contrived
O	,
O	or
O	went
O	in
O	at
O	the
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	called
O	a
O	door
O	,
O	I
O	cannot
O	remember;
O	no
O	,
O	nor
O	could
O	I
O	remember
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	,
O	for
O	never
O	frightened
O	hare
O	fled
O	to
O	cover
O	,
O	or
O	fox
O	to
O	earth
O	,
O	with
O	more
O	terror
O	of
O	mind
O	than
O	I
O	to
O	this
O	retreat
O	.
O	I
O	slept
O	none
O	that
O	night;
O	the
O	farther
O	I
O	was
O	from
O	the
O	occasion
O	of
O	my
O	fright
O	,
O	the
O	greater
O	my
O	apprehensions
O	were
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	something
O	contrary
O	to
O	the
O	nature
O	of
O	such
O	things
O	,
O	and
O	especially
O	to
O	the
O	usual
O	practice
O	of
O	all
O	creatures
O	in
O	fear;
O	but
O	I
O	was
O	so
O	embarrassed
O	with
O	my
O	own
O	frightful
O	ideas
O	of
O	the
O	thing
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	formed
O	nothing
O	but
O	dismal
O	imaginations
O	to
O	myself
O	,
O	even
O	though
O	I
O	was
O	now
O	a
O	great
O	way
O	off
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	I
O	fancied
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	the
O	devil
O	,
O	and
O	reason
O	joined
O	in
O	with
O	me
O	in
O	this
O	supposition
O	,
O	for
O	how
O	should
O	any
O	other
O	thing
O	in
O	human
O	shape
O	come
O	into
O	the
O	place
O	?
O	Where
O	was
O	the
O	vessel
O	that
O	brought
O	them
O	?
O	What
O	marks
O	were
O	there
O	of
O	any
O	other
O	footstep
O	?
O	And
O	how
O	was
O	it
O	possible
O	a
O	man
O	should
O	come
O	there
O	?
O	But
O	then
O	,
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	Satan
O	should
O	take
O	human
O	shape
O	upon
O	him
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	place
O	,
O	where
O	there
O	could
O	be
O	no
O	manner
O	of
O	occasion
O	for
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	print
O	of
O	his
O	foot
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	even
O	for
O	no
O	purpose
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	sure
O	I
O	should
O	see
O	it--this
O	was
O	an
O	amusement
O	the
O	other
O	way
O	.
O	I
O	considered
O	that
O	the
O	devil
O	might
O	have
O	found
O	out
O	abundance
O	of
O	other
O	ways
O	to
O	have
O	terrified
O	me
O	than
O	this
O	of
O	the
O	single
O	print
O	of
O	a
O	foot;
O	that
O	as
O	I
O	lived
O	quite
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	never
O	have
O	been
O	so
O	simple
O	as
O	to
O	leave
O	a
O	mark
O	in
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	it
O	was
O	ten
O	thousand
O	to
O	one
O	whether
O	I
O	should
O	ever
O	see
O	it
O	or
O	not
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	sand
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	first
O	surge
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	upon
O	a
O	high
O	wind
O	,
O	would
O	have
O	defaced
O	entirely
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	seemed
O	inconsistent
O	with
O	the
O	thing
O	itself
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	notions
O	we
O	usually
O	entertain
O	of
O	the
O	subtlety
O	of
O	the
O	devil
O	.
O	Abundance
O	of
O	such
O	things
O	as
O	these
O	assisted
O	to
O	argue
O	me
O	out
O	of
O	all
O	apprehensions
O	of
O	its
O	being
O	the
O	devil;
O	and
O	I
O	presently
O	concluded
O	then
O	that
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	some
O	more
O	dangerous
O	creature;
O	viz
O	.
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	savages
O	of
O	the
O	mainland
O	opposite
O	who
O	had
O	wandered
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	in
O	their
O	canoes
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	either
O	driven
O	by
O	the
O	currents
O	or
O	by
O	contrary
O	winds
O	,
O	had
O	made
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	been
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	but
O	were
O	gone
O	away
O	again
O	to
O	sea;
O	being
O	as
O	loath
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	to
O	have
O	stayed
O	in
O	this
O	desolate
O	island
O	as
O	I
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	to
O	have
O	had
O	them
O	.
O	While
O	these
O	reflections
O	were
O	rolling
O	in
O	my
O	mind
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	very
O	thankful
O	in
O	my
O	thoughts
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	so
O	happy
O	as
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	thereabouts
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	see
O	my
O	boat
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	concluded
O	that
O	some
O	inhabitants
O	had
O	been
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	have
O	searched
O	farther
O	for
O	me
O	.
O	Then
O	terrible
O	thoughts
O	racked
O	my
O	imagination
O	about
O	their
O	having
O	found
O	out
O	my
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	people
O	here;
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	so
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	certainly
O	have
O	them
O	come
O	again
O	in
O	greater
O	numbers
O	and
O	devour
O	me;
O	that
O	if
O	it
O	should
O	happen
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	not
O	find
O	me
O	,
O	yet
O	they
O	would
O	find
O	my
O	enclosure
O	,
O	destroy
O	all
O	my
O	corn
O	,
O	and
O	carry
O	away
O	all
O	my
O	flock
O	of
O	tame
O	goats
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	should
O	perish
O	at
O	last
O	for
O	mere
O	want
O	.
O	Thus
O	my
O	fear
O	banished
O	all
O	my
O	religious
O	hope
O	,
O	all
O	that
O	former
O	confidence
O	in
O	God
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	founded
O	upon
O	such
O	wonderful
O	experience
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	had
O	of
O	His
O	goodness;
O	as
O	if
O	He
O	that
O	had
O	fed
O	me
O	by
O	miracle
O	hitherto
O	could
O	not
O	preserve
O	,
O	by
O	His
O	power
O	,
O	the
O	provision
O	which
O	He
O	had
O	made
O	for
O	me
O	by
O	His
O	goodness
O	.
O	I
O	reproached
O	myself
O	with
O	my
O	laziness
O	,
O	that
O	would
O	not
O	sow
O	any
O	more
O	corn
O	one
O	year
O	than
O	would
O	just
O	serve
O	me
O	till
O	the
O	next
O	season
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	no
O	accident
O	could
O	intervene
O	to
O	prevent
O	my
O	enjoying
O	the
O	crop
O	that
O	was
O	upon
O	the
O	ground;
O	and
O	this
O	I
O	thought
O	so
O	just
O	a
O	reproof
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	resolved
O	for
O	the
O	future
O	to
O	have
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	years'
O	corn
O	beforehand;
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	whatever
O	might
O	come
O	,
O	I
O	might
O	not
O	perish
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	bread
O	.
O	How
O	strange
O	a
O	chequer-work
O	of
O	Providence
O	is
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	man
O	!
O	and
O	by
O	what
O	secret
O	different
O	springs
O	are
O	the
O	affections
O	hurried
O	about
O	,
O	as
O	different
O	circumstances
O	present
O	!
O	To-day
O	we
O	love
O	what
O	to-morrow
O	we
O	hate;
O	to-day
O	we
O	seek
O	what
O	to-morrow
O	we
O	shun;
O	to-day
O	we
O	desire
O	what
O	to-morrow
O	we
O	fear
O	,
O	nay
O	,
O	even
O	tremble
O	at
O	the
O	apprehensions
O	of
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	exemplified
O	in
O	me
O	,
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	lively
O	manner
O	imaginable;
O	for
O	I
O	whose
O	only
O	affliction
O	was
O	that
O	I
O	seemed
O	banished
O	from
O	human
O	society
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	alone
O	,
O	circumscribed
O	by
O	the
O	boundless
O	ocean
O	,
O	cut
O	off
O	from
O	mankind
O	,
O	and
O	condemned
O	to
O	what
O	I
O	call
O	silent
O	life;
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	as
O	one
O	whom
O	Heaven
O	thought
O	not
O	worthy
O	to
O	be
O	numbered
O	among
O	the

O	,
O	or
O	to
O	appear

O	that
O	to
O	have
O	seen
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	species
O	would
O	have
O	seemed
O	to
O	me
O	a
O	raising
O	me
O	from
O	death
O	to
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	greatest
O	blessing
O	that
O	Heaven
O	itself
O	,
O	next
O	to
O	the
O	supreme
O	blessing
O	of
O	salvation
O	,
O	could
O	bestow--I
O	say
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	now
O	tremble
O	at
O	the
O	very
O	apprehensions
O	of
O	seeing
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	sink
O	into
O	the
O	ground
O	at
O	but
O	the
O	shadow
O	or
O	silent
O	appearance
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	having
O	set
O	his
O	foot
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	.
O	Such
O	is
O	the
O	uneven
O	state
O	of
O	human
O	life;
O	and
O	it
O	afforded
O	me
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	curious
O	speculations
O	afterwards
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	had
O	recovered
O	from
O	my
O	first
O	surprise
O	.
O	I
O	considered
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	station
O	of
O	life
O	the
O	infinitely
O	wise
O	and
O	good
O	providence
O	of
O	God
O	had
O	determined
O	for
O	me;
O	that
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	foresee
O	what
O	the
O	ends
O	of
O	Divine
O	wisdom
O	might
O	be
O	in
O	all
O	this
O	,
O	so
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	dispute
O	His
O	sovereignty;
O	who
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	His
O	creature
O	,
O	had
O	an
O	undoubted
O	right
O	,
O	by
O	creation
O	,
O	to
O	govern
O	and
O	dispose
O	of
O	me
O	absolutely
O	as
O	He
O	thought
O	fit;
O	and
O	who
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	a
O	creature
O	that
O	had
O	offended
O	Him
O	,
O	had
O	likewise
O	a
O	judicial
O	right
O	to
O	condemn
O	me
O	to
O	what
O	punishment
O	He
O	thought
O	fit;
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	my
O	part
O	to
O	submit
O	to
O	bear
O	His
O	indignation
O	,
O	because
O	I
O	had
O	sinned
O	against
O	Him
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	reflected
O	,
O	that
O	as
O	God
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	not
O	only
O	righteous
O	but
O	omnipotent
O	,
O	had
O	thought
O	fit
O	thus
O	to
O	punish
O	and
O	afflict
O	me
O	,
O	so
O	He
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	deliver
O	me:
O	that
O	if
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	think
O	fit
O	to
O	do
O	so
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	my
O	unquestioned
O	duty
O	to
O	resign
O	myself
O	absolutely
O	and
O	entirely
O	to
O	His
O	will;
O	and
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	hand
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	my
O	duty
O	also
O	to
O	hope
O	in
O	Him
O	,
O	pray
O	to
O	Him
O	,
O	and
O	quietly
O	to
O	attend
O	to
O	the
O	dictates
O	and
O	directions
O	of
O	His
O	daily
O	providence
O	.

O	up
O	many
O	hours

O	me
O	.
O	In
O	answer
O	,
O	I
O	thankfully
O	laid
O	down
O	the
O	book
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	no
O	more
O	sad
O	,
O	at
O	least
O	on
O	that
O	occasion
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	these
O	cogitations
O	,
O	apprehensions
O	,
O	and
O	reflections
O	,
O	it
O	came
O	into
O	my
O	thoughts
O	one
O	day
O	that
O	all
O	this
O	might
O	,
O	be
O	a
O	mere
O	chimera
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	this
O	foot
O	might
O	be
O	the
O	print
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	foot
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	came
O	on
O	shore
O	from
O	my
O	boat:
O	this
O	cheered
O	me
O	up
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	persuade
O	myself
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	a
O	delusion;
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	nothing
O	else
O	but
O	my
O	own
O	foot;
O	and
O	why
O	might
O	I
O	not
O	come
O	that
O	way
O	from
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	going
O	that
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	boat
O	?
O	Again
O	,
O	I
O	considered
O	also
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	by
O	no
O	means
O	tell
O	for
O	certain
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	trod
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	not;
O	and
O	that
O	if
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	this
O	was
O	only
O	the
O	print
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	foot
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	played
O	the
O	part
O	of
O	those
O	fools
O	who
O	try
O	to
O	make
O	stories
O	of
O	spectres
O	and
O	apparitions
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	are
O	frightened
O	at
O	them
O	more
O	than
O	anybody
O	.
O	Now
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	take
O	courage
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	peep
O	abroad
O	again
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	stirred
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	castle
O	for
O	three
O	days
O	and
O	nights
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	starve
O	for
O	provisions;
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	little
O	or
O	nothing
O	within
O	doors
O	but
O	some
O	barley-cakes
O	and
O	water;
O	then
O	I
O	knew
O	that
O	my
O	goats
O	wanted
O	to
O	be
O	milked
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	which
O	usually
O	was
O	my
O	evening
O	diversion
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	poor
O	creatures
O	were
O	in
O	great
O	pain
O	and
O	inconvenience
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	it;
O	and
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	it
O	almost
O	spoiled
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	almost
O	dried
O	up
O	their
O	milk
O	.
O	Encouraging
O	myself
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	belief
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	print
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	might
O	be
O	truly
O	said
O	to
O	start
O	at
O	my
O	own
O	shadow
O	,
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	go
O	abroad
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	my
O	country
O	house
O	to
O	milk
O	my
O	flock;
O	but
O	to
O	see
O	with
O	what
O	fear
O	I
O	went
O	forward
O	,
O	how
O	often
O	I
O	looked
O	behind
O	me
O	,
O	how
O	I
O	was
O	ready
O	every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	lay
O	down
O	my
O	basket
O	and
O	run
O	for
O	my
O	life
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	made
O	any
O	one
O	have
O	thought
O	I
O	was
O	haunted
O	with
O	an
O	evil
O	conscience
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	lately
O	most
O	terribly
O	frightened;
O	and
O	so
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	down
O	thus
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	seen
O	nothing
O	,
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	little
O	bolder
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	think
O	there
O	was
O	really
O	nothing
O	in
O	it
O	but
O	my
O	own
O	imagination;
O	but
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	persuade
O	myself
O	fully
O	of
O	this
O	till
O	I
O	should
O	go
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	see
O	this
O	print
O	of
O	a
O	foot
O	,
O	and
O	measure
O	it
O	by
O	my
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	see
O	if
O	there
O	was
O	any
O	similitude
O	or
O	fitness
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	might
O	be
O	assured
O	it
O	was
O	my
O	own
O	foot:
O	but
O	when
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	first
O	,
O	it
O	appeared
O	evidently
O	to
O	me
O	that
O	when
O	I
O	laid
O	up
O	my
O	boat
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	possibly
O	be
O	on
O	shore
O	anywhere
O	thereabouts;
O	secondly
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	measure
O	the
O	mark
O	with
O	my
O	own
O	foot
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	my
O	foot
O	not
O	so
O	large
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	.
O	Both
O	these
O	things
O	filled
O	my
O	head
O	with
O	new
O	imaginations
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	me
O	the
O	vapors
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	highest
O	degree
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	shook
O	with
O	cold
O	like
O	one
O	in
O	an
O	ague;
O	and
O	I
O	went
O	home
O	again
O	,
O	filled
O	with
O	the
O	belief
O	that
O	some
O	man
O	or
O	men
O	had
O	been
O	on
O	shore
O	there;
O	or
O	,
O	in
O	short
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	inhabited
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	might
O	be
O	surprised
O	before
O	I
O	was
O	aware;
O	and
O	what
O	course
O	to
O	take
O	for
O	my
O	security
O	I
O	knew
O	not
O	.
O	Oh
O	,
O	what
O	ridiculous
O	resolutions
O	men
O	take
O	when
O	possessed
O	with
O	fear
O	!
O	It
O	deprives
O	them
O	of
O	the
O	use
O	of
O	those
O	means
O	which
O	reason
O	offers
O	for
O	their
O	relief
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	thing
O	I
O	proposed
O	to
O	myself
O	was
O	,
O	to
O	throw
O	down
O	my
O	enclosures
O	,
O	and
O	turn
O	all
O	my
O	tame
O	cattle
O	wild
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	lest
O	the
O	enemy
O	should
O	find
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	frequent
O	the
O	island
O	in
O	prospect
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	or
O	the
O	like
O	booty;
O	then
O	the
O	simple
O	thing
O	of
O	digging
O	up
O	my
O	two
O	corn-fields
O	,
O	lest
O	they
O	should
O	find
O	such
O	a
O	grain
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	still
O	be
O	prompted
O	to
O	frequent
O	the
O	island;
O	then
O	to
O	demolish
O	my
O	bower
O	and
O	tent
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	not
O	see
O	any
O	vestiges
O	of
O	habitation
O	,
O	and
O	be
O	prompted
O	to
O	look
O	farther
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	find
O	out
O	the
O	persons
O	inhabiting
O	.
O	These
O	were
O	the
O	subjects
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	night's
O	cogitations
O	after
O	I
O	was
O	come
O	home
O	again
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	apprehensions
O	which
O	had
O	so
O	overrun
O	my
O	mind
O	were
O	fresh
O	upon
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	head
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	vapors
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	fear
O	of
O	danger
O	is
O	ten
O	thousand
O	times
O	more
O	terrifying
O	than
O	danger
O	itself
O	,
O	when
O	apparent
O	to
O	the
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	find
O	the
O	burden
O	of
O	anxiety
O	greater
O	,
O	by
O	much
O	,
O	than
O	the
O	evil
O	which
O	we
O	are
O	anxious
O	about;
O	and
O	what
O	was
O	worse
O	than
O	all
O	this
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	that
O	relief
O	in
O	this
O	trouble
O	that
O	from
O	the
O	resignation
O	I
O	used
O	to
O	practise
O	I
O	hoped
O	to
O	have
O	.
O	I
O	looked
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	,
O	like
O	Saul
O	,
O	who
O	complained
O	not
O	only
O	that
O	the
O	Philistines
O	were
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	God
O	had
O	forsaken
O	him;
O	for
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	now
O	take
O	due
O	ways
O	to
O	compose
O	my
O	mind
O	,
O	by
O	crying
O	to
O	God
O	in
O	my
O	distress
O	,
O	and
O	resting
O	upon
O	His
O	providence
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	done
O	before
O	,
O	for
O	my
O	defence
O	and
O	deliverance;
O	which
O	,
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	done
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	at
O	least
O	been
O	more
O	cheerfully
O	supported
O	under
O	this
O	new
O	surprise
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	carried
O	through
O	it
O	with
O	more
O	resolution
O	.
O	This
O	confusion
O	of
O	my
O	thoughts
O	kept
O	me
O	awake
O	all
O	night;
O	but
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	I
O	fell
O	asleep;
O	and
O	having
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	amusement
O	of
O	my
O	mind
O	,
O	been
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	tired
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	spirits
O	exhausted
O	,
O	I
O	slept
O	very
O	soundly
O	,
O	and
O	waked
O	much
O	better
O	composed
O	than
O	I
O	had
O	ever
O	been
O	before
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	sedately;
O	and
O	,
O	upon
O	debate
O	with
O	myself
O	,
O	I
O	concluded
O	that
O	this
O	island
O	(
O	which
O	was
O	so
O	exceedingly
O	pleasant
O	,
O	fruitful
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	farther
O	from
O	the
O	mainland
O	than
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	seen
O	)
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	entirely
O	abandoned
O	as
O	I
O	might
O	imagine;
O	that
O	,
O	although
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	stated
O	inhabitants
O	who
O	lived
O	on
O	the
O	spot
O	,
O	yet
O	that
O	there
O	might
O	sometimes
O	come
O	boats
O	off
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	either
O	with
O	design
O	,
O	or
O	perhaps
O	never
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	driven
O	by
O	cross
O	winds
O	,
O	might
O	come
O	to
O	this
O	place;
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	lived
O	there
O	fifteen
O	years
O	now
O	and
O	had
O	not
O	met
O	with
O	the
O	least
O	shadow
O	or
O	figure
O	of
O	any
O	people
O	yet;
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	at
O	any
O	time
O	they
O	should
O	be
O	driven
O	here
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	probable
O	they
O	went
O	away
O	again
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	ever
O	they
O	could
O	,
O	seeing
O	they
O	had
O	never
O	thought
O	fit
O	to
O	fix
O	here
O	upon
O	any
O	occasion;
O	that
O	the
O	most
O	I
O	could
O	suggest
O	any
O	danger
O	from
O	was
O	from
O	any
O	casual
O	accidental
O	landing
O	of
O	straggling
O	people
O	from
O	the
O	main
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	likely
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	driven
O	hither
O	,
O	were
O	here
O	against
O	their
O	wills
O	,
O	so
O	they
O	made
O	no
O	stay
O	here
O	,
O	but
O	went
O	off
O	again
O	with
O	all
O	possible
O	speed;
O	seldom
O	staying
O	one
O	night
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	lest
O	they
O	should
O	not
O	have
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	the
O	tides
O	and
O	daylight
O	back
O	again;
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	consider
O	of
O	some
O	safe
O	retreat
O	,
O	in
O	case
O	I
O	should
O	see
O	any
O	savages
O	land
O	upon
O	the
O	spot
O	.
O	Now
O	I
O	began
O	sorely
O	to
O	repent
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	dug
O	my
O	cave
O	so
O	large
O	as
O	to
O	bring
O	a
O	door
O	through
O	again
O	,
O	which
O	door
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	said
O	,
O	came
O	out
O	beyond
O	where
O	my
O	fortification
O	joined
O	to
O	the
O	rock;
O	upon
O	maturely
O	considering
O	this
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	draw
O	me
O	a
O	second
O	fortification;
O	in
O	the
O	manner
O	of
O	a
O	semicircle
O	,
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	from
O	my
O	wall
O	,
O	just
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	planted
O	a
O	double
O	row
O	of
O	trees
O	about
O	twelve
O	years
O	before
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	made
O	mention;
O	these
O	trees
O	having
O	been
O	planted
O	so
O	thick
O	before
O	,
O	they
O	wanted
O	but
O	few
O	piles
O	to
O	be
O	driven
O	between
O	them
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	be
O	thicker
O	and
O	stronger
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	wall
O	would
O	be
O	soon
O	finished
O	.
O	So
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	now
O	a
O	double
O	wall;
O	and
O	my
O	outer
O	wall
O	was
O	thickened
O	with
O	pieces
O	of
O	timber
O	,
O	old
O	cables
O	,
O	and
O	everything
O	I
O	could
O	think
O	of
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	strong;
O	having
O	in
O	it
O	seven
O	little
O	holes
O	,
O	about
O	as
O	big
O	as
O	I
O	might
O	put
O	my
O	arm
O	out
O	at
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	inside
O	of
O	this
O	I
O	thickened
O	my
O	wall
O	to
O	about
O	ten
O	feet
O	thick
O	with
O	continually
O	bringing
O	earth
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	cave
O	,
O	and
O	laying
O	it
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	and
O	walking
O	upon
O	it;
O	and
O	through
O	the
O	seven
O	holes
O	I
O	contrived
O	to
O	plant
O	the
O	muskets
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	I
O	took
O	notice
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	got
O	seven
O	on
O	shore
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	ship;
O	these
O	I
O	planted
O	like
O	my
O	cannon
O	,
O	and
O	fitted
O	them
O	into
O	frames
O	,
O	that
O	held
O	them
O	like
O	a
O	carriage
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	fire
O	all
O	the
O	seven
O	guns
O	in
O	two
O	minutes'
O	time;
O	this
O	wall
O	I
O	was
O	many
O	a
O	weary
O	month
O	in
O	finishing
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	never
O	thought
O	myself
O	safe
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	done
O	.
O	When
O	this
O	was
O	done
O	I
O	stuck
O	all
O	the
O	ground
O	without
O	my
O	wall
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	great
O	length
O	every
O	way
O	,
O	as
O	full
O	with
O	stakes
O	or
O	sticks
O	of
O	the
O	osier-like
O	wood
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	so
O	apt
O	to
O	grow
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	well
O	stand;
O	insomuch
O	that
O	I
O	believe
O	I
O	might
O	set
O	in
O	near
O	twenty
O	thousand
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	leaving
O	a
O	pretty
O	large
O	space
O	between
O	them
O	and
O	my
O	wall
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	might
O	have
O	room
O	to
O	see
O	an
O	enemy
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	might
O	have
O	no
O	shelter
O	from
O	the
O	young
O	trees
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	attempted
O	to
O	approach
O	my
O	outer
O	wall
O	.
O	Thus
O	in
O	two
O	years'
O	time
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	thick
O	grove;
O	and
O	in
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	years'
O	time
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	wood
O	before
O	my
O	dwelling
O	,
O	growing
O	so
O	monstrously
O	thick
O	and
O	strong
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	indeed
O	perfectly
O	impassable;
O	and
O	no
O	men
O	,
O	of
O	what
O	kind
O	soever
O	,
O	could
O	ever
O	imagine
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	anything
O	beyond
O	it
O	,
O	much
O	less
O	a
O	habitation
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	way
O	which
O	I
O	proposed
O	to
O	myself
O	to
O	go
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	(
O	for
O	I
O	left
O	no
O	avenue
O	)
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	by
O	setting
O	two
O	ladders
O	,
O	one
O	to
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	rock
O	which
O	was
O	low
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	broke
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	room
O	to
O	place
O	another
O	ladder
O	upon
O	that;
O	so
O	when
O	the
O	two
O	ladders
O	were
O	taken
O	down
O	no
O	man
O	living
O	could
O	come
O	down
O	to
O	me
O	without
O	doing
O	himself
O	mischief;
O	and
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	down
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	still
O	on
O	the
O	outside
O	of
O	my
O	outer
O	wall
O	.
O	Thus
O	I
O	took
O	all
O	the
O	measures
O	human
O	prudence
O	could
O	suggest
O	for
O	my
O	own
O	preservation;
O	and
O	it
O	will
O	be
O	seen
O	at
O	length
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	altogether
O	without
O	just
O	reason;
O	though
O	I
O	foresaw
O	nothing
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	more
O	than
O	my
O	mere
O	fear
O	suggested
O	to
O	me
O	.
