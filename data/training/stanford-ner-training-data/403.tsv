O	assaulted
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	partly
O	moved
O	by
O	his
O	threats
O	and
O	partly
O	persuaded
O	by
O	the
O	innkeeper
O	,
O	they
O	left
O	off
O	throwing
O	stones
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	allowed
O	them
O	to
O	carry
O	away
O	the
O	wounded
O	men
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	watch
O	with
O	great
O	quietness
O	and
O	gravity
O	.
O	The
O	innkeeper
O	did
O	not
O	very
O	much
O	like
O	Don
O	Quixote's
O	pranks
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	determined
O	to
O	shorten
O	the
O	ceremony
O	and
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	order
O	of
O	knighthood
O	at
O	once
O	before
O	any
O	one
O	else
O	was
O	injured
O	.
O	Approaching
O	him
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	apologies
O	for
O	the
O	insolence
O	of
O	the
O	base
O	fellows
O	who
O	had
O	thrown
O	stones
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	explained
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	with
O	his
O	consent
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	thought
O	them
O	well
O	punished
O	for
O	their
O	impudence
O	.
O	He
O	added
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	necessary
O	for
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	to
O	watch
O	his
O	armour
O	any
O	more
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	chief
O	point
O	of
O	being
O	knighted
O	was
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	stroke
O	of
O	the
O	sword
O	on
O	the
O	neck
O	and
O	shoulder
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	ceremony
O	he
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	perform
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	readily
O	believed
O	,
O	and
O	answered
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	most
O	eager
O	to
O	obey
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	requested
O	him
O	to
O	finish
O	everything
O	as
O	speedily
O	as
O	possible
O	.
O	For
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	knighted
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	was
O	assaulted
O	again
O	,
O	he
O	intended
O	not
O	to
O	leave
O	one
O	person
O	alive
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	except
O	those
O	which
O	the
O	constable
O	should
O	command
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	would
O	spare
O	for
O	his
O	sake
O	.
O	The
O	innkeeper
O	,
O	alarmed
O	at
O	what
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	fearing
O	lest
O	he
O	should
O	carry
O	out
O	his
O	threat
O	,
O	set
O	about
O	the
O	ceremony
O	without
O	delay
O	.
O	He
O	brought
O	out
O	his
O	day-book
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	wrote
O	down
O	the
O	accounts
O	of
O	the
O	hay
O	and
O	straw
O	which
O	he
O	sold
O	to
O	carriers
O	who
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	inn
O	,
O	and
O	attended
O	by
O	a
O	small
O	boy
O	holding
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	a
O	candle
O	and
O	walking
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	followed
O	by
O	the
O	two
O	women
O	who
O	were
O	staying
O	at
O	the
O	inn
O	,
O	he
O	approached
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	,
O	He
O	solemnly
O	commanded
O	him
O	to
O	kneel
O	upon
O	his
O	knees
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	mumbled
O	something
O	which
O	he
O	pretended
O	to
O	read
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	book
O	that
O	he
O	held
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	good
O	blow
O	on
O	the
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	that
O	another
O	sound
O	thwack
O	over
O	the
O	shoulders
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	sword
O	,
O	always
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	so
O	continuing
O	to
O	mumble
O	and
O	murmur
O	as
O	though
O	he
O	were
O	reading
O	something
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	book
O	.
O	This
O	being
O	done
O	,
O	he
O	commanded
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	damsels
O	to
O	gird
O	on
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	did
O	with
O	much
O	grace
O	and
O	cleverness
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	was
O	with
O	difficulty
O	that
O	they
O	all
O	kept
O	from
O	laughing
O	during
O	this
O	absurd
O	ceremony
O	,
O	but
O	what
O	they
O	had
O	already
O	seen
O	of
O	Don
O	Quixote's
O	fury
O	made
O	them
O	careful
O	not
O	to
O	annoy
O	him
O	even
O	by
O	a
O	smile
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	had
O	girded
O	on
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	the
O	damsel
O	said:
O	"""May"
O	you
O	be
O	a
O	fortunate
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	meet
O	with
O	good
O	success
O	in
O	all
O	your
O	adventures
O	.
O	""""
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	asked
O	her
O	how
O	she
O	was
O	called
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	know
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	was
O	obliged
O	for
O	the
O	favours
O	he
O	had
O	received
O	.
O	She
O	answered
O	with
O	great
O	humility
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	named
O	Tolosa
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	a
O	butcher's
O	daughter
O	of
O	Toledo
O	.
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	replied
O	requesting
O	her
O	to
O	call
O	herself
O	from
O	henceforth
O	the
O	Lady
O	Tolosa
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	promised
O	to
O	perform
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	damsel
O	buckled
O	on
O	his
O	spurs
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	asked
O	her
O	name
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	it
O	was
O	Molinera
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	daughter
O	of
O	an
O	honest
O	miller
O	of
O	Antequera
O	.
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	entreated
O	her
O	also
O	to
O	call
O	herself
O	Lady
O	Molinera
O	,
O	and
O	offered
O	her
O	new
O	services
O	and
O	favours
O	.
O	These
O	strange
O	and
O	never-before-seen
O	ceremonies
O	being
O	ended
O	,
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	could
O	not
O	rest
O	until
O	he
O	was
O	mounted
O	on
O	horseback
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	go
O	to
O	seek
O	adventures
O	.
O	He
O	therefore
O	caused
O	Rozinante
O	to
O	be
O	instantly
O	saddled
O	,
O	leaped
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	embracing
O	the
O	innkeeper
O	,
O	thanked
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	thousand
O	wild
O	and
O	ridiculous
O	ways
O	for
O	the
O	great
O	favour
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	him
O	in
O	dubbing
O	him
O	knight
O	.
O	The
O	innkeeper
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	only
O	eager
O	to
O	be
O	rid
O	of
O	him
O	without
O	delay
O	,
O	answered
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	fashion
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	him
O	march
O	off
O	without
O	demanding
O	from
O	him
O	a
O	single
O	farthing
O	for
