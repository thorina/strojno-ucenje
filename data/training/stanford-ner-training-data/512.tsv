O	he
O	was
O	almost
O	fainting
O	with
O	thirst
O	and
O	hunger
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	day
O	passed
O	and
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	still
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	At
O	long
O	last
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	following
O	day
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	by
O	the
O	first
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	morning
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	close
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	trees
O	laden
O	with
O	fruit
O	of
O	every
O	kind
O	were
O	bending
O	down
O	over
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	The
O	boat
O	sailed
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	going
O	closer
O	and
O	closer
O	every
O	round
O	,
O	until
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	the
O	drooping
O	branches
O	almost
O	touched
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	fruit
O	within
O	his
O	reach
O	made
O	the
O	prince
O	hungrier
O	and
O	thirstier
O	than
O	he
O	was
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	forgetting
O	his
O	promise
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	cat--not
O	to
O	eat
O	anything
O	until
O	he
O	entered
O	the
O	palace
O	in
O	the
O	unknown
O	seas--he
O	caught
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	branches
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	,
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	eating
O	the
O	delicious
O	fruit
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	was
O	doing
O	so
O	the
O	boat
O	floated
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	and
O	soon
O	was
O	lost
O	to
O	sight;
O	but
O	the
O	prince
O	,
O	having
O	eaten
O	,
O	forgot
O	all
O	about
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	worse
O	still
O	,
O	forgot
O	all
O	about
O	the
O	princess
O	in
O	the
O	giant's
O	castle
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	eaten
O	enough

O	descended
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	turning
O	his
O	back
O	on
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	set
O	out
O	straight
O	before

O	.
O	Soon
O	the

O	The

O	shook
O	the
O	branches
O	,
O	and
O	the

O	,
O	sweet
O	berries
O	fell
O	into
O	the

O	until
O	it

O	,
O	and
O	they
O	fell
O	upon
O	the

O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	took
O	up
O	some
O	to
O	look

O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	looked
O	the
O	desire

O	grew
O	stronger
O	,

O	said
O	to

O	it
O	would
O	be
O	no
O	harm
O	to
O	taste
O	one;
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	tasted
O	it
O	the
O	flavor
O	was

O	he
O	swallowed

O	,

O	,

O	,
O	at
O	once
