O	Many
O	,
O	many
O	moons
O	before
O	the
O	White
O	man
O	came
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	Indian
O	boy
O	was
O	left
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	when
O	animals
O	and
O	men
O	understood
O	each
O	other
O	better
O	than
O	they
O	do
O	now
O	.
O	An
O	old
O	mother
O	bear
O	found
O	the
O	little
O	Indian
O	boy
O	.
O	She
O	felt
O	very
O	sorry
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	She
O	told
O	the
O	little
O	boy
O	not
O	to
O	cry
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	would
O	take
O	him
O	home
O	with
O	her;
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	nice
O	wigwam
O	in
O	the
O	hollow
O	of
O	a
O	big
O	tree
O	.
O	Old
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	had
O	two
O	cubs
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	place
O	between
O	her
O	great
O	paws
O	for
O	a
O	third
O	.
O	She
O	took
O	the
O	little
O	papoose
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	hugged
O	him
O	warm
O	and
O	close
O	.
O	She
O	fed
O	him
O	as
O	she
O	did
O	her
O	own
O	little
O	cubs
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	grew
O	strong
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	very
O	happy
O	with
O	his
O	adopted
O	mother
O	and
O	brothers
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	a
O	warm
O	lodge
O	in
O	the
O	hollow
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	tree
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	grew
O	older
O	,
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	found
O	for
O	them
O	all
O	the
O	honey
O	and
O	nuts
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	eat
O	.
O	From
O	sunrise
O	to
O	sunset
O	,
O	the
O	little
O	Indian
O	boy
O	played
O	with
O	his
O	cub
O	brothers
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	different
O	from
O	them
O	.
O	He
O	thought
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	bear
O	,
O	too
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	long
O	,
O	the
O	boy
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	bears
O	played
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	good
O	time
O	.
O	They
O	rolled
O	,
O	and
O	tumbled
O	,
O	and
O	wrestled
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	leaves
O	.
O	They
O	chased
O	one
O	another
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	bear
O	tree
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	they
O	had
O	a
O	matched
O	game
O	of
O	hug
O	,
O	for
O	every
O	little
O	bear
O	must
O	learn
O	to
O	hug
O	.
O	The
O	one
O	who
O	could
O	hug
O	the
O	longest
O	and
O	the
O	tightest
O	won
O	the
O	game
O	.
O	Old
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	watched
O	her
O	three
O	dear
O	children
O	at
O	their
O	play
O	.
O	She
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	content
O	and
O	happy
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	one
O	thing
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	afraid
O	some
O	harm
O	would
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	boy
O	.
O	Never
O	could
O	she
O	quite
O	forget
O	the
O	bear
O	hunters
O	.
O	Several
O	times
O	they
O	had
O	scented
O	her
O	tree
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	wind
O	had
O	thrown
O	them
O	off
O	the
O	trail
O	.
O	Once
O	,
O	from
O	her
O	bear-tree
O	window
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	thrown
O	out
O	rabbit
O	hairs
O	as
O	she
O	saw
O	them
O	coming
O	.
O	The
O	wind
O	had
O	blown
O	the
O	rabbit
O	hairs
O	toward
O	the
O	hunters
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	fell
O	near
O	the
O	hunters
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	suddenly
O	changed
O	into
O	rabbits
O	and
O	the
O	hunters
O	had
O	given
O	chase
O	.
O	At
O	another
O	time
O	,
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	tossed
O	some
O	partridge
O	feathers
O	to
O	the
O	wind
O	as
O	the
O	hunters
O	drew
O	near
O	her
O	tree
O	.
O	A
O	flock
O	of
O	partridges
O	went
O	whirring
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hunters
O	ran
O	after
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	on
O	this
O	day
O	,
O	Mother
O	Bear's
O	heart
O	was
O	heavy
O	.
O	She
O	knew
O	that
O	now
O	the
O	big
O	bear
O	hunters
O	were
O	coming
O	.
O	No
O	rabbits
O	or
O	partridges
O	could
O	lead
O	these
O	hunters
O	from
O	the
O	bear
O	trail
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	had
O	dogs
O	with
O	four
O	eyes
O	.
O	(
O	Foxhounds
O	have
O	a
O	yellow
O	spot
O	over
O	each
O	eye
O	which
O	makes
O	them
O	seem
O	double-eyed
O	.
O	)
O	These
O	dogs
O	were
O	never
O	known
O	to
O	miss
O	a
O	bear
O	tree
O	.
O	Sooner
O	or
O	later
O	they
O	would
O	scent
O	it
O	.
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	thought
O	she
O	might
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	save
O	herself
O	and
O	her
O	cubs
O	.
O	But
O	what
O	would
O	become
O	of
O	the
O	boy
O	?
O	She
O	loved
O	him
O	too
O	well
O	to
O	let
O	the
O	bear
O	hunters
O	kill
O	him
O	.
O	Just
O	then
O	the
O	porcupine
O	,
O	the
O	Chief
O	of
O	the
O	animals
O	,
O	passed
O	by
O	the
O	bear
O	tree
O	.
O	Mother
O	Bear
O	saw
O	him
O	.
O	She
O	put
O	her
O	head
O	out
O	the
O	bear-tree
O	window
O	and
O	called
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	came
O	and
O	sat
O	under
O	the
O	bear-tree
O	window
O	,
O	and
O	listened
O	to
O	Mother
O	Bear's
O	story
O	of
O	her
O	fears
O	for
O	the
O	boy
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	had
O	finished
O	,
O	Chief
O	Porcupine
O	said
O	he
O	would
O	call
O	a
O	council
O	of
O	the
O	animals
O	,
O	and
O	see
O	if
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	save
O	the
O	boy
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	Chief
O	had
O	a
O	big
O	voice
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	raised
O	his
O	voice
O	,
O	even
O	the
O	animals
O	away
O	on
O	the
O	longest
O	trails
O	heard
O	.
O	They
O	ran
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	gathered
O	under
O	the
O	council
O	tree
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	loud
O	roar
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	flapping
O	of
O	wings
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	birds
O	came
O	,

O	.

O	men
O	could
O	build
O	better
O	houses

O	The
O	fox
O	said

O	,

O	The
