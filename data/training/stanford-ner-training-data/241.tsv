O	He
O	had
O	scarcely
O	uttered
O	these
O	words
O	when
O	the
O	whole
O	village
O	was
O	astir
O	in
O	an
O	instant
O	.
O	All
O	ran
O	out
O	and
O	strained
O	their

O	catch
O	the
O	first
O	view
O	of
O	him
O	whom
O	they
O	had

O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Wassamo
O	came
O	forward
O	,
O	they
O	at
O	first
O	fell
O	from
O	him
O	as

O	had

O	from
O	the
O	Spirit-land
O	.
O	He
O	entered
O	the
O	lodge
O	of
O	his
O	parents
O	.
O	They
O	saw
O	that

O	was
O	Wassamo
O	,
O	living
O	,
O	breathing
O	and
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	ever
O	known
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	joy
O	lit
O	up
O	the
O	lodge-circle
O	as
O	though
O	a
O	new
O	fire
O	had
O	been
O	kindled
O	in
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	his
O	friends

O	He
O	related
O	all
O	that
O	had

O	to
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	moment
O	of
O	his

O	the
O	temporary
O	night-lodge
O	with
O	the
O	flame
O	on
O	his
O	head

O	He
O	told
O	them
O	of
O	the
O	strange
O	land
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	sojourned
O	during
O	his

O	He
O	added

O	,
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	married
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	his
O	wife
O	at
O	a
O	short
O	distance
O	from
O	the
O	village
O	.
O	She
O	went
O	out
O	immediately
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	her;
O	they
O	soon
O	found
O	her
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	women
O	in
O	the
O	village
O	conducted
O	her
O	in
O	honor
O	to
O	the
O	lodge
O	of
O	her
O	new
O	relations
O	.
O	The
O	Indian
O	people
O	were
O	astonished
O	at
O	her
O	beauty
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	whiteness
O	of
O	her
O	skin
O	,
O	and
O	still
O	more
O	,

O	was
O	able
O	to
O	talk
O	with
O	them
O	in
O	their
O	own
O	language
O	.
O	The
O	village
O	was
O	happy
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	feast
O	went
O	on
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	the
O	supply
O	held
O	out
O	.
O	All
O	were
O	delighted
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	acquaintance
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	Sand-Spirit's
O	daughter;

O	.
O	The
O	cousin
O	of
O	Wassamo
O	recovered
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	sang
O	once
O	more
O	his
O	sad
O	or
O	mirthful
O	chants
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	the

O	was
O	upon
O	him;

O	kept
O	close
O	by
O	Wassamo
O	,
O	and
O	watched
O	him
O	in
O	all
O	his
O	movements
O	.
O	He
O	made
O	it
O	a
O	point
O	to
O	ask
O	many
O	questions
O	of
O	the

O	he
O	came
O	from;
O	some
O	of

O	replied
O	to
O	,
O	but
O	others
O	were
O	left
O	entirely
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	.
O	At
O	every
O	thunder-storm
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	old
O	Sand-Spirit
O	had
O	foreboded
O	,
O	the
O	wife
O	of

O	disappeared
O	,
O	much
O	to
O	the
O	astonishment
O	of

O	Indian
O	company
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	to

O	wonder
O	,

O	When
O	the

O	to
O	which
O	she
O	withdrew
O	for

O	immediately
O	set
O	about

O	She

O	at

O	as
O	each
O	brought
O	his
O	bundle
O	to
O	the

O	Wassamo
O	,

O	and
O	for
O	a
O	plentiful
O	supply
O	of
O	food
O	.
O	They
O	particularly
O	desired
O	that

O	kept
O	quiet

O	would

O	each
O	of
O	their
O	requests
O	to

O	The
O	tobacco
O	was
O	stored
O	in
O	sacks
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	outside
O	of
O	the
O	skins
O	,
O	that
O	there
O	might
O	be
O	no

O	as
O	to
O	their
O	wants
O	,
O	each
O	one
O	who
O	had
O	given
O	tobacco

O	totem
O	or
O	family
O	emblem

O	These

O	Wassamo
O	warned

O	nor
O	attempt
O	to

O	he
O	disappeared
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	took
O	the
O	moose-skin
O	sacks
O	filled
O	with
O	tobacco
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	farewell
O	to

O	insisted
O	on
O	the
O	privilege
O	of
O	attending
O	Wassamo
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	for
O	a
O	distance
O	,

O	when

O	the
O	strongest
O	wish
O	to
O	proceed
O	with
O	them
O	on
O	their
O	journey
O	.
O	Wassamo
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	it
O	could
O	not
O	be;
O	that
O	only
O	spirits

O	exert

O	and
O	that
O	there

O	no

O	They
O	then

O	Wassamo
O	enjoining
O	it
O	upon

O	,
O	at
O	risk
O	of
O	his
O	life
O	,
O	to
O	not
O	look
O	back
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	once
O	started
O	to
O	return
O	.
O	The
O	cousin
O	,
O	sore
O	at
O	heart
O	,
O	but
O	constrained
O	to
O	obey
O	,
O	parted
O	from
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	walked
O	sadly
O	away
O	,
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	gliding
O	noise
O	as
O	of
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	waters
O	that
O	were
O	cleaved

O	He
O	returned

O	No

O	in
O	any

O	now
O	.
O	Wassamo
O	with
O	his
O	wife
O	soon
O	reached
O	their
O	home
O	at
O	the
O	hills
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	Sand-Spirit
O	was
O	in
O	excellent
O	health
O	,
O	and
O	delighted
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	.
O	He
O	hailed
O	their
O	return
O	with
O	open
O	arms;
O	and
O	he
O	opened
O	his
O	arms
O	so
O	very
O	wide
O	,
O	that
O	when
O	he
O	closed
O	them
O	he
O	not

O	,
O	but
O	all
O	of
O	the
O	tobacco-sacks

O	of
O	the

O	Accordingly
O	he
O	at

O	of
O	the
O	affairs
O	of
O	a
O	tribe
O	in
O	the
O	North
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	pleasant
O	and
O	cheery
O	a
O	Spirit
O	as
O	one
O	would
O	wish
O	to
O	see
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	,
O	Wassamo
O	heard
O	a
O	great
O	rumbling
O	and
O	roaring
O	,
O	as
O	of
O	waters
O	tumbling
O	over
O	rocks;
O	and
O	presently
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	vast
O	bluster
O	,
O	and
O	fairly
O	shaking
O	the
O	lodge
O	with
O	his
O	deep-throated
O	hail
O	of
O	welcome
O	to
O	the
O	old
O	Sand-Spirit
O	,
O	in
O	rolled
O	another
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	Guardian
O	Spirit
O	and
O	special
O	director
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	cataract
O	or
O	water-fall
O	not
O	far
O	off
O	.
O	Then
O	came
O	with
O	crashing
O	steps
O	the
O	owner
O	of
O	several
O	whirlwinds
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	raging
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	neighboring
O	country
O	.
O	And
O	following
O	this
O	one
O	,
O	glided
O	in
O	a
O	sweet-spoken
O	,
O	gentle-faced
O	little
O	Spirit
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	understood
O	to
O	represent
O	a
O	summer-gale
O	that
O	was
O	accustomed
O	to
O	blow
O	,
O	toward
O	evening
O	,
O	in
O	at
O	the
O	lodge-doors
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	be
O	particularly
O	well
O	disposed
O	toward
O	young
O	lovers
O	.
O	The
O	last
O	to
O	appear
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	rocky-headed
O	fellow;
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	twice
O	as
O	stony
O	in
O	his
O	manners;
O	and
O	swaggered
O	and
O	strided
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	raised
O	such
O	a
O	commotion
O	with
O	his
O	great
O	green
O	blanket
O	when
O	he
O	shook
O	it
O	,
O	that
O	Wassamo
O	was
O	nearly
O	taken
O	off
O	his
O	feet;
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	by
O	main
O	force
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	able

O	This
