O	My

O	,
O	Alaric
O	,

O	I
O	had
O	gone
O	in
O	after
O	moose
O	to
O	the
O	country
O	beyond
O	Mud
O	Brook
O	,
O	in
O	Maine
O	.
O	There
O	its
O	watershed
O	between
O	the
O	east
O	branch
O	and
O	the
O	west
O	is
O	cut
O	up
O	into
O	valleys
O	,
O	in
O	one

O	a

O	of
O	moose
O	,
O	in
O	winter
O	,
O	generally
O	takes
O	up
O	quarters
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	yarding-time
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	snow
O	was
O	still
O	only
O	about
O	four
O	inches
O	deep
O	,
O	making
O	it
O	just
O	right
O	for
O	the
O	moose-hunter
O	who
O	is
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	a
O	sportsman
O	.
O	Our
O	task
O	was
O	a
O	slow
O	one;
O	we
O	had
O	to
O	examine
O	each
O	valley
O	for
O	moose
O	tracks
O	,
O	tramping
O	up
O	one
O	side
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	or
O	as
O	we
O	usually
O	managed
O	it
O	,
O	separating
O	at
O	the
O	valley
O	'
O	s
O	mouth
O	,
O	each
O	taking
O	a
O	side
O	,
O	meeting
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	if
O	unsuccessful
O	,
O	taking
O	the
O	quickest
O	way
O	back
O	to
O	camp
O	.
O	And
O	unsuccessful
O	we
O	were
O	,
O	since
O	for
O	three

O	we
O	found
O	no

O	,
O	as
O	released
O	of
O	their
O	loads
O	they
O	sprang
O	back
O	into
O	place
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	quite
O	needlessly
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	insecure
O	footing
O	under
O	the
O	snow
O	,
O	and
O	plunged
O	suddenly
O	at
O	full
O	length
O	.
O	My
O	rifle
O	whirled
O	from
O	my
O	hand
O	with
O	force
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	heard
O	it
O	strike
O	against
O	the
O	uncovered
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	sugar-loaf
O	stone
O	.
O	I
O	jumped
O	up
O	in
O	fear
O	and
O	hastily
O	examined
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	breech
O	was
O	shattered--my
O	rifle
O	was
O	as
O	useless
O	as
O	any
O	stick
O	.
O	Now
O	I
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	catamount
O	,
O	as
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	broken
O	rifle
O	in
O	my
O	hands
O	,
O	I
O	looked
O	about
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	bright
O	with
O	sun
O	and
O	snow
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	entirely
O	helpless
O	,
O	for
O	my
O	revolver
O	and
O	knife
O	were
O	in
O	my
O	belt
O	.
O	Yet
O	a
O	thirty-eight
O	calibre
O	revolver
O	,
O	even
O	with
O	a
O	long
O	cartridge
O	and
O	a
O	long
O	barrel
O	,
O	is
O	not
O	a
O	sure
O	defence
O	against
O	an
O	animal
O	as
O	heavy
O	as
O	myself
O	,
O	which
O	in
O	facing
O	me
O	would
O	present
O	for
O	a
O	mark
O	only
O	a
O	round
O	head
O	and
O	a
O	chest
O	with
O	muscles
O	so
O	thick
O	and
O	knotty
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	probably
O	stop
O	any
O	revolver
O	bullet
O	.
O	I
O	doubted
O	my
O	ability
O	to
O	hit
O	the
O	eye
O	.
O	Very
O	likely
O	I
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	followed;
O	and
O	in
O	any
O	case
O	,
O	I
O	might
O	call
O	Alaric
O	.
O	And
O	yet
O	he
O	was
O	too
O	far
O	away
O	for
O	a
O	shout
O	to
O	reach
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	dared
O	not
O	fire
O	signal-shots
O	,
O	for
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	travel
O	light
O	,
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	at
O	camp
O	all
O	revolver
O	cartridges
O	but
O	those
O	in
O	the
O	chambers
O	.
O	So
O	I
O	started
O	at
O	once
O	for
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	hoping
O	to
O	strike
O	Alaric
O	'
O	s
O	trail
O	on
O	the
O	opposite
O	slope
O	,
O	and
O	intending
O	to
O	follow
O	it
O	until
O	I
O	caught
O	him
O	.
O	My
O	rifle
O	I
O	left
O	where
O	it
O	was;
O	it
O	was
O	useless
O	and
O	heavy
O	.
O	I
O	cast
O	many
O	a
O	glance
O	behind
O	me
O	as
O	,
O	almost
O	at
O	a
O	trot
O	,
O	I
O	made
O	my
O	way
O	down
O	the
O	long
O	hillside
O	.
O	I
O	strode
O	on
O	rapidly
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	certainly
O	a
O	mile
O	to
O	cover
O	before
O	I
O	could
O	strike
O	Alaric
O	'
O	s
O	trail
O	,
O	much
O	more
O	before
O	I
O	could
O	catch
O	my
O	nimble
O	guide
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	cheerful
O	and
O	unalarmed
O	until
O	,
O	pausing
O	to
O	look
O	behind
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	,
O	a
O	hundred
O	yards
O	away
O	,
O	a
O	tawny
O	animal
O	quickly
O	slip
O	behind
O	a
O	tree
O	.
O	I
O	hastily
O	drew
O	my
O	revolver
O	and
O	knife;
O	but
O	no
O	movement
O	came
O	from
O	its
O	hidden
O	breast
O	,
O	and
O	rather
O	than
O	stand
O	and
O	wait
O	,
O	I
O	pursued
O	my
O	retreat
O	.
O	I
O	moved
O	more
O	slowly
O	,
O	yet
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	and
O	still
O	guard
O	myself
O	against
O	another
O	fall
O	and
O	watch
O	for
O	a
O	rush
O	from
O	behind
O	.
O	I
O	scanned
O	the
O	ground
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	glanced
O	back
O	every
O	second
O	.
O	For
O	some
O	time
O	I
O	saw
O	no
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	catamount
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	I
O	did
O	see
O	him
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	startled
O	at
O	his
O	nearness;
O	he
O	was
O	within
O	fifty
O	yards
O	.
O	I
O	hurried
O	on
O	as
O	he
O	slipped
O	aside
O	again;
O	but
O	looking
O	again
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	him
O	now
O	following
O	boldly
O	upon
O	my
O	trail
O	.
O	I
O	stopped
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	stopped
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	and
O	stood
O	regarding
O	me
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	too
O	far
O	away
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	fire
O	yet
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	made
O	no
O	movement
O	to
O	approach
O	,
O	I
O	cautiously
O	continued
O	my
O	retreat
O	,
O	always
O	after
O	a
O	few
O	steps
O	stopping
O	to
O	face
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	stopped
O	as
O	I
O	stopped
O	,
O	yet
O	each
O	time
O	I
O	turned
O	away
O	he
O	came
O	quickly
O	closer
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	already
O	thinking
O	of
O	awaiting
O	him
O	without
O	further
O	movement
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	way
O	was
O	blocked
O	by
O	a
O	ravine
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	cut
O	by
O	the
O	stream
O	that
O	drained
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	and
O	its
O	steep
O	sides
O	were
O	nearly
O	fifteen
O	feet
O	in
O	height
O	.
O	They
O	even
O	overhung
O	in
O	places
O	,
O	but
O	this
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	then
O	know
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	no
O	mind
O	to
O	trust
O	myself
O	in
O	the
O	deep
O	gully
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	catamount
O	might
O	drop
O	upon
O	me
O	before
O	I
O	could
O	scramble
O	out
O	upon
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	.
O	I
O	walked
O	into
O	an
O	open
O	space
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	my
O	stand
O	close
O	to
O	a
O	birch
O	that
O	grew
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	bank
O	.
O	For
O	thirty
O	feet
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	good
O	cover
O	for
O	the
O	catamount;
O	so
O	,
O	armed
O	and
O	determined
O	,
O	I
O	waited
O	his
O	action
O	.
O	The
O	animal
O	skirted
O	the
O	bushes
O	about
O	me
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	examining
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	my
O	disappointment
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	come
O	upon
O	me
O	along
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	ravine
O	.
O	This
O	gave
O	him
O	the
O	best
O	cover
O	before
O	his
O	charge
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	assured
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	momentum
O	of
O	his
O	rush
O	would
O	not
O	carry
O	him
O	tumbling
O	into
O	the
O	gully
O	.
O	Always
O	keeping
O	too
O	well
O	concealed
O	for
O	a
O	good
O	mark
O	,
O	he
O	crept
O	up
O	behind
O	a
O	fallen
O	tree
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	near
O	side
O	of
O	which
O	a
O	little
O	bush
O	grew
O	,
O	and
O	flattened
O	himself
O	there
O	,
O	watching
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	felt
O	sure
O	,
O	and
O	waiting
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	catch
O	me
O	off
O	my
O	guard
O	.
O	I
O	cannot
O	describe
O	how
O	stealthy
O	and
O	noiseless
O	and
O	altogether
O	perfect
O	his
O	maneuvering
O	was
O	.
O	Although
O	the
O	trees
O	that
O	grew
O	about
O	were
O	all
O	small
O	and
O	the
O	bushes
O	bare
O	,
O	and
O	although
O	the
O	white
O	snow
O	gave
O	no
O	background
O	for
O	concealment
O	,
O	he
O	covered
O	himself
O	so
O	perfectly
O	at
O	one
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	slipped
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	so
O	quickly
O	at
O	another
O	,
O	that
O	although
O	I
O	stood
O	with
O	revolver
O	pointed
O	and
O	cocked
O	,
O	I
O	could
O	find
O	no
O	opportunity
O	for
O	a
O	shot
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	circled
O	for
O	position
O	he
O	came
O	ever
O	nearer
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	could
O	see
O	at
O	one
O	time
O	the
O	round
O	head
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	short
O	,
O	pointed
O	ears;
O	at
O	another
O	the
O	long
O	,
O	sinuous
O	,
O	muscular
O	body;
O	but
O	they
O	moved
O	so
O	rapidly
O	that
O	before
O	I
O	could
O	shoot
O	they
O	were
O	gone
O	from
O	sight
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	time
O	he
O	made
O	no
O	sound
O	but
O	a
O	little
O	rustle
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	final
O	concealment
O	I
O	saw
O	nothing
O	of
O	him
O	but
O	his
O	tail
O	,
O	that
O	twitched
O	and
O	twitched
O	and
O	twitched
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	I
O	caught
O	the
O	glint
O	of
O	his
O	pale
O	green
O	eye
O	and
O	fired
O	.
O	There
O	came
O	a
O	snarl
O	from
O	behind
O	the
O	bush
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	dashed
O	to
O	one
O	side
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	while
O	round
O	head
O	and
O	bared
O	teeth
O	and
O	tawny
O	body
O	came
O	crashing
O	through
O	.
O	I
O	pulled
O	trigger
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	report
O	sounded
O	muffled
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	smoke
O	for
O	an
O	instant
O	obscured
O	the
O	beast
O	.
O	All
O	was
O	white
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	breath
O	,
O	it
O	passed
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	saw
O	the
O	rushing
O	catamount
O	not
O	ten
O	feet
O	from
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	time
O	to
O	fire
O	or
O	crouch
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	ready
O	legs
O	hurled
O	myself
O	to
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	my
O	left
O	arm
O	around
O	the
O	tree
O	that
O	grew
O	at
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	bank
O	.
O	With
O	an
O	awful
O	dread
O	I
O	felt
O	the
O	ground
O	giving
O	way
O	beneath
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	dropped
O	my
O	knife
O	and
O	caught
O	the
O	tree
O	closer
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	leaned
O	to
O	fall
O	.
O	It
O	hung
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	over
O	the
O	steep
O	slope
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	save
O	myself
O	.
O	The
O	frost
O	had
O	not
O	clamped
O	the
O	over-hang
O	to
O	the
O	solid
O	ground
O	.
O	The
O	last
O	fall
O	rains
O	had
O	cut
O	it
O	under;
O	the
O	first
O	spring
O	thaw
O	would
O	have
O	brought
O	it
O	down
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	my
O	weight
O	been
O	thrown
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	twist
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	I
O	fell
O	together
O	.
O	I
O	clutched
O	my
O	revolver
O	desperately
O	,
O	despite
O	the
O	sickening
O	fear
O	of
O	the
O	fall
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	my
O	grasp
O	it
O	exploded
O	in
O	mid
O	air
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	fell
O	,
O	and
O	although
O	my
O	body
O	struck
O	easily
O	in
O	the
O	snow-covered
O	ravine
O	,
O	my
O	right
O	hand
O	had
O	been
O	beaten
O	against
O	a
O	sharp
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	birch
O	was
O	upon
O	me
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	move
O	.
O	My
O	legs
O	were
O	on
O	the
O	bank
O	,
O	and
O	underneath
O	the
O	snow
O	beneath
O	my
O	shoulders
O	I
O	soon
O	felt
O	the
O	ice
O	,
O	from
O	which
O	stones
O	protruded
O	.
O	One
O	snow-covered
O	rock
O	received
O	and
O	supported
O	my
O	head
O	.
O	I
O	lay
O	upon
O	my
O	right
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	right
O	hand
O	,
O	swinging
O	in
O	a
O	curve
O	,
O	had
O	struck
O	with
O	force
O	upon
O	another
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	upon
O	the
O	ice
O	,
O	the
O	only
O	part
O	of
O	my
O	body
O	,
O	except
O	my
O	head
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	free
O	.
O	My
O	left
O	arm
O	was
O	pressed
O	close
O	to
O	my
O	side
O	by
O	the
O	birch
O	,
O	which
O	lay
O	across
O	my
O	body
O	and
O	legs
O	.
O	The
O	weight
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	great
O	but
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	have
O	lifted
O	it
O	,
O	could
O	I
O	but
O	have
O	gained
O	purchase
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	must
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	lift
O	my
O	own
O	body
O	,
O	for
O	my
O	hips
O	were
O	lower
O	than
O	my
O	feet
O	,
O	my
O	shoulders
O	lower
O	than
O	my
O	hips;
O	and
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	gather
O	ten
O	pounds
O	of
O	force
O	in
O	that
O	position
O	.
O	My
O	fall
O	confused
O	me
O	somewhat
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	at
O	first
O	feel
O	anything
O	,
O	either
O	the
O	pain
O	in
O	my
O	hand
O	or
O	the
O	danger
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	.
O	I
O	noticed
O	only
O	the
O	fine
O	,
O	powdery
O	snow
O	which
O	,
O	cast
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	fall
O	,
O	settled
O	upon
O	me
O	as
O	I
O	lay
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	saw
O	my
O	arm
O	,
O	stretched
O	out
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	me
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	bloody
O	hand
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	came
O	fully
O	to
O	myself
O	.
O	A
O	pain
O	shot
O	from
O	finger-tip
O	to
O	shoulder
O	as
O	I
O	closed
O	my
O	hand
O	tighter
O	upon
O	the
O	butt
O	of
O	the
O	revolver
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	clenched
O	my
O	teeth
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	rise--tried
O	twice
O	more
O	before
O	I
O	gave
O	it
O	up
O	as
O	hopeless
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	raised
O	my
O	hand
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	in
O	a
O	better
O	position
O	,
O	propped
O	upon
O	a
O	stone
O	.
O	The
O	movements
O	hurt
O	me
O	terribly
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	catamount
O	,
O	which
O	would
O	surely
O	not
O	be
O	satisfied
O	with
O	two
O	bullets
O	for
O	its
O	breakfast
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	scarcely
O	ready
O	when
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	beast
O	was
O	thrust
O	over
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	bank
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	me
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	,
O	and
O	gloated
O	as
O	a
O	human
O	enemy
O	might
O	have
O	done
O	.
O	His
O	savage
O	snarl
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	intelligence
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	slow
O	approach
O	was
O	deliberate
O	torture
O	.
O	He
O	stood
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	in
O	full
O	view--then
O	slipped
O	and
O	slid
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	ice
O	,
O	where
O	,
O	ten
O	yards
O	away
O	,
O	he
O	stood
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	saw
O	his
O	magnificent
O	build
O	,
O	his
O	superb
O	muscular
O	development
O	,
O	as
O	with
O	his
O	body
O	in
O	profile
O	,
O	his
O	head
O	turned
O	toward
O	me
O	,
O	he
O	waited
O	before
O	approaching
O	,
O	playing
O	with
O	my
O	helplessness;
O	but
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	entirely
O	helpless
O	!
O	With
O	shaking
O	hand
O	I
O	took
O	aim;
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	use
O	my
O	thumb
O	to
O	cock
O	the
O	revolver
O	,
O	but
O	drew
O	hard
O	at
O	the
O	trigger
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hammer
O	rose
O	and
O	fell
O	.
O	My
O	turn
O	for
O	gloating
O	had
O	come
O	now
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	catamount
O	was
O	crying
O	with
O	rage
O	and
O	pain
O	.
O	He
O	fell
O	writhing
O	,
O	striking
O	with
O	his
O	forepaws
O	at
O	the
O	snow
O	,
O	and
O	raising
O	his
O	head
O	to
O	snap
O	at
O	nothing;
O	but
O	this
O	did
O	not
O	last
O	long
O	.
O	Slowly
O	he
O	dragged
O	himself
O	to
O	a
O	sitting
O	posture
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	could
O	understand
O	his
O	plight
O	and
O	estimate
O	my
O	own
O	danger
O	.
O	My
O	first
O	two
O	bullets
O	had
O	but
O	torn
O	his
O	flesh
O	.
O	My
O	last
O	had
O	broken
O	his
O	back
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	paralyzed
O	in
O	his
O	hind
O	legs
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	seen
O	a
O	deer
O	,
O	yet
O	he
O	had
O	many
O	minutes
O	to
O	live
O	,
O	perhaps
O	hours
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	strong
O	and
O	angry
O	enough
O	to
O	finish
O	me
O	.
O	Painfully
O	he
O	started
O	on
O	that
O	short
O	journey
O	to
O	me
O	.
O	With
O	his
O	forepaws
O	,
O	his
O	claws
O	digging
O	the
O	snow
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	drag
O	himself
O	toward
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	could
O	only
O	wait
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	but
O	one
O	more
O	shot
O	,
O	and
O	wished
O	to
O	hold
O	it
O	till
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	close;
O	but
O	my
O	torn
O	hand
O	was
O	weak
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	bruised
O	tendons
O	had
O	already
O	begun
O	to
O	stiffen
O	.
O	Into
O	that
O	deep
O	place
O	,
O	where
O	bank
O	and
O	trees
O	overhung
O	,
O	the
O	sun
O	did
O	not
O	come
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	felt
O	the
O	cold
O	striking
O	into
O	my
O	raw
O	flesh
O	.
O	More
O	than
O	that
O	,
O	my
O	weight
O	upon
O	my
O	shoulder
O	began
O	to
O	cut
O	off
O	the
O	blood
O	from
O	my
O	arm
O	.
O	I
O	felt
O	pricking
O	in
O	my
O	flesh
O	,
O	my
O	arm
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	numb
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	feared
O	that
O	I
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	shoot
O	.
O	If
O	he
O	could
O	but
O	hurry
O	!
O	He
O	dragged
O	himself
O	at
O	a
O	snail
O	'
O	s
O	pace
O	.
O	It
O	would
O	be
O	so
O	long
O	before
O	he
O	came
O	close
O	that
O	my
O	hand
O	would
O	be
O	useless
O	.
O	Yet
O	as
O	he
O	crawled
O	directly
O	at
O	me
O	,
O	the
O	mark
O	was
O	a
O	poor
O	one
O	.
O	I
O	saw
O	with
O	satisfaction
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	turn
O	aside
O	for
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	rocks
O	in
O	his
O	path
O	.
O	When
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	reached
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	drag
O	himself
O	around
O	it
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	me
O	my
O	last
O	chance
O	.
O	I
O	saw
O	the
O	space
O	behind
O	his
O	shoulder
O	,
O	prayed
O	that
O	my
O	bullet
O	might
O	miss
O	his
O	ribs
O	,
O	summoned
O	the
O	last
O	force
O	at
O	my
O	almost
O	dead
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	fired
O	.
O	A
O	little
O	drift
O	of
O	air
O	blew
O	the
O	smoke
O	aside
O	so
O	quickly
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	see
O	the
O	fur
O	fly
O	.
O	He
O	bit
O	savagely
O	at
O	his
O	side
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	crawled
O	on
O	without
O	stopping
O	.
O	From
O	my
O	numb
O	hand
O	the
O	revolver
O	fell
O	without
O	noise
O	in
O	the
O	snow--my
O	fight
O	was
O	finished
O	.
O	He
O	came
O	on;
O	he
O	was
O	only
O	fifteen
O	feet
O	away
O	from
O	me
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	stopped
O	and
O	coughed
O	.
O	Would
O	he
O	sink
O	,
O	unable
O	to
O	move
O	farther
O	?
O	No;
O	he
O	started
O	again
O	!
O	Although
O	his
O	legs
O	dragged
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	impeding
O	,
O	although
O	he
O	left
O	a
O	red
O	trail
O	on
O	the
O	snow
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	step
O	forced
O	a
O	snarl
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	on
O	.
O	With
O	glittering
O	eyes
O	and
O	hoarse
O	breath
O	,
O	he
O	forced
O	himself
O	to
O	cross
O	the
O	last
O	space
O	.
O	Minutes
O	passed
O	before
O	he
O	was
O	close
O	enough
O	to
O	touch
O	me
O	.
O	Ah
O	!
O	Even
O	as
O	he
O	turned
O	toward
O	my
O	hand
O	to
O	seize
O	it
O	,
O	even
O	as
O	I
O	waited
O	to
O	see
O	,
O	rather
O	than
O	feel
O	,
O	the
O	crunching
O	of
O	my
O	senseless
O	arm
O	,
O	his
O	head
O	drooped
O	.
O	He
O	raised
O	it
O	once
O	more
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	power
O	was
O	gone
O	.
O	He
O	laid
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	once
O	so
O	powerful
O	,
O	upon
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	rested
O	his
O	body
O	against
O	the
O	stone
O	,
O	that
O	stood
O	high
O	enough
O	to
O	support
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	glared
O	at
O	me
O	with
O	his
O	fierce
O	,
O	malignant
O	eyes
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	fire
O	changed
O	in
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	clouded
O	,
O	flickered
O	,
O	glowed--went
O	out
O	.
O	The
O	last
O	breath
O	was
O	expelled
O	with
O	a
O	wheeze
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	dead
O	.
O	Then
O	my
O	own
O	powers
O	sank
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	thought
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	dying
O	,
O	too
O	.
O	Somewhere
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	my
O	faintness
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	sense
O	as
O	if
O	I
O	felt
O	,
O	rather
O	than
O	heard
O	,
O	hasty
O	,
O	heavy
O	footsteps
O	on
O	the
O	bank
O	above
O	me
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	I
O	knew
O	anything
O	clearly
O	,
O	I
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	tree
O	had
O	been
O	pulled
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	Alaric
O	was
O	bending
O	over
O	me
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	,
O	with
O	ears
O	alert
O	for
O	any
O	sound
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	footsteps
O	kept
O	as
O	near
O	to
O	me
O	as
O	they
O	might
O	be
O	with
O	obedience
O	to
O	my
O	order
O	,
O	come
O	rushing
O	to
O	my
O	aid
O	at
O	the
O	sound
O	at
O	my
O	first
O	revolver-shot
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	distance
O	was
O	so
O	great
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	arrive
O	until
O	my
O	fight
O	was
O	over
O	.
