O	Beli
O	the
O	Great
O	,
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	Manogan
O	,
O	had
O	three
O	sons
O	,
O	Lludd
O	and
O	Caswallawn
O	and
O	Nynyaw;
O	and
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	story
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	fourth
O	son
O	called
O	Llevelys
O	.
O	And
O	after
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	Beli
O	,
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	Britain
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	Lludd
O	his
O	eldest
O	son;
O	and
O	Lludd
O	ruled
O	prosperously
O	,
O	and
O	rebuilt
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	London
O	,
O	and
O	encompassed
O	it
O	about
O	with
O	numberless
O	towers
O	.
O	And
O	after
O	that
O	he
O	bade
O	the
O	citizens
O	build
O	houses
O	therein
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	no
O	houses
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	could
O	equal
O	.
O	And
O	moreover
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	mighty
O	warrior
O	,
O	and
O	generous
O	and
O	liberal
O	in
O	giving
O	meat
O	and
O	drink
O	to
O	all
O	that
O	sought
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	though
O	he
O	had
O	many
O	castles
O	and
O	cities
O	,
O	this
O	one
O	loved
O	he
O	more
O	than
O	any
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	dwelt
O	therein
O	most
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	year
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	was
O	it
O	called
O	Caer
O	Lludd
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	Caer
O	London
O	.
O	And
O	after
O	the
O	stranger
O	race
O	came
O	there
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	called
O	London
O	,
O	or
O	Lwndrys
O	.
O	Lludd
O	loved
O	Llevelys
O	best
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	brothers
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	wise
O	and
O	a
O	discreet
O	man
O	.
O	Having
O	heard
O	that
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	France
O	had
O	died
O	,
O	leaving
O	no
O	heir
O	except
O	a
O	daughter
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	all
O	his
O	possessions
O	in
O	her
O	hands
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	Lludd
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	to
O	beseech
O	his
O	counsel
O	and
O	aid
O	.
O	And
O	that
O	not
O	so
O	much
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	welfare
O	,
O	as
O	to
O	seek
O	to
O	add
O	to
O	the
O	glory
O	and
O	honour
O	and
O	dignity
O	of
O	his
O	kindred
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	might
O	go
O	to
O	France
O	to
O	woo
O	the
O	maiden
O	for
O	his
O	wife
O	.
O	And
O	forthwith
O	his
O	brother
O	conferred
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	counsel
O	was
O	pleasing
O	unto
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	prepared
O	ships
O	and
O	filled
O	them
O	with
O	armed
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	forth
O	towards
O	France
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	landed
O	,
O	they
O	sent
O	messengers
O	to
O	show
O	the
O	nobles
O	of
O	France
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	the
O	embassy
O	.
O	And
O	by
O	the
O	joint
O	counsel
O	of
O	the
O	nobles
O	of
O	France
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	princes
O	,
O	the
O	maiden
O	was
O	given
O	to
O	Llevelys
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	crown
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	with
O	her
O	.
O	And
O	thenceforth
O	he
O	ruled
O	the
O	land
O	discreetly
O	and
O	wisely
O	and
O	happily
O	,
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	his
O	life
O	lasted
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	space
O	of
O	time
O	had
O	passed
O	,
O	three
O	plagues
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	Britain
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	none
O	in
O	the
O	islands
O	had
O	ever
O	seen
O	the
O	like
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	was
O	a
O	certain
O	race
O	that
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	called
O	the
O	Coranians;
O	and
O	so
O	great
O	was
O	their
O	knowledge
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	discourse
O	upon
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	however
O	low
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	spoken
O	,
O	but
O	what
O	,
O	if
O	the
O	wind
O	met
O	it
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	known
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	through
O	this
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	injured
O	.
O	The
O	second
O	plague
O	was
O	a
O	shriek
O	which
O	came
O	on
O	every
O	May
O	eve
O	,
O	over
O	every
O	hearth
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	Britain
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	went
O	through
O	people's
O	hearts
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	scared
O	them
O	that
O	men
O	lost
O	their
O	hue
O	and
O	their
O	strength
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	women
O	their
O	children
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	young
O	men
O	and
O	the
O	maidens
O	lost
O	their
O	senses
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	animals
O	and
O	the
O	waters
O	were
O	left
O	barren
O	.
O	The
O	third
O	plague
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	however
O	much
O	of
O	provisions
O	and
O	food
O	might
O	be
O	prepared
O	in
O	the
O	king's
O	courts
O	,
O	were
O	there
O	even
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	a
O	year's
O	provisions
O	of
O	meats
O	and
O	drink
O	,
O	none
O	of
O	it
O	could
O	ever
O	be
O	found
O	,
O	except
O	what
O	was
O	consumed
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	night
O	.
O	And
O	two
O	of
O	these
O	plagues
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	ever
O	knew
O	their
O	cause;
O	therefore
O	was
O	there
O	better
O	hope
O	of
O	being
O	freed
O	from
O	the
O	first
O	than
O	from
O	the
O	second
O	and
O	third
O	.
O	And
O	thereupon
O	King
O	Lludd
O	felt
O	great
O	sorrow
O	and
O	care
O	,
O	because
O	that
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	how
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	freed
O	from
O	these
O	plagues
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	called
O	to
O	him
O	all
O	the
O	nobles
O	of
O	his
O	kingdom
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	counsel
O	of
O	them
O	what
O	they
O	should
O	do
O	against
O	these
O	afflictions
O	.
O	And
O	by
O	the
O	common
O	counsel
O	of
O	the
O	nobles
O	,
O	Lludd
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	Beli
O	went
O	to
O	Llevelys
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	King
O	of
O	France
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	great
O	of
O	counsel
O	and
O	wisdom
O	,
O	to
O	seek
O	his
O	advice
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	made
O	ready
O	a
O	fleet
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	in
O	secret
O	and
O	in
O	silence
O	,
O	lest
O	that
O	race
O	should
O	know
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	their
O	errand
O	,
O	or
O	any
O	besides
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	his
O	counsellors
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	made
O	ready
O	they
O	went
O	into
O	their
O	ships
O	,
O	Lludd
O	and
O	those
O	whom
O	he
O	chose
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	cleave
O	the
O	seas
O	towards
O	France
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	these
O	tidings
O	came
O	to
O	Llevelys
O	,
O	seeing
O	that
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	his
O	brother's
O	ships
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	him
O	was
O	a
O	fleet
O	vast
O	of
O	size
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Lludd
O	saw
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	left
O	all
O	the
O	ships
O	out
O	upon
O	the
O	sea
O	except
O	one
O	only;
O	and
O	in
O	that
O	one
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	meet
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	likewise
O	with
O	a
O	single
O	ship
O	came
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	come
O	together
O	,
O	each
O	put
O	his
O	arms
O	about
O	the
O	other's
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	welcomed
O	each
O	other
O	with
O	brotherly
O	love
O	.
O	After
O	that
O	Lludd
O	had
O	shown
O	his
O	brother
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	his
O	errand
O	,
O	Llevelys
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	himself
O	knew
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	the
O	coming
O	to
O	those
O	lands
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	took
O	counsel
O	together
O	to
O	discourse
O	on
O	the
O	matter
O	otherwise
O	than
O	thus
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	the
O	wind
O	might
O	not
O	catch
O	their
O	words
O	,
O	nor
O	the
O	Coranians
O	know
O	what
O	they
O	might
O	say
O	.
O	Then
O	Llevelys
O	caused
O	a
O	long
O	horn
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	of
O	brass
O	,
O	and
O	through
O	this
O	horn
O	they
O	discoursed
O	.
O	But
O	whatsoever
O	words
O	they
O	spoke
O	through
O	this
O	horn
O	,
O	one
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	neither
O	of
O	them
O	could
O	hear
O	any
O	other
O	but
O	harsh
O	and
O	hostile
O	words
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Llevelys
O	saw
O	this
O	and
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	demon
O	thwarting
O	them
O	and
O	disturbing
O	through
O	this
O	horn
O	,
O	he
O	caused
O	wine
O	to
O	be
O	put
O	therein
O	to
O	wash
O	it
O	.
O	And
O	through
O	the
O	virtue
O	of
O	the
O	wine
O	the
O	demon
O	was
O	driven
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	horn
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	their
O	discourse
O	was
O	unobstructed
O	,
O	Llevelys
O	told
O	his
O	brother
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	some
O	insects
O	whereof
O	he
O	should
O	keep
O	some
O	to
O	breed
O	,
O	lest
O	by
O	chance
O	the
O	like
O	affliction
O	might
O	come
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	.
O	And
O	other
O	of
O	these
O	insects
O	he
O	should
O	take
O	and
O	bruise
O	in
O	water
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	assured
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	power
O	to
O	destroy
O	the
O	race
O	of
O	Coranians
O	.
O	That
O	is
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	that
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	home
O	to
O	his
O	kingdom
O	he
O	should
O	call
O	together
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	both
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	race
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	race
O	of
O	the
O	Coranians
O	for
O	a
O	conference
O	,
O	as
O	though
O	with
O	the
O	intent
O	of
O	making
O	peace
O	between
O	them;
O	and
O	that
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	together
O	,
O	he
O	should
O	take
O	this
O	charmed
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	cast
O	it
O	over
O	all
O	alike
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	assured
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	water
O	would
O	poison
O	the
O	race
O	of
O	the
O	Coranians
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	not
O	slay
O	or
O	harm
O	those
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	race
O	.
O	"""And"
