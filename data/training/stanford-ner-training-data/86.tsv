O	was
O	leading
O	them
O	to
O	block
O	the

O	retreat
O	from

O	.
O	Jabez
O	Rockwell
O	,
O	marching
O	with
O	the
O	Connecticut
O	Brigade
O	,
O	had
O	forgotten
O	his
O	fears
O	of
O	the
O	brass-capped
O	Hessians
O	and
O	the
O	stone-wall
O	Grenadiers
O	.
O	One
O	night
O	they
O	camped
O	near
O	Monmouth
O	village
O	,
O	and
O	scouts
O	brought
O	in
O	the
O	tidings
O	that
O	the
O	British
O	were
O	within
O	sight
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	long
O	summer
O	twilight
O	Jabez
O	climbed
O	a
O	little
O	knoll
O	hard
O	by
O	,
O	and
O	caught
O	a
O	glimpse
O	of
O	the
O	white
O	tents
O	of
O	the
O	Queen
O	'
O	s
O	Hangers
O	,
O	hardly
O	beyond
O	musket-shot
O	.
O	Before
O	daybreak
O	a
O	rattle
O	of
O	firing
O	woke
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	scrambled
O	out
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	the
O	pickets
O	were
O	already
O	exchanging
O	shots
O	.
O	He
O	picked
O	up
O	his
O	old
O	musket
O	,
O	and
O	chewing
O	a
O	hunk
O	of
O	dry
O	bread
O	for
O	breakfast
O	,
O	joined
O	his
O	company
O	drawn
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	pasture
O	.
O	Knapsacks
O	were
O	piled
O	near
O	Freehold
O	meeting-house
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	troops
O	marched
O	ahead
O	,
O	not
O	knowing
O	where
O	they
O	were
O	sent
O	.
O	Across
O	the
O	wooded
O	fields
O	Jabez
O	saw
O	the
O	lines
O	of
O	red
O	splotches
O	which
O	gleamed
O	in
O	the
O	early
O	sunlight
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	knew
O	these
O	were
O	British
O	troops
O	.
O	The
O	rattling
O	musket-fire
O	became
O	a
O	grinding
O	roar
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	deeper
O	note
O	of
O	artillery
O	boomed
O	into
O	the
O	tumult
O	.
O	A
O	battle
O	had
O	begun
O	,
O	yet
O	the
O	Connecticut
O	Brigade
O	was
O	stewing
O	in
O	the
O	heat

O	no

O	As
