O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	very
O	rich
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	king
O	besides
O	,
O	whose
O	name
O	was
O	Midas;
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	little
O	daughter
O	,
O	whom
O	nobody
O	but
O	myself
O	ever
O	heard
O	of
O	,
O	and
O	whose
O	name
O	I
O	either
O	never
O	knew
O	,
O	or
O	have
O	entirely
O	forgotten
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	because
O	I
O	love
O	odd
O	names
O	for
O	little
O	girls
O	,
O	I
O	choose
O	to
O	call
O	her
O	Marygold
O	.
O	This
O	King
O	Midas
O	was
O	fonder
O	of
O	gold
O	than
O	of
O	anything
O	else
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	He
O	valued
O	his
O	royal
O	crown
O	chiefly
O	because
O	it
O	was
O	composed
O	of
O	that
O	precious
O	metal
O	.
O	If
O	he
O	loved
O	anything
O	better
O	,
O	or
O	half
O	so
O	well
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	one
O	little
O	maiden
O	who
O	played
O	so
O	merrily
O	around
O	her
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	footstool
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	more
O	Midas
O	loved
O	his
O	daughter
O	,
O	the
O	more
O	did
O	he
O	desire
O	and
O	seek
O	for
O	wealth
O	.
O	He
O	thought
O	,
O	foolish
O	man
O	!
O	that
O	the
O	best
O	thing
O	he
O	could
O	possibly
O	do
O	for
O	this
O	dear
O	child
O	would
O	be
O	to
O	bequeath
O	her
O	the
O	immensest
O	pile
O	of
O	yellow
O	,
O	glistening
O	coin
O	,
O	that
O	had
O	ever
O	been
O	heaped
O	together
O	since
O	the
O	world
O	was
O	made
O	.
O	Thus
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	all
O	his
O	thoughts
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	time
O	to
O	this
O	one
O	purpose
O	.
O	If
O	ever
O	he
O	happened
O	to
O	gaze
O	for
O	an
O	instant
O	at
O	the
O	gold-tinted
O	clouds
O	of
O	sunset
O	,
O	he
O	wished
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	real
O	gold
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	be
O	squeezed
O	safely
O	into
O	his
O	strong

O	When
O	little
O	Marygold
O	ran
O	to

O	him
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	bunch

O	grew
O	the

O	sweetest
O	roses
O	that
O	any

O	were

O	a

O	there
O	was
O	now
O	a
O	brighter
O	gleam
O	upon
O	all
O	the
O	piled-up
O	treasures
O	than
O	before
O	.
O	Even
O	the
O	remotest
O	corners
O	had
O	their
O	share

O	beings
O	endowed
O	with
O	supernatural

O	had
O	met

O	and
O	was

O	The

O	lay
O	in

O	!
O	The

O	come

O	at
O	everything
O	that
O	happened

O	and
O	it
O	became
O	immediately

O	in
O	order
O	to
O	admit

O	grew
O	heavy

O	all

O	had
O	grown

O	hurriedly
O	put
O	on

O	clothes
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	enraptured
O	to
O	see
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	magnificent
O	suit
O	of
O	gold
O	cloth
O	,
O	which
O	retained
O	its
O	flexibility
O	and
O	softness
O	,
O	although
O	it
O	burdened
O	him
O	a
O	little
O	with
O	its
O	weight
O	.
O	He
O	drew
O	out
O	his
O	handkerchief
O	,
O	which
O	little
O	Marygold
O	had
O	hemmed
O	for

O	stitches
O	running
O	all
O	along

O	thread
O	!
O	Somehow
O	or
O	other

O	did
O	not

O	the

O	as
O	when

O	climbed
O	his
O	knee
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	into
O	his
O	hand
O	.

O	it
O	was
O	not
O	worth

O	vex
O	himself
O	about

O	now
O	took
O	his
O	spectacles
O	from
O	his
O	pocket
O	,
O	and
O	put

O	nose

O	in
O	order
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	see
O	more
O	distinctly
O	what
O	he
O	was
O	about
O	.
O	In
O	those

O	for

O	had
