O	much

O	When

O	He
O	was
O	lowered
O	over
O	the
O	side
O	with
O	his
O	hands
O	still
O	fastened
O	behind
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	directly
O	after
O	the
O	boat
O	was
O	veered
O	astern
O	with
O	a
O	rope
O	.
O	Some
O	one
O	with
O	a
O	little
O	pity
O	for
O	them
O	threw
O	in
O	some
O	pieces
O	of
O	pork
O	and
O	some
O	clothes
O	,
O	as
O	well

O	or
O	three
O	cutlasses;
O	these

O	the
O	only
O	arms
O	given

O	There
O	were
O	altogether
O	nineteen
O	men
O	in
O	this
O	pitiful
O	strait
O	.
O	Although
O	much
O	of
O	the
O	conduct
O	of
O	the
O	mutineers
O	is
O	easily
O	understood
O	with
O	regard
O	to
O	the
O	captain

O	the
O	wholesale
O	crime

O	thrusting
O	so
O	many

O	,
O	is
O	incomprehensible
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	_Bounty_
O	sailed
O	away
O	,
O	leaving
O	them
O	to
O	their
O	fate

O	those
O	in

O	anxious
O	looks
O	to
O	the
O	captain
O	,
O	wondering
O	what
O	should
O	be
O	done
O	.
O	At
O	a
O	time
O	when
O	his
O	mind
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	full
O	of
O	the
O	injury
O	he
O	had
O	received
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	ship
O	at
O	a
O	moment
O	when
O	his
O	plans
O	were
O	so
O	flourishing
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	every
O	reason
O	to
O	congratulate
O	himself
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	ultimate
O	success
O	of
O	the
O	undertaking
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	much
O	in
O	his
O	favor
O	that
O	he
O	seems
O	to
O	have
O	realized
O	their
O	unfortunate
O	position
O	and
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	determined
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	His
O	first
O	care
O	was
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	much
O	food
O	they
O	had
O	.
O	On
O	examining
O	it
O	,
O	they
O	found
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	hundred
O	and
O	fifty
O	pounds
O	of
O	bread
O	,
O	thirty-two
O	pounds
O	of
O	pork
O	,
O	six
O	quarts
O	of
O	rum
O	,
O	six
O	bottles
O	of
O	wine
O	,
O	and
O	twenty-eight
O	gallons
O	of
O	water
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	were
O	so
O	near
O	Tofoa
O	they
O	determined
O	to
O	put
O	in
O	there
O	for
O	a
O	supply
O	of
O	breadfruit
O	and
O	water
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	keep
O	their
O	other
O	provisions
O	.
O	But
O	after
O	rowing
O	along
O	the
O	coast
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	they
O	only
O	discovered
O	some
O	cocoanut
O	trees
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	stony
O	cliff
O	,
O	against
O	which
O	the
O	sea
O	beat
O	furiously
O	.
O	After
O	several
O	attempts
O	they
O	succeeded
O	in
O	getting
O	about
O	twenty
O	nuts
O	.
O	The
O	second
O	day
O	they
O	failed
O	to
O	get
O	anything
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	some
O	natives
O	came
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	boat
O	and
O	made
O	inquiries
O	about
O	the
O	ship;
O	but
O	the
O	captain
O	unfortunately
O	told
O	the
O	men
O	to
O	say
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	lost
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	only
O	they
O	were
O	saved
O	.
O	This
O	proved
O	most
O	disastrous;
O	for
O	the
O	treacherous
O	natives
O	,
O	finding
O	they
O	were
O	defenceless
O	,
O	at
O	first
O	brought
O	them
O	presents
O	of
O	breadfruit
O	,
O	plantains
O	and
O	cocoanuts
O	,
O	rendering
O	them
O	all
O	more
O	hopeful
O	and
O	cheerful
O	by
O	their
O	kindness
O	.
O	But
O	toward
O	night
O	their
O	numbers
O	increased
O	in
O	a
O	most
O	alarming
O	manner
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	the
O	whole
O	beach
O	was
O	lined
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	Presently
O	they
O	began
O	knocking
O	stones
O	together
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	the
O	men
O	knew
O	they
O	intended
O	to
O	make
O	an
O	attack
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	They
O	made
O	haste
O	to
O	get
O	all
O	the
O	things
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	but
O	one
O	,
O	named
O	John
O	Norton
O	,
O	succeeded
O	in
O	reaching
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	natives
O	rushed
O	upon
O	this
O	poor
O	man
O	and
O	stoned
O	him
O	to
O	death
O	.
O	Those
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	put
O	to
O	sea
O	with
O	all
O	haste
O	,
O	but
O	were
O	again
O	terribly
O	alarmed
O	to
O	find
O	themselves
O	followed
O	by
O	natives
O	in
O	canoes
O	from
O	which
O	they
O	renewed
O	the
O	attack
O	.
O	Many
O	of
O	the
O	sailors
O	were
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	hurt
O	by
O	stones
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	no
O	means
O	at
O	all
O	with
O	which
O	to
O	protect
O	themselves
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	they
O	threw
O	some
O	clothes
O	overboard;
O	these
O	tempted
O	the
O	enemy
O	to
O	stop
O	to
O	pick
O	them
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	night
O	came
O	on
O	they
O	gave
O	up
O	the
O	chase
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	men
O	now
O	begged
O	Captain
O	Bligh
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	toward
O	England;
O	but
O	he
O	told
O	them
O	there
O	could
O	be
O	no
O	hope
O	of
O	relief
O	until
O	they
O	reached
O	Timor
O	,
O	a
O	distance
O	of
O	full
O	twelve
O	hundred
O	leagues;
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	they
O	wished
O	to
O	reach
O	it
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	content
O	themselves
O	with
O	one
O	ounce
O	of
O	bread
O	and
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	a
O	pint
O	of
O	water
O	a
O	day
O	.
O	They
O	all
O	readily
O	agreed
O	to
O	this
O	allowance
O	of
O	food
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	most
O	solemn
O	oath
O	not
O	to
O	depart
O	from
O	their
O	promise
O	to
O	be
O	satisfied
O	with
O	the
O	small
O	quantity
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	about
O	May
O	2
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	compact
O	was
O	made
O	,
O	the
O	boat
O	was
O	put
O	in
O	order
O	,
O	the
O	men
O	divided
O	into
O	watches
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	bore
O	away
O	under
O	a
O	reefed
O	lug-foresail
O	.
O	A
O	fiery
O	sun
O	rose
O	on
O	the
O	3d
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	commonly
O	a
O	sign
O	of
O	rough
O	weather
O	,
O	and
O	filled
O	the
O	almost
O	hopeless
O	derelicts
O	with
O	a
O	new
O	terror
O	.
O	In
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	two
O	it
O	blew
O	very
O	hard
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sea
O	ran
O	so
O	high
O	that
O	their
O	sail
O	was
O	becalmed
O	between
O	the
O	waves;
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	dare
O	to
O	set
O	it
O	when
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	water
O	rushed
O	in
O	over
O	the
O	stern
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	obliged
O	to
O	bale
O	with
O	all
O	their
O	might
O	.
O	The
O	bread
O	was
O	in
O	bags
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	greatest
O	danger
O	of
O	being
O	spoiled
O	by
O	the
O	wet
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	obliged
O	to
O	throw
O	some
O	rope
O	and
O	the
O	spare
O	sails
O	overboard
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	all
O	the
O	clothes
O	but
O	what
O	they
O	wore
O	,
O	to
O	lighten
O	the
O	boat;
O	then
O	the
O	carpenter's
O	tool-chest
O	was
O	cleared
O	and
O	the
O	bread
O	put
O	into
O	it
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	all
O	very
O	wet
O	and
O	cold
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	teaspoonful
O	of
O	rum
O	was
O	served
O	to
O	each
O	man
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	a
O	breadfruit
O	which
O	was
O	so
O	bad
O	that
O	it
O	could
O	hardly
O	be
O	eaten;
O	but
O	the
O	captain
O	was
O	determined
O	at
O	all
O	risks
O	to
O	keep
O	to
O	the
O	compact
O	they
O	had
O	entered
O	into
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	make
O	their
O	provisions
O	last
O	eight
O	weeks
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	afternoon
O	the
O	sea
O	ran
O	even
O	higher
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	night
O	it
O	became
O	very
O	cold;
O	but
O	still
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	dare
O	to
O	leave
O	off
O	baling
O	for
O	an
O	instant
O	,
O	though
O	their
O	legs
O	and
O	arms
O	were
O	numb
O	with
O	fatigue
O	and
O	wet
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	a
O	teaspoonful
O	of
O	rum
O	was
O	served
O	to
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	five
O	small
O	cocoanuts
O	divided
O	for
O	their
O	dinner
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	one
O	was
O	satisfied
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	gale
O	had
O	subsided
O	they
O	examined
O	the
O	bread
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	it
O	had
O	become
O	mouldy
O	and
O	rotten;
O	but
O	even
O	this
O	was
O	carefully
O	kept
O	and
O	used
O	.
O	The
O	boat
O	was
O	now
O	near
O	some
O	islands
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	afraid
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	natives
O	might
O	attack
O	them;
O	while
O	being
O	in
O	sight
O	of
O	land
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	might
O	replenish
O	their
O	poor
O	stock
O	of
O	provisions
O	and
O	rest
O	themselves
O	,
O	added
O	to
O	their
O	misery
O	.
O	One
O	morning
O	they
O	hooked
O	a
O	fish
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	overjoyed
O	at
O	their
O	good
O	fortune;
O	but
O	in
O	trying
O	to
O	get
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	it
O	was
O	lost
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	content
O	themselves
O	with
O	the
O	damaged
O	bread
O	and
O	small
O	allowance
O	of
O	water
O	for
O	their
O	supper
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	dreadfully
O	cramped
O	for
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	obliged
O	to
O	manage
O	so
O	that
O	half
O	their
O	number
O	should
O	lie
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	or
O	upon
O	a
O	chest
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	others
O	sat
O	up
O	and
O	kept
O	watch;
O	their
O	limbs
O	became
O	so
O	stiff
O	from
O	being
O	constantly
O	wet
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	want
O	of
O	space
O	to
O	stretch
O	them
O	in
O	,
O	that
O	after
O	a
O	few
O	hours'
O	sleep
O	they
O	were
O	hardly
O	able
O	to
O	move
O	.
O	About
O	May
O	7
O	,
O	they
O	passed
O	what
O	the
O	captain
O	supposed
O	must
O	be
O	the
O	Fiji
O	Islands
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	large
O	canoes
O	put
O	off
O	and
O	followed
O	them
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	they
O	gave
O	up
O	the
O	chase
O	.
O	It
O	rained
O	heavily
O	that
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	one
O	in
O	the
O	boat
O	did
O	his
O	best
O	to
O	catch
O	some
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	succeeded
O	in
O	increasing
O	their
O	stock
O	to
O	thirty-four
O	gallons
O	,
O	besides
O	having
O	had
O	enough
O	to
O	drink
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	since
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	cast
O	adrift;
O	but
O	the
O	rain
O	made
O	them
O	very
O	cold
O	and
O	miserable
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	no
O	dry
O	clothes
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	they
O	had
O	an
O	ounce
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	of
O	pork
O	,
O	a
O	teaspoonful
O	of
O	rum
O	,
O	half
O	a
O	pint
O	of
O	cocoanut
O	milk
O	and
O	an
O	ounce
O	of
O	bread
O	for
O	breakfast
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	quite
O	a
O	large
O	meal
O	for
O	them
O	.
O	Through
O	fifteen
O	weary
O	days
O	and
O	nights
O	of
O	ceaseless
O	rain
O	they
O	toiled
O	,
O	sometimes
O	through
O	fierce
O	storms
O	of
O	thunder
O	and
O	lightning
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	terrific
O	seas
O	lashed
O	into
O	foam
O	and
O	fury
O	by
O	swift
O	and
O	sudden
O	squalls
O	,
O	with
O	only
O	their
O	miserable
O	pittance
O	of
O	bread
O	and
O	water
O	to
O	keep
O	body
O	and
O	soul
O	together
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	rain
O	and
O	storm
O	the
O	little
O	sleep
O	they
O	got
O	only
O	added
O	to
O	their
O	discomfort
O	,
O	save
O	for
O	the
O	brief
O	forgetfulness
O	it
O	brought;
O	for
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	lie
O	down
O	in
O	water
O	in
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	no
O	covering
O	but
O	the
O	streaming
O	clouds
O	above
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	then
O	advised
O	them
O	to
O	wring
O	their
O	clothes
O	through
O	sea-water
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	found
O	made
O	them
O	feel
O	much
O	warmer
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	.
O	On
O	May
O	17
O	every
O	one
O	was
O	ill
O	and
O	complaining
O	of
O	great
O	pain
O	,
O	and
O	begging
O	for
O	more
O	food;
O	but
O	the
O	captain
O	refused
O	to
O	increase
O	their
O	allowance
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	gave
O	them
O	all
O	a
O	small
O	quantity
O	of
O	rum
O	.
O	Until
O	the
O	24th
O	they
O	flew
O	before
O	the
O	wild
O	seas
O	that
O	swept
O	over
O	stem
O	and
O	stern
O	of
O	their
O	boat
O	and
O	kept
O	them
O	constantly
O	baling
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	them
O	now
O	looked
O	more
O	than
O	half
O	dead
O	from
O	starvation
O	,
O	but
O	no
O	one
O	suffered
O	from
O	thirst
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	absorbed
O	so
O	much
O	water
O	through
O	the
O	skin
O	.
O	A
O	fine
O	morning
O	dawned
O	on
O	the
O	25th
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	sun
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	for
O	fifteen
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	able
O	to
O	eat
O	their
O	scanty
O	allowance
O	in
O	more
O	comfort
O	and
O	warmth
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	afternoon
O	there
O	were
O	numbers
O	of
O	birds
O	called
O	boobies
O	and
O	noddies
O	near
O	,
O	which
O	are
O	never
O	seen
O	far
O	from
O	land
O	.
O	The
O	captain
O	took
O	this
O	opportunity
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	the
O	state
O	of
O	their
O	bread
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	if
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	exceed
O	their
O	allowance
O	there
O	was
O	enough
O	to
O	last
O	for
O	twenty-nine
O	days
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	hoped
O	to
O	reach
O	Timor
O	.
O	That
O	afternoon
O	some
O	noddies
O	came
O	so
O	near
O	the
O	boat
O	that
O	one
O	was
O	caught
O	.
O	These
O	birds
O	are
O	about
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	a
O	small
O	pigeon;
O	it
O	was
O	divided
O	into
O	eighteen
O	parts
O	and
O	given
O	by
O	lot
O	.
O	The
O	men
O	were
O	much
O	amused
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	beak
O	and
O	claws
O	fall
O	to
O	the
O	lot
O	of
O	the
O	captain
O	.
O	The
O	bird
O	was
O	eaten
O	,
O	bones
O	and
O	all
O	,
O	with
O	bread
O	and
O	water
O	,
O	for
O	dinner
O	.
O	Now
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	calmer
O	seas
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	overtaken
O	by
O	a
O	new
O	trouble
O	.
O	The
O	heat
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	became
O	so
O	great
O	that
O	many
O	of
O	them
O	were
O	overcome
O	by
O	faintness
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	boat
O	in
O	an
O	apathetic
O	state
O	all
O	day
O	,
O	only
O	rousing
O	themselves
O	toward
O	evening
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	catching
O	of
O	birds
O	was
O	attempted
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morning
O	of
O	the
O	28th
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	breakers
O	could
O	be
O	heard
O	plainly;
O	they
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	Great
O	Barrier
O	Reef
O	,
O	which
O	runs
O	up
O	much
O	of
O	the
O	east
O	coast
O	of
O	Australia
O	.
O	After
O	some
O	little
O	time
O	a
O	passage
O	nearly
O	a
O	quartar
O	of
O	a
O	mile
O	in
O	width
O	was
O	discovered
O	through
O	the
O	reef
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	carried
O	by
O	a
O	strong
O	current
O	into
O	the
O	peaceful
O	waters
O	which
O	lie
O	within
O	the
O	Barrier
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	they
O	were
O	so
O	overjoyed
O	that
O	their
O	past
O	troubles
O	were
O	forgotten
O	.
O	The
O	dull
O	blue-gray
O	lines
O	of
O	the
O	mainland
O	,
O	with
O	its
O	white
O	patches
O	of
O	glaring
O	sandhills
O	,
O	could
O	be
O	seen
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	afternoon
O	they
O	landed
O	on
O	an
O	island
O	.
O	They
O	found
O	the
O	rocks
O	around
O	it
O	were
O	covered
O	with
O	oysters
O	and
O	huge
O	clams
O	,
O	which
O	could
O	easily
O	be
O	got
O	at
O	low
O	tide
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	their
O	party
O	sent
O	out
O	to
O	reconnoitre
O	returned
O	greatly
O	pleased
O	at
O	having
O	found
O	plenty
O	of
O	fresh
O	water
O	.
O	A
O	fire
O	was
O	made
O	by
O	help
O	of
O	a
O	small
O	magnifying-glass
O	.
O	Among
O	the
O	things
O	thrown
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	from
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	a
O	small
O	copper
O	pot;
O	and
O	thus
O	with
O	a
O	mixture
O	of
O	oysters
O	,
O	bread
O	,
O	and
O	pork
O	a
O	stew
O	was
O	made
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	one
O	had
O	plenty
O	to
O	eat
O	.
O	The
O	day
O	after
O	they
O	landed
O	was
O	the
O	29th
O	of
O	May
O	,
O	the
O	anniversary
O	of
O	the
O	restoration
O	of
O	King
O	Charles
O	II
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	captain
O	thought
O	it
O	applied
O	to
O	their
O	own
O	renewed
O	health
O	and
O	strength
O	,
O	he
O	named
O	it
O	Restoration
O	Island
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	few
O	days'
O	rest
O	,
O	which
O	did
O	much
O	to
O	revive
O	the
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	filled
O	all
O	their
O	vessels
O	with
O	water
O	and
O	had
O	gathered
O	a
O	large
O	supply
O	of
O	oysters
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	ready
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	again
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	were
O	about
O	to
O	start
O	,
O	everybody
O	was
O	ordered
O	to
O	attend
O	prayers
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	embarking
O	about
O	twenty
O	naked
O	savages
O	came
O	running
O	and
O	shouting
O	toward
O	them
O	,
O	each
O	carrying
O	a
O	long
O	barbed
O	spear
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	English
O	made
O	all
O	haste
O	to
O	put
O	to
O	sea
O	.
O	For
O	several
O	days
O	they
O	sailed
O	over
O	the
O	lakelike
O	stillness
O	of
O	the
O	Barrier
O	reef-bound
O	waters
O	,
O	and
O	past
O	the
O	bold
O	desolations
O	of
O	the
O	Queensland
O	coast
O	,
O	every
O	headland
O	and
O	bay
O	there
O	bearing
O	the
O	names
O	Cook
O	gave
O	them
O	only
O	a
O	few
O	years
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	still
O	tell
O	us
O	by
O	that
O	nomenclature
O	each
O	its
O	own
O	story
O	of
O	disappointment
O	and
O	hope
O	.
O	Still
O	making
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	north
O	,
O	they
O	passed
O	many
O	more
O	islands
O	and
O	keys
O	,
O	the
O	onward
O	passage
O	growing
O	hot
O	and
O	hotter
O	,
O	until
O	on
O	June
O	3
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	doubled
O	Cape
O	York
O	,
O	the
O	peninsula
O	which
O	is
O	all
O	but
O	unique
O	in
O	its
O	northward
O	bend
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	again
O	in
O	the
O	open
O	sea
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	many
O	of
O	them
O	were
O	ill
O	with
O	malaria;
O	then
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	wine
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	with
O	them
O	was
O	used
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	little
O	boat
O	still
O	bravely
O	made
O	its
O	way
O	with
O	its
O	crew
O	,
O	whose
O	faces
O	were
O	so
O	hollow
O	and
O	ghastly
O	that
O	they
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	crew
O	of
O	spectres
O	,
O	sailing
O	beneath
O	the
O	scorching
O	sun
O	that
O	beat
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	pale
O	blue
O	of
O	the
O	cloudless
O	sky
O	upon
O	a
O	sea
O	hardly
O	less
O	blue
O	in
O	its
O	greater
O	depths
O	.
O	Only
O	the
O	hope
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	soon
O	reach
O	Timor
O	seemed
O	to
O	rouse
O	them
O	from
O	a
O	state
O	of
O	babbling
O	delirium
O	or
O	fitful
O	slumber
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	11th
O	the
O	captain
O	told
O	them
O	they
O	had
O	passed
O	the
O	meridian
O	of
O	the
O	east
O	of
O	Timor;
O	and
O	at
O	three
O	o'clock
O	on
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	they
O	sighted
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	on
O	Sunday
O	,
O	June
O	14
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	arrived
O	at
O	Company
O	Bay
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	received
O	with
O	every
O	kindness
O	by
O	the
O	people
O	.
O	Thus
O	ended
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	remarkable
O	voyages
O	that
O	have
O	ever
O	been
O	made
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	out
O	with
O	provisions
O	only
O	sufficient
O	for
O	their
O	number
O	for
O	_five_
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	Captain
O	Bligh
O	had
O	,
O	by
O	his
O	careful
O	calculation
O	and
O	determination
O	to
O	give
O	each
O	man
O	only
O	that
O	equal
O	portion
O	they
O	had
O	agreed
O	to
O	accept
O	,
O	made
O	it
O	last
O	for
O	_fifty_
O	days
O	,
O	during
O	which
O	time
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	three
O	thousand
O	six
O	hundred
O	and
O	eighteen
O	nautical
O	miles
O	.
O	There
O	had
O	been
O	days
O	when
O	the
O	men
O	were
O	so
O	hunger-driven
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	besought
O	him
O	with
O	pitiful
O	prayers
O	for
O	more
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	his
O	painful
O	duty
O	to
O	refuse
O	it;
O	and
O	times
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	passed
O	those
O	islands
O	where
O	plentiful
O	food
O	could
O	be
O	got
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	turn
O	a
O	deaf
O	ear
O	to
O	their
O	longings
O	to
O	land
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	to
O	endure
O	the
O	need
O	of
O	food
O	,
O	the
O	cramped
O	position
O	,
O	the
O	uneasy
O	slumber
O	,
O	as
O	did
O	his
O	men;
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	more
O	perfect
O	knowledge
O	of
O	their
O	dangers
O	.
O	There
O	had
O	been
O	days
O	and
O	nights
O	while
O	he
O	worked
O	out
O	their
O	bearings
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	be
O	propped
O	up
O	as
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	stars
O	or
O	sun
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	Captain
O	Bligh's
O	good
O	seamanship
O	,
O	his
O	strict
O	discipline
O	and
O	fairness
O	in
O	the
O	method
O	of
O	giving

O	THE
O	TWO
O	BOY
O	HOSTAGES
O	AT
O	THE
O	SIEGE
O	OF
O	SERINGAPATAM
O	Anonymous
O	In
O	the
O	year
O	1791
O	,
O	Lord
O	Cornwallis
O	,
O	then
O	Governor-General
O	of
O	India
O	,
O	made
O	preparations
O	for
O	a
O	final
O	and
O	decisive
O	campaign
O	against
O	Tippoo
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	not
O	proved
O	himself
O	a
O	successful
O	commander
O	in
O	America
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	compelled
O	to
O	surrender
O	himself
O	and
O	army
O	to
O	Washington;
O	but
O	this
O	time
O	fortune
O	was
O	to
O	follow
O	his
O	arms
O	.
O	His
O	great
O	object
O	was
O	to
O	capture
O	the
O	principal
O	stronghold
O	of
O	the
O	tyrant
O	,
O	Seringapatam;
O	with
O	this
O	in
O	view
O	he
O	proceeded
O	to
O	reduce
O	all
O	the
O	intermediate
O	fortresses
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	February
O	,
O	1792
O	,
O	appeared
O	in
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	famous
O	city
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	dungeons
O	of
O	which
O	many
O	a
O	British
O	soldier
O	had
O	suffered
O	both
O	a
O	weary
O	imprisonment
O	and
O	a
O	cruel
O	death
O	.
O	The
O	army
O	gazed
O	with
O	admiration
O	and
O	wonder
O	on
O	this
O	magnificent
O	Oriental
O	city
O	,
O	its
O	vast
O	extent
O	of
O	embattled
O	walls
O	bristling
O	with
O	cannon
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	domes
O	of
O	its
O	mosques
O	which
O	rose
O	above
O	them
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	cupolas
O	of
O	its
O	splendid
O	palaces
O	and
O	the
O	lofty
O	facades
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	square
O	pagodas
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	garrisoned
O	by
O	no
O	less
O	than
O	45
O	,
O	000
O	men
O	,
O	while
O	beneath
O	its
O	walls
O	were
O	encamped
O	the
O	troops
O	of
O	the
O	sultan
O	.
O	To
O	attempt
O	the
O	capture
O	of
O	so
O	strong
O	a
O	place
O	seemed
O	an
O	impossibility
O	.
O	Great
O	indeed
O	would
O	be
O	the
O	issue
O	of
O	the
O	contest
O	between
O	the
O	two
O	hostile
O	armies
O	.
O	Should
O	the
O	British
O	and
O	their
O	allies
O	be
O	defeated
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	before
O	them
O	but
O	a
O	disastrous
O	retreat
O	over
O	hundreds
O	of
O	miles
O	of
O	country
O	already
O	laid
O	waste
O	by
O	sword
O	and
O	fire;
O	while
O	if
O	Tippoo
O	suffered
O	a
O	reverse
O	nothing
O	remained
O	for
O	him
O	but
O	a
O	humiliating
O	surrender
O	.
O	The
O	ardour
O	of
O	Cornwallis's
O	troops
O	had
O	been
O	kindled
O	by
O	the
O	stories
O	of
O	the
O	frightful
O	tortures
O	which
O	the
O	despot
O	had
O	practiced
O	upon
O	his
O	helpless
O	prisoners
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	passionately
O	desirous
O	of
O	avenging
O	them
O	.
O	Although
O	his
O	forces
O	were
O	far
O	inferior
O	in
O	number
O	,
O	Lord
O	Cornwallis
O	decided
O	upon
O	an
O	immediate
O	attack
O	on
O	the
O	enemy's
O	camp
O	in
O	three
O	divisions
O	.
O	The
O	evening
O	was
O	calm
O	and
O	beautiful
O	,
O	the
O	moon
O	just
O	rising
O	to
O	shed
O	her
O	silvery
O	light
O	over
O	the
O	scene
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	troops
O	moved
O	on
O	in
O	silence
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	hearts
O	beating
O	high
O	with
O	courage
O	and
O	hopes
O	of
O	success
O	.
O	Lord
O	Cornwallis
O	himself
O	led
O	the
O	centre
O	division
O	,
O	sword
O	in
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	headed
O	several
O	bayonet
O	charges
O	,
O	during
O	which
O	he
O	received
O	a
O	wound
O	in
O	the
O	hand
O	.
O	The
O	attack
O	took
O	Tippoo
O	by
O	complete
O	surprise
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	first
O	alarm
O	he
O	rushed
O	from
O	his
O	gorgeous
O	tent
O	and
O	sprang
O	on
O	to
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	so
O	a
O	mass
O	of
O	fugitives
O	thronged
O	past
O	him
O	,
O	conveying
O	the
O	intelligence
O	that
O	his
O	centre
O	had
O	been
O	penetrated
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	column
O	was
O	marching
O	to
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	retreat
O	from
O	the
O	great
O	ford
O	leading
O	across
O	the
O	river
O	Cauvery
O	to
O	Seringapatam
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	only
O	just
O	time
O	to
O	make
O	good
O	his
O	escape
O	.
O	All
O	night
O	the
O	fighting
O	raged
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	morning
O	Tippoo
O	reckoned
O	he
O	had
O	lost
O	,
O	in
O	killed
O	,
O	wounded
O	,
O	and
O	missing
O	,
O	no
O	less
O	than
O	23
O	,
O	000
O	men
O	.
O	Being
O	unable
O	to
O	recapture
O	his
O	largest--the
O	sultan's--redoubt
O	,
O	he
O	abandoned
O	all
O	the
O	others
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	fit
O	of
O	despair
O	,
O	withdrew
O	his
O	forces
O	to
O	the
O	island
O	and
O	fortress
O	of
O	Seringapatam
O	,
O	there
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	last
O	stand
O	.
O	The
O	besiegers
O	pressed
O	forward
O	with
O	vigour
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	its
O	two
O	principal
O	sides
O	the
O	city
O	was
O	completely
O	invested
O	.
O	The
O	pioneers
O	and
O	working-parties
O	were
O	actively
O	at
O	work
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	turned
O	Tippoo's
O	wonderful
O	garden
O	into
O	a
O	scene
O	of
O	desolation
O	.
O	The
O	sultan
O	saw
O	that
O	his
O	situation
O	was
O	becoming
O	desperate
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	an
O	attempt
O	to
O	negotiate
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	thought
O	to
O	paralyse
O	the
O	efforts
O	of
O	the
O	English
O	and
O	end
O	the
O	war
O	,
O	by
O	procuring
O	the
O	assassination
O	of
O	their
O	chief
O	.
O	A
O	number
O	of
O	horsemen
O	,
O	drugged
O	and
O	maddened
O	by
O	_bhang_
O	,
O	vowed
O	to
O	bring
O	to
O	the
O	sultan
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	his
O	foe
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	it
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	as
O	an
O	offering
O	.
O	They
O	made
O	a
O	dash
O	into
O	the
O	British
O	camp
O	,
O	but
O	before
O	they
O	could
O	secure
O	their
O	trophy
O	were
O	routed
O	,
O	and
O	most
O	of
O	them
O	slain
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	impossible
O	to
O	enumerate
O	all
O	the
O	deeds
O	of
O	heroism
O	performed
O	during
O	the
O	battle
O	and
O	the
O	progress
O	of
O	the
O	siege--the
O	bravery
O	of
O	Captain
O	Hugh
O	Sibbald
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	hundred
O	Highlanders
O	,
O	captured
O	and
O	defended
O	the
O	sultan's
O	redoubt
O	against
O	innumerable
O	odds;
O	of
O	the
O	courage
O	of
O	Major
O	Dalrymple
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	Highlanders
O	and
O	Bengal
O	infantry
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	to
O	draw
O	attention
O	from
O	the
O	working-parties
O	,
O	crossed
O	the
O	Cauvery
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	furiously
O	upon
O	Tippoo's
O	cavalry
O	camp
O	.
O	Every
O	British
O	soldier
O	seemed
O	animated
O	with
O	a
O	dauntless
O	courage
O	.
O	Meantime
O	a
O	trench
O	had
O	been
O	opened
O	within
O	800
O	yards
O	of
O	the
O	walls
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	advances
O	carried
O	on
O	with
O	spirit
O	and
O	energy
O	.
O	The
O	anger
O	of
O	the
O	Oriental
O	despot
O	manifested
O	itself
O	by
O	a
O	continual
O	discharge
O	of
O	cannon
O	.
O	Eighteen
O	days
O	after
O	the
O	battle
O	everything
O	was
O	ready
O	for
O	a
O	grand
O	attack
O	upon
O	the
O	citadel
O	of
O	Seringapatam
O	.
O	The
O	British
O	soldiers
O	,
O	flushed
O	with
O	success
O	,
O	and
O	burning
O	to
O	avenge
O	the
O	cruel
O	sufferings
O	and
O	murders
O	of
O	their
O	countrymen
O	,
O	were
O	eager
O	to
O	commence
O	the
O	assault
O	.
O	The
O	besieged
O	,
O	crushed
O	,
O	despairing
O	,
O	expected
O	every
O	minute
O	to
O	hear
O	the
O	roar
O	of
O	the
O	breaching
O	batteries
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	see
O	their
O	stately
O	mosques
O	in
O	flames
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	moment
O	,
O	so
O	full
O	of
O	anticipation
O	,
O	orders
O	were
O	issued
O	to
O	cease
O	all
O	acts
O	of
O	hostility
O	.
O	Tippoo
O	had
O	sued
O	for
O	peace;
O	but
O	at
O	the
O	very
O	instant
O	the
O	order
O	for
O	cessation
O	of
O	firing
O	was
O	issued
O	,
O	every
O	gun
O	that
O	could
O	be
O	brought
O	to
O	bear
O	upon
O	the
O	trenches
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	musketry
O	from
O	all
O	available
O	points
O	,
O	were
O	ordered
O	by
O	the
O	sultan
O	to
O	be
O	fired
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	treaty
O	which
O	was
O	now
O	drawn
O	up
O	Tippoo
O	not
O	only
O	agreed
O	to
O	release
O	all
O	his
O	prisoners
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	pay
O	the
O	equivalent
O	of
O	$16
O	,
O	500
O	,
O	000
O	,
O	yield
O	up
O	half
O	his
O	possessions
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	British
O	his
O	two
O	eldest
O	sons
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	retained
O	as
O	hostages
O	till
O	the
O	due
O	performance
O	of
O	his
O	pledges
O	.
O	Never
O	before
O	had
O	Indian
O	history
O	presented
O	so
O	touching
O	a
O	spectacle
O	as
O	that
O	seen
O	on
O	the
O	day
O	when
O	the
O	young
O	princes
O	were
O	delivered
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	their
O	father's
O	conquerors
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morning
O	of
O	the
O	26th
O	of
O	February
O	,
O	twenty
O	days
O	only
O	after
O	the
O	appearance
O	of
O	the
O	British
O	before
O	the
O	walls
O	,
O	the
O	two
O	youthful
O	hostages
O	,
O	each
O	mounted
O	on
O	a
O	richly-caparisoned
O	elephant
O	,
O	left
O	the
O	fort
O	.
O	Soldiers
O	and
O	citizens
O	,
O	stirred
O	by
O	deep
O	sympathy
O	,
O	thronged
O	the
O	ramparts
O	to
O	take
O	one
O	last
O	look
O	at
O	the
O	two
O	boys
O	.
O	Even
O	the
O	stern
O	and
O	cruel
O	Tippoo
O	himself
O	was
O	moved
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	difficult
O	to
O	repress
O	his
O	emotion
O	as
O	,
O	standing
O	on
O	the
O	bastion
O	above
O	the
O	great
O	entrance
O	,
O	he
O	watched
O	the
O	procession
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	youthful
O	hostages
O	issued
O	from
O	the
O	fortress
O	the
O	guns
O	of
O	Seringapatam
O	thundered
O	forth
O	a
O	salute;
O	and
O	as
O	they
O	approached
O	the
O	British
O	lines
O	they
O	were
O	received
O	with
O	similar
O	honors
O	.
O	Accompanied
O	by
O	the
O	English
O	negotiator
O	of
O	the
O	terms
O	of
O	peace
O	and
O	a
O	guard
O	of

O	,
O	they
O	were
O	met
O	at
O	the

O	conveyed
O	to
O	the

O	.
