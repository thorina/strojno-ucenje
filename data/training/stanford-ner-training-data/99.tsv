O	On
O	the
O	evening
O	of
O	Wednesday
O	,
O	September
O	5
O	,
O	the
O	steamship
O	Forfarshire
O	left
O	Hull
O	for
O	Dundee
O	,
O	carrying
O	a
O	cargo
O	of
O	iron
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	some
O	forty
O	passengers
O	on
O	board
O	.
O	The
O	ship
O	was
O	only
O	eight
O	years
O	old;
O	the
O	master
O	,
O	John
O	Humble
O	,
O	was
O	an
O	experienced
O	seaman;
O	and
O	the
O	crew
O	,
O	including
O	firemen
O	and
O	engineers
O	,
O	was
O	complete
O	.
O	But
O	even
O	before
O	the
O	vessel
O	left
O	the
O	dock
O	one
O	passenger
O	at
O	least
O	had
O	felt
O	uneasily
O	that
O	something
O	was
O	wrong--that
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	unusual
O	commotion
O	among
O	officials
O	and
O	sailors
O	.
O	Still
O	,
O	no
O	alarm
O	was
O	given
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	dusk
O	the
O	vessel
O	steamed
O	prosperously
O	down
O	the
O	Humber
O	River
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	(
O	Thursday
O	,
O	the
O	6th
O	)
O	the
O	weather
O	changed
O	,
O	the
O	wind
O	blowing
O	N
O	.
O	N
O	.
O	W
O	.
O	,
O	and
O	increasing
O	toward
O	midnight
O	to
O	a
O	perfect
O	gale
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morning
O	of
O	Friday
O	,
O	the
O	7th
O	,
O	a
O	sloop
O	from
O	Montrose
O	,
O	making
O	for
O	South
O	Shields
O	,
O	saw
O	a
O	small
O	boat
O	labouring
O	hard
O	in
O	the
O	trough
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	The
O	Montrose
O	vessel
O	bore
O	down
O	on
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	state
O	of
O	the
O	weather
O	managed
O	to
O	get
O	the
O	boat
O	'
O	s
O	crew
O	on
O	board
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	nine
O	men
O	in
O	all
O	,
O	the
O	sole
O	survivors
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	believed
O	themselves
O	to
O	be
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	crew
O	and
O	passengers
O	of
O	the
O	_Forfarshire
O	,
O	_
O	which
O	was
O	then
O	lying
O	a
O	total
O	wreck
O	on
O	Longstone
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	outermost
O	of
O	the
O	Farne
O	Islands
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	wretched
O	story
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	tell
O	of
O	lives
O	thrown
O	away
O	through
O	carelessness
O	and
O	negligence
O	,
O	unredeemed
O	,
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	their
O	story
O	went
O	,
O	by
O	any
O	heroism
O	or
O	unselfish
O	courage
O	.
O	While
O	still
O	in
O	the
O	Humber
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	twenty
O	miles
O	from
O	Hull
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	found
O	that
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	boilers
O	leaked
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	captain
O	refused
O	to
O	put
O	about
O	.
O	The
O	pumps
O	were
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	to
O	fill
O	the
O	boiler
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	vessel
O	kept
O	on
O	her
O	way
O	,
O	though
O	slowly
O	,
O	not
O	passing
O	between
O	the
O	Farne
O	Islands
O	and
O	the
O	mainland
O	till
O	Thursday
O	evening
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	eight
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	when
O	they
O	entered
O	Berwick
O	Bay;
O	the
O	wind
O	freshened
O	and
O	was
O	soon
O	blowing
O	hard
O	from
O	N
O	.
O	N
O	.
O	W
O	.
O	The
O	motion
O	of
O	the
O	vessel
O	increased
O	the
O	leakage
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	now
O	found
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	holes
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	three
O	boilers
O	.
O	Two
O	men
O	were
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	the
O	pumps
O	,
O	one
O	or
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	passengers
O	also
O	assisting
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	the
O	water
O	was
O	pumped
O	into
O	the
O	boilers
O	it
O	poured
O	out
O	again
O	.
O	The
O	bilge
O	was
O	so
O	full
O	of
O	steam
O	and
O	boiling
O	water
O	that
O	the
O	firemen
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	to
O	the
O	fires
O	.
O	Still
O	the
O	steamer
O	struggled
O	on
O	,
O	laboring
O	heavily
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	sea
O	was
O	running
O	very
O	high
O	.
O	At
O	midnight
O	they
O	were
O	off
O	St
O	.
O	Abbs
O	Head
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	engineers
O	reported
O	that
O	the
O	case
O	was
O	hopeless;
O	the
O	engines
O	had
O	entirely
O	ceased
O	to
O	work
O	.
O	The
O	ship
O	rolled
O	helplessly
O	in
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rocky
O	coast
O	was
O	at
O	no
O	great
O	distance
O	.
O	They
O	ran
O	up
O	the
O	sails
O	fore
O	and
O	aft
O	to
O	try
O	and
O	keep
O	her
O	off
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	her
O	round
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	run
O	before
O	the
O	wind
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	tide
O	was
O	setting
O	southward
O	she
O	drifted
O	fast
O	with
O	wind
O	and
O	tide
O	.
O	Torrents
O	of
O	rain
O	were
O	falling
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	wind
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	thick
O	fog
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	passengers
O	were
O	below
O	,
O	others
O	were
O	on
O	deck
O	with
O	crew
O	and
O	captain
O	,
O	knowing
O	well
O	their
O	danger
O	.
O	About
O	three
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	breakers
O	was
O	distinctly
O	heard
O	a
O	little
O	way
O	ahead
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	a
O	light
O	was
O	seen
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	left
O	,
O	glimmering
O	faintly
O	through
O	the
O	darkness
O	.
O	It
O	came
O	home
O	to
O	the
O	anxious
O	crew
O	with
O	sickening
O	certainty
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	being
O	driven
O	on
O	the
O	Farne
O	Islands
O	.
O	These
O	islands
O	form
O	a
O	group
O	of
O	desolate
O	rocks
O	lying
O	off
O	the
O	Northumbrian
O	coast
O	.
O	They
O	are
O	twenty
O	in
O	number
O	,
O	some
O	only
O	uncovered
O	at
O	low
O	tide
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	offering
O	a
O	rugged
O	iron
O	wall
O	to
O	any
O	ill-fated
O	boat
O	that
O	may
O	be
O	driven
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	Even
O	in
O	calm
O	weather
O	and
O	by
O	daylight
O	seamen
O	are
O	glad
O	to
O	give
O	them
O	a
O	wide
O	berth
O	.
O	The
O	master
O	of
O	the
O	_Forfarshire_
O	in
O	this
O	desperate
O	strait
O	attempted
O	to
O	make
O	for
O	the
O	channel
O	which
O	runs
O	between
O	the
O	Islands
O	and
O	the
O	mainland
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	at
O	best
O	a
O	forlorn
O	chance;
O	it
O	was
O	hopeless
O	here;
O	the
O	vessel
O	refused
O	to
O	answer
O	her
O	helm
O	!
O	On
O	she
O	drove
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
O	,
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	came
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	the
O	breakers;
O	the
O	passengers
O	and
O	crew
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	boat
O	became
O	frantic
O	.
O	Women
O	wailed
O	and
O	shrieked;
O	the
O	captain
O	'
O	s
O	wife
O	clung
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	weeping;
O	the
O	crew
O	lost
O	all
O	instinct
O	of
O	discipline
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	of
O	nothing
O	but
O	saving
O	their
O	skins
O	.
O	Between
O	three
O	and
O	four
O	the
O	shock
O	came--a
O	hideous
O	grinding
O	noise
O	,
O	a
O	strain
O	and
O	shiver
O	of
O	the
O	whole
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	struck
O	violently
O	against
O	a
O	great
O	rock
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	awful
O	moment
O	which
O	followed
O	,
O	five
O	of
O	the
O	crew
O	succeeded
O	in
O	lowering
O	the
O	larboard
O	quarter-boat
O	and
O	pushed
O	off
O	in
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	mate
O	swung
O	himself
O	over
O	the
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	reached
O	her;
O	and
O	a
O	passenger
O	rushing
O	at
O	this
O	moment
O	up
O	from
O	the
O	cabin
O	and
O	seeing
O	the
O	boat
O	already
O	three
O	yards
O	from
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	cleared
O	the
O	space
O	with
O	a
O	bound
O	and
O	landed
O	safely
O	in
O	her
O	,
O	though
O	nearly
O	upsetting
O	her
O	by
O	his
O	weight
O	.
O	She
O	righted
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	crew
O	pulled
O	off
O	with
O	the
O	desperate
O	energy
O	of
O	men
O	rowing
O	for
O	their
O	lives
O	.
O	The
O	sight
O	of
O	agonized
O	faces
O	,
O	the
O	shrieks
O	of
O	the
O	drowning
O	,
O	were
O	lost
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	howling
O	winds
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boat
O	with
O	the
O	seven
O	men
O	on
O	board
O	was
O	swept
O	along
O	by
O	the
O	rapidly-flowing
O	tide
O	.
O	Such
O	was
O	the
O	story
O	the
O	exhausted
O	boat
O	'
O	s
O	crew
O	told
O	next
O	morning
O	to
O	their
O	rescuers
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	Montrose
O	sloop
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	'
O	s
O	company--what
O	of
O	them
O	?
O	Had
O	they
O	all
O	gone
O	down
O	by
O	the
O	island
O	crag
O	with
O	never
O	a
O	hand
O	stretched
O	out
O	to
O	help
O	them
O	?
O	Hardly
O	had
O	the
O	boat
O	escaped
O	from
O	the
O	stranded
O	vessel
O	when
O	a
O	great
O	wave
O	struck
O	her
O	on
O	the
O	quarter
O	,
O	lifted
O	her
O	up
O	bodily
O	,
O	and
O	dashed
O	her
O	back
O	on
O	the
O	rock
O	.
O	She
O	struck
O	midships
O	on
O	the
O	sharp
O	edge
O	and
O	broke
O	at
O	once
O	into
O	two
O	pieces
O	.
O	The
O	after
O	part
O	was
O	washed
O	clean
O	away
O	with
O	about
O	twenty
O	passengers
O	clinging
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	the
O	captain
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	being
O	among
O	them
O	.
O	A
O	group
O	of
O	people
O	,
O	about
O	nine
O	in
O	number
O	,
O	were
O	huddled
O	together
O	near
O	the
O	bow;
O	they
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	whole
O	forepart
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	,
O	were
O	lifted
O	right
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	rock
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	fore
O	cabin
O	was
O	a
O	poor
O	woman
O	,
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Dawson
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	child
O	on
O	each
O	arm
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	vessel
O	was
O	stranded
O	on
O	the
O	rock
O	the
O	waves
O	rushed
O	into
O	the
O	exposed
O	cabin
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	managed
O	to
O	keep
O	her
O	position
O	,
O	cowering
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	.
O	First
O	one
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	other
O	child
O	died
O	from
O	cold
O	and
O	exhaustion
O	,
O	and
O	falling
O	from
O	the
O	fainting
O	mother
O	were
O	swept
O	from
O	her
O	sight
O	by
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	poor
O	soul
O	herself
O	survived
O	all
O	the
O	horrors
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	now
O	four
O	o
O	'
O	clock;
O	the
O	storm
O	was
O	raging
O	with
O	unabated
O	violence
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	still
O	two
O	hours
O	to
O	daybreak
O	.
O	About
O	a
O	mile
O	from
O	Longstone
O	,
O	the
O	island
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	vessel
O	struck
O	,
O	lies
O	Brownsman
O	,
O	the
O	outermost
O	of
O	the
O	Farne
O	Islands
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	stands
O	the
O	lighthouse
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	keeper
O	of
O	the
O	lighthouse
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	William
O	Darling
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	an
O	elderly
O	,
O	almost
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	only
O	other
O	inmates
O	of
O	the
O	lighthouse
O	were
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	daughter
O	Grace
O	,
O	a
O	girl
O	of
O	twenty-two
O	.
O	On
O	this
O	Friday
O	night
O	she
O	was
O	awake
O	,
O	and
O	through
O	the
O	raging
O	of
O	the
O	storm
O	heard
O	shrieks
O	more
O	persistent
O	and
O	despairing
O	than
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	wildest
O	sea-birds
O	.
O	In
O	great
O	trouble
O	she
O	rose
O	and
O	awakened
O	her
O	father
O	.
O	The
O	cries
O	continued
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
O	they
O	could
O	do
O	nothing
O	.
O	Even
O	after
O	day
O	broke
O	it
O	was
O	difficult
O	to
O	make
O	out
O	distant
O	objects
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	mist
O	was
O	still
O	hanging
O	over
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	glass
O	they
O	could
O	discern
O	the
O	wreck
O	on
O	Longstone
O	,
O	and
O	figures
O	moving
O	about
O	on
O	it
O	.
O	Between
O	the
O	two
O	islands
O	lay
O	a
O	mile
O	of
O	yeasty
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	tide
O	was
O	running
O	hard
O	between
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	only
O	boat
O	on
O	the
O	lighthouse
O	was
O	a
O	clumsily
O	built
O	jolly-boat
O	,
O	heavy
O	enough
O	to
O	tax
O	the
O	strength
O	of
O	two
O	strong
O	men
O	in
O	ordinary
O	weather
O	,
O	and
O	here
O	there
O	was
O	but
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	and
O	a
O	young
O	girl
O	to
O	face
O	a
O	raging
O	sea
O	and
O	a
O	tide
O	running
O	dead
O	against
O	them
O	.
O	Darling
O	hesitated
O	to
O	undertake
O	anything
O	so
O	dangerous
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	daughter
O	would
O	hear
O	of
O	no
O	delay
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	of
O	that
O	rough
O	mile
O	of
O	sea
O	men
O	were
O	perishing
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	stay
O	where
O	she
O	was
O	and
O	see
O	them
O	die
O	.
O	So
O	off
O	they
O	set
O	in
O	the
O	heavy
O	coble
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	with
O	one
O	oar
O	,
O	the
O	girl
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	rowing
O	with
O	straining
O	breath
O	and
O	beating
O	hearts
O	.
O	Any
O	moment
O	they
O	might
O	be
O	whelmed
O	in
O	the
O	sea
O	or
O	dashed
O	against
O	the
O	rocks
O	.
O	Even
O	if
O	they
O	got
O	the
O	crew
O	off
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	doubtful
O	if
O	they
O	could
O	row
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	lighthouse;
O	the
O	tide
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	turn
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	be
O	against
O	them
O	on
O	their
O	homeward
O	journey;
O	death
O	seemed
O	to
O	face
O	them
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	.
O	When
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	rock
O	there
O	was
O	imminent
O	danger
O	of
O	their
O	being
O	dashed
O	to
O	pieces
O	against
O	it
O	.
O	Steadying
O	the
O	boat
O	an
O	instant
O	,
O	Darling
O	managed
O	to
O	jump
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	rock
O	,
O	while
O	Grace
O	rapidly
O	rowed
O	out
O	a
O	little
O	and
O	kept
O	the
O	boat
O	from
O	going
O	on
O	the
O	rocks
O	by
O	rowing
O	continually
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	difficult
O	to
O	imagine
O	how
O	the
O	nine
O	shipwrecked
O	people
O	,
O	exhausted
O	and
O	wearied
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	were
O	got
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	sea
O	,
O	especially
O	as
O	the
O	poor
O	woman
O	,
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Dawson
O	,
O	was
O	in
O	an
O	almost
O	fainting
O	condition;
O	but
O	finally
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	gotten
O	on
O	board
O	.
O	Fortunately
O	,
O	one
O	or
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	rescued
O	crew
O	were
O	able
O	to
O	assist
O	in
O	the
O	heavy
O	task
O	of
O	rowing
O	the
O	boat
O	back
O	to
O	Brownsman
O	.
O	The
O	storm
O	continued
O	to
O	rage
O	for
O	several
O	days
O	after
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	whole
O	party
O	had
O	to
O	remain
O	in
O	the
O	lighthouse
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	a
O	boatload
O	which
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	their
O	rescue
O	from
O	North
O	Shields
O	was
O	also
O	storm-stayed
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	told
O	of
O	this
O	admirable
O	girl
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	tenderest
O	and
O	gentlest
O	of
O	nurses
O	and
O	hostesses
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	certainly
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	singularly
O	courageous
O	of
O	women
O	.
O	She
O	could
O	never
O	be
O	brought
O	to
O	look
O	upon
O	her
O	exploit
O	as
O	in
O	any
O	way
O	remarkable
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	by-and-by
O	honors
O	and
O	distinctions
O	were
O	showered
O	upon
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	people
O	came
O	from
O	long
O	distances
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	,
O	she
O	kept
O	through
O	it
O	all
O	the
O	dignity
O	of
O	perfect
O	simplicity
O	and
O	modesty
O	.
O	Close
O	to
O	Bamborough
O	,
O	on
O	a
O	windy
O	hill
O	,
O	lie
O	a
O	little
O	gray
O	church
O	and
O	a
O	quiet
O	churchyard
O	.
O	At
O	all
O	seasons
O	high
O	winds
O	from
O	the
O	North
O	Sea
O	blow
O	over
O	the
O	graves
O	and
O	fret
O	and
O	eat
O	away
O	the
O	soft
O	gray
O	sandstone
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	plain
O	headstones
O	are
O	made
O	.
O	So
O	great
O	is
O	the
O	wear
O	and
O	tear
O	of
O	these
O	winds
O	that
O	comparatively
O	recent
O	monuments
O	look
O	like
O	those
O	which
O	have
O	stood
O	for
O	centuries
O	.
O	On
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	stones
O	lies
O	a
O	recumbent
O	figure
O	,
O	with
O	what
O	looks
O	not
O	unlike
O	a
O	lance
O	clasped
O	in
O	the
O	hand
O	and
O	laid
O	across
O	the
O	breast
O	.
O	Involuntarily
O	one
O	thinks
O	of
O	the
O	stone
O	crusaders
O	,
O	who
O	lie
O	in
O	their
O	armor
O	,
O	clasping
O	their
O	half-drawn
O	swords
O	,
O	awaiting
O	the
O	Resurrection
O	morning
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	the
O	monument
O	of
O	Grace
O	Darling
O	,
O	who
O	here
O	lies
O	at
O	rest
O	with
O	her
O	oar
O	still
O	clasped
O	in
O	her
O	strong
O	right
O	hand
O	.
