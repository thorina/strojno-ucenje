O	Jack
O	was
O	an
O	idle
O	,
O	lazy
O	boy
O	who
O	would
O	do
O	no
O	work
O	to
O	support
O	his
O	widowed
O	mother;
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	both
O	came
O	to
O	such
O	poverty
O	that
O	the
O	poor
O	woman
O	had
O	to
O	sell
O	her
O	cow
O	to
O	buy
O	food
O	to
O	keep
O	them
O	from
O	starving
O	.
O	She
O	sent
O	Jack
O	to
O	market
O	with
O	the
O	cow
O	,
O	telling
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	and
O	sell
O	it
O	for
O	a
O	good
O	price
O	.
O	As
O	Jack
O	was
O	going
O	along
O	the
O	road
O	to
O	market
O	he
O	met
O	a
O	butcher
O	.
O	The
O	butcher
O	offered
O	to
O	buy
O	the
O	cow
O	in
O	exchange
O	for
O	a
O	hatful
O	of
O	colored
O	beans
O	.
O	Jack
O	thought
O	the
O	beans
O	looked
O	very
O	pretty
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	glad
O	to
O	be
O	saved
O	the
O	long
O	hot
O	walk
O	to
O	market;
O	so
O	he
O	struck
O	the
O	bargain
O	on
O	the
O	spot
O	and
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	with
O	the
O	beans
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	butcher
O	went
O	off
O	with
O	the
O	cow
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	poor
O	widow
O	was
O	very
O	disappointed
O	.
O	She
O	scolded
O	her
O	son
O	for
O	an
O	idle
O	,
O	lazy
O	,
O	good-for-nothing
O	boy
O	,
O	and
O	flung
O	the
O	beans
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	in
O	a
O	passion
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	beans
O	were
O	magic
O	beans
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	,
O	when
O	Jack
O	awoke
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	taken
O	root
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	and
O	had
O	grown
O	so
O	tall
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	reached
O	right
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	Jack
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	wonder
O	and
O	curiosity;
O	and
O	,
O	being
O	fond
O	of
O	adventure
O	and
O	excitement
O	,
O	he
O	set
O	out
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	climb
O	the
O	beanstalk
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	was
O	up
O	at
O	the

O	it
O	.

O	right
O	up

O	a
O	thousand

O	all
O	going
O	at
O	once

O	If

O	so
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	run
O	nearly
O	so
O	fast
O	as
O	usual
O	,
O	and
O	Jack
O	reached
O	the

O	just
O	in
O	front
O	of

O	Jack
O	slid
O	down

O	calling
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	his
O	voice
O	for
O	his
O	mother
O	to
O	fetch
O	him
O	an
O	axe
O	.
O	The
O	ogre
O	came
O	tumbling
O	down
O	the
O	beanstalk
O	after
O	him;
O	but
O	Jack
O	seized
O	the
O	axe
O	and
O	chopped
O	the
O	beanstalk
O	off
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	root
O	.
O	Down
O	came
O	the
O	beanstalk
O	,
O	down
O	came
O	the
O	ogre
O	,
O	and
O	falling
O	headlong
O	into
O	the
O	garden
O	he
O	was
O	killed
O	on
O	the
O	spot
O	.
O	After

O	Jack
O	quite
O	gave
O	up

O	,
O	with
O	the
