O	Perseus
O	was
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	Danaë
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	a
O	king
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	Perseus
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	little
O	boy
O	,
O	some
O	wicked
O	people
O	put
O	his
O	mother
O	and
O	himself
O	into
O	a
O	chest
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	them
O	afloat
O	upon
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	The
O	wind
O	blew
O	freshly
O	,
O	and
O	drove
O	the
O	chest
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	uneasy
O	billows
O	tossed
O	it
O	up
O	and
O	down;
O	while
O	Danaë
O	clasped
O	her
O	child
O	closely
O	to
O	her
O	bosom
O	,
O	and
O	dreaded
O	that
O	some
O	big
O	wave
O	would
O	dash
O	its
O	foamy
O	crest
O	over
O	them
O	both
O	.
O	The
O	chest
O	sailed
O	on
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	and
O	neither
O	sank
O	nor
O	was
O	upset;
O	until
O	,
O	when
O	night
O	was
O	coming
O	,
O	it
O	floated
O	so
O	near
O	an
O	island
O	that
O	it
O	got
O	entangled
O	in
O	a
O	fisherman's
O	nets
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	drawn
O	out
O	high
O	and
O	dry
O	upon
O	the
O	sand
O	.
O	The
O	island
O	was
O	called
O	Seriphus
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	reigned
O	over
O	by
O	King
O	Polydectes
O	,
O	who
O	happened
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	fisherman's
O	brother
O	.
O	This
O	fisherman
O	,
O	I
O	am
O	glad
O	to
O	tell
O	you
O	,
O	was
O	an
O	exceedingly
O	humane
O	and
O	upright
O	man
O	.
O	He
O	showed
O	great
O	kindness
O	to
O	Danaë
O	and
O	her
O	little
O	boy;
O	and
O	continued
O	to
O	befriend
O	them
O	,
O	until
O	Perseus
O	had
O	grown
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	handsome
O	youth
O	,
O	very
O	strong
O	and
O	active
O	,
O	and
O	skilful
O	in
O	the
O	use
O	of
O	arms
O	.
O	Long
O	before
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	King
O	Polydectes
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	two
O	strangers--the
O	mother
O	and
O	her
O	child--who
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	his
O	dominions
O	in
O	a
O	floating
O	chest
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	good
O	and
O	kind
O	,
O	like
O	his
O	brother
O	the
O	fisherman
O	,
O	but
O	extremely
O	wicked
O	,
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	send
O	Perseus
O	on
O	a
O	dangerous
O	enterprise
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	would
O	probably
O	be
O	killed
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	do
O	some
O	great
O	mischief
O	to
O	Danaë
O	herself
O	.
O	So
O	this
O	bad-hearted
O	king
O	spent
O	a
O	long
O	while
O	in
O	considering
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	dangerous
O	thing
O	that
O	a
O	young
O	man
O	could
O	possibly
O	undertake
O	to
O	perform
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	having
O	hit
O	upon
O	an
O	enterprise
O	that
O	promised
O	to
O	turn
O	out
O	as
O	fatally
O	as
O	he
O	desired
O	,
O	he
O	sent
O	for
O	the
O	youthful
O	Perseus
O	.
O	The

O	came
O	to
O	the

O	some
O	good

O	were
O	extremely

O	to

O	.
O	These

O	when
O	he
O	found
