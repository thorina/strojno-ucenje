O	The
O	following
O	tale
O	was
O	found
O	among
O	the
O	papers
O	of
O	the
O	late
O	Diedrich
O	Knickerbocker
O	,
O	an
O	old
O	gentleman
O	of
O	New
O	York
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	very
O	curious
O	in
O	the
O	Dutch
O	history
O	of
O	the
O	province
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	manners
O	of
O	the
O	descendants
O	from
O	its
O	primitive
O	settlers
O	.
O	His
O	historical
O	researches
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	did
O	not
O	lie
O	so
O	much
O	among
O	books
O	as
O	among
O	men;
O	for
O	the
O	former
O	are
O	lamentably
O	scanty
O	on
O	his
O	favourite
O	topics;
O	whereas
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	old
O	burghers
O	,
O	and
O	still
O	more
O	their
O	wives
O	,
O	rich
O	in
O	that
O	legendary
O	lore
O	so
O	invaluable
O	to
O	true
O	history
O	.
O	Whenever
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	he
O	happened
O	upon
O	a
O	genuine
O	Dutch
O	family
O	,
O	snugly
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	its
O	low-roofed
O	farmhouse
O	under
O	a
O	spreading
O	sycamore
O	,
O	he
O	looked
O	upon
O	it
O	as
O	a
O	little
O	clasped
O	volume
O	of
O	black-letter
O	,
O	and
O	studied
O	it
O	with
O	the
O	zeal
O	of
O	a
O	book
O	worm
O	.
O	The
O	result
O	of
O	all
O	these
O	researches
O	was
O	a
O	history
O	of
O	the
O	province
O	during
O	the
O	reign
O	of
O	the
O	Dutch
O	governors
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	published
O	some
O	years
O	since
O	.
O	There
O	have
O	been
O	various
O	opinions
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	literary
O	character
O	of
O	his
O	work
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	to
O	tell
O	the
O	truth
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	a
O	whit
O	better
O	than
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	.
O	Its
O	chief
O	merit
O	is
O	its
O	scrupulous
O	accuracy
O	,
O	which
O	indeed
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	questioned
O	on
O	its
O	first
O	appearance
O	,
O	but
O	has
O	since
O	been
O	completely
O	established;
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	now
O	admitted
O	into
O	all
O	historical
O	collections
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	book
O	of
O	unquestionable
O	authority
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	gentleman
O	died
O	shortly
O	after
O	the
O	publication
O	of
O	his
O	work
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	dead
O	and
O	gone
O	,
O	it
O	cannot
O	do
O	much
O	harm
O	to
O	his
O	memory
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	his
O	time
O	might
O	have
O	been
O	much
O	better
O	employed
O	in
O	weightier
O	labours
O	.
O	He
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	was
O	apt
O	to
O	ride
O	his
O	hobby
O	his
O	own
O	way;
O	and
O	though
O	it
O	did
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	kick
O	up
O	the
O	dust
O	a
O	little
O	in
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	his
O	neighbours
O	,
O	and
O	grieve
O	the
O	spirit
O	of
O	some
O	friends
O	,
O	for
O	whom
O	he
O	felt
O	the
O	truest
O	deference
O	and
O	affection;
O	yet
O	his
O	errors
O	and
O	follies
O	are
O	remembered
O	""""
O	more
O	in
O	sorrow
O	than
O	in
O	anger
O	,
O	""""
O	and
O	it
O	begins
O	to
O	be
O	suspected
O	that
O	he
O	never
O	intended
O	to
O	injure
O	or

O	.
O	But
O	however
O	his

O	may

O	by

O	it

O	Whoever
O	has

O	a
O	voyage
O	up
O	the
O	Hudson
O	must
O	remember
O	the
O	Kaatskill
O	Mountains
O	.
O	They
O	are
O	a
O	dismembered
O	branch
O	of
O	the

O	are
O	seen
O	away
O	to
O	the

O	the

O	swelling

O	noble
O	height
O	,
O	and
O	lording
O	it
O	over

O	Every

O	of

O	,
O	every

O	of
O	weather
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	every

O	of
O	the

O	,
O	produces
O	some
O	change
O	in
O	the
O	magical
O	hues
O	and
O	shapes
O	of
O	these
O	mountains
O	,
O	and
O	they

O	by
O	all
O	the
O	good
O	wives
O	,
O	far

O	,
O	as

O	barometers
O	.
O	When
O	the

O	they

O	print
O	their
O	bold
O	outlines
O	on

O	but
O	sometimes
O	when
O	the
O	rest
O	of

O	will
O	glow

O	.
O	At
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	these
O	fairy
O	mountains
O	,
O	the
O	voyager
O	may
O	have
O	descried
O	the
O	light
O	smoke
O	curling
O	up
O	from
O	a
O	village
O	,
O	whose
O	shingle-roofs
O	gleam
O	among
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	just
O	where
O	the
O	blue
O	tints
O	of
O	the

O	melt
O	away
O	into
O	the

O	It
O	is
O	a
O	little
O	village
O	of
O	great
O	antiquity
O	,
O	having
O	been
O	founded
O	by
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	Dutch
O	colonists
O	in
O	the
O	early
O	time
O	of
O	the
O	province
O	,
O	just
O	about
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	the
O	government
O	of
O	the
O	good
O	Peter
O	Stuyvesant
O	(
O	may
O	he
O	rest
O	in
O	peace
O	!
O	)
O	and
O	there
O	were
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	houses
O	of
O	the
O	original
O	settlers
O	standing
O	within
O	a
O	few
O	years
O	,
O	built
O	of
O	small
O	yellow
O	bricks
O	brought
O	from
O	Holland
O	,
O	having
O	latticed
O	windows
O	and
O	gable
O	fronts
O	,
O	surmounted
O	with
O	weathercocks
O	.
O	In
O	that
O	same
O	village
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	very
O	houses
O	(
O	which
O	,
O	to
O	tell
O	the
O	precise
O	truth
O	,
O	was
O	sadly
O	time-worn
O	and
O	weather-beaten
O	)
O	,
O	there
O	lived
O	many
O	years
O	since
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	country
O	was
O	yet
O	a
O	province
O	of
O	Great
O	Britain
O	,
O	a
O	simple
O	,
O	good-natured
O	fellow
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Rip
O	Van
O	Winkle
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	descendant
O	of
O	the
O	Van
O	Winkles
O	who
O	figured
O	so
O	gallantly
O	in
O	the
O	chivalrous
O	days
O	of
O	Peter
O	Stuyvesant
O	,
O	and
O	accompanied
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	siege
O	of
O	Fort
O	Christina
O	.
O	He
O	inherited
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	but
O	little
O	of
O	the
O	martial
O	character
O	of
O	his
O	ancestors
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	observed
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	simple
O	,
O	good-natured
O	man;
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	moreover
O	,
O	a
O	kind
O	neighbour
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	obedient
O	hen-pecked
O	husband
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	latter
O	circumstance
O	might
O	be
O	owing
O	that
O	meekness
O	of
O	spirit
O	which
O	gained
O	him
O	such
O	universal
O	popularity;
O	for
O	those
O	men
O	are
O	most
O	apt
O	to
O	be
O	obsequious
O	and
O	conciliating
O	abroad
O	,
O	who
O	are
O	under
O	the
O	discipline
O	of
O	shrews
O	at
O	home
O	.
O	Their
O	tempers
O	,
O	doubtless
O	,
O	are
O	rendered
O	pliant
O	and
O	malleable
O	in
O	the
O	fiery
O	furnace
O	of
O	domestic
O	tribulation;
O	and
O	a
O	curtain
O	lecture
O	is
O	worth
O	all
O	the
O	sermons
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	for
O	teaching
O	the
O	virtues
O	of
O	patience
O	and
O	long-suffering
O	.
O	A
O	termagant
O	wife
O	may
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	in
O	some
O	respects
O	be
O	considered
O	a
O	tolerable
O	blessing
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	so
O	,
O	Rip
O	Van
O	Winkle
O	was
O	thrice
O	blessed
O	.
O	Certain
O	it
O	is
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	favourite
O	among
O	all
O	the
O	good
O	wives
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	as
O	usual
O	with
O	the
O	amiable
O	sex
O	,
O	took
O	his
O	part
O	in
O	all
O	family
O	squabbles;
O	and
O	never
O	failed
O	,
O	whenever
O	they
O	talked
O	those
O	matters
O	over
O	in
O	their
O	evening
O	gossipings
O	,
O	to
O	lay
O	all
O	the
O	blame
O	on
O	Dame
O	Van
O	Winkle
O	.
O	The
O	children
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	would
O	shout
O	with
O	joy
O	whenever
O	he
O	approached
O	.
O	He
O	assisted
O	at
O	their
O	sports
O	,
O	made
O	their
O	playthings
O	,
O	taught
O	them
O	to
O	fly
O	kites
O	and
O	shoot
O	marbles
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	long
O	stories
O	of
O	ghosts
O	,
O	witches
O	,
O	and
O	Indians
O	.
O	Whenever
O	he
O	went
O	dodging
O	about
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	surrounded
O	by
O	a
O	troop
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	hanging
O	on
O	his
O	skirts
O	,
O	clambering
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	playing
O	a
O	thousand
O	tricks
O	on
O	him
O	,
O	with
O	impunity;
O	and
O	not
O	a
O	dog
O	would
O	bark
O	at
O	him
O	throughout
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	.
O	The
O	great
O	error
O	in
O	Rip
O	'
O	s
O	composition
O	was
O	an
O	insuperable
O	aversion
O	to
O	all
O	kinds
O	of
O	profitable
O	labour
O	.
O	It
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	from
O	the
O	want
O	of
O	assiduity
O	or
O	perseverance;
O	for
O	he
O	would
O	sit
O	on
O	a
O	wet
O	rock
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	rod
O	as
O	long
O	and
O	heavy
O	as
O	a
O	Tartar
O	'
O	s
O	lance
O	,
O	and
O	fish
O	all
O	day
O	without
O	a
O	murmur
O	,
O	even
O	though
O	he
O	should
O	not
O	be
O	encouraged
O	by
O	a
O	single
O	nibble
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	carry
O	a
O	fowling-piece
O	on
O	his
O	shoulder
O	for
O	hours
O	together
O	,
O	trudging
O	through
O	woods
O	and
O	swamps
O	,
O	and
O	up
O	hill
O	and
O	down
O	dale
O	,
O	to
O	shoot
O	a
O	few
O	squirrels
O	or
O	wild
O	pigeons
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	never
O	refuse
O	to
O	assist
O	a
O	neighbour
O	,
O	even
O	in
O	the
O	roughest
O	toil
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	a
O	foremost
O	man
O	at
O	all
O	country
O	frolics
O	for
O	husking
O	Indian
O	corn
O	,
O	or
O	building
O	stone-fences;
O	the
O	women
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	used
O	to
O	employ
O	him
O	to
O	run
O	their
O	errands
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	do
O	such
O	little
O	odd
O	jobs
O	as
O	their
O	less
O	obliging
O	husband^
O	would
O	not
O	do
O	for
O	them
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	word
O	,
O	Rip
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	attend
O	to
O	anybody
O	'
O	s
O	business
O	but
O	his
O	own;
O	but
O	as
O	to
O	doing
O	family
O	duty
O	,
O	and
O	keeping
O	his
O	farm
O	in
O	order
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	it
O	impossible
O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	he
O	declared
O	it
O	was
O	of
O	no
O	use
O	to
O	work
O	on
O	his
O	farm;
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	pestilent
O	little
O	piece
O	of
O	ground
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	country;
O	everything
O	about
O	it
O	went
O	wrong
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	go
O	wrong
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	His
O	fences
O	were
O	continually
O	falling
O	to
O	pieces;
O	his
O	cow
O	would
O	either
O	go
O	astray
O	or
O	get
O	among
O	the
O	cabbages;
O	weeds
O	were
O	sure
O	to
O	grow
O	quicker
O	in
O	his
O	fields
O	than
O	any
O	where
O	else;
O	the
O	rain
O	always
O	made
O	a
O	point
O	of
O	setting
O	in
O	just
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	some
O	out-door
O	work
O	to
O	do;
O	so
O	that
O	though
O	his
O	patrimonial
O	estate
O	had
O	dwindled
O	away
O	under
O	his
O	management
O	,
O	acre
O	by
O	acre
O	,
O	until
O	there
O	was
O	little
O	more
O	left
O	than
O	a
O	mere
O	patch
O	of
O	Indian
O	corn
O	and
O	potatoes
O	,
O	yet
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	worst-conditioned
O	farm
O	in
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	.
O	His
O	children
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	were
O	as
O	ragged
O	and
O	wild
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	belonged
O	to
O	nobody
O	.
O	His
O	son
O	Rip
O	,
O	an
O	urchin
O	begotten
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	likeness
O	,
O	promised
O	to
O	inherit
O	the
O	habits
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	old
O	clothes
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	generally
O	seen
O	trooping
O	like
O	a
O	colt
O	at
O	his
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	heels
O	,
O	equipped
O	in
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	cast-off
O	galligaskins
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	much
O	ado
O	to
O	hold
O	up
O	with
O	one
O	hand
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	fine
O	lady
O	does
O	her
O	train
O	in
O	bad
O	weather
O	.
O	Rip
O	Van
O	Winkle
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	those
O	happy
O	mortals
O	,
O	of
O	foolish
O	,
O	well-oiled
O	dispositions
O	,
O	who
O	take
O	the
O	world
O	easy
O	,
O	eat
O	white
O	bread
O	or
O	brown
O	,
O	whichever
O	can
O	be
O	got
O	with
O	least
O	thought
O	or
O	trouble
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	rather
O	starve
O	on
O	a
O	penny
O	than
O	work
O	for
O	a
O	pound
O	.
O	If
O	left
O	to
O	himself;
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	whistled
O	life
O	away
O	in
O	perfect
O	contentment;
O	but
O	his
O	wife
O	kept
O	continually
O	dinning
O	in
O	his
O	ears
O	about
O	his
O	idleness
O	,
O	his
O	carelessness
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	ruin
O	he
O	was
O	bringing
O	on
O	his
O	family
O	.
O	Morning
O	,
O	noon
O	,
O	and
O	night
O	her
O	tongue
O	was
O	incessantly
O	going
O	,
O	and
O	everything
O	he
O	said
O	or
O	did
O	was
O	sure
O	to
O	produce
O	a
O	torrent
O	of
O	household
O	eloquence
O	.
O	Rip
O	had
O	but
O	one
O	way
O	of
O	replying
O	to
O	all
O	lectures
O	of
O	the
O	kind
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	by
O	frequent
O	use
O	,
O	had
O	grown
O	into
O	a
O	habit
O	.
O	He
O	shrugged
O	his
O	shoulders
O	,
O	shook
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	cast
O	up
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	but
O	said
O	nothing
O	.
O	This
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	always
O	provoked
O	a
O	fresh
O	volley
O	from
O	his
O	wife;
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	fain
O	to
O	draw
O	off
O	his
O	forces
O	,
O	and
O	take
O	to
O	the
O	outside
O	of
O	the
O	house--the
O	only
O	side
O	which
O	,
O	in
O	truth
O	,
O	belongs
O	to
O	a
O	henpecked
O	husband
O	.
O	Rip
O	'
O	s
O	sole
O	domestic
O	adherent
O	was
O	his
O	dog
O	Wolf
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	as
O	much
O	henpecked
O	as
O	his
O	master;
O	for
O	Dame
O	Van
O	Winkle
O	regarded
O	them
O	as
O	companions
O	in
O	idleness
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	looked
O	upon
O	Wolf
O	with
O	an
O	evil
O	eye
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	his
O	master
O	'
O	s
O	going
O	so
O	often
O	astray
O	.
O	True
O	it
O	is
O	,
O	in
O	all
O	points
O	of
O	spirit
O	befitting
O	an
O	honourable
O	dog
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	courageous
O	an
O	animal
O	as
O	ever
O	scoured
O	the
O	woods--but
O	what
O	courage
O	can
O	withstand
O	the
O	ever-during
O	and
O	all-besetting
O	terrors
O	of
O	a
O	woman
O	'
O	s
O	tongue
O	?
O	The
O	moment
O	Wolf
O	entered
O	the
O	house
O	his
O	crest
O	fell
O	,
O	his
O	tail
O	drooped
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	or
O	curled
O	between
O	his
O	legs
O	,
O	he
O	sneaked
O	about
O	with
O	a
O	gallows
O	air
O	,
O	casting
O	many
O	a
O	sidelong
O	glance
O	at
O	Dame
O	Van
O	Winkle
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	least
O	flourish
O	of
O	a
O	broomstick
O	or
O	ladle
O	he
O	would
O	fly
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	with
O	yelping
O	precipitation
O	.
O	Times
O	grew
O	worse
O	and
O	worse
O	with
O	Rip
O	Van
O	Winkle
O	as
O	years
O	of
O	matrimony
O	rolled
O	on;
O	a
O	tart
O	temper
O	never
O	mellows
O	with
O	age
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	sharp
O	tongue
O	is
O	the
O	only
O	edged
O	tool
O	that
O	grows
O	keener
O	with
O	constant
O	use
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	long
O	while
O	he
O	used
O	to
O	console
O	himself
O	,
O	when
O	driven
O	from
O	home
O	,
O	by
O	frequenting
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	perpetual
O	club
O	of
O	the
O	sages
O	,
O	philosophers
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	idle
O	personages
O	of
O	the
O	village;
O	which
O	held
O	its
O	sessions
O	on
O	a
O	bench
O	before
O	a
O	small
O	inn
O	,
O	designated
O	by
O	a
O	rubicund
O	portrait
O	of
O	His
O	Majesty
O	George
O	the
O	Third
O	.
O	Here
O	they
O	used
O	to
O	sit
O	in
O	the
O	shade
O	through
O	a
O	long
O	lazy
O	summer
O	'
O	s
O	day
O	,
O	talking
O	listlessly
O	over
O	village
O	gossip
O	,
O	or
O	telling
O	endless
O	,
O	sleepy
O	stories
O	about
O	nothing
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	worth
O	any
O	statesman
O	'
O	s
O	money
O	to
O	have
O	heard
O	the
O	profound
O	discussions
O	that
O	sometimes
O	took
O	place
O	,
O	when
O	by
O	chance
O	an
O	old
O	newspaper
O	fell
O	into
O	their
O	hands
O	from
O	some
O	passing
O	traveller
O	.
O	How
O	solemnly
O	they
O	would
O	listen
O	to
O	the
O	contents
O	,
O	as
O	drawled
O	out
O	by
O	Derrick
O	Van
O	Bummel
O	,
O	the
O	school-master
O	,
O	a
O	dapper
O	learned
O	little
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	daunted
O	by
O	the
O	most
O	gigantic
O	word
O	in
O	the
O	dictionary;
O	and
O	how
O	sagely
O	they
O	would
O	deliberate
O	upon
O	public
O	events
O	some
O	months
O	after
O	they
O	had
O	taken
O	place
O	.
O	The
O	opinions
O	of
O	this
O	junto
O	were
O	completely
O	controlled
O	by
O	Nicholas
O	Vedder
O	,
O	a
O	patriarch
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	and
O	landlord
O	of
O	the
O	inn
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	seat
O	from
O	morning
O	till
O	night
O	,
O	just
O	moving
O	sufficiently
O	to
O	avoid
O	the
O	sun
O	and
O	keep
O	in
O	the
O	shade
O	of
O	a
O	large
O	tree;
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	neighbours
O	could
O	tell
O	the
O	hour
O	by
O	his
O	movements
O	as
O	accurately
O	as
O	by
O	a
O	sun-dial
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	true
O	he
O	was
O	rarely
O	heard
O	to
O	speak
O	,
O	but
O	smoked
O	his
O	pipe
O	incessantly
O	.
O	His
O	adherents
O	however
O	(
O	for
O	every
O	great
O	man
O	has
O	his
O	adherents
O	)
O	,
O	perfectly
O	understood
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	how
O	to
O	gather
O	his
O	opinions
O	.
O	When
O	anything
O	that
O	was
O	read
O	or
O	related
O	displeased
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	observed
O	to
O	smoke
O	his
O	pipe
O	vehemently
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	send
O	forth
O	short
O	,
O	frequent
O	and
O	angry
O	puffs;
O	but
O	when
O	pleased
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	inhale
O	the
O	smoke
O	slowly
O	and
O	tranquilly
O	,
O	and
O	emit
O	it
O	in
O	light
O	and
O	placid
O	clouds;
O	and
O	sometimes
O	,
O	taking
O	the
O	pipe
O	from
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	letting
O	the
O	fragrant
O	vapour
O	curl
O	about
O	his
O	nose
O	,
O	would
O	gravely
O	nod
O	his
O	head
O	in
O	token
O	of
O	perfect
O	approbation
O	.
O	From
O	even
O	this
O	stronghold
O	the
O	unlucky
O	Rip
O	was
O	at
O	length
O	routed
O	by
O	his
O	termagant
O	wife
O	,
O	who
O	would
O	suddenly
O	break
O	in
O	upon
O	the
O	tranquillity
O	of
O	the
O	assemblage
O	and

O	sacred
O	from
O	the
O	daring
O	tongue

O	On

O	a

O	at
O	nine-pins
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	dressed

O	fashion;

O	long
O	knives
O	in

O	belts
O	,
O	and
O	most
O	of
O	them
O	had

O	breeches
O	of
O	similar
O	style
O	with

O	the
O	guide

O	.
O	Their
O	visages
O	,

O	had
O	a
O	large
O	beard
O	,
O	broad
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	small
O	piggish
O	eyes;
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	another
O	seemed
O	to
O	consist
O	entirely
O	of
O	nose
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	surmounted
O	by
O	a
O	white
O	sugar-loaf
O	hat
O	,
O	set
O	off
O	with
O	a
O	little
O	red
O	cock
O	'
O	s
O	tail
O	.
O	They
O	all
O	had
O	beards
O	,
O	of
O	various
O	shapes
O	and
O	colours
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	one
O	who
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	commander
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	stout
O	old
O	gentleman
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	weather-beaten
O	countenance;
O	he
O	wore
O	a
O	laced
O	doublet
O	,
O	broad
O	belt
O	and
O	hanger
O	,
O	high-crowned
O	hat
O	and
O	feather
O	,
O	red
O	stockings
O	,
O	and
O	high-heeled
O	shoes
O	,
O	with
O	roses
O	in
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	group
O	reminded
O	Rip
O	of
O	the
O	figures
O	in
O	an
O	old
O	Flemish
O	painting
O	in
O	the
O	parlour
O	of
O	Dominie
O	Van
O	Shaick
O	,
O	the
O	village

O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	brought
O	over
O	from
O	Holland
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	the
O	settlement
O	.
O	What
O	seemed
O	particularly
O	odd
O	to
O	Rip
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	though
O	these
O	folks
O	were
O	evidently
O	amusing
O	themselves
O	,
O	yet
O	they
O	maintained
O	the
O	gravest
O	faces
O	,
O	the
O	most
O	mysterious
O	silence
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	,
O	withal
O	,
O	the
O	most
O	melancholy
O	party
O	of
O	pleasure
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	witnessed
O	.
O	Nothing
O	interrupted
O	the
O	stillness
O	of
O	the
O	scene
O	but
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	the
O	balls
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	whenever
O	they
O	were
O	rolled
O	,
O	echoed
O	along
O	the
O	mountains
O	like
O	rumbling
O	peals
O	of
O	thunder
O	.
O	As
O	Rip
O	and
O	his
O	companion
O	approached
O	them
O	,
O	they
O	suddenly
O	desisted
O	from
O	their
O	play
O	,
O	and
O	stared
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	such
O	fixed
O	,
O	statue-like
O	gaze
O	,
O	and
O	such
O	strange
O	,
O	uncouth
O	,
O	lack-lustre
O	countenances
O	that
O	his
O	heart
O	turned
O	within
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	knees
O	smote
O	together
O	.
O	His
O	companion
O	now
O	emptied
O	the
O	contents
O	of
O	the
O	keg
O	into
O	large
O	flagons
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	signs
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	wait
O	upon
O	the
O	company
O	.
O	He
O	obeyed
O	with
O	fear
O	and
O	trembling;
O	they
O	quaffed
O	the
O	liquor
O	in
O	profound
O	silence
O	,
O	and
O	then

O	to

O	.
O	By
O	degrees
O	Rip
O	'

O	and

O	subsided
O	.

O	taste

O	He
O	shook
O	his

O	,
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	heart
O	full
O	of
O	trouble
O	and
O	anxiety
O	,
O	turned

O	.
O	As
O	he
O	approached
O	the

O	he
O	met
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	people
O	,
O	but
O	none
O	whom
O	he
O	knew
O	,
O	which
O	somewhat
O	surprised
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	thought
O	himself
O	acquainted
O	with
O	every
O	one
O	in
O	the

O	Their
O	dress
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	was
O	of
O	a
O	different
O	fashion
O	from
O	that
O	to

O	was
O	accustomed

O	They
O	all
O	stared
O	at

O	with
O	equal

O	surprise
O	,

O	whenever

O	their

O	upon

O	,
O	invariably

O	The

O	A

O	Mountains
O	had
O	always
O	been
O	haunted
O	by
O	strange
O	beings

O	That
O	it

O	affirmed
O	that
O	the

O	Hendrick
O	Hudson
O	,
O	the
O	first
O	discoverer
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	and
O	country
O	,
O	kept
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	vigil
O	there
O	every
O	twenty
O	years
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	crew
O	of
O	the
O	Half-moon;
O	being
O	permitted
O	in
O	this
O	way
O	to
O	revisit
O	the
O	scenes
O	of
O	his
O	enterprise
O	,
O	and
O	keep
O	a
O	guardian
O	eye
O	upon
O	the
O	river
O	and
O	the
O	great
O	city
O	called
O	by
O	his
O	name
O	.
O	That
O	his
O	father
O	had
O	once
O	seen
O	them
O	in
O	their
O	old
O	Dutch
O	dresses
O	playing
O	at
O	nine-pins
O	in
O	a
O	hollow
O	of
O	the

O	and
O	that
O	he

O	had
O	heard
O	,
O	one
O	summer
O	afternoon
O	,
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	their
O	balls
O	like

O	peals
O	of

O	.
O	To
O	make
O	a
O	long
O	story
O	short
O	,
O	the
O	company
O	broke
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	more
O	important
O	concerns
O	of
O	the
O	election

O	Rip
O	'
O	s
O	daughter
O	took
O	him
O	home
O	to
O	live
O	with
O	her;
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	snug
O	well-furnished
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	stout
O	cheery
O	farmer
O	for
O	a
O	husband
O	,
O	whom
O	Rip
O	recollected
O	for
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	urchins
O	that
O	used
O	to
O	climb
O	upon
O	his
O	back
O	.
O	As
O	to
O	Rip
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	and
O	heir
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	ditto
O	of
O	himself
O	,
O	seen
O	leaning
O	against
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	employed
O	to
O	work
O	on
O	the
O	farm;
O	but
O	evinced
O	an
O	hereditary
O	disposition
O	to
O	attend
O	to
O	anything
O	else
O	but
O	his
O	business
O	.
O	Rip
O	now
O	resumed
O	his
O	old
O	walks
O	and
O	habits;
O	he
O	soon
O	found
O	many
O	of
O	his
O	former
O	cronies
O	,
O	though
O	all
O	rather
O	the
O	worse
O	for
O	the
O	wear
O	and
O	tear
O	of
O	time;
O	and
O	preferred
O	making
O	friends
O	among
O	the
O	rising
O	generation
O	,
O	with
O	whom
O	he
O	soon
O	grew
O	into
O	great
O	favour
O	.
O	Having
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	at
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	being
O	arrived
O	at
O	that
O	happy
O	age
O	when
O	a
O	man
O	can
O	be
O	idle
O	with
O	impunity
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	place
O	once
O	more
O	on
O	the
O	bench
O	at
O	the
O	inn
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	reverenced
O	as
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	patriarchs
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	chronicle
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	times
O	""""
O	before
O	the
O	war
O	.
O	""""
O	It
O	was
O	some
O	time
O	before
O	he
O	could
O	get
O	into
O	the
O	regular
O	track
O	of
O	gossip
O	,
O	or
O	could
O	be
O	made
O	to
O	comprehend
O	the
O	strange
O	events
O	that
O	had
O	taken
O	place
O	during
O	his
O	torpor
O	.
O	How
O	that
O	there
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	revolutionary
O	war--that
O	the
O	country
O	had
O	thrown
O	off
O	the
O	yoke
O	of
O	old
O	England--and
O	that
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	being
O	a
O	subject
O	of
O	his
O	Majesty
O	George
O	the
O	Third
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	now
O	a
O	free
O	citizen
O	of
O	the
O	United
O	States
O	.
O	Rip
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	was
O	no
O	politician;
O	the
O	changes
O	of
O	states
O	and
O	empires
O	made
O	but
O	little
O	impression
O	on
O	him;
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	one
O	species
O	of
O	despotism
O	under
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	long
O	groaned
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	was--petticoat
O	government
O	.
O	Happily
O	that
O	was
O	at
O	an
O	end;
O	he
O	had
O	got
O	his
O	neck
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	yoke
O	of
O	matrimony
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	go
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	whenever
O	he
O	pleased
O	,
O	without
O	dreading
O	the
O	tyranny
O	of
O	Dame
O	Van
O	Winkle
O	.
O	Whenever
O	her
O	name
O	was
O	mentioned
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	shook
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	shrugged
O	his
O	shoulders
O	,
O	and
O	cast
O	up
O	his
O	eyes
O	,
O	which
O	might
O	pass
O	either
O	for
O	an
O	expression
O	of
O	resignation
O	to
O	his
O	fate
O	,
O	or
O	joy
O	at
O	his
O	deliverance
O	.
O	He
O	used
O	to
O	tell
O	his
O	story
O	to
O	every
O	stranger
O	that
O	arrived
O	at
O	Mr
O	.
O	Doolittle
O	'
O	s
O	hotel
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	observed
O	,
O	at
O	first
O	,
O	to
O	vary
O	on
O	some
O	points
O	every
O	time
O	he
O	told
O	it
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	,
O	doubtless
O	,
O	owing
O	to
O	his
O	having
O	so
O	recently
O	awaked
O	.
O	It
O	at
O	last
O	settled
O	down
O	precisely
O	to
O	the
O	tale
O	I
O	have
O	related
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	woman
O	,
O	or
O	child
O	in
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	but
O	knew
O	it
O	by
O	heart
O	.
O	Some
O	always
O	pretended
O	to
O	doubt
O	the
O	reality
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	insisted
O	that
O	Rip
O	had
O	been
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	one
O	point
O	on
O	which
O	he
O	always
O	remained
O	flighty
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	Dutch
O	inhabitants
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	almost
O	universally
O	gave
O	it
O	full
O	credit
O	.
O	Even
O	to
O	this
O	day
O	they
O	never
O	hear
O	a
O	thunder-storm
O	of
O	a
O	summer
O	afternoon
O	about
O	the
O	Kaatskill
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	say
O	Hendrick
O	Hudson
O	and
O	his
O	crew
O	are
O	at
O	their
O	game
O	of
O	nine-pins;
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	a
O	common
O	wish
O	of
O	all
O	henpecked
O	husbands
O	in
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	,
O	when
O	life
O	hangs
O	heavy
O	on
O	their
O	hands
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	have
O	a
O	quieting
O	draught
O	out
O	of
O	Rip
O	Van
O	Wrinkle
O	'
