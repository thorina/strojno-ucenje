O	The

O	and
O	doubting

O	the
O	full
O	value
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	offered

O	a

O	out
O	of
O	his

O	.
O	Aladdin
O	,
O	taking
O	the
O	money
O	very
O	eagerly
O	,
O	retired
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	haste
O	that
O	the
O	Jew
O	,
O	not
O	content
O	with
O	the
O	exorbitancy
O	of
O	his
O	profit
O	,
O	was
O	vexed
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	penetrated
O	into

O	ignorance
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	run
O	after
O	him
O	,
O	to
O	endeavor
O	to
O	get
O	some
O	change
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	piece
O	of
O	gold;
O	but
O	he
O	ran
O	so
O	fast
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	got
O	so
O	far
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	impossible
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	overtake
O	him
O	.
O	Before
O	Aladdin
O	went
O	home
O	he
O	called
O	at
O	a
O	baker's
O	,
O	bought
O	some
O	cakes
O	of
O	bread
O	,
O	changed
O	his
O	money
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	his
O	return
O	gave
O	the
O	rest
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	who
O	went
O	and
O	purchased
O	provisions
O	enough
O	to
O	last
O	them
O	some
O	time
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	manner
O	they
O	lived
O	,
O	till
O	Aladdin
O	had
O	sold
O	the
O	twelve

O	singly
O	,
O	as
O	necessity
O	pressed
O	,
O	to
O	the

O	,
O	after

O	,
O	durst
O	not

O	.
O	When

O	had
O	sold
O	the
O	last
O	dish
O	he
O	had
O	recourse
O	to
O	the
O	tray
O	,
O	which
O	weighed
O	ten
O	times
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	the
O	dishes
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	carried
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	old
O	purchaser
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	too
O	large
O	and
O	cumbersome;
O	therefore
O	he
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	bring
O	him
O	home
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	mother's
O	,
O	where
O	,
O	after

O	Jew
O	had
O	examined
O	the
O	weight
O	of
O	the
