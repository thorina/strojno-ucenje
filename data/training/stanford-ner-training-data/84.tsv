O	Few
O	people
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	country
O	would
O	have
O	heard
O	of
O	Baron
O	Trenck
O	had
O	it
O	not
O	been
O	for
O	the
O	wonderful
O	skill
O	and
O	cunning
O	with
O	which
O	he
O	managed
O	to
O	cut
O	through
O	the
O	stone
O	walls
O	and
O	iron
O	bars
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	many
O	cages
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	born
O	at
O	Kaenigsberg
O	in
O	Prussia
O	in
O	1726
O	,
O	and
O	entered
O	the
O	body-guard
O	of
O	Frederic
O	II
O	in
O	1742
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	about
O	sixteen
O	.
O	Trenck
O	was
O	a
O	young
O	man
O	of
O	good
O	family
O	,
O	rich
O	,
O	well
O	educated
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	account
O	,
O	fond
O	of
O	amusement
O	.
O	He
O	confesses
O	to
O	having
O	shirked
O	his
O	duties
O	more
O	than
O	once
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	some
O	pleasure
O	,
O	even
O	after
O	the
O	War
O	of
O	the
O	Austrian
O	Succession
O	had
O	broken
O	out
O	(
O	September
O	,
O	1744
O	)
O	,
O	and
O	Frederic
O	,
O	strict
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	had
O	forgiven
O	him
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	plain
O	from
O	this
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	must
O	have
O	considered
O	that
O	Trenck
O	had
O	been
O	guilty
O	of
O	some
O	deadly
O	treachery
O	toward
O	him
O	when
O	in
O	after
O	years
O	he
O	declined
O	to
O	pardon
O	him
O	for
O	crimes
O	which
O	after
O	all
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	had
O	never
O	committed
O	.
O	Trenck's
O	first
O	confinement
O	was
O	in
O	1746
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	thrown
O	into
O	the
O	Castle
O	of
O	Glatz
O	,
O	on
O	a
O	charge
O	of
O	corresponding
O	with
O	his
O	cousin
O	and
O	namesake
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	the
O	Empress
O	Maria
O	Theresa
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	being
O	an
O	Austrian
O	spy
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	he
O	was
O	kindly
O	treated
O	and
O	allowed
O	to
O	walk
O	freely
O	about
O	the
O	fortifications
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	took
O	advantage
O	of
O	the
O	liberty
O	given
O	him
O	to
O	arrange
O	a
O	plan
O	of
O	escape
O	with
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	fellow-prisoners
O	.
O	The
O	plot
O	was
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	betrayed
O	by
O	the
O	other
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	heavy
O	punishment
O	fell
O	on
O	Trenck
O	.
O	By
O	the
O	king's
O	orders
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	promptly
O	deprived
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	privileges
O	and
O	placed
O	in
O	a
O	cell
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	towers
O	,
O	which
O	overlooked
O	the
O	ramparts
O	lying
O	ninety
O	feet
O	below
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	nearest
O	the
O	town
O	.
O	This
O	added
O	a
O	fresh
O	difficulty
O	to
O	his
O	chances
O	of
O	escape
O	,
O	as
O	,
O	in
O	passing
O	from
O	the
O	castle
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	certain
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	by
O	many
O	people
O	.
O	But
O	no
O	obstacles
O	mattered
O	to
O	Trenck
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	money
O	,
O	and
O	money
O	could
O	do
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	began
O	by
O	bribing
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	officials
O	about
O	the
O	prison
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	official
O	in
O	his
O	turn
O	bribed
O	a
O	soapboiler
O	,
O	who
O	lived
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	castle
O	gates
O	,
O	and
O	promised
O	to
O	conceal
O	Trenck
O	somewhere
O	in
O	his
O	house
O	.
O	Still
O	,
O	liberty
O	must
O	have
O	seemed
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	off
O	,
O	for
O	Trenck
O	had
O	only
O	one
O	little
O	knife
O	with
O	which
O	to
O	cut
O	through
O	anything
O	.
O	By
O	dint
O	of
O	incessant
O	and
O	hard
O	work
O	,
O	he
O	managed
O	to
O	saw
O	through
O	three
O	thick
O	steel
O	bars
O	,
O	but
O	even
O	so
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	eight
O	others
O	left
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	His
O	friend
O	the
O	official
O	then
O	procured
O	him
O	a
O	file
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	use
O	it
O	with
O	great
O	care
O	,
O	lest
O	the
O	scraping
O	sound
O	should
O	be
O	heard
O	by
O	his
O	guards
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	they
O	wilfully
O	closed
O	their
O	ears
O	,
O	for
O	many
O	of
O	them
O	were
O	sorry
O	for
O	Trenck;
O	but
O	,
O	at
O	all
O	events
O	,
O	the
O	eleven
O	bars
O	were
O	at
O	last
O	sawn
O	through
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	that
O	remained
O	was
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	rope
O	ladder
O	.
O	This
O	he
O	did
O	by
O	tearing
O	his
O	leather
O	portmanteau
O	into
O	strips
O	and
O	plaiting
O	them
O	into
O	a
O	rope
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	this
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	enough
O	,
O	he
O	added
O	his
O	sheets
O	.
O	The
O	night
O	was
O	dark
O	and
O	rainy
O	,
O	which
O	favored
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	rampart
O	in
O	safety
O	.
O	Unluckily
O	,
O	he
O	met
O	here
O	with
O	an
O	obstacle
O	on
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	counted
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	large
O	drain
O	,
O	opening
O	into
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	trenches
O	,
O	which
O	Trenck
O	had
O	neither
O	seen
O	nor
O	heard
O	of
O	,
O	and
O	into
O	this
O	he
O	fell
O	.
O	In
O	spite
O	of
O	his
O	struggles
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	held
O	fast
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	strength
O	being
O	at
O	last
O	exhausted
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	call
O	the
O	sentinel
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	midday
O	,
O	having
O	been
O	left
O	in
O	the
O	drain
O	for
O	hours
O	to
O	make
O	sport
O	for
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	carried
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	cell
O	.
O	Henceforth
O	he
O	was
O	still
O	more
O	strictly
O	watched
O	than
O	before
O	,
O	though
O	,
O	curiously
O	enough
O	,
O	his
O	money
O	never
O	seems
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	taken
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	he
O	had
O	about
O	eighty
O	louis
O	left
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	always
O	kept
O	hidden
O	.
O	Eight
O	days
O	after
O	his
O	last
O	attempt
O	,
O	Fouquet
O	,
O	the
O	commandant
O	of
O	Glatz
O	,
O	who
O	hated
O	Trenck
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	family
O	,
O	sent
O	a
O	deputation
O	consisting
O	of
O	the
O	adjutant
O	,
O	an
O	officer
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	certain
O	Major
O	Doo
O	to
O	speak
O	to
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	man
O	and
O	exhort
O	him
O	to
O	patience
O	and
O	submission
O	.
O	Trenck
O	entered
O	into
O	conversation
O	with
O	them
O	for
O	the
O	purpose
O	of
O	throwing
O	them
O	off
O	their
O	guard
O	,
O	when
O	suddenly
O	he
O	snatched
O	away
O	Doo's
O	sword
O	,
O	rushed
O	from
O	his
O	cell
O	,
O	knocked
O	down
O	the
O	sentinel
O	and
O	lieutenant
O	who
O	were
O	standing
O	outside
O	,
O	and
O	striking
O	right
O	and
O	left
O	at
O	the
O	soldiers
O	who
O	came
O	flying
O	to
O	bar
O	his
O	progress
O	,
O	he
O	dashed
O	down
O	the
O	stairs
O	and
O	leaped
O	from
O	the
O	ramparts
O	.
O	Though
O	the
O	height
O	was
O	great
O	he
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	fosse
O	without
O	injury
O	,
O	still
O	grasping
O	his
O	sword
O	.
O	He
O	scrambled
O	quickly
O	to
O	his
O	feet
O	and
O	jumped
O	easily
O	over
O	the
O	second
O	rampart
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	much
O	lower
O	than
O	the
O	first
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	began
O	to
O	breathe
O	freely
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	was
O	safe
O	from
O	being
O	overtaken
O	by
O	the
O	soldiers
O	,
O	who
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	come
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	round
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	moment
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	sentinel
O	making
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	a
O	short
O	distance
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	rushed
O	for
O	the
O	palisades
O	which
O	divided
O	the
O	fortifications
O	from
O	the
O	open
O	country
O	,
O	from
O	which
O	the
O	mountains
O	and
O	Bohemia
O	were
O	easily
O	reached
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	act
O	of
O	scaling
O	them
O	,
O	his
O	foot
O	was
O	caught
O	tight
O	between
O	the
O	bars
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	trapped
O	till
O	the
O	sentinel
O	came
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	sharp
O	fight
O	got
O	him
O	back
O	to
O	prison
O	.
O	For
O	some
O	time
O	poor
O	Trenck
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	sad
O	condition
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	struggle
O	with
O	the
O	sentinel
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	wounded
O	,
O	while
O	his
O	right
O	foot
O	had
O	got
O	crushed
O	in
O	the
O	palisades
O	.
O	Besides
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	watched
O	far
O	more
O	strictly
O	than
O	before
O	,
O	for
O	an
O	officer
O	and
O	two
O	men
O	remained
O	always
O	in
O	his
O	cell
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	sentinels
O	were
O	stationed
O	outside
O	.
O	The
O	reason
O	of
O	these
O	precautions
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	was
O	to
O	prevent
O	his
O	gaining
O	over
O	his
O	guards
O	singly
O	,
O	either
O	by
O	pity
O	or
O	bribery
O	.
O	His
O	courage
O	sank
O	to
O	its
O	lowest
O	ebb
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	told
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	that
O	his
O	imprisonment
O	was
O	for
O	life
O	,
O	whereas
O	long
O	after
O	he
O	discovered
O	the
O	real
O	truth
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	king's
O	intention
O	had
O	been
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	under
O	arrest
O	for
O	a
O	year
O	only
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	had
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	patience
O	,
O	three
O	weeks
O	would
O	have
O	found
O	him
O	free
O	.
O	His
O	repeated
O	attempts
O	to
O	escape
O	naturally
O	angered
O	Frederic
O	,
O	while
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	hand
O	the
O	king
O	knew
O	nothing
O	of
O	the
O	fact
O	which
O	excused
O	Trenck's
O	impatience--namely
O	,
O	the
O	belief
O	carefully
O	instilled
O	in
O	him
O	by
O	all
O	around
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	doomed
O	to
O	perpetual
O	confinement
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	impossible
O	to
O	describe
O	in
O	detail
O	all
O	the
O	plans
O	made
O	by
O	Trenck
O	to
O	regain
O	his
O	freedom;
O	first
O	because
O	they
O	were
O	endless
O	,
O	and
O	secondly
O	because
O	several
O	were
O	nipped
O	in
O	the
O	bud
O	.
O	Still
O	,
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	man
O	felt
O	that
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	his
O	money
O	was
O	not
O	taken
O	from
O	him
O	his
O	case
O	was
O	not
O	hopeless
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	officers
O	in
O	command
O	were
O	generally
O	poor
O	and
O	in
O	debt
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	always
O	sent
O	to
O	garrison
O	work
O	as
O	a
O	punishment
O	.
O	After
O	one
O	wild
O	effort
O	to
O	liberate
O	_all_
O	the
O	prisoners
O	in
O	the
O	fortress
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	naturally
O	discovered
O	and
O	frustrated
O	,
O	Trenck
O	made
O	friends
O	with
O	an
O	officer
O	named
O	Schell
O	,
O	lately
O	arrived
O	at
O	Glatz
O	,
O	who
O	promised
O	not
O	only
O	his
O	aid
O	but
O	his
O	company
O	in
O	the
O	new
O	enterprise
O	.
O	As
O	more
O	money
O	would
O	be
O	needed
O	than
O	Trenck
O	had
O	in
O	his
O	possession
O	,
O	he
O	contrived
O	to
O	apply
O	to
O	his
O	rich
O	relations
O	outside
O	the
O	prison
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	some
O	means--what
O	we
O	are
O	not
O	told--they
O	managed
O	to
O	convey
O	a
O	large
O	sum
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	Suspicion
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	got
O	about
O	that
O	Trenck
O	was
O	on
O	too
O	familiar
O	a
O	footing
O	with
O	the
O	officers
O	,
O	and
O	orders
O	were
O	given
O	that
O	his
O	door
O	should
O	always
O	be
O	kept
O	locked
O	.
O	This
O	occasioned
O	further
O	delay
O	,
O	as
O	false
O	keys
O	had
O	secretly
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	before
O	anything
O	else
O	could
O	be
O	done
O	.
O	Their
O	flight
O	was
O	unexpectedly
O	hastened
O	by
O	Schell
O	accidentally
O	learning
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	danger
O	of
O	arrest
O	.
O	One
O	night
O	they
O	crept
O	unobserved
O	through
O	the
O	arsenal
O	and
O	over
O	the
O	inner
O	palisade
O	,
O	but
O	on
O	reaching
O	the
O	rampart
O	they
O	came
O	face
O	to
O	face
O	with
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	officers
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	a
O	leap
O	into
O	the
O	fosse
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	way
O	of
O	escape
O	.
O	Luckily
O	,
O	the
O	wall
O	at
O	this
O	point
O	was
O	not
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	Trenck
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	without
O	injury;
O	but
O	Schell
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	happy
O	,
O	and
O	hurt
O	his
O	foot
O	so
O	badly
O	that
O	he
O	called
O	on
O	his
O	friend
O	to
O	kill
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	alone
O	.
O	Trenck
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	declined
O	to
O	abandon
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	dragged
O	him
O	over
O	the
O	outer
O	palisade
O	,
O	took
O	him
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	for
O	the
O	frontier
O	.
O	Before
O	they
O	had
O	gone
O	five
O	hundred
O	yards
O	,
O	they
O	heard
O	the
O	boom
O	of
O	the
O	alarm
O	guns
O	from
O	the
O	fortress
O	,
O	while
O	clearer
O	still
O	were
O	the
O	sounds
O	of
O	pursuit
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	knew
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	naturally
O	be
O	sought
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	toward
O	Bohemia
O	,
O	they
O	changed
O	their
O	course
O	and
O	pushed
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	river
O	Neiss
O	,
O	at
O	this
O	season
O	partly
O	covered
O	with
O	ice
O	.
O	Trenck
O	swam
O	over
O	slowly
O	with
O	his
O	friend
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	a
O	boat
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	.
O	By
O	means
O	of
O	this
O	boat
O	they
O	evaded
O	their
O	enemies
O	,
O	and
O	reached
O	the
O	mountains
O	after
O	some
O	hours
O	,
O	very
O	hungry
O	,
O	and
O	almost
O	frozen
O	to
O	death
O	.
O	Here
O	a
O	new
O	terror
O	awaited
O	them
O	.
O	Some
O	peasants
O	with
O	whom
O	they
O	took
O	refuge
O	recognized
O	Schell
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	the
O	fugitives
O	gave
O	themselves
O	up
O	for
O	lost
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	peasants
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	the
O	two
O	wretched
O	objects
O	,
O	fed
O	them
O	and
O	gave
O	them
O	shelter
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	could
O	make
O	up
O	their
O	minds
O	what
O	was
O	best
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	.
O	To
O	their
O	unspeakable
O	dismay
O	,
O	they
O	found
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	,
O	only
O	seven
O	miles
O	from
O	Glatz
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	neighboring
O	town
O	of
O	Wunschelburg
O	a
O	hundred
O	soldiers
O	were
O	quartered
O	,
O	with
O	orders
O	to
O	capture
O	all
O	deserters
O	from
O	the
O	fortress
O	.
O	This
O	time
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	fortune
O	favored
O	the
O	luckless
O	Trenck
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	he
O	and
O	Schell
O	were
O	both
O	in
O	uniform
O	,
O	they
O	rode
O	unobserved
O	through
O	the
O	village
O	while
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	were
O	at
O	church
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	skirting
O	Wunschelburg
O	,
O	crossed
O	the
O	Bohemian
O	frontier
O	in
O	the
O	course
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	.
O	Then
O	follows
O	a
O	period
O	of
O	comparative
O	calm
O	in
O	Trenck's
O	history
O	.
O	He
O	travelled
O	freely
O	about
O	Poland
O	,
O	Austria
O	,
O	Russia
O	,
O	Sweden
O	,
O	Denmark
O	and
O	Holland
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	ventured
O	occasionally
O	across
O	the
O	border
O	into
O	Prussia
O	.
O	Twelve
O	years
O	seem
O	to
O	have
O	passed
O	by
O	in
O	this
O	manner
O	,
O	till
O	,
O	in
O	1758
O	,
O	his
O	mother
O	died
O	,
O	and
O	Trenck
O	asked
O	leave
O	of
O	the
O	council
O	of
O	war
O	to
O	go
O	up
O	to
O	Dantzic
O	to
O	see
O	his
O	family
O	and
O	to
O	arrange
O	his
O	affairs
O	.
O	Curiously
O	enough
O	,
O	it
O	appears
O	never
O	to
O	have
O	occurred
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	deserter
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	such
O	liable
O	to
O	be
O	arrested
O	at
O	any
O	moment
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	was
O	what
O	actually
O	happened
O	.
O	By
O	order
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	Trenck
O	was
O	taken
O	first
O	to
O	Berlin
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	deprived
O	of
O	his
O	money
O	and
O	some
O	valuable
O	rings
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	removed
O	to
O	Magdeburg
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	place
O	Duke
O	Ferdinand
O	of
O	Brunswick
O	was
O	the
O	governor
O	.
O	Here
O	his
O	quarters
O	were
O	worse
O	than
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	known
O	them
O	.
O	His
O	cell
O	was
O	only
O	six
O	feet
O	by
O	ten
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	window
O	was
O	high
O	,
O	with
O	bars
O	without
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	within
O	.
O	The
O	wall
O	was
O	seven
O	feet
O	thick
O	,
O	and
O	beyond
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	palisade
O	,
O	which
O	rendered
O	it
O	impossible
O	for
O	the
O	sentinels
O	to
O	approach
O	the
O	window
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	the
O	prisoner
O	was
O	shut
O	in
O	by
O	three
O	doors
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	food
O	(
O	which
O	was
O	not
O	only
O	bad
O	,
O	but
O	very
O	scanty
O	)
O	was
O	passed
O	to
O	him
O	through
O	an
O	opening
O	.
O	One
O	thing
O	only
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	favor
O	.
O	His
O	cell
O	was
O	only
O	entered
O	once
O	a
O	week
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	could
O	pursue
O	any
O	work
O	to
O	further
O	his
O	escape
O	without
O	much
O	danger
O	of
O	being
O	discovered
O	.
O	Notwithstanding
O	the
O	high
O	window
O	,
O	the
O	thick
O	wall
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	palisade--notwithstanding
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	his
O	want
O	of
O	money--he
O	soon
O	managed
O	to
O	open
O	negotiations
O	with
O	the
O	sentinels
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	joy
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	next
O	cell
O	was
O	empty
O	.
O	If
O	he
O	could
O	only
O	contrive
O	to
O	burrow
O	his
O	way
O	into
O	that
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	watch
O	his
O	opportunity
O	to
O	steal
O	through
O	the
O	open
O	door;
O	once
O	free
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	either
O	swim
O	the
O	Elbe
O	and
O	cross
O	into
O	Saxony
O	,
O	which
O	lay
O	about
O	six
O	miles
O	distant
O	,
O	or
O	else
O	float
O	down
O	the
O	river
O	in
O	a
O	boat
O	till
O	he
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	danger
O	.
O	Small
O	as
O	the
O	cell
O	was
O	,
O	it
O	contained
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	cupboard
O	,
O	fixed
O	into
O	the
O	floor
O	by
O	irons
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	these
O	Trenck
O	began
O	to
O	work
O	.
O	After
O	frightful
O	labor
O	,
O	he
O	at
O	last
O	extracted
O	the
O	heavy
O	nails
O	which
O	fastened
O	the
O	staples
O	to
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	and
O	breaking
O	off
O	the
O	heads
O	(
O	which
O	he
O	put
O	back
O	to
O	avoid
O	detection
O	)
O	,
O	he
O	kept
O	the
O	rest
O	to
O	fashion
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	purposes
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	means
O	he
O	made
O	instruments
O	to
O	raise
O	the
O	bricks
O	.
O	On
O	this
O	side
O	also
O	the
O	wall
O	was
O	seven
O	feet
O	thick
O	,
O	and
O	formed
O	of
O	bricks
O	and
O	stones
O	.
O	Trenck
O	numbered
O	them
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	care
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	cell
O	might
O	present
O	its
O	usual
O	appearance
O	before
O	the
O	Wednesday
O	visit
O	of
O	his
O	guards
O	.
O	To
O	hide
O	the
O	joins
O	,
O	he
O	scraped
O	off
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	mortar
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	smeared
O	over
O	the
O	place
O	.
O	As
O	may
O	be
O	supposed
O	,
O	all
O	this
O	took
O	a
O	very
O	long
O	time
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	work
O	with
O	but
O	the
O	tools
O	he
O	himself
O	had
O	made
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	were
O	very
O	rough
O	.
O	But
O	one
O	day
O	a
O	friendly
O	sentinel
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	little
O	iron
O	rod
O	and
O	a
O	small
O	knife
O	with
O	a
O	wooden
O	handle
O	.
O	These
O	were
O	treasures
O	indeed
O	!
O	And
O	with
O	their
O	help
O	he
O	worked
O	away
O	for
O	six
O	months
O	at
O	his
O	hole
O	,
O	as
O	in
O	some
O	places
O	the
O	mortar
O	had
O	become
O	so
O	hard
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	to
O	be
O	pounded
O	like
O	a
O	stone
O	.
O	During
O	this
O	time
O	he
O	enlisted
O	the
O	compassion
O	of
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	sentinels
O	,
O	who
O	not
O	only
O	described
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	lay
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	which
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	traverse
O	if
O	he
O	ever
O	succeeded
O	in
O	getting
O	out
O	of
O	prison
O	,
O	but
O	interested
O	in
O	his
O	behalf
O	a
O	Jewess
O	named
O	Esther
O	Heymann
O	,
O	whose
O	own
O	father
O	had
O	been
O	for
O	two
O	years
O	a
O	prisoner
O	in
O	Magdeburg
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	manner
O	Trenck
O	became
O	the
O	possessor
O	of
O	a
O	file
O	,
O	a
O	knife
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	writing
O	paper
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	friendly
O	Jewess
O	had
O	agreed
O	to
O	convey
O	letters
O	to
O	some
O	influential
O	people
O	,
O	both
O	at
O	Vienna
O	and
O	Berlin
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	to
O	his
O	sister
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	step
O	led
O	to
O	the
O	ruin
O	,
O	not
O	only
O	of
O	Trenck
O	,
O	but
O	of
O	several
O	persons
O	concerned
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	betrayed
O	by
O	an
O	imperial
O	secretary
O	of
O	embassy
O	called
O	Weingarten
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	tempted
O	by
O	a
O	bill
O	for
O	20
O	,
O	000
O	florins
O	.
O	Many
O	of
O	those
O	guilty
O	of
O	abetting
O	Trenck
O	in
O	this
O	fresh
O	effort
O	to
O	escape
O	were
O	put
O	to
O	death
O	,
O	while
O	his
O	sister
O	was
O	ordered
O	to
O	build
O	a
O	new
O	prison
O	for
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	Fort
O	de
O	l'Etoile
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	himself
O	was
O	destined
O	to
O	pass
O	nine
O	more
O	years
O	in
O	chains
O	.
O	In
O	spite
O	of
O	his
O	fetters
O	,
O	Trenck
O	was
O	able
O	in
O	some
O	miraculous
O	way
O	to
O	get
O	on
O	with
O	his
O	hole
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	long
O	labor
O	was
O	rendered
O	useless
O	by
O	the
O	circumstance
O	that
O	his
O	new
O	prison
O	was
O	finished
O	sooner
O	than
O	he
O	expected
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	removed
O	into
O	it
O	hastily
O	,
O	being
O	only
O	able
O	to
O	conceal
O	his
O	knife
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	now
O	chained
O	even
O	more
O	heavily
O	than
O	before
O	,
O	his
O	two
O	feet
O	being
O	attached
O	to
O	a
O	heavy
O	ring
O	fixed
O	in
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	another
O	ring
O	being
O	fastened
O	round
O	his
O	body
O	.
O	From
O	this
O	ring
O	was
O	suspended
O	a
O	chain
O	with
O	a
O	thick
O	iron
O	bar
O	,
O	two
O	feet
O	long
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	this
O	his
O	hands
O	were
O	fastened
O	.
O	An
O	iron
O	collar
O	was
O	afterward
O	added
O	to
O	his
O	instruments
O	of
O	torture
O	.
O	Besides
O	torments
O	of
O	body
O	,
O	nothing
O	was
O	wanting
O	which
O	could
O	work
O	on
O	his
O	mind
O	.
O	His
O	prison
O	was
O	built
O	between
O	the
O	trenches
O	of
O	the
O	principal
O	rampart
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	of
O	course
O	very
O	dark
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	likewise
O	very
O	damp
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	to
O	crown
O	all
O	,
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	"""Trenck"""
O	had
O	been
O	printed
O	in
O	red
O	bricks
O	on
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	above
O	a
O	tomb
O	whose
O	place
O	was
O	indicated
O	by
O	a
O	death's-head
O	.
O	Here
O	again
O	,
O	he
O	tells
O	us
O	,
O	he
O	excited
O	the
O	pity
O	of
O	his
O	guards
O	,
O	who
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	bed
O	and
O	coverlet
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	much
O	bread
O	as
O	he
O	chose
O	to
O	eat;
O	and
O	,
O	wonderful
O	as
O	it
O	may
O	seem
O	,
O	his
O	health
O	did
O	not
O	suffer
O	from
O	all
O	these
O	horrors
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	got
O	a
O	little
O	accustomed
O	to
O	his
O	cramped
O	position
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	use
O	the
O	knife
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	cut
O	through
O	his
O	chains
O	.
O	He
O	next
O	burst
O	the
O	iron
O	band
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	severed
O	his
O	leg
O	fetters
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	way
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	put
O	them
O	on
O	again
O	and
O	no
O	one
O	be
O	any
O	the
O	wiser
O	.
O	Nothing
O	is
O	more
O	common
O	in
O	the
O	history
O	of
O	prisoners
O	than
O	this
O	exploit
O	,
O	and
O	nothing
O	is
O	more
O	astonishing
O	,
O	yet
O	we
O	meet
O	with
O	the
O	fact
O	again
O	and
O	again
O	in
O	their
O	memoirs
O	and
O	biographies
O	.
O	Trenck
O	at
O	any
O	rate
O	appears
O	to
O	have
O	accomplished
O	the
O	feat
O	without
O	much
O	difficulty
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	found
O	it
O	very
O	hard
O	,
O	to
O	get
O	his
O	hand
O	back
O	into
O	his
O	handcuffs
O	.
O	After
O	he
O	had
O	disposed
O	of
O	his
O	bonds
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	saw
O	at
O	the
O	doors
O	leading
O	to
O	the
O	gallery
O	.
O	These
O	were
O	four
O	in
O	number
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	of
O	wood
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	fourth
O	,
O	his
O	knife
O	broke
O	in
O	two
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	courage
O	that
O	had
O	upheld
O	him
O	for
O	so
O	many
O	years
O	gave
O	away
O	.
O	He
O	opened
O	his
O	veins
O	and
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	die
O	,
O	when
O	in
O	his
O	despair
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	Gefhardt
O	,
O	the
O	friendly
O	sentinel
O	from
O	the
O	other
O	prison
O	.
O	Hearing
O	of
O	Trenck's
O	sad
O	plight
O	,
O	he
O	scaled
O	the
O	palisade
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	we
O	are
O	told
O	expressly
O	,
O	bound
O	up
O	his
O	wounds
O	,
O	though
O	we
O	are
O	_not_
O	told
O	how
O	he
O	managed
O	to
O	enter
O	the
O	cell
O	.
O	Be
O	that
O	as
O	it
O	may
O	,
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	guards
O	came
O	to
O	open
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	they
O	found
O	Trenck
O	ready
O	to
O	meet
O	them
O	,
O	armed
O	with
O	a
O	brick
O	in
O	one
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	knife
O	,
O	doubtless
O	obtained
O	from
O	Gefhardt
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	man
O	that
O	approached
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	stretched
O	wounded
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	thinking
O	it
O	dangerous
O	to
O	irritate
O	further
O	a
O	desperate
O	man
O	,
O	they
O	made
O	a
O	compromise
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	governor
O	took
O	off
O	his
O	chains
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	strong
O	soup
O	and
O	fresh
O	linen
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	while
O	,
O	new
O	doors
O	were
O	put
O	to
O	his
O	cell
O	,
O	the
O	inner
O	door
O	being
O	lined
O	with
O	plates
O	of
O	iron
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	himself
O	was
O	fastened
O	with
O	stronger
O	chains
O	than
O	those
O	he
O	had
O	burst
O	through
O	.
O	For
O	all
O	this
O	the
O	watch
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	very
O	lax
O	,
O	as
O	Gefhardt
O	soon
O	contrived
O	to
O	open
O	communication
O	with
O	him
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	letters
O	were
O	passed
O	through
O	the
O	window
O	(
O	to
O	which
O	the
O	prisoner
O	had
O	made
O	a
O	false
O	and
O	movable
O	frame
O	)
O	and
O	forwarded
O	to
O	Trenck's
O	rich
O	friends
O	.
O	His
O	appeal
O	was
O	always
O	answered
O	promptly
O	and
O	amply
O	.
O	More
O	valuable
O	than
O	money
O	were
O	two
O	files
O	,
O	also
O	procured
O	from
O	Gefhardt
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	their
O	means
O	the
O	new
O	chains
O	were
O	speedily
O	cut
O	through
O	,
O	though
O	,
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	without
O	any
O	apparent
O	break
O	.
O	Having
O	freed
O	his
O	limbs
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	saw
O	through
O	the
O	floor
O	of
O	his
O	cell
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	of
O	wood
O	.
O	Underneath
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	hard
O	rock
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	sand
O	,
O	which
O	Trenck
O	scooped
O	out
O	with
O	his
O	hands
O	.
O	This
O	earth
O	was
O	passed
O	through
O	the
O	window
O	to
O	Gefhardt
O	,
O	who
O	removed
O	it
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	on
O	guard
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	his
O	friend
O	pistols
O	,
O	a
O	bayonet
O	,
O	and
O	knives
O	to
O	assist
O	him
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	finally
O	made
O	his
O	escape
O	.
O	All
O	seemed
O	going
O	smoothly
O	.
O	The
O	foundations
O	of
O	the
O	prison
O	were
O	only
O	four
O	feet
O	deep
O	,
O	and
O	Trenck's
O	tunnel
O	had
O	reached
O	a
O	considerable
O	distance
O	when
O	everything
O	was
O	again
O	spoiled
O	.
O	A
O	letter
O	written
O	by
O	Trenck
O	to
O	Vienna
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	governor
O	,
O	owing
O	to
O	some
O	stupidity
O	on
O	the
O	part
O	of
O	Gefhardt's
O	wife
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	intrusted
O	to
O	deliver
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	letter
O	does
O	not
O	seem
O	to
O	have
O	contained
O	any
O	special
O	disclosure
O	of
O	his
O	plan
O	of
O	escape
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	governor
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	still
O	Duke
O	Ferdinand
O	of
O	Brunswick
O	,
O	could
O	find
O	nothing
O	wrong
O	in
O	Trenck's
O	cell
O	except
O	the
O	false
O	window-frame
O	.
O	The
O	cut
O	chains
O	,
O	though
O	examined
O	,
O	somehow
O	escaped
O	detection
O	,
O	from
O	which
O	we
O	gather
O	either
O	that
O	the
O	officials
O	were
O	very
O	careless
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	carpenter
O	very
O	stupid
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	both
O	may
O	have
O	been
O	the
O	case
O	,
O	for
O	as
O	the
O	Seven
O	Years'
O	War
O	(
O	against
O	Austria
O	)
O	was
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	raging
O	,
O	sentinels
O	and
O	officers
O	were
O	frequently
O	changed
O	,
O	and
O	prison
O	discipline
O	insensibly
O	relaxed
O	.
O	Had
O	this
O	not
O	been
O	so
O	,
O	Trenck
O	could
O	never
O	have
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	labor
O	unseen
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	merely
O	deprived
O	of
O	his
O	bed
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	punishment
O	for
O	tampering
O	with
O	the
O	window
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	recovered
O	from
O	his
O	fright
O	and
O	an
O	illness
O	which
O	followed
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	digging
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	necessary
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	bore
O	under
O	the
O	subterranean
O	gallery
O	of
O	the
O	principal
O	rampart
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	distance
O	of
O	thirty-seven
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	get
O	outside
O	the
O	foundation
O	of
O	the
O	rampart
O	.
O	Beyond
O	that
O	was
O	a
O	door
O	leading
O	to
O	the
O	second
O	rampart
O	.
O	Trenck
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	work
O	almost
O	naked
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	raising
O	the
O	suspicions
O	of
O	the
O	officials
O	by
O	his
O	dirty
O	clothes
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	precautions
O	and
O	the
O	wilful
O	blindness
O	of
O	his
O	guards
O	,
O	who
O	as
O	usual
O	were
O	on
O	his
O	side
O	,
O	all
O	was
O	at
O	length
O	discovered
O	.
O	His
O	hole
O	was
O	filled
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	year's
O	work
O	lost
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	torture
O	invented
O	for
O	him
O	was
O	worse
O	than
O	any
O	that
O	had
O	gone
O	before
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	visited
O	and
O	awakened
O	every
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	not
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	.
O	This
O	lasted
O	for
O	four
O	years
O	,
O	during
O	part
O	of
O	which
O	time
O	Trenck
O	employed
O	himself
O	in
O	writing
O	verses
O	and
O	making
O	drawings
O	on
O	his
O	tin
O	cups
O	,
O	after
O	the
O	manner
O	of
O	all
O	prisoners
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	writing
O	books
O	with
O	his
O	blood
O	,
O	as
O	ink
O	was
O	forbidden
O	.
O	We
O	are
O	again
O	left
O	in
O	ignorance
O	as
O	to
O	how
O	he
O	got
O	paper
O	.
O	He
O	also
O	began
O	to
O	scoop
O	out
O	another
O	hole
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	discovered
O	afresh
O	,
O	though
O	nothing
O	particular
O	seems
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	done
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	partly
O	owing
O	to
O	the
O	kindness
O	of
O	the
O	new
O	governor
O	,
O	who
O	soon
O	afterward
O	died
O	.
O	It
O	had
O	been
O	arranged
O	by
O	his
O	friends
O	that
O	for
O	the
O	space
O	of
O	one
O	year
O	horses
O	should
O	be
O	ready
O	for
O	him
O	at
O	a
O	certain
O	place
O	on
O	the
O	first
O	and
O	fifteenth
O	of
O	every
O	month
O	.
O	Inspired
O	by
O	this
O	thought
O	,
O	he
O	turned
O	to
O	his
O	burrowing
O	with
O	renewed
O	vigor
O	,
O	and
O	worked
O	away
O	at
O	every
O	moment
O	when
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	so
O	unseen
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	reached
O	some
O	distance
O	,
O	he
O	dislodged
O	a
O	large
O	stone
O	which
O	blocked
O	up
O	the
O	opening
O	toward
O	his
O	cell
O	.
O	His
O	terror
O	was
O	frightful
O	.
O	Not
O	only
O	was
O	the
O	air
O	suffocating
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	darkness
O	dreadful
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	if
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	guards
O	were
O	unexpectedly
O	to
O	come
O	into
O	his
O	cell
O	,
O	the
O	opening
O	must
O	be
O	discovered
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	toil
O	again
O	lost
O	.
O	For
O	eight
O	hours
O	he
O	stayed
O	in
O	the
O	tunnel
O	paralyzed
O	by
O	fear
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	roused
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	dint
O	of
O	superhuman
O	struggles
O	managed
O	to
O	open
O	a
O	passage
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	reach
O	his
O	cell
O	,
O	which
O	for
O	once
O	appeared
O	to
O	him
O	as
O	a
O	haven
O	of
O	rest
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	this
O	the
O	war
O	ended
O	with
O	the
O	Peace
O	of
O	Paris
O	(
O	1763
O	)
O	,
O	and
O	Trenck's
O	hopes
O	of
O	release
O	seemed
O	likely
O	to
O	be
O	realized
O	.
O	He
O	procured
O	money
O	from
O	his
O	friends
O	,
O	and
O	bribed
O	the
O	Austrian
O	ambassador
O	in
O	Berlin
O	to
O	open
O	negotiations
O	on
O	his
O	behalf
O	,
O	and
O	while
O	these
O	were
O	impending
O	he
O	rested
O	from
O	his
O	labors
O	for
O	three
O	whole
O	months
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	he
O	was
O	possessed
O	by
O	an
O	idea
O	which
O	was
O	little
O	less
O	than
O	madness
O	.
O	He
O	bribed
O	a
O	major
O	to
O	ask
O	for
O	a
O	visit
O	from
O	Duke
O	Ferdinand
O	of
O	Brunswick
O	,
O	again
O	Governor
O	of
O	Magdeburg
O	,
O	offering
O	to
O	disclose
O	his
O	passage
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	reveal
O	all
O	his
O	plans
O	of
O	escape
O	,
O	on
O	condition
O	that
O	the
O	duke
O	would
O	promise
O	to
O	plead
O	for
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	This
O	message
O	never
O	reached
O	the
O	duke
O	himself
O	,
O	but
O	some
O	officers
O	arrived
O	ostensibly
O	sent
O	by
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	reality
O	tools
O	of
O	the
O	major's
O	.
O	They
O	listened
O	to
O	all
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	all
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	show
O	,
O	then
O	broke
O	their
O	word
O	,
O	filled
O	up
O	the
O	passage
O	,
O	and
O	redoubled
O	the
O	chains
O	and
O	the
O	watch
O	.
O	Notwithstanding
O	this
O	terrible
O	blow
O	,
O	Trenck's
O	trials
O	were
O	drawing
O	to
O	an
O	end
O	.
O	Whether
O	Frederic's
O	heart
O	was
O	softened
O	by
O	his
O	brilliant
O	victories
O	,
O	or
O	whether
O	Trenck's
O	influential
O	friends
O	succeeded
O	in
O	making
O	themselves
O	heard
O	,
O	we
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	,
O	but
O	six
O	months
O	later
O	he
O	was
O	set
O	free
O	,
O	on
O	condition
O	that
O	he
O	never
O	tried
O	to
O	revenge
O	himself
O	on
O	any
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	never
O	again
O	should
O	cross
O	the
O	frontiers
O	of
O	Saxony
O	or

O	A

O	AMONG
O	THE
O	INDIANS
O	,
O	AS
O	TOLD
O	BY
O	HIMSELF
O	By
O	John
O	Tanner
O	The
O	earliest
O	event
O	of
O	my
O	life
O	which
O	I
O	distinctly
O	remember
O	(
O	says
O	John
O	Tanner
O	)
O	is
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	my
O	mother
O	.
O	This
O	happened
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	two
O	years
O	old
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	attending
O	circumstances
O	made
O	so
O	deep
O	an
O	impression
O	that
O	they
O	are
O	still
O	fresh
O	in
O	my
O	memory
O	.
O	I
O	cannot
O	recollect
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	settlement
O	at
O	which
O	we
O	lived
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	have
O	since
O	learned
O	it
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	Kentucky
O	River
O	,
O	at
O	a
O	considerable
O	distance
O	from
O	the
O	Ohio
O	.
O	My
O	father
O	,
O	whose
O	name
O	was
O	John
O	Tanner
O	,
O	was
O	an
O	emigrant
O	from
O	Virginia
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	clergyman
O	.
O	When
O	about
O	to
O	start
O	one
O	morning
O	to
O	a
O	village
O	at
O	some
O	distance
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	appeared
O	,
O	a
O	strict
O	charge
O	to
O	my
O	sisters
O	,
O	Agatha
O	and
O	Lucy
O	,
O	to
O	send
O	me
O	to
O	school;
O	but
O	this
O	they
O	neglected
O	to
O	do
O	until
O	afternoon
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	weather
O	was
O	rainy
O	and
O	unpleasant
O	,
O	I
O	insisted
O	on
O	remaining
O	at
O	home
O	.
O	When
O	my
O	father
O	returned
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	at
O	home
O	all
O	day
O	,
O	he
O	sent
O	me
O	for
O	a
O	parcel
O	of
O	small
O	canes
O	,
O	and
O	flogged
O	me
O	much
O	more
O	severely
O	than
O	I
O	could
O	suppose
O	the
O	offence
O	merited
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	displeased
O	with
O	my
O	sisters
O	for
O	attributing
O	all
O	the
O	blame
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	neglected
O	even
O	to
O	tell
O	me
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	school
O	in
O	the
O	forenoon
O	.
O	From
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	my
O	father's
O	house
O	was
O	less
O	like
O	home
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	often
O	thought
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	"""I"
O	wish
O	I
O	could
O	go
O	and
O	live
O	among
O	the
O	Indians

O	""""
O	One
O	day
O	we
O	went
O	from
O	Cincinnati
O	to
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	Big
O	Miami
O	,
O	opposite
O	which
O	we
O	were
O	to
O	settle
O	.
O	Here
O	was
O	some
O	cleared
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	or
O	two
O	log

O	,
O	but
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	deserted
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	Indians
O	.
O	My
O	father
O	rebuilt
O	the
O	cabins
O	,
O	and
O	inclosed
O	them
O	with
O	a
O	strong
O	picket
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	early
O	in
O	the
O	spring

O	the

O	preparing
O	a
O	field
O	to
O	plant
O	corn
O	.

O	not
O	more
O	than
O	ten
O	days
O	after
O	our
O	arrival

O	the
O	actions

O	Indians
O	lurking
O	about
O	in

O	To
O	prevent

O	my

O	child

O	then
O	not

O	soon

O	confinement

O	began
O	to
O	pinch
O	my
O	little
O	brother

O	My
O	mother
O	at
O	length
O	took

O	by
O	my
O	father
O	and
O	those
O	in
O	the
O	field

O	I
O	had
O	to

O	some
O	precaution

O	After
O	I

O	I
O	had

O	made
O	some
O	resistance
O	,
O	or
O	done
O	something
O	to
O	irritate
O	this

O	took
O	me

O	little
O	to

O	drawing
O	his

O	This

O	Kish-kau-ko
O	presently
O	raised
O	a
O	yell:
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	and
O	four
O	others
O	answered
O	it
O	by
O	a
O	similar
O	yell
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	running
O	up
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	since
O	understood
O	that
O	Kish-kau-ko
O	complained
O	to
O	his
O	father
O	that
O	the
O	short
O	man
O	had
O	made
O	an
O	attempt
O	to
O	kill
O	his
O	little
O	brother
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	called
O	me
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	chief
O	,
O	after
O	reproving
O	the
O	short
O	man
O	,
O	took
O	me
O	by
O	one
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	Kish-kau-ko
O	took
O	me
O	by
O	the
O	other
O	and
O	thus
O	they
O	dragged
O	me
O	between
O	them
O	,
O	the
O	man
O	who
O	threatened
O	to
O	kill
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	was
O	now
O	an
O	object
O	of
O	terror
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	being
O	kept
O	at
O	some
O	distance
O	.
O	I
O	could
O	perceive
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	retarded
O	them
O	somewhat
O	in
O	their
O	retreat
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	apprehensive
O	of
O	being
O	overtaken;
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	were
O	always
O	at
O	some
O	distance
O	from
O	us
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	about
O	one
O	mile
O	from
O	my
O	father's
O	house
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	they
O	threw
O	me
O	into
O	a
O	hickory-bark
O	canoe
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	concealed
O	under
O	the
O	bushes
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	.
O	Into
O	this
O	they
O	all
O	seven
O	jumped
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	crossed
O	the
O	Ohio
O	,
O	landing
O	at
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	Big
O	Miami
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	south
O	side
O	of
O	that
O	river
O	.
O	Here
O	they
O	abandoned
O	their
O	canoe
O	,
O	and
O	stuck
O	their
O	paddles
O	in
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	be
O	seen
O	from
O	the
O	river
O	.
O	At
O	a
O	little
O	distance
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	they
O	had
O	some
O	blankets
O	and
O	provisions
O	concealed;
O	they
O	offered
O	me
O	some
O	dry
O	venison
O	and
O	bear's
O	grease
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	eat
O	.
O	My
O	father's
O	house
O	was
O	plainly
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	from
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	we
O	stood;
O	they
O	pointed
O	at
O	it
O	,
O	looked
O	at
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	laughed
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	have
O	never
O	known
O	what
O	they
O	said
O	.
O	After
O	they
O	had
O	eaten
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	ascend
O	the
O	Miami
O	,
O	dragging
O	me
O	along
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	It
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	early
O	in
O	the
O	spring
O	when
O	we
O	arrived
O	at
O	Sau-ge-nong
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	can
O	remember
O	that
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	leaves
O	were
O	small
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Indians
O	were
O	about
O	planting
O	their
O	corn
O	.
O	They
O	managed
O	to
O	make
O	me
O	assist
O	at
O	their
O	labors
O	,
O	partly
O	by
O	signs
O	,
O	and
O	partly
O	by
O	the
O	few
O	words
O	of
O	English
O	old
O	Manito-o-geezhik
O	could
O	speak
O	.
O	After
O	planting
O	,
O	they
O	all
O	left
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	to
O	hunt
O	and
O	dry
O	meat
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	their
O	hunting-grounds
O	,
O	they
O	chose
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	many
O	deer
O	resorted
O	,
O	and
O	here
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	build
O	a
O	long
O	screen
O	like
O	a
O	fence;
O	this
O	they
O	made
O	of
O	green
O	boughs
O	and
O	small
O	trees
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	built
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	they
O	showed
O	me
O	how
O	to
O	remove
O	the
O	leaves
O	and
O	dry
O	brush
O	from
O	that
O	side
O	of
O	it
O	to
O	which
O	the
O	Indians
O	were
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	shoot
O	the
O	deer
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	labor
O	I
O	was
O	sometimes
O	assisted
O	by
O	the
O	squaws
O	and
O	children
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	other
O	times
O	I
O	was
O	left
O	alone
O	.
O	It
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	warm
O	weather
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	happened
O	one
O	day
O	that
O	,
O	having
O	been
O	left
O	alone
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	tired
O	and
O	thirsty
O	,
O	I
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	I
O	cannot
O	tell
O	how
O	long
O	I
O	slept
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	awake
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	I
O	heard
O	someone
O	crying
O	a
O	great
O	way
O	off
O	.
O	Then
O	I
O	tried
O	to
O	raise
O	up
O	my
O	head
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	.
O	Being
O	now
O	more
O	awake
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	my
O	Indian
O	mother
O	and
O	sister
O	standing
O	by
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	perceived
O	that
O	my
O	face
O	and
O	head
O	were
O	wet
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	woman
O	and
O	her
O	daughter
O	were
O	crying
O	bitterly
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	some
O	time
O	before
O	I
O	perceived
O	that
O	my
O	head
O	was
O	badly
O	cut
O	and
O	bruised
O	.
O	It
O	appears

O	,
O	after
O	I
O	had
O	fallen
O	asleep
O	,
O	Manito-o-geezhik
O	,
O	passing

O	learned
O	to
O	discharge
O	such
O	services
O	as
O	they
O	required
O	of

O	I

O	two
O	years
O	at

O	a
O	great

O	by
O	the
O	British
O	agents
O	at
O	Mackinac
O	.
O	This

O	arrived
O	with
O	plenty
O	of
O	presents
O	.
O	She

O	Mackinac
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	passed
O	in

O	had
O	the
O	direction
O	in
O	all
O	affairs
O	of
O	any
O	moment
O	.
O	She
O	imposed
O	on
O	me
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	year
O	,
O	some
O	tasks
O	.
O	She
O	made
O	me
O	cut
O	wood
O	,
O	bring
O	home
O	game
O	,
O	bring
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	perform
O	other
O	services
O	not
O	commonly
O	required
O	of
O	boys
O	of
O	my
O	age;
O	but
O	she
O	treated
O	me
O	invariably
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	kindness
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	far
O	more
O	happy
O	and
O	content
O	than
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	in
O	the
O	family
O	of
O	Manito-o-geezhik
O	.
O	She
O	sometimes
O	whipped
O	me
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	did
O	her
O	own
O	children:
O	but
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	severely
O	and
O	frequently
O	beaten
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	before
O	.
O	Early
O	in
O	the
O	spring
O	,
O	Net-no-kwa
O	and
O	her
O	husband
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	family
O	,
O	started
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	Mackinac
O	.
O	They
O	left
O	me
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	done
O	before
O	,
O	at
O	Point
O	St

O	,
O	as
O	they
O	would
O	not

O	the
O	risk
O	of
O	losing
O	me
O	by
O	suffering
O	me
O	to
O	be

O	at
O	Mackinac
O	.
O	On
O	our
O	return

O	had
O	gone
O	twenty-five
O	or
O	thirty
O	miles
O	from
O	Point
O	St

O	Ignace
O	,
O	we

O	into
O	the
O	lake
O	.
O	Here
O	we
O	encamped
O	with
O	some
O	other
O	Indians
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	party
O	of
O	traders
O	.
O	Pigeons
O	were

O	of

O	,
O	and

O	,
O	were

O	I
O	had

O	indeed
O	,
O	had
O	never

O	my
O	life
O	discharged
O	a
O	gun
O	.
O	My
O	mother
O	had
O	purchased
O	at
O	Mackinac
O	a
O	keg

O	Taw-ga-we-ninne

O	before
O	I
O	met
O	with
O	pigeons
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	alighted
O	in
O	the
O	bushes
O	very

O	I
O	cocked
O	my

O	,
O	bringing
O	the

O	almost
O	in

O	Having
O	brought
O	the
O	sight
O	to
O	bear
O	upon
O	the
O	pigeon
O	,
O	I
O	pulled
O	trigger
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	next
O	instant
O	sensible
O	of
O	a
O	humming
O	noise

O	under
O	the
O	tree
O	on
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	sitting
O	.
O	My
O	face
O	was
O	much
O	bruised
O	,
O	and
O	covered
O	with
O	blood
O	.
O	I
O	ran
O	home
O	,
O	carrying
O	my
O	pigeon
O	in
O	triumph
O	.
O	My
O	face
O	was
O	speedily
O	bound
O	up;
O	my
O	pistol
O	exchanged
O	for
O	a
O	fowling-piece;
O	I
O	was
O	accoutred
O	with
O	a
O	powder-horn
O	,
O	and
O	furnished
O	with
O	shot
O	,
O	and
O	allowed
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	after
O	birds
O	.
O	One
O	of

O	went
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	to
O	observe
O	my

O	without

O	.
O	Henceforth
O	I
O	began

O	,
O	that

O	Game
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	scarce
O	,

O	we
O	all

O	The

O	on

O	intended

O	were
O	then

O	she
O	had
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	,
O	seen
O	a
O	smoke
O	rising
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	confident
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	place
O	she
O	had
O	indicated
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	watched
O	long
O	,
O	expecting
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	smoke;
O	but
O	,
O	wearied
O	at
O	length
O	with
O	waiting
O	,
O	I
O	walked
O	a
O	few
O	paces
O	into
O	the
O	open
O	place
O	,
O	resembling
O	a
O	path
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	unexpectedly
O	fell
O	up
O	to
O	my
O	middle
O	in
O	the
O	snow
O	,
O	I
O	extricated
O	myself
O	without
O	difficulty
O	,
O	and
O	walked
O	on;
O	but
O	,
O	remembering
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	heard
O	the
O	Indians
O	speak
O	of
O	killing
O	bears
O	in
O	their
O	holes
O	,
O	it
O	occurred
O	to
O	me
O	that
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	a
O	bear's
O	hole
O	into
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	fallen
O	and
O	,
O	looking
O	down
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	a
O	bear
O	lying
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	hole
O	.
O	I
O	placed
O	the
O	muzzle
O	of
O	my
O	gun
O	nearly
O	between
O	his
O	eyes
O	and
O	discharged
O	it
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	smoke
O	cleared
O	away
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	stick
O	and
O	thrust
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	eyes
O	and
O	into
O	the
O	wound
O	in
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	bear
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	being
O	satisfied
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	dead
O	,
O	I
O	endeavored
O	to
O	lift
O	him
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	hole;
O	but
O	being
O	unable
O	to
O	do
O	this
O	,
O	I
O	returned
O	home
O	,
O	following
O	the
O	track
O	I
O	had
O	made
O	in
O	coming

O	One
O	winter
O	I
O	hunted
O	for
O	a
O	trader
O	called
O	by
O	the
O	Indians
O	Aneeb
O	,
O	which
O	means
O	an
O	elm
O	tree
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	winter
O	advanced
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	weather
O	became
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	cold
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	it
O	difficult
O	to
O	procure
O	as
O	much
O	game
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	in
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	supplying
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	was
O	wanted
O	by
O	the
O	trader
O	.
O	Early
O	one
O	morning
O	,
O	about
O	mid-winter
O	,
O	I
O	started
O	an
O	elk
O	.
O	I
O	pursued
O	until
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	almost
O	overtaken
O	him;
O	but
O	hope
O	and
O	strength
O	failed
O	me
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	.
O	What
O	clothing
O	I
O	had
O	on
O	me
O	,
O	notwithstanding
O	the
O	extreme
O	coldness
O	of
O	the
O	weather
O	,
O	was
O	drenched
O	with
O	sweat
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	after
O	I
O	turned
O	toward
O	home
O	that
O	I
O	felt
O	it
O	stiffening
O	about
O	me
O	.
O	My
O	leggings
O	were
O	of
O	cloth
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	torn
O	in
O	pieces
O	in
O	running
O	through
O	the
O	bush
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	conscious
O	I
O	was
O	somewhat
O	frozen
O	before
O	I
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	our
O	lodge
O	standing
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	now
O	midnight
O	.
O	I
O	knew
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	old
O	woman's
O	intention
O	to
O	move
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	knew
O	where
O	she
O	would
O	go;
O	but
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	informed
O	she
O	would
O	go
O	on
O	that
O	day
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	followed
O	on
O	their
O	path
O	,
O	I
O	soon
O	ceased
O	to
O	suffer
O	from
O	cold
O	,
O	and
O	felt
O	that
O	sleepy
O	sensation
O	which
O	I
O	knew
O	preceded
O	the
O	last
O	stage
O	of
O	weakness
O	in
O	such
O	as
O	die
O	of
O	cold
O	.
O	I
O	redoubled
O	my
O	efforts
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	an
O	entire
O	consciousness
O	of
O	the
O	danger
O	of
O	my
O	situation;
O	it
O	was
O	with
O	no
O	small
O	difficulty
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	prevent
O	myself
O	from
O	lying
O	down
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	I
O	lost
O	all
O	consciousness
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	how
O	long
O	I
O	cannot
O	tell
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	awaking
O	as
O	from
O	a
O	dream
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	walking
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	in
O	a
O	small
O	circle
O	not
O	more
O	than
O	twenty
O	or
O	twenty-five
O	yards
O	over
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	return
O	of
O	my
O	senses
O	,
O	I
O	looked
O	about
O	to
O	try
O	to
O	discover
O	my
O	path
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	missed
O	it;
O	but
O	,
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	looking
O	,
O	I
O	discovered
O	a
O	light
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	I
O	directed
O	my
O	course
O	.
O	Once
O	more
O	,
O	before
O	I
O	reached
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	I
O	lost
O	my
O	senses;
O	but
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	fall
O	down;
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	never
O	have
O	gotten
O	up
O	again;
O	but
O	I
O	ran
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	in
O	a
O	circle
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	at
O	last
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	I
O	immediately
O	fell
O	down
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	lose
O	myself
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	I
O	can
O	remember
O	seeing
O	the
O	thick
O	and
O	sparkling
O	coat
O	of
O	frost
O	on
O	the
O	inside
O	of
O	the
O	pukkwi
O	lodge
O	,
O	and
O	hearing
O	my
O	mother
O	say
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	kept
O	a
O	large
O	fire
O	in
O	expectation
O	of
O	my
O	arrival;
O	and
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	thought
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	so
O	long
O	gone
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	known
O	long
O	before
O	night
O	of
O	her
O	having
O	moved
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	month
O	before
O	I
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	again
O	,
O	my
O	face
O	,
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	legs
O	having
O	been
O	much
O	frozen
O	.
O	After
O	many
O	dangerous
O	and
O	disagreeable
O	experiences
O	,
O	John
O	Tanner
O	,
O	when
O	almost
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	whites
O	to
O	tell
O	his
O	history
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	write
O	,
O	was
O	taken
O	down
O	at
O	his
O	dictation
O	.
