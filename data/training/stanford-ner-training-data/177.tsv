O	I

O	me
O	that

O	Accordingly
O	I
O	took
O	my

O	times
O	was
O	altogether
O	ungovernable
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	his
O	language
O	was
O	terrible
O	.
O	In
O	these
O	fits
O	of
O	passion
O	,
O	if
O	a
O	door
O	stood
O	in
O	his
O	way
O	he
O	would
O	never
O	do
O	less
O	than
O	kick
O	a
O	panel
O	through
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	sometimes
O	throw
O	his
O	heels
O	over
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	come
O	down
O	on
O	his
O	feet
O	,
O	uttering
O	oaths
O	in
O	a
O	circle
O	.
O	And
O	thus
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	rage
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	who
O	performed
O	a
O	somerset
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	what
O	others
O	have
O	since
O	learned
O	to
O	do
O	for
O	merriment
O	and
O	money
O	.
O	Once
O	Rugg
O	was
O	seen
O	to
O	bite
O	a
O	tenpenny
O	nail
O	in
O	halves

O	those
O	days
O	everybody
O	,
O	both
O	men
O	and
O	boys
O	,
O	wore
O	wigs;
O	and
O	Peter
O	,
O	at
O	these
O	moments
O	of
O	violent
O	passion
O	,
O	would
O	become
O	so
O	profane
O	that
O	his
O	wig
O	would
O	rise
O	up
O	from
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	Some
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	terrible
O	language;
O	others
O	accounted
O	for
O	it
O	in
O	a
O	more
O	philosophical
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	caused
O	by
O	the
O	expansion
O	of
O	his
O	scalp
O	,
O	as
O	violent

O	know
O	,
O	will
O	swell

O	While
O	these

O	were
O	on
O	him
O	,
O	Rugg

O	no

O	for
O	heaven

O	earth

O	Except
O	this
O	infirmity
O	,

O	his
O	high-spirited

O	the

O	Peter

O	would
O	fancy
O	she
O	heard
O	the
O	crack
O	of
O	a
O	whip
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fleet
O	tread
O	of
O	a
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rattling
O	of
O	a
O	carriage
O	,
O	passing
O	her
O	door
O	.
O	The
O	neighbours
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	heard
O	the
O	same
O	noises
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	said
O	they
O	knew
O	it
O	was
O	Rugg
O	'
O	s
O	horse;
O	the
O	tread
O	on
O	the
O	pavement
O	was
O	perfectly
O	familiar
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	This
O	occurred
O	so
O	repeatedly
O	that
O	at
O	length
O	the
O	neighbours
O	watched
O	with
O	lanterns
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	real
O	Peter
O	Rugg
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	horse
O	and
O	chair
O	,
O	and
O	child
O	sitting
O	beside
O	him
O	,
O	pass
O	directly
O	before
O	his
O	own
O	door
O	,
O	his
O	head
O	turning
O	toward
O	his
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	himself
O	making
O	every
O	effort
O	to
O	stop
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	the
O	friends
O	of
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Rugg
O	exerted
O	themselves
O	to
O	find
O	her
O	husband
O	and
O	child
O	.
O	They
O	inquired
O	at
O	every
O	public
O	house
O	and
O	stable
O	in
O	town;
O	but
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	that
O	Rugg
O	made
O	any
O	stay
O	in
O	Boston
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	,
O	after
O	Rugg
O	had
O	passed
O	his
O	own
O	door
O	,
O	could
O	give
O	any
O	account
O	of
O	him;
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	asserted
O	by
O	some
O	that
O	the
O	clatter
O	of
O	Rugg
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	and
O	carriage
O	over
O	the
O	pavements
O	shook
O	the
O	houses
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	street
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	is
O	credible
O	,
O	if
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	Rugg
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	and
O	carriage
O	did
O	pass
O	on
O	that
O	night
O	.
O	For
O	at
O	this
O	day
O	,
O	in
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	streets
O	,
O	a
O	loaded
O	truck
O	or
O	team
O	in
O	passing
O	will
O	shake
O	the
O	houses
O	like
O	an
O	earthquake
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	Rugg
O	'
O	s
O	neighbours
O	never
O	afterward
O	watched
O	again;
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	treated
O	it
O	all
O	as
O	a
O	delusion
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	no
O	more
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	Others
O	,
O	of
O	a
O	different
O	opinion
O	,
O	shook
O	their
O	heads
O	and
O	said
O	nothing
O	.
O	Thus
O	Rugg
O	and
O	his
O	child
O	,
O	horse
O	and
O	chair
O	,
O	were
O	soon
O	forgotten;
O	and
O	probably
O	many
O	in
O	the
O	neighbourhood
O	never
O	heard
O	a
O	word
O	on
O	the
O	subject
O	.

O	There

O	through
O	the

O	to
O	make
O	further

O	inquired
O	,

O	Little

O	to
O	beg

O	alms
O	.
O	Little
O	Two
O	Eyes

O	them
O	,

O	,
O	looking
O	earnestly
O	in

O	were
O	obliged
O	to
O	beg
O	their
O	bread
O	from
O	door
O	to
O	door
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	good
O	sister
O	received

O	most
O	kindly
O	,

O	all

O	indeed

O	so
O	badly
