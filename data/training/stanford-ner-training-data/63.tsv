O	Some
O	years
O	before
O	my
O	beard
O	announced
O	approaching
O	manhood
O	,
O	or
O	,
O	in
O	other
O	words
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	neither
O	man
O	nor
O	boy
O	,
O	but
O	between
O	both
O	,
O	I
O	expressed
O	in
O	repeated
O	conversations
O	a
O	strong
O	desire
O	of
O	seeing
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	from
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	discouraged
O	by
O	my
O	parents
O	,
O	though
O	my
O	father
O	had
O	been
O	no
O	inconsiderable
O	traveller
O	himself
O	.
O	A
O	cousin
O	by
O	my
O	mother's
O	side
O	took
O	a
O	liking
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	often
O	said
O	I
O	was
O	a
O	fine
O	forward
O	youth
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	much
O	inclined
O	to
O	gratify
O	my
O	curiosity
O	.
O	His
O	eloquence
O	had
O	more
O	effect
O	than
O	mine
O	,
O	for
O	my
O	father
O	consented
O	to
O	my
O	accompanying
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	voyage
O	to
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	Ceylon
O	,
O	where
O	his
O	uncle
O	had
O	resided
O	as
O	governor
O	many
O	years
O	.
O	We
O	sailed
O	from
O	Amsterdam
O	with
O	despatches
O	from
O	their
O	High
O	Mightinesses
O	the
O	States
O	of
O	Holland
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	about
O	six
O	weeks
O	we
O	arrived
O	at
O	Ceylon
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	were
O	received
O	with
O	great
O	marks
O	of
O	friendship
O	and
O	true
O	politeness
O	.
O	After
O	we
O	had
O	resided
O	at
O	Ceylon
O	about
O	a
O	fortnight
O	I
O	accompanied
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	governor's
O	brothers
O	upon
O	a
O	shooting
O	party
O	.
O	Near
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	a
O	large
O	piece
O	of
O	water
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	engaged
O	my
O	attention
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	rustling
O	noise
O	behind;
O	on
O	turning
O	about
O	I
O	was
O	almost
O	petrified
O	(
O	as
O	who
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	?
O	)
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	a
O	lion
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	evidently
O	approaching
O	with
O	the
O	intention
O	of
O	satisfying
O	his
O	appetite
O	with
O	my
O	poor
O	carcass
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	without
O	asking
O	my
O	consent
O	.
O	What
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	in
O	this
O	horrible
O	dilemma
O	?
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	even
O	a
O	moment
O	for
O	reflection;
O	my
O	piece
O	was
O	only
O	charged
O	with
O	swan-shot
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	other
O	about
O	me
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	though
O	I
O	could
O	have
O	no
O	idea
O	of
O	killing
O	such
O	an
O	animal
O	with
O	that
O	weak
O	kind
O	of
O	ammunition
O	,
O	yet
O	I
O	had
O	some
O	hopes
O	of
O	frightening
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	report
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	of
O	wounding
O	him
O	also
O	.
O	I
O	immediately
O	let
O	fly
O	,
O	without
O	waiting
O	till
O	he
O	was
O	within
O	reach;
O	and
O	the
O	report
O	did
O	but
O	enrage
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	now
O	quickened
O	his
O	pace
O	and
O	seemed
O	to
O	approach
O	me
O	full
O	speed
O	.
O	I
O	attempted
O	to
O	escape
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	only
O	added
O	(
O	if
O	an
O	addition
O	could
O	be
O	made
O	)
O	to
O	my
O	distress;
O	for
O	the
O	moment
O	I
O	turned
O	about
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	large
O	crocodile
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	mouth
O	extended
O	almost
O	ready
O	to
O	receive
O	me
O	.
O	On
O	my
O	right
O	hand
O	was
O	the
O	piece
O	of
O	water
O	before
O	mentioned
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	my
O	left
O	a
O	deep
O	precipice
O	,
O	said
O	to
O	have
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	since
O	learned
O	,
O	a
O	receptacle
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	for
O	venomous
O	creatures;
O	in
O	short
O	,
O	I
O	gave
O	myself
O	up
O	as
O	lost
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	lion
O	was
O	now
O	upon
O	his
O	hind
O	legs
O	,
O	just
O	in
O	the
O	act
O	of
O	seizing
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	fell
O	involuntarily
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	with
O	fear
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	afterward
O	appeared
O	,
O	he
O	sprang
O	over
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	lay
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	a
O	situation
O	which
O	no
O	language
O	can
O	describe
O	,
O	expecting
O	to
O	feel
O	his
O	teeth
O	or
O	talons
O	in
O	some
O	part
O	of
O	me
O	every
O	moment
O	.
O	After
O	waiting
O	in
O	this
O	prostrate
O	situation
O	a
O	few
O	seconds
O	,
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	violent
O	but
O	unusual
O	noise
O	,
O	differing
O	from
O	any
O	sound
O	that
O	had
O	ever
O	before
O	assailed
O	my
O	ears;
O	nor
O	is
O	it
O	at
O	all
O	to
O	be
O	wondered
O	at
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	inform
O	you
O	from
O	whence
O	it
O	proceeded
O	.
O	After
O	listening
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	I
O	ventured
O	to
O	raise
O	my
O	head
O	and
O	look
O	round
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	to
O	my
O	unspeakable
O	joy
O	,
O	I
O	perceived
O	the
O	lion
O	had
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	eagerness
O	with
O	which
O	he
O	sprang
O	at
O	me
O	,
O	jumped
O	forward
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	fell
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	crocodile's
O	mouth
O	!
O	which
O	,
O	as
O	before
O	observed
O	,
O	was
O	wide
O	open;
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	one
O	stuck
O	in
O	the
O	throat
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	struggling
O	to
O	extricate
O	themselves
O	.
O	I
O	fortunately
O	recollected
O	my
O	hunting
O	knife
O	which
O	was
O	by
O	my
O	side;
O	with
O	this
O	instrument
O	I
O	severed
O	the
O	lion's
O	head
O	at
O	one
O	blow
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	body
O	fell
O	at
O	my
O	feet
O	!
O	I
O	then
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	butt-end
O	of
O	my
O	fowling-piece
O	,
O	rammed
O	the
O	head
O	farther
O	into
O	the
O	throat
O	of
O	the
O	crocodile
O	,
O	and
O	destroyed
O	him
O	,
O	by
O	suffocation
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	could
O	neither
O	gorge
O	nor
O	eject
O	it
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	I
O	had
O	thus
O	gained
O	a
O	complete
O	victory
O	over
O	my
O	two
O	powerful
O	adversaries
O	,
O	my
O	companion
O	arrived
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	me;
O	for
O	finding
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	follow
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	,
O	apprehending
O	I
O	had
O	lost
O	my
O	way
O	or
O	met
O	with
O	some
O	accident
O	.
O	After
O	mutual
O	congratulations
O	we
O	measured
O	the
O	crocodile
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	just
O	forty
O	feet
O	in
O	length
O	.
O	CROSSING
O	THE
O	THAMES
O	WITHOUT
O	THE
O	AID
O	OF
O	BRIDGE
O	,
O	BOAT
O	OR
O	BALLOON
O	By
O	R
O	.
O	E
O	.
O	Raspe
O	My
O	first
O	visit
O	to
O	England
O	was
O	about
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	George
O	the
O	Third's
O	reign
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	occasion
O	to
O	go
O	down
O	to
O	Wapping
O	to
O	see
O	some
O	goods
O	shipped
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	sending
O	to
O	some
O	friends
O	at
O	Hamburgh:
O	after
O	that
O	business
O	was
O	over
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	the
O	Tower
O	Wharf
O	in
O	my
O	way
O	back
O	.
O	Here
O	I
O	found
O	the
O	sun
O	very
O	powerful
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	fatigued
O	that
O	I
O	stepped
O	into
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	cannon
O	to
O	compose
O	me
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	fell
O	fast
O	asleep
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	about
O	noon;
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	fourth
O	of
O	June
O	,
O	the
O	king's
O	birthday
O	.
O	Exactly
O	at
O	one
O	o'clock
O	these
O	cannon
O	were
O	all
O	discharged
O	in
O	memory
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	all
O	charged
O	that
O	morning
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	no
O	suspicion
O	of
O	my
O	situation
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	shot
O	over
O	the
O	houses
O	on
O	the
O	opposite
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	into
O	a
O	farmer's
O	yard
O	,
O	between
O	Bermondsey
O	and
O	Deptford
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	fell
O	upon
O	a
O	large
O	haystack
O	without
O	waking
O	,
O	and
O	continued
O	there
O	in
O	a
O	sound
O	sleep
O	till
O	hay
O	became
O	so
O	extravagantly
O	dear
O	(
O	which
O	was
O	about
O	three
O	months
O	after
O	)
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	farmer
O	found
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	interest
O	to
O	send
O	his
O	whole
O	stock
O	to
O	market
O	.
O	The
O	stack
O	I
O	was
O	reposing
O	on
O	was
O	the
O	largest
O	in
O	the
O	yard
O	,
O	containing
O	about
O	five
O	hundred
O	load;
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	cut
O	that
O	first
O	.
O	I
O	waked
O	(
O	with
O	the
O	voices
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	who
O	had
O	ascended
O	the
O	ladders
O	to
O	begin
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	)
O	and
O	got
O	up
O	,
O	totally
O	ignorant
O	of
O	my
O	situation
O	.
O	In
O	attempting
O	to
O	run
O	away
O	,
O	I
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	farmer
O	to
O	whom
O	the
O	hay
O	belonged
O	,
O	and
O	broke
O	his
O	neck
O	,
O	yet
O	received
O	no
O	injury
O	myself
O	!
O	I
O	afterwards
O	found
O	,
O	to
O	my
O	great
O	consolation
O	,
O	that
O	this
O	fellow
O	was
O	a
O	most
O	detestable
O	character
O	,
O	always
O	keeping
O	the
O	produce
O	of
O	his
O	grounds
O	for
O	extravagant
O	markets
O	.
