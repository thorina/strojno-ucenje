O	Long
O	years
O	ago
O	,
O	there
O	ruled
O	over
O	Britain
O	a
O	King
O	called
O	Uther
O	Pendragon
O	.
O	A
O	mighty
O	prince
O	was
O	he
O	,
O	and
O	feared
O	by
O	all
O	men;
O	yet
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	sought
O	the
O	love
O	of
O	the
O	fair
O	Igraine
O	of
O	Cornwall
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	naught
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	from
O	grief
O	and
O	disappointment
O	,
O	Uther
O	fell
O	sick
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	seemed
O	like
O	to
O	die
O	.
O	Now
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	,
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	famous
O	magician
O	named
O	Merlin
O	,
O	so
O	powerful
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	change
O	his
O	form
O	at
O	will
O	,
O	or
O	even
O	make
O	himself
O	invisible;
O	nor
O	was
O	there
O	any
O	place
O	so
O	remote
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	reach
O	it
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	merely
O	by
O	wishing
O	himself
O	there
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	,
O	suddenly
O	he
O	stood
O	at
O	Uther's
O	bedside
O	,
O	and
O	said:
O	"""Sir"
O	King
O	,
O	I
O	know
O	thy

O	am

O	help
O	thee
O	.
O	Only
O	promise
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	,
O	at
O	his
O	birth
O	,
O	the
O	son
O	that
O	shall
O	be
O	born
O	to
O	thee
O	,
O	and
O	thou
O	shalt
O	have
O	thy
O	heart's
O	desire
O	.
O	""""
O	To
O	this
O	the
O	King
O	agreed
O	joyfully
O	,
O	and
O	Merlin
O	kept
O	his
O	word:
O	for
O	he
O	gave
O	Uther
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	one
O	whom
O	Igraine
O	had
O	loved
O	dearly
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	she
O	took
O	him
O	willingly
O	for
O	her
O	husband
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	time
O	had
O	come
O	that
O	a
O	child
O	should
O	be
O	born
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	Queen
O	,
O	Merlin
O	appeared
O	before
O	Uther
O	to
O	remind
O	him
O	of
O	his
O	promise;
O	and
O	Uther
O	swore
O	it
O	should
O	be
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	said
O	.
O	Three
O	days
O	later
O	,
O	a
O	prince
O	was
O	born
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	pomp
O	and
O	ceremony
O	,
O	was
O	christened
O	by
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Arthur;
O	but
O	immediately
O	thereafter
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	commanded
O	that
O	the
O	child
O	should

O	carried
O	to
O	the
O	postern-gate
O	,
O	there
O	to

O	to
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	who
O	would
O	be
O	found
O	waiting
O	without

O	Not
O	long
O	after
O	,
O	Uther
O	fell
O	sick
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	his
O	end

O	come;
O	so
O	,
O	by
O	Merlin's
O	advice;
O	he
O	called
O	together
O	his
O	knights
O	and
O	barons
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	them:
O	"""My"

O	King
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	strengthening

O	people
O	a
O	great
O	shout:
O	"""Arthur"
O	is
O	King
O	!
O	Arthur
O	is
O	King
O	!
O	We
O	will
O	have
O	no
O	King
O	but
O	"Arthur"";"
O	and
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	great
O	barons
O	scowled
O	and
O	threatened
O	,
O	they
O	fell
O	on
O	their
O	knees
O	before
O	him
O	while
O	the
O	Archbishop
O	placed
O	the
O	crown
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	swore
O	to
O	obey
O	him
O	faithfully
O	as
O	their
O	lord
O	and
O	sovereign
O	.
O	Thus
O	Arthur
O	was
O	made
O	King;
O	and
O	to
O	all
O	he
O	did
O	justice
O	,
O	righting
O	wrongs
O	and
O	giving
O	to
O	all
O	their
O	dues
O	.
O	Nor
O	was
O	he
O	forgetful
O	of
O	those
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	his
O	friends;
O	for
O	Kay
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	loved
O	as
O	a
O	brother
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	Seneschal
O	and
O	chief
O	of
O	his
O	household
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	Sir
O	Ector
O	,
O	his
O	foster
O	father
O	,
O	he
O	gave
O	broad
O	lands
O	.
O	Thus
O	Arthur
O	was
O	made
O	King
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	fight
O	for
O	his
O	own;
O	for
O	eleven
O	great
O	kings
O	drew
O	together
O	and
O	refused
O	to
O	acknowledge
O	him
O	as
O	their
O	lord
O	,
O	and
O	chief
O	amongst
O	the
O	rebels
O	was
O	King
O	Lot
O	of
O	Orknev
O	who
O	had
O	married
O	Arthur's
O	sister
O	,
O	Bellicent
O	.
O	By
O	Merlin's
O	advice
O	,
O	Arthur
O	sent
O	for
O	help
O	overseas
O	,
O	to
O	Ban
O	and
O	Bors
O	,
O	the
O	two
O	great
O	Kings
O	who
O	ruled
O	in
O	Gaul
O	.
O	With
O	their
O	aid
O	,
O	he
O	overthrew
O	his
O	foes
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	battle
O	near
O	the
O	river
O	Trent;
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	passed
O	with
O	them
O	into
O	their
O	own
O	lands
O	and
O	helped
O	them
O	drive
O	out
O	their
O	enemies
O	.
O	So
O	there
O	was
O	ever
O	great
O	friendship
O	between
O	Arthur
O	and
O	the
O	Kings
O	Ban
O	and
O	Bors
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	their
O	kindred;
O	and
O	afterward
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	famous
O	Knights
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	were
O	of
O	that
O	kin
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Arthur
O	set
O	himself
O	to
O	restore
O	order
O	throughout
O	his
O	kingdom
O	.
O	To
O	all
O	who
O	would
O	submit
O	and
O	amend
O	their
O	evil
O	ways
O	,
O	he
O	showed
O	kindness;
O	but
O	those
O	who
O	persisted
O	in
O	oppression
O	and
O	wrong
O	he
O	removed
O	,
O	putting
O	in
O	their
O	places
O	others
O	who
O	would
O	deal
O	justly
O	with
O	the
O	people
O	.
O	And
O	because
O	the
O	land
O	had
O	become
O	overrun
O	with
O	forest
O	during
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	misrule
O	,
O	he
O	cut
O	roads
O	through
O	the
O	thickets
O	,
O	that
O	no
O	longer
O	wild
O	beasts
O	and
O	men
O	,
O	fiercer
O	than
O	the
O	beasts
O	,
O	should
O	lurk
O	in
O	their
O	gloom
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	harm
O	of
O	the
O	weak
O	and
O	defenceless
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	soon
O	the
O	peasant
O	ploughed
O	his
O	fields
O	in
O	safety
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	had
O	been
O	wastes
O	,
O	men
O	dwelt
O	again
O	in
O	peace
O	and
O	prosperity
O	.
O	Amongst
O	the
O	lesser
O	Kings
O	whom
O	Arthur
O	helped
O	to
O	rebuild
O	their
O	towns
O	and
O	restore
O	order
O	,
O	was
O	King
O	Leodegrance
O	of
O	Cameliard
O	.
O	Now
O	Leodegrance
O	had
O	one
O	fair
O	child
O	,
O	his
O	daughter
O	Guenevere;
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	time
O	that
O	first
O	he
O	saw
O	her
O	,
O	Arthur
O	gave
O	her
O	all
O	his
O	love
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	sought
O	counsel
O	of
O	Merlin
O	,
O	his
O	chief
O	adviser
O	.
O	Merlin
O	heard
O	the
O	King
O	sorrowfully
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	said:
O	"""Sir"
O	King
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	man's
O	heart
O	is
O	set
O	,
O	he
O	may
O	not
O	change
O	.
O	Yet
O	had
O	it
O	been
O	well
O	if
O	ye
O	had
O	loved
O	another
O	.
O	""""
O	So
O	the
O	King
O	sent
O	his
O	knights
O	to
O	Leodegrance
O	,
O	to
O	ask
O	of
O	him
O	his
O	daughter;
O	and
O	Leodegrance
O	consented
O	,
O	rejoicing
O	to
O	wed
O	her
O	to
O	so
O	good
O	and
O	knightly
O	a
O	King
O	.
O	With
O	great
O	pomp
O	,
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	conducted
O	to
O	Canterbury
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	the
O	King
O	met
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	two
O	were
O	wed
O	by
O	the
O	Archbishop
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	Cathedral
O	,
O	amid
O	the
O	rejoicings
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	.
O	On
O	that
O	same
O	day
O	did
O	Arthur
O	found
O	his
O	Order
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	,
O	the
O	fame
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	to
O	spread
O	throughout
O	Christendom
O	and
O	endure
O	through
O	all
O	time
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	had
O	been
O	made
O	for
O	King
O	Uther
O	Pendragon
O	by
O	Merlin
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	meant
O	thereby
O	to
O	set
O	forth
O	plainly
O	to
O	all
O	men
O	the
O	roundness
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	After
O	Uther
O	died
O	,
O	King
O	Leodegrance
O	had
O	possessed
O	it;
O	but
O	when
O	Arthur
O	was
O	wed
O	,
O	he
O	sent
O	it
O	to
O	him
O	as
O	a
O	gift
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	was
O	the
O	King's
O	joy
O	at
O	receiving
O	it
O	.
O	One
O	hundred
O	and
O	fifty
O	knights
O	might
O	take
O	their
O	places
O	about
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	them
O	Merlin
O	made
O	sieges
O	,
O	or
O	seats
O	.
O	One
O	hundred
O	and
O	twenty-eight
O	did
O	Arthur
O	knight
O	at
O	that
O	great
O	feast;
O	thereafter
O	,
O	if
O	any
O	sieges
O	were
O	empty
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	high
O	festival
O	of
O	Pentecost
O	new
O	knights
O	were
O	ordained
O	to
O	fill
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	magic
O	was
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	each
O	knight
O	found
O	inscribed
O	,
O	in
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	proper
O	siege
O	.
O	One
O	seat
O	only
O	long
O	remained
O	unoccupied
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	was
O	the
O	Siege
O	Perilous
O	.
O	No
O	knight
O	might
O	occupy
O	it
O	until
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	Sir
O	Galahad;
O	for
O	,
O	without
O	danger
O	to
O	his
O	life
O	,
O	none
O	might
O	sit
O	there
O	who
O	was
O	not
O	free
O	from
O	all
O	stain
O	of
O	sin
O	.
O	With
O	pomp
O	and
O	ceremony
O	did
O	each
O	knight
O	take
O	upon
O	him
O	the
O	vows
O	of
O	true
O	knighthood:
O	to
O	obey
O	the
O	King;
O	to
O	show
O	mercy
O	to
O	all
O	who
O	asked
O	it;
O	to
O	defend
O	the
O	weak;
O	and
O	for
O	no
O	worldly
O	gain
O	to
O	fight
O	in
O	a
O	wrongful
O	cause:
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	rejoiced
O	together
O	,
O	doing
O	honour
O	to
O	Arthur
O	and
O	to
O	his
O	Queen
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	rode
O	forth
O	to
O	right
O	the
O	wrong
O	and
O	help
O	the
O	oppressed
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	their
O	aid
O	the
O	King
O	held
O	his
O	realm
O	in
O	peace
O	,
O	doing
O	justice
O	to
O	all
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	as
O	time
O	passed
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	gathered
O	into
O	his
O	Order
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	knights
O	whose
O	peers
O	shall
O	never
O	be
O	found
O	in
O	any
O	age;
O	and
O	foremost
O	amongst
O	them
O	all
O	was
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	du
O	Lac
O	.
O	Such
O	was
O	his
O	strength
O	that
O	none
O	against
O	whom
O	he
O	laid
O	lance
O	in
O	rest
O	could
O	keep
O	the
O	saddle
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	shield
O	was
O	proof
O	against
O	his
O	sword
O	dint;
O	but
O	for
O	his
O	courtesy
O	even
O	more
O	than
O	for
O	his
O	courage
O	and
O	strength
O	,
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	was
O	famed
O	far
O	and
O	near
O	.
O	Gentle
O	he
O	was
O	and
O	ever
O	the
O	first
O	to
O	rejoice
O	in
O	the
O	renown
O	of
O	another;
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	jousts
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	avoid
O	encounter
O	with
O	the
O	young
O	and
O	untried
O	knight
O	,
O	letting
O	him
O	pass
O	to
O	gain
O	glory
O	if
O	he
O	might
O	.
O	It
O	would
O	take
O	a
O	great
O	book
O	to
O	record
O	all
O	the
O	famous
O	deeds
O	of
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	adventures
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	of
O	Gaul
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	King
O	Ban
O	,
O	ruled
O	over
O	Benwick;
O	he
O	was
O	named
O	Launcelot
O	du
O	Lac
O	by
O	the
O	Lady
O	of
O	the
O	Lake
O	who
O	reared
O	him
O	when
O	his
O	mother
O	died
O	.
O	Early
O	he
O	won
O	renown;
O	then
O	,
O	when
O	there
O	was
O	peace
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	land
O	,
O	he
O	passed
O	into
O	Britain
O	,
O	to
O	Arthur's
O	Court
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	King
O	received
O	him
O	gladly
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	him
O	Knight
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	trustiest
O	friend
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	Guenevere
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	brought
O	to
O	Canterbury
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	married
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	Launcelot
O	was
O	chief
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	sent
O	to
O	wait
O	upon
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	this
O	came
O	the
O	sorrow
O	of
O	later
O	days
O	.
O	For
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	moment
O	he
O	saw
O	her
O	,
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	loved
O	Guenevere
O	,
O	for
O	her
O	sake
O	remaining
O	wifeless
O	all
O	his
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	all
O	things
O	being
O	her
O	faithful
O	knight
O	.
O	But
O	busy-bodies
O	and
O	mischief-
O	makers
O	spoke
O	evil
O	of
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	and
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	their
O	talk
O	came
O	the
O	undoing
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	the
O	downfall
O	of
O	his
O	great
O	work
O	.
O	But
O	that
O	was
O	after
O	long
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	many
O	true
O	knights
O	had
O	lived
O	their
O	lives
O	,
O	honouring
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	Queen
O	,
O	and
O	doing
O	great
O	deeds
O	.
O	Before
O	Merlin
O	passed
O	from
O	the
O	world
O	of
O	men
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	uttered
O	many
O	marvellous
O	prophesies
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	that
O	boded
O	ill
O	to
O	King
O	Arthur;
O	for
O	he
O	foretold
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	to
O	come
O	,
O	a
O	son
O	of
O	Arthur's
O	sister
O	should
O	stir
O	up
O	bitter
O	war
O	against
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	a
O	great
O	battle
O	should
O	be
O	fought
O	,
O	when
O	many
O	a
O	brave
O	knight
O	should
O	find
O	his
O	doom
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	among
O	the
O	nephews
O	of
O	Arthur
O	,
O	was
O	one
O	most
O	dishonourable;
O	his
O	name
O	was
O	Mordred
O	.
O	No
O	knightly
O	deed
O	had
O	he
O	ever
O	done
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	hated
O	to
O	hear
O	the
O	good
O	report
O	of
O	others
O	because
O	he
O	himself
O	was
O	a
O	coward
O	and
O	envious
O	.
O	But
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	there
O	was
O	none
O	that
O	Mordred
O	hated
O	more
O	than
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	du
O	Lac
O	,
O	whom
O	all
O	true
O	knights
O	held
O	in
O	most
O	honour;
O	and
O	not
O	the
O	less
O	did
O	Mordred
O	hate
O	Launcelot
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	knight
O	whom
O	Queen
O	Guenevere
O	had
O	in
O	most
O	esteem
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	his
O	jealous
O	rage
O	passing
O	all
O	bounds
O	,
O	he
O	spoke
O	evil
O	of
O	the
O	Queen
O	and
O	of
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	traitors
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	Now
O	Sir
O	Gawain
O	and
O	Sir
O	Gareth
O	,
O	Mordred's
O	brothers
O	,
O	refused
O	to
O	give
O	ear
O	to
O	these
O	slanders
O	,
O	holding
O	that
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	knightly
O	service
O	of
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	did
O	honour
O	to
O	King
O	Arthur
O	also;
O	but
O	by
O	ill-fortune
O	another
O	brother
O	,
O	Sir
O	Agravaine
O	,
O	had
O	ill-will
O	to
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	and
O	professed
O	to
O	believe
O	Mordred's
O	evil
O	tales
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	two
O	went
O	to
O	King
O	Arthur
O	with
O	their
O	ill
O	stories
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	Arthur
O	had
O	heard
O	them
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	wroth;
O	for
O	never
O	would
O	he
O	lightly
O	believe
O	evil
O	of
O	any
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	was
O	the
O	knight
O	whom
O	he
O	loved
O	above
O	all
O	others
O	.
O	Sternly
O	then
O	he
O	bade
O	them
O	begone
O	and
O	come
O	no
O	more
O	to
O	him
O	with
O	unproven
O	tales
O	against
O	any
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	least
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	against
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	and
O	their
O	lady
O	,
O	the
O	Queen
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	departed
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	their
O	hearts
O	was
O	hatred
O	against
O	Launcelot
O	and
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	more
O	bitter
O	than
O	ever
O	for
O	the
O	rebuke
O	they
O	had
O	called
O	down
O	upon
O	themselves
O	.
O	Great
O	was
O	the
O	King's
O	grief
O	.
O	Despite
O	all
O	that
O	Mordred
O	could
O	say
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	slow
O	to
O	doubt
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	loved
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	mind
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	forebodings;
O	and
O	well
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	their
O	kin
O	would
O	seek
O	vengeance
O	on
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	noble
O	fellowship
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	be
O	utterly
O	destroyed
O	.
O	All
O	too
O	soon
O	it
O	proved
O	even
O	as
O	the
O	King
O	had
O	feared
O	.
O	Many
O	were
O	found
O	to
O	hold
O	with
O	Sir
O	Mordred;
O	some
O	from
O	envy
O	of
O	the
O	honour
O	and
O	worship
O	of
O	the
O	noble
O	Sir
O	Launcelot;
O	and
O	among
O	them
O	even
O	were
O	those
O	who
O	dared
O	to
O	raise
O	their
O	voice
O	against
O	the
O	Queen
O	herself
O	,
O	calling
O	for
O	judgment
O	upon
O	her
O	as
O	leagued
O	with
O	a
O	traitor
O	against
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	having
O	caused
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	so
O	many
O	good
O	knights
O	.
O	Now
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	the
O	law
O	was
O	that
O	if
O	any
O	one
O	were
O	accused
O	of
O	treason
O	by
O	witnesses
O	,
O	or
O	taken
O	in
O	the
O	act
O	,
O	that
O	one
O	should
O	die
O	the
O	death
O	by
O	burning
O	,
O	be
O	it
O	man
O	or
O	woman
O	,
O	knight
O	or
O	churl
O	.
O	So
O	then
O	the
O	murmurs
O	grew
O	to
O	a
O	loud
O	clamour
O	that
O	the
O	law
O	should
O	have
O	its
O	course
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	King
O	Arthur
O	should
O	pass
O	sentence
O	on
O	the
O	Queen
O	.
O	Then
O	was
O	the
O	King's
O	woe
O	doubled;
O	"""For"
O	,
O	""""
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	"""I"
O	sit
O	as

O	wherefore
O	I

O	,
O	and
O	now
O	there
O	is
O	none
O	other
O	to
O	help
O	her
O	.
O	""""
O	So
O	a
O	decree
O	was
O	issued
O	that
O	Queen
O	Guenevere
O	should
O	be
O	burnt

O	the
O	stake
O	outside

O	But
O	Sir

O	Then
O	the

O	to

O	to
O	the

O	So
O	Gareth
O	made
O	answer
O	for
O	both:

O	then
O	sorrowfully
O	they
O	mounted
O	their
O	horses
O	and
O	rode
O	to
O	Carlisle
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	day
O	appointed
O	had
O	come
O	,
O	the

O	and
O	there
O	she
O	was
O	bound
O	to
O	the

O	be
O	burnt
O	to

O	Loud
O	were
O	her
O	ladies'
O	lamentations
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	a
O	lord
O	was
O	found
O	to
O	weep
O	at
O	that
O	grievous
O	sight
O	of
O	a
O	Queen
O	brought
O	so
O	low;
O	yet
O	was
O	there
O	none
O	who

O	as
O	her
O	champion
O	,
O	lest
O	he
O	should

O	As
O	for
O	Gareth

O	,
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	the

O	and
O	stood
O	with
O	their
O	faces
O	covered
O	in
O	their
O	mantles
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	torch
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	applied
O	to
O	the
O	faggots
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	sound
O	as
O	of
O	many
O	horses
O	galloping
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	instant
O	a
O	band
O	of
O	knights
O	rushed
O	upon
O	the
O	astonished
O	throng
O	,
O	their
O	leader
O	cutting
O	down
O	all
O	who
O	crossed
O	his
O	path
O	until
O	he
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	lifted
O	to
O	his
O	saddle
O	and
O	bore
O	from
O	the
O	press
O	.
O	Then
O	all
O	men
O	knew
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	come
O	knightly
O	to
O	rescue
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	their
O	hearts
O	they
O	rejoiced
O	.
O	So
O	with
O	little
O	hindrance
O	they
O	rode
O	away
O	,
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	kin
O	with
O	the
O	Queen
O	in
O	their
O	midst
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	the
O	Joyous
O	Garde
O	where
O	they
O	held
O	the
O	Queen
O	in
O	safety
O	and
O	all
O	reverence
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	desired
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	assurance
O	of
O	liberty
O	for
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	as
O	also
O	safe
O	conduct
O	for
O	himself
O	and
O	his
O	knights
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might

O	,
O	with
O	due

O	to
O	the

O	at
O	Carlisle;
O	and
O	thereto
O	the
O	King
O	pledged
O	his
O	word
O	.
O	So
O	Launcelot
O	set
O	forth
O	with
O	the
O	Queen
O	,
O	and
O	behind
O	them
O	rode
O	a
O	hundred
O	knights
O	arrayed
O	in
O	green
O	velvet
O	,
O	the
O	housings
O	of
O	the
O	horses
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	all
O	studded
O	with
O	precious

O	thus
O	they
O	passed
O	through
O	the

O	of
O	Carlisle
O	,
O	openly
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	were
O	many
O	who
O	rejoiced
O	that
O	the
O	Queen
O	was
O	come
O	again
O	and
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	though
O	they
O	of
O	Gawain's
O	party
O	scowled
O	upon

O	.
O	When

O	come
O	into

O	Guenevere
O	to
O	the
O	throne

O	knelt
O	before

O	then
O	,
O	rising
O	,
O	Sir

O	lifted
O	the
O	Queen
O	to
O	her
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	he
O	spoke
O	to

O	boldly
O	and
O	well

O	thereafter
O	,
O	in

O	of
O	that
O	sad
O	day
O	,
O	he
O	called
O	it
O	the
O	Dolorous
O	Garde
O	.
O	In
O	after
O	times
O	when
O	the
O	King
O	had
O	passed
O	overseas
O	to
O	France
O	,
O	leaving
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	to
O	rule
O	Britain
O	in
O	his
O	stead
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	messengers
O	from
O	Britain
O	bearing
O	letters
O	for
O	King
O	Arthur;
O	and
O	more
O	evil
O	news
O	than
O	they
O	brought
O	might
O	not
O	well
O	be
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	told
O	how
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	had
O	usurped
O	his
O	uncle's
O	realm
O	.
O	First
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	caused
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	noised
O	abroad
O	that
O	King
O	Arthur
O	was
O	slain
O	in
O	battle
O	with
O	Sir
O	Launcelot
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	since
O	there
O	be
O	many
O	ever
O	ready
O	to
O	believe
O	any
O	idle
O	rumour
O	and
O	eager
O	for
O	any
O	change
O	,
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	no
O	hard
O	task
O	for
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	to
O	call
O	the
O	lords
O	to
O	a
O	Parliament
O	and
O	persuade
O	them
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	King
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	Queen
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	brought
O	to
O	believe
O	that
O	her
O	lord
O	was
O	dead
O	,
O	so
O	she
O	took
O	refuge
O	in
O	the
O	Tower
O	of
O	London
O	from
O	Sir
O	Mordred's
O	violence
O	,
O	nor
O	was
O	she
O	to
O	be
O	induced
O	to
O	leave
O	her
O	strong
O	refuge
O	for
O	aught
O	that
O	Mordred
O	could
O	promise
O	or
O	threaten
O	.
O	Forthwith
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	bade
O	his
O	host
O	make
O	ready
O	to
O	move
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	coast
O	,
O	they
O	embarked
O	and
O	made
O	sail
O	to
O	reach
O	Britain
O	with
O	all
O	possible
O	speed
O	.
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	,
O	on
O	his
O	part
O	,
O	had
O	heard
O	of
O	their
O	sailing
O	,
O	and
O	hasted
O	to
O	get
O	together
O	a
O	great
O	army
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	grievous
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	many
O	a
O	stout
O	knight
O	held
O	by
O	Mordred
O	,
O	ay
O	,
O	even
O	many
O	whom
O	Arthur
O	himself
O	had
O	raised
O	to
O	honour
O	and
O	fortune;
O	for
O	it
O	is
O	the
O	nature
O	of
O	men
O	to
O	be
O	fickle
O	.
O	Thus
O	is
O	was
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	Arthur
O	drew
O	near
O	to
O	Dover
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	Mordred
O	with
O	a
O	mighty
O	host
O	,
O	waiting
O	to
O	oppose
O	his
O	landing
O	.
O	Then
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	sea-fight
O	,
O	those
O	of
O	Mordred's
O	party
O	going
O	out
O	in
O	boats
O	,
O	to
O	board
O	King
O	Arthur's
O	ships
O	and
O	slay
O	him
O	and
O	his
O	men
O	or
O	ever
O	they
O	should
O	come
O	to
O	land
O	.
O	Right
O	valiantly
O	did
O	King
O	Arthur
O	bear
O	him
O	,
O	as
O	was
O	his
O	wont
O	,
O	and
O	boldly
O	his
O	followers
O	fought
O	in
O	his
O	cause
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	drove
O	off
O	their
O	enemies
O	and
O	landed
O	at
O	Dover
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	Mordred
O	and
O	his
O	array
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	many
O	that
O	Mordred
O	had
O	cheated
O	by
O	his
O	lying
O	reports
O	,
O	had
O	drawn
O	unto
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	to
O	whom
O	at
O	heart
O	they
O	had
O	ever
O	been
O	loyal
O	,
O	knowing
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	true
O	and
O	noble
O	King
O	and
O	hating
O	themselves
O	for
O	having
O	been
O	deceived
O	by
O	such
O	a
O	false
O	usurper
O	as
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	.
O	One
O	night
O	,
O	as
O	King
O	Arthur
O	slept
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	Sir
O	Gawain
O	stood
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	looking
O	just
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	in
O	life
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	him:
O	"""My"
O	uncle
O	and
O	my

O	,
O	to
O	warn
O	you
O	that
O	in
O	no

O	,
O	and
O	with
O	you
O	the
O	most

O	people
O	on
O	both

O	.
O	Make

O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	a
O	treaty
O	.
O	""""
O	Immediately
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	awoke
O	and
O	called
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	best
O	and
O	wisest
O	of
O	his
O	knights
O	.
O	Then
O	all
O	were
O	agreed
O	that
O	,
O	on
O	any
O	terms
O	whatsoever
O	,
O	a
O	treaty
O	should
O	be
O	made
O	with
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	,
O	even
O	as
O	Sir
O	Gawain
O	had
O	said;
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	dawn
O	,
O	messengers
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	camp
O	of
O	the
O	enemy
O	,
O	to
O	call
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	to
O	a
O	conference
O	.
O	So
O	it
O	was
O	determined
O	that
O	the
O	meeting
O	should
O	take
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	both
O	armies
O	,
O	in
O	an
O	open
O	space
O	between
O	the
O	two
O	camps
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	King
O	Arthur
O	and
O	Mordred
O	should
O	each
O	be
O	accompanied
O	by
O	fourteen
O	knights
O	.
O	Little
O	enough
O	faith
O	had
O	either
O	in
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	so
O	when
O	they
O	set
O	forth
O	to
O	the
O	meeting
O	,
O	they
O	bade
O	their
O	hosts
O	join
O	battle
O	if
O	ever
O	they
O	saw
O	a
O	sword
O	drawn
O	.
O	Now
O	as
O	they
O	talked
O	,
O	it
O	befell
O	that
O	an
O	adder
O	,
O	coming
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	bush
O	hard
O	by
O	,
O	stung
O	a
O	knight
O	in
O	the
O	foot;
O	and
O	he
O	,
O	seeing
O	the
O	snake
O	,
O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	to
O	kill
O	it
O	and
O	thought
O	no
O	harm
O	thereby
O	.
O	But
O	on
O	the
O	instant
O	that
O	the
O	sword
O	flashed
O	,
O	the
O	trumpets
O	blared
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	hosts
O	rushed
O	to
O	battle
O	.
O	Never
O	was
O	there
O	fought
O	a
O	fight
O	of
O	such
O	enmity;
O	for
O	brother
O	fought
O	with
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	comrade
O	with
O	comrade
O	,
O	and
O	fiercely
O	they
O	cut
O	and
O	thrust
O	,
O	with
O	many
O	a
O	bitter
O	word
O	between;
O	while
O	King
O	Arthur
O	himself
O	,
O	his
O	heart
O	hot
O	within
O	him
O	,
O	rode
O	through
O	and
O	through
O	the
O	battle
O	,
O	seeking
O	the
O	traitor
O	Mordred
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	fought
O	all
O	day
O	,
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	evening
O	fell
O	.
O	Then
O	Arthur
O	,
O	looking
O	round
O	him
O	,
O	saw
O	of
O	his
O	valiant
O	knights
O	but
O	two
O	left
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lucan
O	and
O	Sir
O	Bedivere
O	,
O	and
O	these
O	sore
O	wounded;

O	there
O	,

O	him
O	,
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	heap
O	of

O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	,
O	the
O	cause

O	this
O	ruin
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	his
O	heart
O	nigh
O	broken
O	with
O	grief
O	for
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	true
O	knights
O	,
O	cried
O	with
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	,
O	"""Traitor"

O	""""
O	and
O	with
O	his
O	spear
O	gripped
O	in
O	both
O	hands
O	,

O	rushed
O	upon
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	and
O	smote
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	weapon
O	stood
O	out
O	a
O	fathom
O	behind
O	.
O	And
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	knew
O	that

O	had
O	his
O	death
O	wound
O	.
O	With
O	all
O	the
O	might
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	,
O	he
O	thrust
O	him
O	up
O	the
O	spear
O	to
O	the
O	haft
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	struck
O	King
O	Arthur
O	upon
O	the
O	head
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	steel
O	pierced
O	the
O	helmet
O	and
O	bit
O	into
O	the
O	head;
O	then
O	Mordred
O	fell
O	back
O	,
O	stark
O	and
O	dead
O	.
O	Sir
O	Lucan
O	and
O	Sir
O	Bedivere
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	King
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	,
O	swooning
O	from
O	the
O	blow

O	him
O	to
O	a
O	little

O	seashore
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	laid
O	him
O	on
O	the
