O	The
O	person
O	whose
O	story
O	we
O	are
O	now
O	about
O	to
O	tell
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	Jerseyman;
O	but
O	,
O	as
O	most
O	of
O	the
O	incidents
O	which
O	make
O	him
O	interesting
O	to
O	us
O	occurred
O	in
O	this
O	State
O	,
O	we
O	will
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	benefit
O	of
O	a
O	few
O	years
O	'
O	residence
O	here
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	General
O	Charles
O	Lee
O	,
O	who
O	might
O	well
O	have
O	been
O	called
O	a
O	soldier
O	of
O	fortune
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	born
O	in
O	England
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	British
O	Isles
O	were
O	entirely
O	too
O	small
O	to
O	satisfy
O	his
O	wild
O	ambitions
O	and
O	his
O	roving
O	disposition
O	.
O	There
O	are
O	few
O	heroes
O	of
O	romance
O	who
O	have
O	had
O	such
O	a
O	wide
O	and
O	varied
O	experience
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	have
O	engaged
O	in
O	so
O	many
O	strange
O	enterprises
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	brave
O	man
O	and
O	very
O	able
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	fault
O	which
O	prevented
O	him
O	from
O	being
O	a
O	high-class
O	soldier;
O	and
O	that
O	fault
O	was
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	restraint
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	always
O	restive
O	under
O	command
O	of
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	while
O	always
O	ready
O	to
O	tell
O	other
O	people
O	what
O	they
O	ought
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	was
O	never
O	willing
O	to
O	be
O	told
O	what
O	he
O	ought
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	He
O	joined
O	the
O	British
O	army
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	young
O	man;
O	and
O	he
O	first
O	came
O	to
O	this
O	country
O	in
O	1757
O	,
O	when
O	General
O	Abercrombie
O	brought
O	over
O	an
O	army
O	to
O	fight
O	the
O	French
O	.
O	For
O	three
O	years
O	,
O	Lee
O	was
O	engaged
O	in
O	the
O	wilds
O	and
O	forests
O	,
O	doing
O	battle
O	with
O	the
O	Indians
O	and
O	French
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	doubt
O	he
O	had
O	all
O	the
O	adventures
O	an
O	ordinary
O	person
O	would
O	desire
O	,
O	But
O	this
O	experience
O	was
O	far
O	from
O	satisfactory
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	left
O	America
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	Portugal
O	with
O	another
O	British
O	army
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	fought
O	the
O	Spanish
O	with
O	as
O	much
O	impetuosity
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	fought
O	the
O	French
O	and
O	Indians
O	.
O	Life
O	was
O	absolutely
O	tasteless
O	to
O	Lee
O	without
O	a
O	very
O	strong
O	sprinkle
O	of
O	variety
O	.
O	Consequently
O	he
O	now
O	tried
O	fighting
O	in
O	an
O	entirely
O	different
O	field
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	politics
O	.
O	He
O	became
O	a
O	Liberal
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	his
O	voice
O	fought
O	the
O	government
O	for
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	previously
O	fighting
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	.
O	But
O	a
O	few
O	years
O	of
O	this
O	satisfied
O	him;
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	Poland
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	became
O	a
O	member
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	staff
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	a
O	Polish
O	officer
O	disported
O	himself
O	for
O	two
O	years
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	very
O	likely
O	that
O	in
O	Turkey
O	a
O	high-spirited
O	man
O	would
O	find
O	more
O	opportunities
O	for
O	lively
O	adventure
O	than
O	even
O	in
O	Poland
O	.
O	At
O	any
O	rate
O	,
O	Charles
O	Lee
O	thought
O	so;
O	and
O	to
O	Turkey
O	he
O	went
O	,
O	and
O	entered
O	into
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	the
O	sultan
O	.
O	Here
O	he
O	distinguished
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	company
O	of
O	Turks
O	who
O	were
O	guarding
O	a
O	great
O	treasure
O	in
O	its
O	transportation
O	from
O	Moldavia
O	to
O	Constantinople
O	.
O	No
O	doubt
O	he
O	wore
O	a
O	turban
O	and
O	baggy
O	trousers
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	a
O	great
O	scimiter
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	that
O	sort
O	is
O	not
O	likely
O	to
O	do
O	things
O	by
O	halves
O	when
O	he
O	does
O	them
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	Having
O	had
O	such
O	peculiar
O	experiences
O	in
O	various
O	armies
O	and
O	various
O	parts
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	Lee
O	thought
O	himself
O	qualified
O	to
O	occupy
O	a
O	position
O	of
O	rank
O	in
O	the
O	British
O	army
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	coming
O	back
O	to
O	England
O	,
O	he
O	endeavored
O	to
O	obtain
O	military
O	promotion
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	government
O	there
O	did
O	not
O	seem
O	to
O	think
O	he
O	had
O	learned
O	enough
O	in
O	Poland
O	and
O	Turkey
O	to
O	enable
O	him
O	to
O	take
O	precedence
O	of
O	English
O	officers
O	accustomed
O	to
O	command
O	English
O	troops
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	declined
O	to
O	put
O	him
O	above
O	such
O	officers
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	place
O	he
O	desired
O	.
O	Lee
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	mild
O	temper
O	.
O	He
O	became
O	very
O	angry
O	at
O	the
O	treatment
O	he
O	received
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	abandoning
O	his
O	native
O	country
O	again
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	Russia
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	czar
O	gave
O	him
O	command
O	of
O	a
O	company
O	of
O	wild
O	Cossacks
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	remain
O	long
O	with
O	the
O	Cossacks
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	they
O	were
O	not
O	wild
O	and
O	daring
O	enough
O	to
O	suit
O	his
O	fancy
O	,
O	although
O	there
O	are
O	very
O	few
O	fancies
O	which
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	satisfied
O	with
O	the
O	reckless
O	and
O	furious
O	demeanor
O	generally
O	attributed
O	to
O	these
O	savage
O	horsemen
O	.
O	He
O	threw
O	up
O	his
O	command
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	Hungary
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	did
O	some
O	fighting
O	in
O	an
O	entirely
O	different
O	fashion
O	.
O	Not
O	having
O	any
O	opportunity
O	to
O	distinguish
O	himself
O	upon
O	a
O	battlefield
O	,
O	he
O	engaged
O	in
O	a
O	duel;
O	and
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	acting
O	the
O	part
O	of
O	a
O	hero
O	of
O	romance
O	,
O	he
O	killed
O	his
O	man
O	.
O	Hungary
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	suitable
O	residence
O	for
O	him
O	after
O	the
O	duel
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	England
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	country
O	in
O	a
O	state
O	of
O	excitement
O	in
O	regard
O	to
O	the
O	American
O	Colonies
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	if
O	there
O	was
O	anything
O	that
O	Lee
O	liked
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	state
O	of
O	excitement
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	this
O	political
O	hubbub
O	he
O	felt
O	as
O	much
O	at
O	home
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	charging
O	the
O	ranks
O	of
O	an
O	enemy
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	part
O	against
O	the
O	government
O	,
O	for
O	,
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	we
O	know
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	always
O	been
O	against
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	became
O	a
O	violent
O	supporter
O	of
O	the
O	rights
O	of
O	the
O	colonists
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	in
O	earnest
O	in
O	this
O	matter
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	1773
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	America
O	to
O	see
O	for
O	himself
O	how
O	matters
O	stood
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	got
O	over
O	here
O	,
O	he
O	became
O	more
O	strongly
O	in
O	favor
O	of
O	the
O	colonists
O	than
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	at
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	everywhere
O	proclaimed
O	that
O	the
O	Americans
O	were
O	right
O	in
O	resisting
O	the
O	unjust
O	taxation
O	claims
O	of
O	Great
O	Britain
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	had
O	always
O	been
O	ready
O	to
O	lay
O	aside
O	his
O	British
O	birthright
O	and
O	become
O	some
O	sort
O	of
O	a
O	foreigner
O	,
O	he
O	now
O	determined
O	to
O	become
O	an
O	American;
O	and
O	to
O	show
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	earnest
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	down
O	to
O	Virginia
O	and
O	bought
O	a
O	farm
O	there
O	.
O	Lee
O	soon
O	became
O	acquainted
O	with
O	people
O	in
O	high
O	places
O	in
O	American
O	politics;
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	first
O	Congress
O	assembled
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	talk
O	with
O	its
O	members
O	,
O	urging
O	them
O	to
O	stand
O	up
O	for
O	their
O	rights
O	,
O	and
O	draw
O	their
O	swords
O	and
O	load
O	their
O	guns
O	in
O	defense
O	of
O	independence
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	quite
O	natural
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	Revolution
O	really
O	began
O	,
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	was
O	so
O	strongly
O	in
O	favor
O	of
O	the
O	patriots
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	had
O	so
O	much
O	military
O	experience
O	in
O	so
O	many
O	different
O	lands
O	,
O	should
O	be
O	allowed
O	to
O	take
O	part
O	in
O	the
O	war
O	,
O	and
O	Charles
O	Lee
O	was
O	appointed
O	major
O	general
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	high
O	military
O	position
O	,
O	--much
O	higher
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	than
O	he
O	could
O	ever
O	have
O	obtained
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	country
O	,
O	--but
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	satisfy
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	position
O	he
O	wanted
O	was
O	that
O	of
O	commander
O	in
O	chief
O	of
O	the
O	American
O	army;
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	surprised
O	and
O	angry
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	offered
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	his
O	ability
O	should
O	be
O	passed
O	over
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	high
O	place
O	given
O	to
O	a
O	person
O	like
O	George
O	Washington
O	,
O	who
O	knew
O	but
O	little
O	of
O	war
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	no
O	idea
O	whatever
O	how
O	the
O	thing
O	was
O	done
O	in
O	Portugal
O	,
O	Poland
O	,
O	Russia
O	and
O	Turkey
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	was
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	no
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	country
O	gentleman
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	showed
O	that
O	these
O	Americans
O	were
O	fools
O	,
O	who
O	did
O	not
O	understand
O	their
O	best
O	interests
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	chance
O	for
O	a
O	fight
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	a
O	good
O	many
O	fights
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	a
O	major
O	generalship
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	sneered
O	at
O	,
O	he
O	accepted
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	resigned
O	the
O	commission
O	which
O	he
O	held
O	in
O	the
O	English
O	army
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	doubtless
O	in
O	earnest
O	in
O	his
O	desire
O	to
O	assist
O	the
O	Americans
O	to
O	obtain
O	their
O	independence
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	always
O	in
O	earnest
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	doing
O	anything
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	inclined
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	propose
O	to
O	sacrifice
O	his
O	own
O	interests
O	to
O	the
O	cause
O	he
O	had
O	undertaken;
O	and
O	as
O	,
O	by
O	entering
O	the
O	American
O	army
O	,
O	he
O	risked
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	estate
O	in
O	England
O	,
O	he
O	arranged
O	with
O	Congress
O	for
O	compensation
O	for
O	such
O	loss
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	although
O	General
O	Lee
O	was
O	now
O	a
O	very
O	ardent
O	American
O	soldier
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	forgive
O	Mr
O	.
O	Washington
O	for
O	taking
O	command
O	above
O	him
O	.
O	If
O	that
O	Virginia
O	gentleman
O	had
O	had
O	the
O	courtesy
O	and
O	good
O	sense
O	which
O	were
O	generally
O	attributed
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	have

O	,
O	modestly
O	stepping
O	aside
O	,
O	would
O	have
O	asked
O	General
O	Lee
O	to
O	accept
O	it
O	.
O	At
O	least
O	,
O	that
O	was
O	the
O	opinion
O	of
O	General
O	Charles
O	Lee
O	.
O	As
O	this
O	high
O	and
O	mighty
O	soldier
O	was
O	so
O	unwilling
O	to
O	submit
O	to
O	the
O	orders
O	of
O	incompetent
O	people
O	,
O	he
O	never
O	liked
O	to
O	be
O	under
O	the
O	direct
O	command
O	of
O	Washington
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	possible
O	to
O	do
O	so
O	,
O	he
O	managed
O	to
O	be
O	concerned
O	in
O	operations
O	not
O	under
O	the
O	immediate
O	eye
O	of
O	the
O	commander
O	in
O	chief
O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	jealous
O	indeed
O	of
O	Washington
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	hesitate
O	to
O	express
O	his
O	opinion
O	about
O	him
O	whenever
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	chance
O	.
O	The
O	American
O	army
O	was
O	not
O	very
O	successful
O	in
O	Long
O	Island
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	time
O	when
O	it
O	fared
O	very
O	badly
O	in
O	New
O	Jersey;
O	and
O	Lee
O	was
O	not
O	slow
O	to
O	declare
O	that
O	these
O	misfortunes
O	were
O	owing
O	entirely
O	to
O	the
O	ignorance
O	of
O	the
O	man
O	who
O	was
O	in
O	command
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	if

O	in

O	Colonies
O	who
O	could
O	command
O	the
O	army
O	better
O	,
O	and
O	lead
O	it
O	more
O	certainly
O	and
O	speedily
O	to
O	victory
O	,
O	General
O	Lee
O	was
O	always
O	ready
O	to
O	mention
O	an
O	experienced
O	soldier
O	who
O	would
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	perform
O	that
O	duty
O	most
O	admirably
O	.
O	If
O	it
O	had
O	not

O	for
O	this
O	unfortunate
O	and
O	jealous
O	disposition
O	,
O	Charles

O	very
O	different
O	man
O	from
O	""""
O	Light

O	Harry
O	""""
O	Lee--would
O	have
O	been
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	useful
O	officers
O	in
O	the
O	American
O	army
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	had
O	such
O	a
O	jealousy
O	of
O	Washington
O	,
O	and
O	hoped
O	so
O	continually
O	that
O	something
O	would
O	happen
O	which
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	place
O	then
O	occupied
O	by
O	the
O	Virginia
O	country
O	gentleman
O	,
O	that
O	,
O	although
O	he
O	was
O	at
O	heart
O	an
O	honest
O	patriot
O	,
O	he
O	allowed
O	himself
O	to
O	do
O	things
O	which
O	were
O	not
O	at
O	all
O	patriotic
O	.
O	He
O	wanted
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	Americans
O	successful
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	want
O	to
O	see
O	all
O	that
O	happen
O	under
O	the
O	leadership
O	of
O	Washington;
O	and
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	put
O	an
O	obstacle
O	in
O	the
O	way
O	of
O	that
O	incompetent
O	person
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	do
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	be
O	glad
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	stumble
O	over
O	it
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	winter
O	of
O	1776
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	American
O	army
O	was
O	taking
O	its
O	way
O	across
O	New
O	Jersey
O	towards
O	the
O	Delaware
O	River
O	with
O	Cornwallis
O	in
O	pursuit
O	,
O	Washington
O	was
O	anxiously
O	looking
O	for
O	the
O	troops
O	under
O	the
O	command
O	of
O	General
O	Lee
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	ordered
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	his
O	assistance;
O	and
O	if
O	ever
O	assistance
O	was
O	needed
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	needed
O	then
O	.
O	But
O	Lee
O	liked
O	to
O	do
O	his
O	own
O	ordering
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	hurrying
O	to
O	help
O	Washington
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	better
O	to
O	do
O	something
O	on
O	his
O	own
O	account;
O	and
O	so
O	he
O	endeavored
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	the
O	rear
O	of
O	Cornwallis
O	'
O	s
O	army
O	,
O	thinking
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	should
O	attack
O	the
O	enemy
O	in
O	that
O	way
O	,
O	he
O	might
O	possibly
O	win
O	a
O	startling
O	victory
O	which
O	would
O	cover
O	him
O	with
O	glory
O	,
O	and
O	show
O	how
O	much
O	better
O	a
O	soldier
O	he
O	was
O	than
O	that
O	poor
O	Washington
O	who
O	was
O	retreating
O	across
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	boldly
O	turning
O	and
O	showing
O	fight
O	.
O	If
O	Lee
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	true
O	soldier
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	conscientiously
O	obeyed
O	the
O	commands
O	of
O	his
O	superior
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	joined
O	Washington
O	and
O	his
O	army
O	without
O	delay
O	and
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	afterward
O	would
O	have
O	had
O	an
O	opportunity
O	of
O	taking
O	part
O	in
O	the
O	battle
O	of
O	Trenton
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	Virginia
O	country
O	gentleman
O	defeated
O	the
O	British
O	,
O	and
O	gained
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	important
O	victories
O	of
O	the
O	war
O	.
O	Lee
O	pressed
O	slowly
O	onward--ready
O	to
O	strike
O	a
O	great
O	blow
O	for
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	unwilling
O	to
O	help
O	anybody
O	else
O	strike
O	a
O	blow--until
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	Morristown;
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	staying
O	there
O	one
O	night
O	,
O	he
O	proceeded
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	of
O	Basking
O	Ridge
O	,
O	a
O	pretty
O	village
O	not
O	far
O	away
O	.
O	Lee
O	left
O	his
O	army
O	at
O	Bernardsville
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	then
O	known
O	as
O	Vealtown
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	on
O	to
O	Basking
O	Ridge
O	,
O	accompanied
O	only
O	by
O	a
O	small
O	guard
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	took
O	lodgings
O	at
O	an
O	inn
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	himself
O	comfortable
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	go
O	and
O	put
O	himself
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	his
O	army
O	and
O	move
O	on
O	,
O	because
O	there
O	were
O	various
O	affairs
O	which
O	occupied
O	his
O	attention
O	.
O	Several
O	of
O	his
O	guard
O	wished
O	to
O	speak
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	being
O	men
O	from
O	Connecticut
O	,
O	who
O	appeared
O	before
O	him
O	in
O	full-bottomed
O	wigs
O	,
O	showing
O	plainly
O	that
O	they
O	considered
O	themselves
O	people
O	who
O	were
O	important
O	enough
O	to
O	have
O	their
O	complaints
O	attended
O	to
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	wanted
O	his
O	horse
O	shod
O	,
O	another
O	asked
O	for
O	some
O	money
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	pay
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	third
O	had
O	something
O	to
O	say
O	about
O	rations
O	.
O	But
O	General
O	Lee
O	cut
O	them
O	all
O	off
O	very
O	shortly
O	with
O	,
O	""""
O	You
O	want

O	what
O	you
O	want

O	You
O	want

O	go
O	,
O	for
O	you

O	no
O	good
O	here
O	.
O	""""
O	Then
O	his
O	adjutant
O	general
O	asked
O	to
O	see
O	him;
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	visit
O	from
O	a
O	Major
O	Wilkinson
O	,
O	who
O	arrived
O	that
O	morning
O	with
O	a
O	letter
O	from
O	General
O	Gates
O	.
O	All
O	these
O	things
O	occupied
O	him
O	very
O	much
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	sit
O	down
O	to
O	breakfast
O	till
O	ten
O	o
O	'
O	clock
O	.
O	Shortly
O	after
O	they
O	had
O	finished
O	their
O	meal
O	,
O	and
O	Lee
O	was
O	writing
O	a
O	letter
O	to
O	General
O	Gates
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	expressed
O	a
O	very
O	contemptible
O	opinion
O	of
O	General
O	Washington
O	,
O	Major
O	Wilkinson
O	saw
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	lane
O	which
O	led
O	from
O	the
O	house
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	main
O	road
O	,
O	a
O	party
O	of
O	British
O	cavalry
O	who
O	dashed
O	round
O	the
O	corner
O	toward
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	The
O	major
O	immediately
O	called
O	out
O	to
O	General
O	Lee
O	that
O	the
O	redcoats
O	were
O	coming;
O	but
O	Lee
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	frightened
O	by
O	sudden
O	reports
O	,
O	finished
O	signing
O	the
O	letter
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	jumped
O	up
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	dragoons
O	had
O	surrounded
O	the
O	house;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	perceived
O	this
O	,
O	General
O	Lee
O	naturally
O	wanted
O	to
O	know
O	where
O	the
O	guards
O	were
O	,
O	and
O	why
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	fire
O	on
O	these
O	fellows
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	firing
O	,
O	and
O	apparently
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	guards
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	Wilkinson
O	went
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	them
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	their
O	arms
O	in
O	the
O	room
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	their
O	quarters
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	men
O	were
O	gone
O	.
O	These
O	private
O	soldiers
O	had
O	evidently
O	been
O	quite
O	as
O	free
O	and
O	easy
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	bent
O	upon
O	making
O	themselves
O	comfortable
O	,
O	as
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	general
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	had
O	no
O	thought
O	that
O	such
O	a
O	thing
O	as
O	a
O	British
O	soldier
O	was
O	anywhere
O	in
O	the
O	neighborhood
O	.
O	When
O	Wilkinson
O	looked
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	guards
O	running
O	in
O	every
O	direction
O	,
O	with
O	dragoons
O	chasing
O	them
O	.
O	What
O	all
O	this
O	meant
O	,
O	nobody
O	knew
O	at
O	first;
O	and
O	Wilkinson
O	supposed
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	merely
O	a
O	band
O	of
O	marauders
O	of
O	the
O	British
O	army
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	making
O	a
O	raid
O	into
O	the
O	country
O	to
O	get
O	what
O	they
O	could
O	in
O	the
O	way
O	of
O	plunder
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	this
O	was
O	found
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	great
O	mistake;
O	for
O	the
O	officer
O	in
O	command
O	of
O	the
O	dragoons
O	called
O	from
O	the
O	outside
O	,
O	and
O	demanded
O	that
O	General
O	Lee
O	should
O	surrender
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	do
O	so
O	in
O	five
O	minutes
O	,
O	the
O	house
O	would
O	be
O	set
O	on
O	fire
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	plain
O	to
O	everybody
O	that
O	the
O	British
O	had
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	leisurely
O	advance
O	of
O	this
O	American
O	general
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	his
O	command
O	and
O	come
O	to
O	Basking
O	Ridge
O	to
O	take
O	his
O	ease
O	at
O	an
O	inn
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	they
O	had
O	sent
O	a
O	detachment
O	to
O	capture
O	him
O	.
O	Soon
O	the
O	women
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	came
O	to
O	General
O	Lee
O	,
O	and
O	urged
O	him
O	to
O	hide
O	himself
O	under
O	a
O	feather
O	bed
O	.
O	They
O	declared
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	cover
O	him
O	up
O	so
O	that
O	nohody
O	would
O	suspect
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	bed;
O	then
O	they
O	would
O	tell
O	the
O	soldiers
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	come
O	and
O	search
O	the
O	house
O	if
O	they
O	chose
O	.
O	But
O	although
O	Lee
O	was
O	a
O	jealous
O	man
O	and
O	a
O	hasty
O	man
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	soul
O	above
O	such
O	behavior
O	as
O	this
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	hide
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	feather
O	bed;
O	but
O	,
O	as
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	honorable
O	way
O	of
O	escape
O	,
O	he
O	boldly
O	came
O	forward
O	and
O	surrendered
O	himself
O	.
O	The
O	British
O	gave
O	him
O	no
O	time
O	to
O	make
O	any
O	preparations
O	for
O	departure
O	.
O	They
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	but
O	that
O	his
O	army
O	might
O	be
O	on
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	Basking
O	Ridge;
O	and
O	the
O	sooner
O	they
O	were
O	off
O	,
O	the
O	better
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	made
O	him
O	jump
O	on
O	Major
O	Wilkinson
O	'
O	s
O	horse
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	tied
O	by
O	the
O	door;
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	slippers
O	and
O	dressing
O	gown
O	,
O	and
O	without
O	a
O	hat
O	,
O	this
O	bold
O	soldier
O	of
O	wide
O	experience
O	,
O	who
O	thought
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	commander
O	in
O	chief
O	of
O	the
O	American
O	army
O	,
O	was
O	hurried
O	away
O	at
O	full
O	gallop
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	taken
O	to
O	New
O	York
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	put
O	into
O	prison
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	said
O	that
O	Lee
O	plotted
O	against
O	America
O	during
O	his
O	imprisonment;
O	but
O	General
O	Washington
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	that
O	,
O	and
O	used
O	every
O	exertion
O	to
O	have
O	him
O	exchanged
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	his
O	aspiring
O	rival
O	soon
O	again
O	joined
O	the
O	American
O	army
O	.
O	But
O	his
O	misfortune
O	had
O	no
O	effect
O	upon
O	General
O	Charles
O	Lee
O	,
O	who
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	command
O	with
O	as
O	high
O	an
O	opinion
O	of
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	low
O	an
O	opinion
O	of
O	certain
O	other
O	people
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	had
O	when
O	he
O	involuntarily
O	left
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	some
O	time
O	after
O	this
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	battle
O	of
O	Monmouth
O	Court
O	House
O	,
O	that
O	Charles
O	Lee
O	showed
O	what
O	sort
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	he
O	really
O	was
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	now
O	become
O	so
O	jealous
O	that
O	he
O	positively
O	determined
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	obey
O	orders
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	act
O	as
O	he
O	thought
O	best
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	command
O	of
O	a
O	body
O	of
O	troops
O	numbering
O	five
O	thousand
O	,
O	a
O	good-sized
O	army
O	for
O	those
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	ordered
O	to
O	advance
O	to
O	Monmouth
O	Court
O	House
O	and
O	attack
O	the
O	enemy
O	who
O	were
O	there
O	,
O	while
O	Washington
O	,
O	with
O	another
O	force
O	,
O	would
O	hasten
O	to
O	his
O	assistance
O	as
O	rapidly
O	as
O	possible
O	.
O	Washington
O	carried
O	out
O	his
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	plan;
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	nearly
O	reached
O	Monmouth
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	amazement
O	,
O	that
O	Lee
O	had
O	gone
O	there
O	,
O	but
O	had
O	done
O	no
O	fighting
O	at
O	all
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	now
O	actually
O	retreating
O	,
O	and
O	coming
O	in
O	his
O	direction
O	.
O	As
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	demoralizing
O	in
O	the
O	highest
O	degree
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	command
O	,
O	if
O	Lee
O	'
O	s
O	armed
O	forces
O	in
O	full
O	retreat
O	should
O	come
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	Washington
O	hurried
O	forward
O	to
O	prevent
O	anything
O	of
O	the
O	sort
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	met
O	Lee
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	latter
O	was
O	asked
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	meaning
O	of
O	this
O	strange
O	proceeding
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	give
O	no
O	good
O	reason
O	,
O	except
O	that
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	better
O	not
O	to
O	risk
O	an
O	engagement
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Virginia
O	country
O	gentleman
O	blazed
O	out
O	at
O	the
O	soldier
O	of
O	fortune
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	said
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	ever
O	heard
O	George
O	Washington
O	speak
O	to
O	any
O	other
O	man
O	as
O	he
O	spoke
O	to
O	General
O	Lee
O	on
O	that
O	day
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	told
O	to
O	go
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	command
O	and
O	to
O	obey
O	orders
O	,
O	and
O	together
O	the
O	American
O	forces
O	moved
O	on
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	battle
O	which
O	followed
O	,
O	the
O	enemy
O	was
O	repulsed;
O	but
O	the
O	victory
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	complete
O	as
O	it
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	British
O	departed
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	and
O	went
O	where
O	they
O	intended
O	to
O	go
O	,
O	without
O	being
O	cut
O	off
O	by
O	the
O	American
O	army
O	,
O	as
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	the
O	case
O	if
O	Lee
O	had
O	obeyed
O	the
O	orders
O	which
O	were
O	given
O	him
O	.
O	General
O	Lee
O	was
O	very
O	angry
O	at
O	the
O	charges
O	which
O	Washington
O	had
O	made
O	against
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	demanded
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	tried
O	by
O	court-martial
O	.
O	His
O	wish
O	was
O	granted
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	tried
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	guilty
O	of
O	every
O	charge
O	made
O	against
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	consequence
O	was
O	suspended
O	from
O	the
O	army
O	for
O	one
O	year
O	.
O	But
O	Charles
O	Lee
O	never
O	went
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	American
O	army
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	he
O	had
O	enough
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	In
O	any
O	event
O	,
O	it
O	had
O	had
O	enough
O	of
O	him;
O	and
O	seven
O	years
O	afterwards
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	died
O	of
O	a
O	fever
O	,
O	his
O	ambition
O	to
O	stand
O	in
O	Washington
O	'
O	s
O	shoes
O	died
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	lived
O	on
O	his
O	Virginia
O	farm
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	impetuous
O	and
O	eccentric
O	as
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	in
O	the
O	army
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	must
O	have
O	been

O	very
O	unpleasant
O	neighbor
O	.
O	In
O	fact

O	This

O	is
O	a
O	curious
O	absence

O	the

O	.
O	The
O	combat
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	owes
O	its
O	enduring
O	fame
O	to
O	two
O	somewhat
O	irrelevant
O	circumstances--first
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	fought
O	when
O	France
O	and
O	England
O	were
O	not

O	war
O	,
O	but
O	were
O	trembling
O	on

O	The
O	sound
O	of
O	the
O	_Arethusa

O	s_
O	guns
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	signal
O	of
O	war
O	between
O	the
O	two
O	nations
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	fact
O	is
O	that
O	an
O	ingenious
O	rhymester--scarcely
O	a
O	poet--crystallised
O	the
O	fight
O	into
O	a
O	set
O	of
O	verses
O	in
O	which
O	there
O	is
O	something
O	of
O	the
O	true
O	smack
O	of
O	the

O	yet

O	sea-fight
O	lies
O	embalmed

O	so
O	to
O	speak
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	immortal
O	in
O	the
O	sea-song

O	The
O	_Arethusa_

O	a
O	stumpy

O	Great

O	thirty-two

O	On

O	War
O	had

O	gunpowder
O	in
O	the
O	last
O	resort
O	.
O	Keppel
O	'
O	s
O	force
O	was
O	much
O	inferior
O	to
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	Brest
O	fleet
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the

O	of
O	the

O	were
O	visible

O	admiral
O	know
