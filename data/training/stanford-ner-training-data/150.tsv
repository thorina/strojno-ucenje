O	One
O	evening
O	,
O	in
O	times
O	long
O	ago
O	,
O	old
O	Philemon
O	and
O	his
O	old
O	wife
O	Baucis
O	sat
O	at
O	their
O	cottage
O	door
O	,
O	enjoying
O	the
O	calm
O	and
O	beautiful
O	sunset
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	already
O	eaten
O	their
O	frugal
O	supper
O	,
O	and
O	intended
O	now
O	to
O	spend
O	a
O	quiet
O	hour
O	or
O	two
O	before
O	bedtime
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	talked
O	together
O	about
O	their
O	garden
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	cow
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	bees
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	grapevine
O	,
O	which
O	clambered
O	over
O	the
O	cottage
O	wall
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	grapes
O	were
O	beginning
O	to
O	turn
O	purple
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	rude
O	shouts
O	of
O	children
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fierce
O	barking
O	of
O	dogs
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	village
O	near
O	at
O	hand
O	,
O	grew
O	louder
O	and
O	louder
O	,
O	until
O	,
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	hardly
O	possible
O	for
O	Baucis
O	and
O	Philemon

O	would

O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	to

O	them
O	better
O	and
O	more
O	bountifully
O	than
O	their

O	Their
O	cottage
O	stood
O	on
O	a
O	rising
O	ground
O	,
O	at
O	some
O	short
O	distance
O	from
O	a
O	village
O	,
O	which
O	lay
O	in
O	a
O	hollow
O	valley
O	that
O	was
O	about
O	half
O	a
O	mile
O	in
O	breadth
O	.
O	This
O	valley
O	,
O	in
O	past
O	ages
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	world
O	was
O	new
O	,
O	had
O	probably
O	been
O	the
O	bed
O	of
O	a
O	lake
O	.
O	There
O	,
O	fishes
O	had
O	glided
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	in
O	the
O	depths
O	,
O	and
O	water
O	weeds
O	had
O	grown
O	along
O	the
O	margin
O	,
O	and
O	trees
O	and

O	had
O	seen
O	their
O	reflected
O	images
O	in
O	the
O	broad
O	and
O	peaceful
O	mirror
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	waters
O	subsided
O	,
O	men
O	had
O	cultivated
O	the
O	soil
O	,
O	and
O	built
O	houses
O	on
O	it
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	now
O	a
O	fertile
O	spot
O	,
O	and
O	bore
O	no
O	traces
O	of
O	the
O	ancient
O	lake
O	,
O	except
O	a
O	very
O	small
O	brook
O	,
O	which
O	meandered
O	through
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	and
O	supplied
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	with
O	water
O	.
O	The
O	valley
O	had
O	been
O	dry
O	land
O	so
O	long
O	that
O	oaks
O	had
O	sprung
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	grown
O	great
O	and
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	perished
O	with
O	old
O	age
O	,
O	and
O	been
O	succeeded
O	by
O	others
O	,
O	as
O	tall
O	and
O	stately
O	as
O	the
O	first
O	.
O	Never
O	was
O	there
O	a
O	prettier
O	or
O	more
O	fruitful
O	valley
O	.
O	The
O	very
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	plenty
O	around
O	them
O	should
O	have
O	made
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	kind
O	and
O	gentle
O	,
O	and
O	ready
O	to
O	show
O	their
O	gratitude
O	to
O	Providence
O	by
O	doing
O	good
O	to
O	their
O	fellow
O	creatures
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	we
O	are
O	sorry
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	this
O	lovely
O	village
O	were
O	not
O	worthy
O	to
O	dwell
O	in
O	a
O	spot
O	on
O	which
O	Heaven
O	had
O	smiled
O	so
O	beneficently
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	a
O	very
O	selfish
O	and
O	hard-hearted
O	people
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	no
O	pity
O	for
O	the
O	poor
O	,
O	nor
O	sympathy
O	with
O	the
O	homeless
O	.
O	They
O	would
O	only
O	have
O	laughed
O	,
O	had
O	anybody
O	told
O	them
O	that
O	human
O	beings
O	owe
O	a
O	debt
O	of
O	love
O	to
O	one
O	another
O	,
O	because
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	other
O	method
O	of
O	paying
O	the
O	debt
O	of
O	love
O	and
O	care
O	which
O	all
O	of
O	us
O	owe
O	to
O	Providence
O	.
O	You
O	will
O	hardly
O	believe
O	what
O	I
O	am
O	going
O	to
O	tell
O	you
O	.
O	These
O	naughty
O	people
O	taught
O	their
O	children
O	to
O	be
O	no
O	better
O	than
O	themselves
O	,
O	and
O	used
O	to
O	clap
O	their
O	hands
O	,
O	by
O	way
O	of
O	encouragement
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	little
O	boys
O	and
O	girls
O	run
O	after
O	some
O	poor
O	stranger
O	,
O	shouting
O	at
O	his
O	heels
O	,
O	and
O	pelting
O	him
O	with
O	stones
O	.
O	They
O	kept
O	large
O	and
O	fierce
O	dogs
O	,
O	and
O	whenever
O	a
O	traveller
O	ventured
O	to
O	show
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	village
O	street
O	,
O	this
O	pack
O	of
O	disagreeable
O	curs
O	scampered
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	,
O	barking
O	,
O	snarling
O	,
O	and
O	showing
O	their
O	teeth
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	would
O	seize
O	him
O	by
O	his
O	leg
O	,
O	or
O	by
O	his
O	clothes
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	it
O	happened;
O	and
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	ragged
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	generally
O	a
O	pitiable
O	object
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	time
O	to
O	run
O	away
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	terrible
O	thing
O	to
O	poor
O	travellers
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	may
O	suppose
O	,
O	especially
O	when
O	they
O	chanced
O	to
O	be
O	sick
O	,
O	or
O	feeble
O	,
O	or
O	lame
O	,
O	or
O	old
O	.
O	Such
O	persons
O	(
O	if
O	they
O	once
O	knew
O	how
O	badly
O	these
O	unkind
O	people
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	unkind
O	children
O	and
O	curs
O	,
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	behaving
O	)
O	would
O	go
O	miles
O	and
O	miles
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	way
O	,
O	rather
O	than
O	try
O	to
O	pass
O	through
O	the
O	village
O	again
O	.
O	What
O	made
O	the
O	matter
O	seem
O	worse
O	,
O	if
O	possible
O	,
O	was
O	that
O	when
O	rich
O	persons
O	came
O	in
O	their
O	chariots
O	,
O	or
O	riding
O	on
O	beautiful
O	horses
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	servants
O	in
O	rich
O	liveries
O	attending
O	on
O	them
O	,
O	nobody
O	could
O	be
O	more
O	civil
O	and
O	obsequious
O	than
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	of
O	the
O	village
O	.
O	They
O	would
O	take
O	off
O	their
O	hats
O	,
O	and
O	make
O	the
O	humblest
O	bows
O	you
O	ever
O	saw
O	.
O	If
O	the
O	children
O	were
O	rude
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	pretty
O	certain
O	to
O	get
O	their
O	ears
O	boxed;
O	and
O	as
O	for
O	the
O	dogs
O	,
O	if
O	a
O	single
O	cur
O	in
O	the
O	pack
O	presumed
O	to
O	yelp
O	,
O	his
O	master
O	instantly
O	beat
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	club
O	,
O	and
O	tied
O	him
O	up
O	without
O	any
O	supper
O	.
O	This
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	all
O	very
O	well
O	,
O	only
O	it
O	proved
O	that
O	the
O	villagers
O	cared
O	much
O	about
O	the
O	money
O	that
O	a
O	stranger
O	had
O	in
O	his
O	pocket
O	,
O	and
O	nothing
O	whatever
O	for
O	the
O	human
O	soul
O	,
O	which
O	lives
O	equally
O	in
O	the
O	beggar
O	and
O	the
O	prince
O	.
O	So
O	now
O	you

O	at

O	Their
