O	The

O	and
O	the

O	,
O	in
O	spite

O	fear
O	of
O	the
O	cow
O	,
O	would
O	have
O	gone
O	down
O	to
O	extricate
O	the
O	calf
O	,
O	but
O	at
O	this
O	instant
O	Solomon
O	roused
O	in
O	his
O	lair
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	a
O	hand
O	in
O	the
O	demonstration
O	.
O	His
O	uproar
O	became
O	frightful

O	the
O	cow
O	,
O	more
O	than
O	ever
O	alarmed
O	for
O	her
O	calf
O	,
O	continued
O	to
O	bawl
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	trap-door
O	raised
O	for
O	ventilation
O	over
O	Solomon's
O	stall
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boys
O	ran
O	eagerly
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	look
O	at
O	the
O	grizzly
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	highly
O	entertained
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	.
O	Hair
O	on
O	end
O	,
O	teeth
O	gnashing
O	,
O	Solomon
O	charged
O	back
O	and
O	forth
O	in
O	his
O	enclosure
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	reared
O	up
O	on
O	his
O	hind
O	legs
O	and
O	clawed
O	at
O	the
O	pine
O	planks
O	which
O	shut
O	him
O	in
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	not
O	long
O	continued
O	this
O	performance
O	when
O	his
O	claws
O	caught
O	in
O	the
O	crack
O	of
O	a
O	loosened
O	board
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	ripping
O	creak
O	and
O	a
O	crash
O	,
O	and
O	down
O	came
O	the
O	board
O	.
O	Another
O	followed
O	,
O	and
O	Solomon
O	,
O	ceasing
O	his
O	violent
O	threats
O	for
O	the
O	instant
O	,
O	peered
O	through
O	a
O	wide
O	gap
O	into
O	another
O	domain
O	.
O	His
O	hesitation
O	was
O	brief;
O	he
O	scrambled
O	through
O	,
O	walked
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	open
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	horse-stall
O	into
O	an
O	alley
O	,
O	and
O	sought
O	wider
O	range
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	the
O	boys
O	were
O	a
O	little
O	frightened
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	concluded
O	that
O	Solomon
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	climb
O	into
O	the
O	loft
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	safer
O	for
O	them
O	to
O	stay
O	above
O	than
O	to
O	go
O	down
O	the
O	ladder
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	grizzly
O	might
O	easily
O	push
O	aside
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	half-dozen
O	sliding
O	doors
O	and
O	get
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	barn
O	.
O	The
O	barn
O	was
O	at
O	a
O	considerable
O	distance
O	from
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	so
O	they
O	determined
O	not
O	to
O	alarm
O	the
O	women
O	unless
O	Solomon
O	should
O	get
O	outside
O	and
O	so
O	make
O	it
O	necessary
O	.
O	They
O	sat
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	listening
O	to
O	the
O	monotonous
O	bawling
O	of
O	the
O	cow
O	.
O	Solomon
O	seemed
O	to
O	have
O	lost
O	interest
O	in
O	her
O	noise
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	heard
O	him
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	rummaging
O	among
O	the
O	empty
O	stalls
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	begun
O	to
O	hope
O	that
O	the
O	bear
O	would
O	not
O	find
O	his
O	way
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	stalls
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	heard
O	him
O	scrambling
O	heavily
O	.
O	Then
O	came
O	a
O	resounding
O	thump
O	as
O	he
O	dropped
O	from
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	open
O	mangers
O	to
O	the
O	floor
O	of
O	the
O	barn
O	.
O	Almost
O	instantly
O	a
O	terrific
O	bawling
O	and
O	uproar
O	broke
O	out
O	below
O	.
O	Solomon
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	cow
O	at
O	last
O	.
O	The
O	boys
O	ran
O	to
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	hay-lift
O	and
O	peered
O	down
O	.
O	The
O	cow
O	was
O	directly
O	underneath
O	,
O	had
O	backed
O	up
O	against
O	the
O	buggies
O	,
O	and
O	stood
O	tossing
O	her
O	head
O	and
O	bawling
O	like
O	a
O	crazy
O	thing
O	.
O	Dropping
O	their
O	eyes
O	below
O	the
O	level
O	of
O	the
O	loft
O	floor
O	,
O	the
O	lads
O	saw
O	Solomon
O	coming
O	round
O	a
O	pile
O	of
O	new
O	alfalfa
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	unloaded
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	central
O	stalls
O	.
O	His
O	rage
O	was
O	terrific
O	,
O	although
O	he
O	advanced
O	slowly
O	to
O	the
O	attack
O	.
O	He
O	came
O	under
O	the
O	wide
O	opening
O	and
O	swayed
O	back
O	and
O	forth
O	before
O	the
O	cow
O	like
O	a
O	tiger
O	in
O	its
O	cage
O	,
O	roaring
O	his
O	threats
O	and
O	watching
O	for
O	an
O	opening
O	to
O	get
O	by
O	the
O	lowered
O	horns
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	creature
O	of
O	instinct
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	veteran's
O	precaution
O	before
O	a
O	wicked
O	pair
O	of
O	horns
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	the
O	cow
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	lightning
O	charge
O	,
O	caught
O	him
O	broadside
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	bore
O	him
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	swift
O	rush
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	heap
O	of
O	clover
O	.
O	But
O	for
O	that
O	soft
O	padding
O	for
O	his
O	ribs
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	gone
O	hard
O	with
O	Solomon
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	doubled
O	up
O	and
O	thrust
O	into
O	the
O	soft
O	mass
O	,
O	fighting
O	wildly
O	.
O	Bear
O	and
O	cow
O	were
O	buried
O	in
O	a
O	storm
O	of
O	clover
O	and
O	flying
O	hay
O	.
O	They
O	twisted
O	about
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	bear
O	got
O	his
O	back
O	braced
O	against
O	a
O	stall
O	and
O	his
O	hind
O	feet
O	against
O	the
O	cow
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	bowled
O	her
O	into
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	barn
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	huge
O	grunt
O	she
O	alighted
O	on
O	her
O	side
O	and
O	rolled
O	clean
O	over
O	.
O	As
O	she
O	scrambled
O	to
O	her
O	feet
O	,
O	full
O	of
O	pluck
O	and
O	snorting
O	fiercely
O	,
O	Solomon
O	issued
O	from
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	alfalfa-heap
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	the
O	two
O	faced
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	filling
O	the
O	barn
O	with
O	loudmouthed
O	threats
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	splendid
O	and
O	exciting
O	battle
O	,
O	but
O	Rufe
O	and
O	Perry
O	,
O	certain
O	that
O	the
O	bear
O	would
O	kill
O	the
O	cow
O	unless
O	prevented
O	,
O	felt
O	that
O	they
O	must
O	do
O	something
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	heard
O	their
O	Uncle
O	Joe
O	say
O	that
O	,
O	since
O	Solomon
O	was
O	getting
O	crosser
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	away
O	if
O	anybody
O	could
O	be
O	found
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	get
O	him
O	.
O	Since
O	nobody
O	else
O	was
O	within
O	reach
O	,
O	they
O	cast
O	about
O	for
O	some
O	means
O	of
O	distracting
O	Solomon
O	from
O	his
O	fell
O	purpose
O	.
O	Better
O	kill
O	the
O	bear
O	,
O	if
O	possible
O	,
O	than
O	let
O	him
O	destroy
O	a
O	valuable
O	farm
O	animal
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	as
O	the

O	merely
O	succeeded

O	him
O	to
O	the
O	burrow
O	in
O	a
O	neighboring

O	found
O	it

O	Meanwhile
O	the

O	(

O	Lillian
O	M
O	.
O	Gask
O	A
O	wise
O	and
O	just
O	monarch
O	was
O	the
O	good
O	King
O	John
O	.
O	His
O	kingdom
O	extended
O	over
O	Central
O	Italy
O	,
O	and
O	included
O	the
O	famous
O	town
O	of
O	Atri
O	,
O	which
O	in
O	days
O	gone
O	by
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	famous
O	harbour
O	on
O	the
O	shores
O	of
O	the
O	Adriatic
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	sea
O	had
O	retreated
O	from
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	lay
O	inland;
O	no
O	longer
O	the
O	crested
O	waves
O	rolled
O	on
O	its
O	borders
O	,
O	or
O	tossed
O	their
O	showers
O	of
O	silver
O	spray
O	to
O	meet
O	the
O	vivid
O	turquoise
O	of
O	the
O	sky
O	.
O	The
O	great
O	desire
O	of
O	good
O	King
O	John
O	was
O	that
O	every
O	man
O	,
O	woman
O	and
O	child
O	in
O	his
O	dominions
O	should
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	obtain
O	justice
O	without
O	delay
O	,
O	be
O	they
O	rich
O	or
O	poor
O	.
O	To
O	this
O	end
O	,
O	since
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	possibly
O	listen
O	to
O	all
O	himself
O	,
O	he
O	hung
O	a
O	bell
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	towers
O	,
O	and
O	issued
O	a
O	proclamation
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	when
O	this
O	was
O	rung
O	a
O	magistrate
O	would
O	immediately
O	proceed
O	to
O	the
O	public
O	square
O	and
O	administer
O	justice
O	in
O	his
O	name
O	.
O	The
O	plan
O	worked
O	admirably;
O	both
O	rich
O	and
O	poor
O	were
O	satisfied
O	,
O	and
O	since
O	they
O	knew
O	that
O	evil-doers
O	would
O	be
O	quickly
O	punished
O	,
O	and

O	,

O	hesitated
O	to

O	or
O	oppress
O	their
O	neighbours
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	great
O	bell
O	pealed

O	fence
O	of
O	her
O	paddock
O	had
O	been
O	broken
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	,
O	pleased
O	at
O	finding
O	herself
O	at
O	liberty
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	leaped
O	the
O	others
O	,
O	he
O	ordered
O	a
O	servant
O	to
O	take
O	her
O	back
O	.
O	The
O	mare
O	willingly
O	followed
O	the
O	man;
O	but
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	was
O	seen
O	galloping
O	up
O	towards
O	the
O	house
O	in
O	as
O	great
O	a
O	hurry
O	as
O	before
O	.
O	The
O	servant
O	,
O	who
O	arrived
O	some
O	time
O	afterwards
O	,
O	assured
O	his
O	master
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	put
O	the
O	mare
O	safely
O	into
O	the
O	paddock
O	.
O	Captain
O	I--told
O	him
O	again
O	to
O	take
O	back
O	the
O	animal
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	examine
O	the
O	fence
O	more
O	thoroughly
O	,
O	still
O	believing
O	that
O	it
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	broken
O	down
O	in
O	some
O	part
O	or
O	other
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	gate
O	might
O	be
O	secure
O	.
O	Captain
O	I--and
O	his
O	friend
O	then
O	retired
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	seated
O	at
O	dinner
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	horse's
O	hoofs
O	reached
O	their
O	ears
O	.
O	The
O	friend
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	on
O	this
O	got
O	up
O	to
O	look
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	,
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	mare
O	come
O	back
O	for
O	the
O	third
O	time;
O	and
O	observing
O	the
O	remarkable
O	manner
O	in
O	which
O	she
O	was
O	running
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	,
O	apparently
O	trying
O	even
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	exclaimed
O	,
O	"""What"
O	can
O	that
O	mare
O	want
O	?
O	I
O	am
O	sure
O	that
O	there
O	is
O	something
O	the
O	matter
O	.
O	""""
O	Captain
O	I--on
O	hearing
O	this
O	hurried
O	out
O	to
O	ascertain
O	the
O	state
O	of
O	the
O	case
O	.
O	No
O	sooner
O	did
O	the
O	mare
O	see
O	him
O	than
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	frisk
O	about
O	and
O	exhibit
O	the
O	most
O	lively
O	satisfaction;
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	stopping
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	accustomed
O	caress
O	,
O	off
O	she
O	set
O	again
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	accord
O	towards
O	the
O	paddock
O	,
O	looking
O	back
O	to
O	ascertain
O	whether
O	her
O	master
O	was
O	following
O	.
O	His
O	friend
O	now
O	joined
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	mare
O	,
O	finding
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	keeping
O	close
O	behind
O	her
O	,
O	trotted
O	on
O	till
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	paddock
O	was
O	reached
O	,
O	where
O	she
O	waited
O	for
O	them
O	.
O	On
O	its
O	being
O	opened
O	,
O	she
O	led
O	them
O	across
O	the
O	field
O	to
O	a
O	deep
O	ditch
O	on
O	the
O	farther
O	side
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	what
O	was
O	their
O	surprise
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	her
O	colt
O	had
O	fallen
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	struggling
O	on
O	its
O	back
O	with
O	its
O	legs
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	utterly
O	unable
O	to
O	extricate
O	itself
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	more
O	probably
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	dead
O	.
O	The
O	mare
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	evident
O	,
O	finding
O	that
O	the
O	servant
O	did
O	not
O	comprehend
O	her
O	wishes
O	,
O	had
O	again
O	and
O	again
O	sought
O	her
O	master
O	,
O	in
O	whom
O	she
O	had
O	learned
O	from
O	past
O	experience
O	to
O	confide
O	.
O	Here
O	was
O	an
O	example
O	of
O	strong
O	maternal
O	affection
O	eliciting
O	a
O	faculty
O	superior
O	to
O	instinct
O	,
O	which
O	fully
O	merits
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	reason
O	.
O	The
O	memory
O	of
O	horses
O	is
O	remarkable
O	.
O	The
O	newsman
O	of
O	a
O	country
O	paper
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	riding
O	his
O	horse
O	once
O	or
O	twice
O	a
O	week
O	to
O	the
O	houses
O	of
O	fifty
O	or
O	sixty
O	of
O	his
O	customers
O	,
O	the
O	horse
O	invariably
O	stopping
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	accord
O	at
O	each
O	house
O	as
O	he
O	reached
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	memory
O	of
O	the
O	horse
O	was
O	exhibited
O	in
O	a
O	still
O	more
O	curious
O	manner
O	.
O	It
O	happened
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	two
O	persons
O	on
O	the
O	route
O	who
O	took
O	one
O	paper
O	between
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	each
O	claimed
O	the
O	privilege
O	of
O	having
O	it
O	first
O	on
O	each
O	alternate
O	week
O	.
O	The
O	horse
O	soon
O	became
O	accustomed
O	to
O	this
O	regulation
O	,
O	and
O	though
O	the
O	parties
O	lived
O	two
O	miles
O	distant
O	,
O	he
O	stopped
O	once
O	a
O	fortnight
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	half-customer
O	at
O	one
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	once
O	a
O	fortnight
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	half-customer
O	at
O	the
O	other;
O	and
O	never
O	did
O	he
O	forget
O	this
O	arrangement
O	,
O	which
O	lasted
O	for
O	several
O	years
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	once
O	travelling
O	in
O	the
O	interior
O	of
O	Portugal
O	with
O	several
O	companions
O	.
O	My
O	horse
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	in
O	that
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	before
O	.
O	We
O	left
O	our
O	inn
O	at
O	daybreak
O	,
O	and
O	proceeded
O	through
O	a
O	mountainous
O	district
O	to
O	visit
O	some
O	beautiful
O	scenery
O	.
O	On
O	our
O	return
O	evening
O	was
O	approaching
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	stopped
O	behind
O	my
O	companions
O	to
O	tighten
O	the
O	girths
O	of
O	my
O	saddle
O	.
O	Believing
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	only
O	one
O	path
O	to
O	take
O	,
O	I
O	rode
O	slowly
O	on
O	,
O	but
O	shortly
O	reached
O	a
O	spot
O	where
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	some
O	doubt
O	whether
O	I
O	should
O	go
O	forward
O	or
O	turn
O	off
O	to
O	the
O	left
O	.
O	I
O	shouted
O	,
O	but
O	heard
O	no
O	voice
O	in
O	reply
O	,
O	nor
O	could
O	I
O	see
O	any
O	trace
O	of
O	my
O	friends
O	.
O	Darkness
O	was
O	coming
O	rapidly
O	on
O	.
O	My
O	horse
O	seeming
O	inclined
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	left
O	hand
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	it
O	best
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	do
O	so
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	the
O	sky
O	became
O	overcast
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	moon
O	.
O	The
O	darkness
O	was
O	excessive
O	.
O	Still
O	my
O	steed
O	stepped
O	boldly
O	on
O	.
O	So
O	dense
O	became
O	the
O	obscurity
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	his
O	ears;
O	nor
O	could
O	I
O	,
O	indeed
O	,
O	distinguish
O	my
O	own
O	hand
O	held
O	out
O	at
O	arms-length
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	help
O	for
O	it
O	but
O	to
O	place
O	the
O	reins
O	on
O	my
O	horse's
O	neck
O	and
O	let
O	him
O	go
O	forward
O	.
O	We
O	had
O	heard
O	of
O	robberies
O	and
O	murders
O	committed;
O	and
O	I
O	knew
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	steep
O	precipices
O	,
O	down
O	which
O	,
O	had
O	my
O	horse
O	fallen
O	,
O	we
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	dashed
O	to
O	pieces
O	.
O	Still
O	the
O	firm
O	way
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	trotted
O	gave
O	me
O	confidence
O	.
O	Hour
O	after
O	hour
O	passed
O	by
O	.
O	The
O	darkness
O	would
O	,
O	at
O	all
O	events
O	,
O	conceal
O	me
O	from
O	the
O	banditti
O	,
O	if
O	such
O	were
O	in
O	wait--that
O	was
O	one
O	consolation;
O	but
O	then
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	where
O	my
O	horse
O	might
O	be
O	taking
O	me
O	.
O	It
O	might
O	be
O	far
O	away
O	from
O	where
O	I
O	hoped
O	to
O	find
O	my
O	companions
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	dog
O	bark
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	light
O	twinkling
O	far
O	down
O	beneath
O	me
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	I
O	knew
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	still
O	on
O	the
O	mountain-side
O	.
O	Thus
O	on
O	my
O	steady
O	steed
O	proceeded
O	,
O	till
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	along
O	a
O	road
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	fancied
O	I
O	could
O	distinguish
O	the
O	outlines
O	of
O	trees
O	on
O	either
O	hand
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	he
O	turned
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	when
O	my
O	hat
O	was
O	nearly
O	knocked
O	off
O	by
O	striking
O	against
O	the
O	beam
O	of
O	a
O	trellised
O	porch
O	,
O	covered
O	with
O	vines;
O	and
O	to
O	my
O	joy
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	me
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	inn
O	which
O	we
O	had
O	left
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	.
O	My
O	companions
O	,
O	trusting
O	to
O	their
O	human
O	guide
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	arrived
O	,
O	having
O	taken
O	a
O	longer
O	though
O	safer
O	route
O	.
O	My
O	steed
O	had
O	followed
O	the
O	direct
O	path
O	over
O	the
O	mountains
O	which
O	we
O	had
O	pursued
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	.
O	Another
O	horse
O	of
O	mine
O	,
O	which
O	always
O	appeared
O	a
O	gentle
O	animal
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	constantly
O	carried
O	a
O	lady
O	,
O	was
O	,
O	during
O	my
O	absence
O	,
O	ridden
O	by
O	a
O	friend
O	with
O	spurs
O	.
O	On
O	my
O	return
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	on
O	several
O	occasions
O	attacked
O	his
O	rider
O	,
O	when
O	dismounted
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	fore-feet
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	once
O	carried
O	off
O	the
O	rim
O	of
O	his
O	hat
O	.
O	From
O	that
O	time
O	forward
O	he
O	would
O	allow
O	no
O	one
O	to
O	approach
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	saw
O	spurs
O	on
O	his
O	heels;
O	and
O	I
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	blindfold
O	him
O	when
O	mounting
O	and
O	dismounting
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	on
O	several
O	occasions
O	attacked
O	me
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	my
O	friend
O	.
O	A
O	horse
O	was
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	paddock
O	near
O	Leeds
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	of
O	which
O	stood
O	a
O	pump
O	with
O	a
O	tub
O	beneath
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	groom
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	often
O	forgot
O	to
O	fill
O	the
O	tub
O	,
O	the
O	horse
O	having
O	thus
O	no
O	water
O	to
O	drink
O	.
O	The
O	animal
O	had
O	observed
O	the
O	way
O	in
O	which
O	water
O	was
O	procured
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	night
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	tub
O	was
O	empty
O	,
O	was
O	seen
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	pump
O	handle
O	in
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	work
O	it
O	with
O	his
O	head
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	procured
O	as
O	much
O	water
O	as
O	he
O	required
O	.
O	A
O	remarkable
O	instance
O	of
O	a
O	horse
O	saving
O	human
O	life
O	occurred
O	some
O	years
O	ago
O	at
O	the
O	Cape
O	of
O	Good
O	Hope
O	.
O	A
O	storm
O	was
O	raging
O	when
O	a
O	vessel
O	,
O	dragging
O	her
O	anchors
O	,
O	was
O	driven
O	on
O	the
O	rocks
O	and
O	speedily
O	dashed
O	to
O	pieces
O	.
O	Many
O	of
O	those
O	on
O	board
O	perished
O	.
O	The
O	remainder
O	were
O	seen
O	clinging
O	to
O	the
O	wreck
O	,
O	or
O	holding
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	fragments
O	which
O	were
O	washing
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	amid
O	the
O	breakers
O	.
O	No
O	boat
O	could
O	put
O	off
O	.
O	When
O	all
O	hope
O	had
O	gone
O	of
O	saving
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	people
O	,
O	a
O	settler
O	,
O	somewhat
O	advanced
O	in
O	life
O	,
O	appeared
O	on
O	horseback
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	His
O	horse
O	was
O	a
O	bold
O	and
O	strong
O	animal
O	,
O	and
O	noted
O	for
O	excelling
O	as
O	a
O	swimmer
O	.
O	The
O	farmer
O	,
O	moved
O	with
O	compassion
O	for
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	seamen
O	,
O	resolved
O	to
O	attempt
O	saving
O	them
O	.
O	Fixing
O	himself
O	firmly
O	in
O	the
O	saddle
O	,
O	he
O	pushed
O	into
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	breakers
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	both
O	horse
O	and
O	rider
O	disappeared;
O	but
O	soon
O	they
O	were
O	seen
O	buffeting
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	and
O	swimming
O	towards
O	the
O	wreck
O	.
O	Calling
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	seamen
O	,
O	he
O	told
O	them
O	to
O	hold
O	on
O	by
O	his
O	boots;
O	then
O	turning
O	his
O	horse's
O	head
O	,
O	he
O	brought
O	them
O	safely
O	to
O	land
O	.
O	No
O	less
O	than
O	seven
O	times
O	did
O	he
O	repeat
O	this
O	dangerous
O	exploit
O	,
O	thus
O	saving
O	fourteen
O	lives
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	eighth
O	time
O	he
O	plunged
O	in
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	encountering
O	a
O	formidable
O	wave
O	,
O	the
O	brave
O	man
O	lost
O	his
O	balance
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	instantly
O	overwhelmed
O	.
O	The
O	horse
O	swam
O	safely
O	to
O	shore;
O	but
O	his
O	gallant
O	rider
O	,
O	alas
O	!
O	was
O	no
O	more
O	.
O	Some
O	horses
O	in
O	the
O	county
O	of
O	Limerick
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	pastured
O	in
O	a
O	field
O	,
O	broke
O	bounds
O	like
O	a
O	band
O	of
O	unruly
O	schoolboys
O	,
O	and
O	scrambling
O	through
O	a
O	gap
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	made
O	in
O	a
O	fence
O	,
O	found
O	themselves
O	in
O	a
O	narrow
O	lane
O	.
O	Along
O	the
O	quiet
O	by-road
O	they
O	galloped
O	helter-skelter
O	,
O	at
O	full
O	speed
O	,
O	snorting
O	and
O	tossing
O	their
O	manes
O	in
O	the
O	full
O	enjoyment
O	of
O	their
O	freedom
O	,
O	but
O	greatly
O	to
O	the
O	terror
O	of
O	a
O	party
O	of
O	children
O	who
O	were
O	playing
O	in
O	the
O	lane
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	horses
O	were
O	seen
O	tearing
O	wildly
O	along
O	,
O	the
O	children
O	scrambled
O	up
O	the
O	bank
O	into
O	the
O	hedge
O	,
O	and
O	buried
O	themselves
O	in
O	the
O	bushes
O	,
O	regardless
O	of
O	thorns
O	,
O	--with
O	the
O	exception
O	of
O	one
O	poor
O	little
O	thing
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	too
O	small
O	to
O	run
O	,
O	fell
O	down
O	on
O	its
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	crying
O	loudly
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	narrow
O	way
O	.
O	On
O	swept
O	the
O	horses;
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	leader
O	of
O	the
O	troop
O	saw
O	the
O	little
O	child
O	lying
O	in
O	his
O	path
O	,
O	he
O	suddenly
O	stopped
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	did
O	the
O	others
O	behind
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	stooping
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	he
O	seized
O	the
O	infant's
O	clothes
O	with
O	his
O	teeth
O	,
O	and
O	carefully
O	lifted
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	road
O	,
O	laying
O	it
O	gently
O	and
O	quite
O	unhurt
O	on
O	the
O	tender
O	grass
O	.
O	He
O	and
O	his
O	companions
O	then
O	resumed
O	their
O	gallop
O	in
O	the
O	lane
O	,
O	unconscious
O	of
O	having
O	performed
O	a
O	remarkable

O	and
O	,
O	to
O	exhibit

O	time
O	,
O	to
O	enable

O	to
O	see
O	the

O	,
O	he
O	had

O	the

O	possible
O	that
O	his
O	vigilance
O	in
O	investigating

O	sharpened
O	by
O	the

O	a
O	very

O	following

O	As

O	ground
O	by
O	its

O	of
O	canine
O	companions
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	assembled
O	,
O	the
O	second
O	battalion
O	of
O	the

O	To
O	this
O	unseasonable
O	hilarity
O	Carlo
O	seriously
O	objected
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	actions
O	plainly
O	told
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	his
O	disgust
O	at
O	the
O	conduct
O	of
O	the
O	silly
O	members
O	of
O	his
O	race
O	.
O	He
O	usually
O	remained
O	a
O	passive
O	observer
O	until
O	the
O	exercise
O	in
O	the
O	manual
O	of
O	arms
O	,
O	at

O	in
O	the
O	ceremonies
O	,
O	the
O	caperings
O	and
O	the
O	barkings
O	would
O	become
O	quite
O	unendurable
O	.
O	Our
O	hero
O	would
O	then
O	assume
O	the
O	character
O	of
O	a
O	preserver
O	of
O	the
O	peace
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	make
O	for
O	the
O	nearest
O	group
O	of
O	revellers
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	as
O	many
O	seconds
O	,
O	give
O	a
O	half
O	dozen
O	or
O	more
O	of
O	them
O	vigorous
O	shakes
O	,
O	which
O	would
O	set
O	them
O	to
O	howling
O	,
O	and
O	warn
O	the
O	others
O	of
O	the
O	thoughtless
O	tribe
O	of
O	an
O	impending
O	danger
O	.
O	Immediately
O	the
O	offenders
O	would
O	all
O	scamper
O	to
O	another
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	and
O	remain
O	quiet
O	until
O	the
O	dress
O	parade
O	was
O	over
O	.
O	This
O	duty
O	was
O	self-imposed
O	and
O	faithfully
O	performed
O	upon
O	many
O	occasions
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	parade
O	was
O	dismissed
O	Carlo
O	would
O	march
O	back
O	to
O	quarters
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	company
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	would
O	remain
O	until
O	the
O	last
O	daily
O	distributions
O	of
O	rations
O	,
O	whereupon
O	,
O	after
O	having
O	disposed
O	of
O	his
O	share
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	start
O	out
O	upon
O	a
O	tour
O	of
O	regimental
O	inspection
O	,
O	making
O	friendly
O	calls
O	at
O	various
O	company
O	quarters
O	and
O	by
O	taps
O	turning
O	up
O	at
O	the
O	headquarters
O	of
O	the
O	guard
O	.
O	His
O	duties
O	ended
O	for
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	enjoy
O	his
O	well-earned
O	rest
O	until
O	reveille
O	,
O	unless
O	some
O	event
O	of
O	an
O	unusual
O	nature
O	,
O	occurring
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	disturbed
O	his
O	repose
O	and
O	demanded
O	his
O	attention
O	.
O	During
O	the
O	first
O	year
O	of
O	his
O	service
O	in
O	the
O	field
O	,
O	Carlo
O	was
O	very
O	fortunate
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	shared
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	transportations
O	by
O	water
O	,
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	marchings
O	,
O	skirmishes
O	,
O	and
O	battles
O	,
O	without
O	receiving
O	a
O	scratch
O	or
O	having
O	a
O	day's
O	illness
O	.
O	But
O	his
O	good
O	fortune
O	was
O	soon
O	to
O	end
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	ordained
O	that
O	,
O	like
O	other
O	brave
O	defenders
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	suffer
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	cause
O	for
O	which
O	all
O	were
O	risking
O	their
O	lives
O	.

O	up
O	the

O	so
O	frequently

O	belonged

O	was
O	a

O	It
O	was
O	an

O	specimen
O	of
O	that
O	well-known
O	breed
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	not
O	generally
O	celebrated
O	for
O	any

O	intelligence
O	,
O	but
O	is
O	chiefly
O	remarkable
O	for
O	size
O	and

O	.
O	This

O	Prideaux

O	Turk
O	was
O	sure
O	to

O	attracted
O	their

O	,
O	but
O	Turk
O	seldom
O	condescended
O	to
O	notice
O	such
O	vulgar
O	demonstrations;

O	was
O	a

O	,

O	had
O	apparently

O	was
O	over
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	no
O	more
O	trouble
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	got
O	ready
O	to
O	jump
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	the

O	sprang
O	to
O	his

O	flung
O	himself
O	upon

O	again

O	He
O	threw
O	himself
O	with
O	all

O	upon

O	drove
O	me
O	backwards

O	a

O	I

O	(
O	as

O	and
O	because

O	for
O	some
O	reason

O	I
O	beat
O	him
O	down
O	somehow

O	--I
O	don't
O	like
O	to

O	again
O	three
O	or
O	four

O	with

O	FIRE-FIGHTER'S
O	DOG
O	By
O	Arthur
O	Quiller-Couch
O	This
O	is
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	a
O	very
O	distinguished
O	member
O	of
O	the
O	London
O	Fire
O	Brigade--the
O	dog
O	Chance
O	.
O	It
O	proves
O	that
O	the
O	fascinations
O	of
O	fires
O	(
O	and
O	who
O	that
O	has
O	witnessed
O	a
O	fire
O	cannot
O	own
O	this
O	fascination
O	?
O	)
O	extends
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	brute
O	creation
O	.
O	In
O	old
O	Egypt
O	,
O	Herodotus
O	tells
O	us
O	,
O	the
O	cats
O	used
O	on
O	the
O	occasion
O	of
O	a
O	conflagration
O	to
O	rush
O	forth
O	from
O	their
O	burning
O	homes
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	madly
O	attempt
O	to
O	return
O	again;
O	and
O	the
O	Egyptians
O	,
O	who
O	worshipped
O	the
O	animals
O	,
O	had
O	to
O	form
O	a
O	ring
O	round
O	to
O	prevent
O	their
O	dashing
O	past
O	and
O	sacrificing
O	themselves
O	to
O	the
O	flames
O	.
O	This
O	may
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	be
O	due
O	to
O	the
O	cat's
O	notorious
O	love
O	for
O	home
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	case

O	the
O	dog
O	Chance
O	another
O	hypothesis
O	has
O	to
O	be
O	searched
O	for
O	.
O	The
O	animal
O	formed
O	his
O	first
O	acquaintance
O	with
O	the
O	brigade
O	by
O	following
O	a
O	fireman
O	from
O	a
O	conflagration
O	in
O	Shoreditch
O	to
O	the
O	central
O	station
O	at
O	Watling
O	Street
O	.
O	Here
O	,
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	petted
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	by
O	the
O	men
O	,
O	his
O	master
O	came
O	for
O	him
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	home
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	dog
O	quickly
O	escaped
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	central
O	station
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	first
O	opportunity
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	carried
O	back
O	,
O	returned
O	,
O	was
O	carried
O	back
O	again

O	and
O	allowed
O	him

O	.
O	Henceforth
O	for
O	years
O	he
O	invariably
O	went
O	with
O	the
O	engine
O	,
O	sometimes
O	upon

O	sometimes

O	the
O	welcome
O	news

O	out

O	Downs
O	One

O	a

O	,
O	crossed
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	half-way
O	down
O	the

O	.
O	He
O	stopped
O	at
O	a
O	house
O	called
O	The
O	Den
O	,
O	went
O	up
O	the
O	piazza
O	steps
O	,
O	and
O	paused
O	by
O	an
O	open
O	window
O	.
O	A
O	lady
O	sitting
O	inside
O	saw
O	and
O	spoke
O	to
O	him;
O	but
O	without
O	taking
O	any
O	notice
O	,
O	he
O	put
O	his

O	on

O	we
O	gave
O	him
O	he
O	by
O	no
O	means
O	despised
O	any
O	delicacies
O	he
O	could
O	discover
O	on
O	his
O	own
O	account
O	.
O	For
O	instance
O	he
O	cleaned
O	out
O	a
O	pot
O	of
O	glycerine
O	.
O	Having
O	tilted
O	the
O	lid
O	up
O	,
O	he
O	pulled
O	out
O	the
O	pins
O	from
O	a
O	pincushion
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	saved
O	in
O	time;
O	he
O	was
O	curious
O	about
O	a
O	powder-box
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	mewing
O	downstairs
O	a
O	Peter
O	in
O	white;
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	despise
O	the
O	birds
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	hat;
O	he
O	lost
O	his
O	temper
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	his
O	rival
O	in
O	the
O	looking-glass
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	beside
O	himself
O	with
O	rage
O	when
O	the
O	glass
O	swung
O	round
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	only
O	a
O	plain
O	board
O	.
O	His
O	most
O	curious
O	experience
O	was
O	his
O	first
O	glimpse
O	of
O	the
O	moon
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	saw
O	from
O	our
O	bit
O	of
O	back
O	garden
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	rooted
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	with
O	wonder
O	at
O	the
O	amazing
O	sight
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	called
O	him
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	The
O	only
O	reply
O	was
O	a
O	melancholy
O	,
O	love-stricken
O	mew
O	which
O	went
O	to
O	my
O	heart
O	.
O	*
O	*
O	*
O	*
O	*
O	So
O	Peter
O	rejoiced
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	his
O	youth
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	end
O	to
O	his
O	frolics
O	.
O	But
O	do
O	not
O	think
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	that
O	his
O	education
O	was
O	neglected
O	,
O	especially
O	in
O	the
O	invaluable
O	matters
O	of
O	manners
O	and
O	deportment
O	,
O	both
O	of
O	which
O	are
O	so
O	essential
O	to
O	advancement
O	in
O	life
O	.
O	I
O	taught
O	him
O	to
O	sit
O	at
O	table;
O	to
O	enter
O	a
O	room
O	with
O	grace
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	leave
O	it
O	with
O	dignity
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	I
O	spared
O	no
O	trouble
O	,
O	and
O	Peter
O	became
O	as
O	rigorous
O	as
O	a
O	Chesterfield
O	in
O	the
O	proper
O	observance
O	of
O	all
O	such
O	matters
O	.
O	I
O	can
O	give
O	you
O	no
O	better
O	example
O	of
O	Peter's
O	extensive
O	knowledge
O	of
O	what
O	was
O	right
O	and
O	wrong
O	in
O	the
O	ceremonial
O	side
O	of
O	life
O	than
O	by
O	telling
O	you
O	that
O	when
O	he
O	felt
O	an
O	irrepressible
O	sneeze
O	forming
O	he
O	trotted
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	and
O	sneezed
O	outside
O	.
O	When
O	Peter
O	played
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	he
O	played
O	gently
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	disturb
O	his
O	elders
O	by
O	obtrusive
O	attentions
O	.
O	He
O	never
O	required
O	to
O	be
O	told
O	twice
O	to
O	do
O	a
O	thing
O	.
O	Once
O	was
O	enough
O	for
O	Peter
O	.
O	Then
O	again
O	in
O	the
O	matter
O	of
O	breakages
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	virtuous
O	a
O	kitten
O	as
O	ever
O	lived
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	thirty
O	precious
O	blue
O	china
O	vases
O	on
O	my
O	sideboard
O	,
O	and
O	through
O	this
O	fragile
O	maze
O	Peter
O	always
O	wound
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	without
O	moving
O	a
O	vase
O	.
O	His
O	virtues
O	in
O	this
O	respect
O	were
O	well
O	known
O	to
O	my
O	servants
O	,
O	who
O	never
O	accused
O	Peter
O	of
O	breaking
O	the
O	milk-jug
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	cups
O	and
O	saucers
O	,
O	I
O	can
O	assure
O	you
O	.
O	Like
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	human
O	beings
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	his
O	faults
O	,
O	but
O	upon
O	these
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	impertinent
O	to
O	touch
O	more
O	than
O	lightly
O	.
O	Peter
O	was
O	partial
O	to
O	Fridays
O	,
O	because
O	Fridays
O	were
O	devoted
O	to
O	cleaning
O	up
O	.
O	If
O	you
O	have
O	ever
O	watched
O	a
O	woman
O	washing
O	the
O	kitchen
O	floor
O	,
O	you
O	will
O	have
O	noticed
O	that
O	she
O	completes
O	one
O	patch
O	before
O	she
O	proceeds
O	with
O	the
O	next
O	,
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	took
O	pride
O	in
O	each
O	patch
O	,
O	regarding
O	it
O	as
O	a
O	picture
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	Peter's
O	delight
O	to
O	sit
O	and
O	watch
O	this
O	domestic
O	operation;
O	and
O	no
O	sooner
O	was
O	the
O	woman's
O	back
O	turned
O	towards
O	a
O	fresh
O	portion
O	of
O	her
O	territory
O	than
O	Peter
O	ran
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	freshly
O	washed
O	patch
O	and
O	impressed
O	it
O	with
O	the
O	seal
O	of
O	his
O	paws
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	an
O	explorer
O	would
O	indicate
O	a
O	great
O	annexation
O	by
O	a
O	series
O	of
O	flags
O	.
O	That
O	was
O	a
O	mere
O	frolic
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	about
O	this
O	time
O	that
O	I
O	discovered
O	Peter's
O	power
O	as
O	a
O	performing
O	cat
O	.
O	I
O	tied
O	a
O	hare's
O	foot
O	to
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	string
O	and
O	dangled
O	it
O	before
O	Peter's
O	eyes
O	.
O	I
O	hid
O	the
O	hare's
O	foot
O	in
O	strange
O	places
O	.
O	I
O	flung
O	it
O	downstairs
O	.
O	I
O	threw
O	it
O	upstairs
O	.
O	The
O	hare's
O	foot
O	never
O	failed
O	to
O	attract
O	him
O	.
O	We
O	used
O	to
O	roll
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	together;
O	we
O	played
O	hide-and-seek
O	together
O	.
O	I
O	noticed

O	back

O	out
O	,
O	his
O	head
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	paws
O	crossed
O	.
O	By
O	degrees
O	I
O	taught
O	him
O	to
O	assume
O	this
O	attitude
O	at
O	the
O	word
O	of
O	command
O	,

O	Peter

O	permission
O	to

O	leaving
O	the
O	old
O	farmer
O	to

O	.
O	Together

O	Jack
O	once

O	up
O	his
O	residence
O	in
O	the
O	hollow
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	oak
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	lived
O	on
O	the
O	furred
O	and
O	feathered
O	game
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	returned
O	home
O	.
O	For
O	hours
O	he
O	wandered
O	about
O	his
O	old
O	home
O	,
O	fearful
O	of
O	discovery
O	,
O	now
O	crouching
O	amongst
O	the
O	flower-beds
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	flying
O	in
O	terror
O	at
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	the
O	hall
O	clock
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	ventured
O	into
O	the
O	kitchen
O	,
O	entering
O	by
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	creeping
O	to
O	the

O	dozed
O	off
O	to
O	the
O	music
O	of

O	cricket
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	welcomed

O	another
O	Prodigal
O	Son
O	.
O	Alas
O	!
O	these
O	delights
O	were
O	cut
O	short
O	,
O	for
O	Peter
O	and
O	I
O	were
O	soon
O	compelled
O	to
O	pack
O	up

O	traps
O	and
O	proceed
O	to
O	the
O	seaside

O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	took
O	him
O	out
O	yachting
O	he
O	was
O	compelled

O	,
O	and
O	the

O	rang
O	with
O	piteous
O	calls
O	for
O	help
O	.
O	Peter
O	has
O	never
O	cared
O	for
O	the
O	sea
O	since
O	then
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	deeply

O	the

O	impressed
O	upon
O	him
O	that
O	I

O	a

O	issue
O	at
O	this
O	particular
O	moment
O	for
O	a
O	little
O	bread-crumb
O	expedition
O	.
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby
O	was
O	a
O	careful
O	housekeeper
O	,
O	and
O	finding
O	no
O	crumbs
O	about
O	,
O	the
O	mouse
O	roamed
O	into
O	the
O	silent
O	highway
O	presented
O	by
O	the
O	orifice
O	of
O	the
O	euphonium
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	natural
O	enough
O	that
O	Peter
O	should
O	follow
O	the
O	mouse
O	.
O	Unfortunately
O	,
O	Peter's
O	progress
O	was
O	stopped
O	,
O	the
O	girth
O	of
O	his
O	body
O	being
O	too
O	great
O	to
O	admit
O	him;
O	and
O	my
O	door
O	being
O	open
O	,
O	I
O	at
O	once
O	rushed
O	to
O	the
O	rescue
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	Peter
O	with
O	his
O	head
O	in
O	the
O	depths
O	of
O	the
O	euphonium
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	fierce
O	struggles
O	to
O	vacate
O	the
O	position
O	.
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby
O	came
O	downstairs
O	and
O	entered
O	her
O	parlor
O	just
O	as
O	I
O	succeeded
O	in
O	extracting
O	Peter
O	from
O	the
O	musical
O	instrument
O	.
O	Fiercely
O	was
O	I
O	reproached
O	for
O	Peter's
O	escapade
O	,
O	and
O	humbly
O	did
O	I
O	make
O	his
O	apologies
O	,
O	little
O	knowing
O	the
O	secret
O	of
O	the
O	plight
O	from
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	rescued
O	him
O	.
O	Having
O	soothed
O	my
O	landlady
O	,
O	she
O	at
O	length
O	took
O	up
O	the
O	euphonium
O	and
O	proceeded
O	to
O	apply
O	her
O	eye
O	to
O	the
O	main
O	orifice
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	Peter
O	had
O	damaged
O	it
O	,
O	handling
O	the
O	euphonium
O	in
O	the
O	manner
O	of
O	a
O	telescope
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	thinking
O	of
O	the
O	reproaches
O	in
O	prospect
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	startled
O	by
O	a
O	loud
O	shriek
O	,
O	to
O	which
O	the
O	euphonium
O	imparted
O	a
O	metallic
O	vibration
O	,
O	and
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby
O	dropped
O	the
O	instrument
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	the
O	good
O	lady
O	herself
O	following
O	it
O	with
O	a
O	thud
O	.
O	A
O	wee
O	mouse
O	scuttled
O	across
O	her
O	face
O	,
O	disappeared
O	behind
O	the
O	easy
O	chair
O	,
O	and
O	doubtless
O	rejoined
O	his
O	anxious
O	family
O	.
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby
O	recovered
O	after
O	her
O	maid-of-all-work
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	burnt
O	a
O	few
O	sheets
O	of
O	brown
O	paper
O	under
O	her
O	nostrils;
O	but
O	I
O	had
O	great
O	difficulty
O	in
O	making
O	the
O	peace
O	.
O	In
O	vain
O	I
O	pointed
O	out
O	that
O	the
O	responsibility
O	did
O	not
O	remain
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	or
O	even
O	with
O	Peter
O	.
O	We
O	agreed
O	after
O	some
O	debate
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	German
O	band
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	never
O	afterwards
O	patronized
O	by
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby
O	.
O	I
O	got
O	into
O	further
O	trouble
O	with
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby
O	owing
O	to
O	a
O	greyhound
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	bought
O	at
O	a
O	sale
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	character
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	character
O	.
O	If
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby
O	had
O	killed
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	meat
O	hatchet
O	I
O	would
O	have
O	held
O	my
O	peace
O	,
O	for
O	never
O	a
O	day
O	passed
O	but
O	King
O	Arthur
O	took
O	his
O	name
O	in
O	vain
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	night
O	I
O	brought
O	him
O	home
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby
O	gave
O	me
O	permission
O	as
O	a
O	great
O	favor
O	to
O	chain
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	kitchen
O	table
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	table
O	legs
O	had
O	been
O	mangled
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	is
O	our
O	reason
O	why
O	I
O	called
O	him
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	night
O	King
O	Arthur
O	was
O	taken
O	upstairs
O	and
O	attached
O	to
O	the
O	leg
O	of
O	my
O	wash-stand
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	awakened
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	beauty
O	sleep
O	by
O	a
O	horrible
O	clamor
O	which
O	caused
O	me
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	the
O	house
O	had
O	fallen
O	in
O	.
O	I
O	presently
O	realized
O	that
O	King
O	Arthur
O	had
O	mistaken
O	the
O	water-jug
O	for
O	a
O	dragon
O	.
O	In
O	any
O	case
O	it
O	was
O	smashed
O	to
O	bits
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	noise
O	brought
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby
O	to
O	my
O	door
O	in
O	anger
O	.
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	sorry
O	to
O	say
O	what
O	King
O	Arthur
O	cost
O	me
O	in
O	hard
O	cash
O	for
O	breakages
O	and
O	legs
O	of
O	mutton
O	.
O	Poor
O	Peter
O	!
O	thou
O	wast
O	a
O	saint
O	when
O	compared
O	with
O	that
O	fiend
O	on
O	four
O	legs
O	.
O	The
O	_denouement_
O	came
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	arose
O	from
O	King
O	Arthur's
O	fondness
O	for
O	the
O	ladies
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	nothing
O	remarkable
O	in
O	the
O	appearance
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	lady
O	who
O	was
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby's
O	favorite
O	lodger
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	held
O	the
O	rooms
O	above
O	mine
O	for
O	three
O	years
O	.
O	Rut
O	the
O	lady
O	had
O	a
O	most
O	beautiful
O	sealskin
O	jacket
O	,
O	trimmed
O	with
O	tails
O	of
O	sable
O	.
O	King
O	Arthur
O	had
O	unluckily
O	a
O	feminine
O	affection
O	for
O	furs
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	never
O	dared
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	into
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	fashionable
O	thoroughfares
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	way
O	of
O	following
O	the
O	ladies
O	,
O	not
O	for
O	their
O	own
O	dear
O	sakes
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	the
O	fur
O	which
O	they
O	might
O	happen
O	to
O	be
O	wearing
O	.
O	Whether
O	they
O	were
O	only
O	tippets
O	or
O	dyed
O	rabbit-skins
O	,
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	matter
O	to
O	King
O	Arthur
O	.
O	Well
O	,
O	one
O	unfortunate
O	afternoon
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	leading
O	my
O	greyhound
O	home
O	.
O	A
O	few
O	yards
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	us
O	was
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby's
O	first-floor
O	lady
O	,
O	taking
O	the
O	sun
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	glories
O	of
O	her
O	sealskin
O	jacket
O	and
O	sable
O	tails
O	.
O	To
O	my
O	horror
O	I
O	dropped
O	the
O	chain
O	in
O	taking
O	a
O	match-box
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	pocket
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	I
O	could
O	take
O	any
O	steps
O	to
O	prevent
O	him--_King
O	Arthur
O	was
O	coursing
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby's
O	first-floor
O	lodger
O	at
O	his
O	highest
O	rate
O	of
O	speed
O	!
O	!
O	!
O	_
O	King
O	Arthur
O	held
O	on
O	his
O	course
O	and
O	literally
O	took
O	the
O	old
O	lady
O	aback
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	tear
O	those
O	choice
O	sable
O	tippets
O	asunder
O	.
O	Nor
O	was
O	the
O	base
O	creature
O	content
O	to
O	rest
O	at
O	the
O	sable
O	tippets
O	.
O	Before
O	I
O	reached
O	his
O	victim
O	his
O	mouth
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	sealskin
O	.
O	Let
O	me
O	pass
O	on
O	,
O	merely
O	saying
O	that
O	King
O	Arthur
O	was
O	shot
O	that
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	mews
O	at
O	the
O	back
O	of
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby's
O	,
O	a
O	victim
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	indiscretions
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	I
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	fatal
O	catastrophe
O	which
O	finally
O	drove
O	me
O	and
O	Peter
O	from
O	the
O	shelter
O	of
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby's
O	roof
O	.
O	That
O	lady
O	had
O	a
O	set
O	of
O	false
O	teeth
O	which
O	she
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	depositing
O	on
O	her
O	dressing-table
O	when
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	bed
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	learned
O	this
O	from
O	Sarah
O	when
O	that
O	damsel
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	confidential
O	mood
O	.
O	Peter
O	,
O	I
O	think
O	I
O	have
O	told
O	you
O	,
O	slept
O	in
O	my
O	room
O	.
O	One
O	very
O	warm
O	night
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby
O	left
O	her
O	door
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	night
O	light
O	was
O	burning
O	as
O	usual
O	.
O	I
O	also
O	slept
O	with
O	my
O	door
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	Peter
O	,
O	being
O	hot
O	like
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	us
O	,
O	left
O	the
O	room
O	for
O	a
O	stroll
O	,
O	and
O	visited
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby's
O	apartment
O	.
O	Presently
O	he
O	came
O	back
O	with
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby's
O	teeth
O	between
O	his
O	own--at
O	least
O	I
O	suppose
O	so
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	found
O	them
O	on
O	the
O	hearth-rug
O	when
O	I
O	awoke
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	greatly
O	amused
O	,
O	though
O	a
O	little
O	puzzled
O	to
O	know
O	how
O	I
O	could
O	replace
O	them
O	.
O	After
O	some
O	reflection
O	I
O	went
O	down
O	to
O	breakfast
O	,
O	placed
O	the
O	trophy
O	in
O	a
O	saucer
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	it
O	to
O	Sarah
O	,
O	who
O	screamed
O	and
O	traitorously
O	ran
O	up
O	and
O	informed
O	her
O	mistress
O	.
O	Mrs
O	.
O	Nagsby
O	came
O	down
O	rampant
O	,
O	but
O	of
O	course
O	speechless
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	thankful
O	for
O	this;
O	but
O	the
O	violent
O	woman
O	,
O	after
O	sputtering
O	spasmodically
O	,
O	caught
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	missing
O	article
O	in
O	the
O	saucer
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	lost
O	to
O	all
O	sense
O	of
O	shame
O	,
O	replaced
O	it
O	in
O	position
O	and
O	poured
O	forth
O	a
O	torrent
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	violent
O	abuse
O	.
O	Peter

O	half

O	for

O	larger

O	My

O	a

O	I
O	opened
O	the

O	promptly
O	closing
O	it

O	dropped
O	the
O	cuye
O	in
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	to
O	my
O	surprise
O	,
O	they
O	paid
O	no

O	,
O	except
O	to
O	appear

O	,
O	the

O	showed
O	no

O	I

O	,
O	dogs
O	,
O	horses
O	,
O	cattle

O	to
O	the
O	strongest
O	and
O	boldest--in
O	presence
O	of
O	the

O	find
O	this
O	pretty

O	creature
O	so
O	utterly
O	unconcerned

O	In
O	dropping
O	from

O	he
O	alighted
O	squarely
O	upon
O	the
O	backs
O	of
O	the
O	snakes
O	,
O	whereupon
O	they
O	drew
O	away
O	uneasily;
O	and
O	he
O	proceeded
O	to
O	look

O	sniff
O	about
O	,
O	very
O	much
O	as
O	you

O	.
O	I
O	stood
O	by
O	the
O	cage
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	,
O	expecting
O	the
O	snakes
O	to
O	lose
O	patience
O	at
O	last
O	and
O	enact
O	a
O	tragedy;
O	but
O	nothing
O	happened
O	.
O	The
O	cuye
O	scurried
O	freely
O	about
O	the
O	cage
O	,
O	generally
O	treading
O	upon
O	the
O	irregular
O	loops
O	which
O	covered
O	most
O	of
O	the
O	floor;
O	and
O	the
O	snakes
O	neither
O	rattled
O	nor
O	raised
O	their
O	heads
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	For
O	fully
O	a
O	week
O	the
O	three
O	lodged
O	together
O	harmoniously
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	,
O	on
O	entering
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	the
O	guinea-pig
O	quietly
O	reposing
O	inside
O	the
O	careless
O	coil
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	strange
O	bedfellows
O	.
O	Several
O	times
O	he
O	was
O	squatting
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	than
O	once
O	sitting
O	squarely
O	upon
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	one
O	!
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	wonder
O	if
O	there
O	were
O	anything
O	constitutionally
O	wrong
O	with
O	the
O	snakes
O	.
O	Whether
O	they
O	deemed
O	him
O	too
O	big
O	or
O	too
O	foolish
O	to
O	be
O	eaten
O	,
O	I
O	have
O	never
O	known;
O	but
O	,
O	whatever
O	the
O	reason
O	,
O	they
O	made
O	no
O	motion
O	toward
O	eating
O	him
O	.
O	Unfortunately
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	to
O	return
O	a
O	favor
O	.
O	One
O	afternoon
O	I
O	was
O	writing
O	at
O	my
O	desk
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	tremendous
O	rattling
O	behind
O	me
O	caused
O	me
O	to
O	jump
O	up
O	and
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	cage
O	.
O	The
O	smaller
O	snake
O	was
O	up
O	in
O	arms
O	,
O	skirring
O	his
O	rattle
O	violently
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	larger
O	one
O	was
O	twisting
O	uneasily
O	about
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	showing
O	fight
O	.
O	And
O	what
O	do
O	you
O	imagine
O	ailed
O	him
O	?
O	Why
O	,
O	that
O	miserable
O	cuye
O	was
O	perched
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	coolly
O	nibbling
O	that
O	beautiful
O	rattle
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	only
O	three
O	or
O	four
O	beads
O	were
O	left
O	!
O	In
O	my
O	righteous
O	indignation
O	I
O	tore
O	open
O	the
O	slide
O	and
O	"""snaked"
O	"out"""
O	the
O	vandal
O	as
O	quickly
O	as
O	possible
O	.
O	Afterward
O	it
O	occurred
O	to
O	me
O	to
O	wonder
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	struck;
O	for
O	nothing
O	so
O	alarms
O	and
O	angers
O	a
O	crotalus
O	as
O	a
O	swift
O	motion
O	like
O	that
O	with
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	removed
O	the
O	cuye
O	.
O	The
O	rattles
O	never
O	grew
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	best
O	snake
O	was
O	spoiled
O	.
O	Why
O	the
O	cuye
O	should
O	have
O	cared
O	to
O	eat
O	that
O	mysterious
O	husk
O	which
O	is
O	so
O	absolutely
O	dry
O	and
O	flavorless
O	,
O	I
O	can
O	explain
O	only
O	by
O	adding
O	that
O	rats
O	and
O	mice
O	have
O	the
O	same
O	perverted
O	taste
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	seems
O	fairly
O	a
O	passion
O	with
O	them
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	had
O	many
O	skins
O	and
O	rattles
O	eaten
O	up
O	by
O	them
O	.
O	Shortly
O	after
O	this
O	episode
O	one
O	of
O	our
O	helpers
O	in
O	the
O	office
O	found
O	a
O	nest
O	of
O	mice
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	mindful
O	of
O	my
O	hungry
O	snakes
O	,
O	I
O	contrived
O	to
O	catch
O	one
O	mouse
O	alive
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	rattlers
O	saw
O	him
O	through
O	their
O	screen
O	,
O	they
O	manifested
O	such
O	a
O	lively
O	interest
O	as
O	nothing
O	had
O	aroused
O	in
O	them
O	before
O	.
O	I
O	cautiously
O	opened
O	the
O	slide
O	in
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	cage
O	,
O	held
O	the
O	mouse
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	tail
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	him
O	drop
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	fair
O	illustration
O	of
O	the
O	matchless
O	agility
O	of
O	the
O	crotalus
O	when
O	he
O	cares
O	to
O	be
O	quick
O	.
O	The
O	cage
O	was
O	just
O	twelve
O	inches
O	high
O	in
O	the
O	clear;
O	but
O	before
O	the
O	falling
O	mouse
O	was
O	halfway
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	indescribable
O	gray
O	blur
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	larger
O	snake
O	had
O	hit
O	him
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	improved
O	numerous
O	chances
O	to
O	study
O	the
O	stroke
O	of
O	rattlesnake
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	the
O	swiftest
O	motion
O	made
O	by
O	any
O	living
O	creature;
O	but
O	that
O	particular
O	case
O	,
O	better
O	than
O	any
O	other
O	,
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	conception
O	of
O	its
O	actual
O	rapidity
O	.
O	From
O	years
O	of
O	experience
O	with
O	the
O	pneumatic
O	shutter
O	in
O	photographing
O	objects
O	in
O	rapid
O	motion
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	say
O	the
O	snake's
O	head
O	traversed
O	that
O	twelve
O	or
O	fifteen
O	inches
O	in
O	something
O	like
O	the
O	three-hundredth
O	part
O	of
O	a
O	second
O	.
O	The
O	mouse
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	floor
O	of
O	the
O	cage
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	never
O	moved
O	again
O	.
O	The
O	snake
O	knew
O	perfectly
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	done
O	its
O	work
O	,

O	HARD
O	TO
O	HIT
O	By
O	Ernest
O	Ingersoll
O	The
O	spring
O	weather
O	we
O	sometimes
O	have
O	in
O	March
O	reminds
O	me
O	,
O	especially
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	,
O	of
O	some
O	days
O	passed
O	so
O	high
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	Rocky
O	Mountains
O	that
O	the
O	summer
O	was
O	left
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	.
O	One
O	such
O	spring-like
O	evening
O	we
O	camped
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	timber-limit
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	made
O	my
O	first
O	trip
O	into
O	the
O	region
O	above
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	no
O	trees
O	grow
O	.
O	Having
O	left
O	the
O	spruce-woods
O	quickly
O	behind
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	some
O	stiff
O	climbing
O	up
O	ledges
O	of
O	broken
O	rocks
O	,
O	standing
O	,
O	cliff-like
O	,
O	to
O	bar
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	summit
O	.
O	These
O	surmounted
O	,
O	the
O	way
O	was
O	clear
O	,
O	for
O	from
O	the
O	northeast--the
O	side
O	I
O	was
O	on--this
O	mountain
O	presents
O	a
O	smooth
O	grassy
O	slope
O	to
O	the
O	very
O	top;
O	but
O	the
O	western
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	range
O	is
O	a
O	series
O	of
O	rocky
O	precipices
O	,
O	seamed
O	and
O	shattered
O	.
O	This
O	is
O	true
O	of
O	many
O	mountains
O	in
O	Colorado
O	.
O	Just
O	above
O	the
O	cliffs
O	grew
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	dwarfed
O	spruces
O	,
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	with
O	trunks
O	six
O	inches
O	in
O	diameter
O	,
O	yet
O	lying
O	flat
O	along
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	gnarled
O	and
O	wind-pressed
O	boughs
O	were
O	scarcely
O	knee-high
O	.
O	They
O	stood
O	so
O	closely
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	so
O	stiff
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	pass
O	between
O	them;
O	but
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	hand
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	strong
O	enough
O	to
O	bear
O	my
O	weight
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	walk
O	over
O	their
O	tops
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	inconvenient
O	to
O	go
O	around
O	.
O	Some
O	small
O	brown
O	sparrows
O	,
O	of
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	species
O	,
O	lived
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	very
O	talkative
O	.
O	Sharp
O	,
O	metallic
O	chirps
O	were
O	heard
O	,
O	also
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	blue
O	snow-bird
O	flitted
O	about
O	,
O	showing
O	the
O	white
O	feathers
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	of
O	its
O	tail
O	,
O	in
O	scudding
O	from
O	one
O	sheltering
O	bush
O	to
O	another
O	.
O	Doubtless
O	,
O	careful
O	search
O	would
O	have
O	discovered
O	its
O	home
O	,
O	snugly
O	built
O	of
O	circularly
O	laid
O	grasses
O	,
O	and
O	tucked
O	deeply
O	into
O	some
O	cozy
O	hollow
O	beside
O	the
O	root
O	of
O	a
O	spruce
O	.
O	My
O	pace
O	now
O	became
O	slow
O	,
O	for
O	in
O	the
O	thin
O	air
O	of
O	a
O	place
O	twelve
O	thousand
O	feet
O	above
O	the
O	sea-level
O	,
O	climbing
O	is
O	exhausting
O	work
O	.
O	But
O	before
O	long
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	and
O	stood
O	on
O	the
O	verge
O	of
O	a
O	crag
O	that
O	showed
O	the
O	crumbling
O	action
O	of
O	water
O	and
O	frost
O	.
O	Gaping
O	cracks
O	seamed
O	its
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	enormous
O	mass
O	of
O	fallen
O	rock
O	covered
O	the
O	broad
O	slope
O	at
O	its
O	foot
O	.
O	The
O	very
O	moment
O	I
O	arrived
O	there
O	,
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	most
O	lively
O	squeaking
O	going
O	on
O	,
O	apparently
O	just
O	under
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	cliff
O	or
O	in
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	cracks
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	an
O	odd
O	noise
O	,
O	something
O	between
O	a
O	bark
O	and
O	scream
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	could
O	think
O	of
O	nothing
O	but
O	young
O	hawks
O	as
O	the
O	authors
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	So
O	I
O	set
O	at
O	work
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	nest
O	,
O	but
O	my
O	search
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	sharp
O	squeaking
O	seemed
O	to
O	multiply
O	and
O	to
O	come
O	from
O	a
O	dozen
O	different
O	quarters
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	I
O	had
O	crawled
O	down
O	the
O	rough
O	face
O	of
O	the
O	cliff
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	heaps
O	of
O	fallen
O	rock
O	.
O	There
O	I
O	caught
O	a
O	glimpse
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	head
O	with
O	two
O	black
O	eyes
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	prairie-dog's
O	,
O	peering
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	crevice
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	was
O	just
O	in
O	time
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	open
O	his
O	small
O	jaws
O	and
O	say
O	"_""shink"""
O	_--about
O	as
O	a
O	rusty
O	hinge
O	would
O	pronounce
O	it
O	.
O	I
O	whipped
O	my
O	revolver
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	belt
O	and
O	fired
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	dodged
O	the
O	bullet
O	and
O	was
O	gone
O	.
O	Echoes
O	rattled
O	about
O	among
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	wandered
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	canon
O	,
O	and
O	hammered
O	away
O	at
O	half
O	a
O	dozen
O	stone
O	walls
O	before
O	ceasing
O	entirely
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	died
O	away
O	,
O	not
O	another
O	sound
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	heard
O	.
O	Every
O	little
O	rascal
O	had
O	hid
O	.
O	So
O	I
O	sat
O	down
O	and
O	waited
O	.
O	In
O	about
O	five
O	minutes
O	a
O	tiny
O	,
O	timid
O	squeak
O	broke
O	the
O	stillness
O	,
O	then
O	a
O	second
O	a
O	trifle
O	louder
O	,
O	then
O	one
O	away
O	under
O	my
O	feet
O	in
O	some
O	subterranean
O	passage
O	.
O	Hardly
O	daring
O	to
O	breathe
O	,
O	I
O	waited
O	and
O	watched
O	.
O	Finally
O	the
O	chorus
O	became
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	caught
O	sight
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	singers
O	only
O	about
O	ten
O	yards
O	away
O	,
O	head
O	and
O	shoulders
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	hole
O	,
O	doubtless
O	commenting
O	to
O	his
O	neighbor
O	in
O	no
O	complimentary
O	way
O	upon
O	the
O	strange
O	intruder
O	.
O	Slowly
O	lifting
O	my
O	pistol
O	,
O	I
O	pulled
O	the
O	trigger
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	sure

O	a

O	was
O	my
O	only

O	he
O	had
O	dodged
O	again

O	I
O	had
O	seen
O	enough
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	to
O	know
