O	I
O	set
O	off
O	from
O	Rome
O	on
O	a
O	journey
O	to
O	Russia
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	winter
O	,
O	from
O	a
O	just
O	notion
O	that
O	frost
O	and
O	snow
O	must
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	mend
O	the
O	roads
O	,
O	which
O	every
O	traveller
O	had
O	described
O	as
O	uncommonly
O	bad
O	through
O	the
O	northern
O	parts
O	of
O	Germany
O	,
O	Poland
O	,
O	Courland
O	,
O	and
O	Livonia
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	horseback
O	as
O	the
O	most
O	convenient
O	manner
O	of
O	travelling;
O	I
O	was
O	but
O	lightly
O	clothed
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	this
O	I
O	felt
O	the
O	inconvenience
O	the
O	more
O	I
O	advanced
O	northeast
O	.
O	What
O	must
O	not
O	a
O	poor
O	old
O	man
O	have
O	suffered
O	in
O	that
O	severe
O	weather
O	and
O	climate
O	,
O	whom
O	I
O	saw
O	on
O	a
O	bleak
O	common
O	in
O	Poland
O	,
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	road
O	,
O	helpless
O	,
O	shivering
O	and
O	hardly
O	having
O	wherewithal
O	to
O	cover
O	his
O	nakedness
O	?
O	I
O	pitied
O	the
O	poor
O	soul;
O	though
O	I
O	felt
O	the
O	severity
O	of
O	the
O	air
O	myself
O	,
O	I
O	threw
O	my
O	mantle
O	over
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	voice
O	from
O	the
O	heavens
O	,
O	blessing
O	me
O	for
O	that
O	piece
O	of
O	charity
O	,
O	saying:
O	"""You"
O	will
O	be
O	rewarded
O	,
O	my
O	son
O	,
O	in
O	time
O	.
O	""""
O	I
O	went
O	on:
O	night
O	and
O	darkness
O	overtook
O	me
O	.
O	No
O	village
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	The
O	country
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	snow
O	and
O	I
O	was
O	unacquainted
O	with
O	the
O	road
O	.
O	Tired
O	,
O	I
O	alighted
O	and
O	fastened
O	my
O	horse
O	to
O	something
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	pointed
O	stump
O	of
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	which
O	appeared
O	above
O	the
O	snow
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	safety
O	,
O	I
O	placed
O	my
O	pistols
O	under
O	my
O	arm
O	and
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	snow
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	slept
O	so
O	soundly
O	that
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	open
O	my
O	eyes
O	till
O	full
O	daylight
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	not
O	easy
O	to
O	conceive
O	my
O	astonishment
O	to
O	find
O	myself
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	a
O	village
O	,
O	lying
O	in
O	a
O	church-yard
O	,
O	nor
O	was
O	my
O	horse
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	heard
O	him
O	soon
O	after
O	neigh
O	somewhere
O	above
O	me
O	.
O	On
O	looking
O	upwards
O	,
O	I
O	beheld
O	him
O	hanging
O	by
O	his
O	bridle
O	to
O	the
O	weathercock
O	of
O	the
O	steeple
O	.
O	Matters
O	were
O	now
O	very
O	plain
O	to
O	me:
O	the
O	village
O	had
O	been
O	covered
O	with
O	snow
O	overnight;
O	a
O	sudden
O	change
O	of
O	weather
O	had
O	taken
O	place;
O	I
O	had
O	sunk
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	church-yard
O	whilst
O	asleep
O	,
O	gently
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	proportion
O	as
O	the
O	snow
O	had
O	melted
O	away;
O	and
O	what
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	I
O	had
O	taken
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	stump
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	tree
O	appearing
O	above
O	the
O	snow
O	,
O	to
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	tied
O	my
O	horse
O	,
O	proved
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	the
O	cross
O	or
O	weathercock
O	of
O	the
O	steeple
O	!
O	Without
O	long
O	consideration
O	I
O	took
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	pistols
O	,
O	shot
O	the
O	bridle
O	in
O	two
O	,
O	brought
O	down
O	the
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	proceeded
O	on
O	my
O	journey
O	.
O	He
O	carried
O	me
O	well
O	.
O	Advancing
O	into
O	the
O	interior
O	parts
O	of
O	Russia
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	travelling
O	on
O	horseback
O	rather
O	unfashionable
O	in
O	winter
O	,
O	so
O	I
O	submitted
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	always
O	do
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	custom
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	took
O	a
O	single
O	horse
O	sledge
O	,
O	and
O	drove
O	towards
O	St
O	.
O	Petersburg
O	.
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	exactly
O	recollect
O	whether
O	it
O	was
O	Eastland
O	or
O	Jugemanland
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	remember
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	a
O	dreary
O	forest
O	I
O	spied
O	a
O	terrible
O	wolf
O	making
O	after
O	me
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	speed
O	of
O	ravenous
O	winter
O	hunger
O	.
O	He
O	soon
O	overtook
O	me;
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	possibility
O	of
O	escape
O	.
O	Mechanically
O	I
O	laid
O	myself
O	down
O	flat
O	in
O	the
O	sledge
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	my
O	horse
O	run
O	for
O	our
O	safety
O	.
O	What
O	I
O	wished
O	,
O	but
O	hardly
O	hoped
O	or
O	expected
O	,
O	happened
O	immediately
O	after
O	.
O	The
O	wolf
O	did
O	not
O	mind
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	,
O	but
O	took
O	a
O	leap
O	over
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	falling
O	furiously
O	on
O	the
O	horse
O	,
O	began
O	instantly
O	to
O	tear
O	and
O	devour
O	the
O	hind
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	poor
O	animal
O	,
O	which
O	ran
O	the
O	faster
O	for
O	his
O	pain
O	and
O	terror
O	.
O	Thus
O	unnoticed
O	and
O	safe
O	myself
O	,
O	I
O	lifted
O	my
O	head
O	slyly
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	horror
O	I
O	beheld
O	that
O	the
O	wolf
O	had
O	ate
O	his
O	way
O	into
O	the
O	horse's
O	body
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	fairly
O	forced
O	himself
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	took
O	my
O	advantage
O	and
O	fell
O	upon
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	butt-end
O	of
O	my
O	whip
O	.
O	This
O	unexpected
O	attack
O	in
O	his
O	rear
O	frightened
O	him
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	leapt
O	forward
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	might
O	,
O	the
O	horse's
O	carcass
O	dropped
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	his
O	place
O	the
O	wolf
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	harness
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	on
O	my
O	part
O	whipping
O	him
O	continually
O	,
O	we
O	both
O	arrived
O	in
O	full
O	career
O	safe
O	at
O	St
O	.
O	Petersburg
O	,
O	contrary
O	to
O	our
O	respective
O	expectations
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	much
O	to
O	the
O	astonishment
O	of
O	the
O	spectators
O	.
