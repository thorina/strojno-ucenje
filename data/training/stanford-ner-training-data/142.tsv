O	Queen
O	'
O	s
O	room
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	child
O	and
O	kill
O	him
O	.
O	Every
O	year
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	Bird-Boy
O	'
O	s
O	birthday
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	gray
O	bird
O	was
O	seen
O	.
O	The
O	Queen
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	heard
O	this
O	terrible
O	order
O	,
O	uttered
O	a
O	gasping
O	scream
O	,
O	and
O	seizing
O	her
O	little
O	son
O	from
O	out
O	his
O	cradle
O	,
O	pressed
O	him
O	close
O	to
O	her
O	breast
O	.
O	But
O	although
O	she
O	fought
O	for
O	her
O	baby
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	might
O	,
O	the
O	rude
O	strength
O	of
O	the
O	jailers
O	prevailed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	child
O	was
O	torn
O	from
O	its
O	mother
O	'
O	s
O	arms
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	before
O	anyone
O	could
O	prevent
O	her
O	,
O	the
O	poor
O	Queen
O	beat
O	open
O	the
O	rotted
O	fastening
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	casement
O	window
O	,
O	sprang
O	upon
O	the
O	ledge
O	,
O	and
O	giving
O	one
O	last
O	look
O	of
O	love
O	and
O	tenderness
O	to
O	her
O	unhappy
O	child
O	,
O	leaped
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	surging
O	and
O	pounding
O	over
O	the
O	rocks
O	hundreds
O	of
O	feet
O	below
O	.
O	She
O	certainly
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	dashed
O	to
O	pieces
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	a
O	good
O	spirit
O	of
O	the
O	ocean
O	taken
O	pity
O	on
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	changed
O	her
O	into
O	a
O	great
O	gray
O	bird
O	.
O	Crying
O	mournfully
O	,
O	the
O	bird
O	circled
O	the
O	old
O	tower
O	thrice
O	,
O	and
O	disappeared
O	over
O	the
O	white-capped
O	waters
O	.
O	In
O	spite
O	of
O	his
O	roughness
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	jailer
O	was
O	neither
O	a
O	brutal
O	nor
O	a
O	wicked
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	relish
O	the
O	cruel
O	task
O	which
O	the
O	King
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	killing
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	,
O	he
O	carried
O	him
O	many
O	leagues
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	dark
O	forest
O	which
O	bordered
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	family
O	of
O	charcoal-burners
O	.
O	With
O	these
O	rough
O	,
O	good
O	people
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	lived
O	till
O	he
O	was
O	five
O	years
O	old
O	.
O	And
O	every
O	year
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	boy
O	'
O	s
O	birthday
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	gray
O	bird
O	came
O	flying
O	over
O	the
O	forest
O	from
O	the
O	distant
O	ocean
O	,
O	circled
O	thrice
O	the
O	charcoal-burners
O	'
O	hut
O	,
O	and
O	disappeared
O	again
O	,
O	crying
O	mournfully
O	.
O	One
O	midsummer
O	day
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	merry
O	hallooing
O	and
O	blowing
O	of
O	sweet-voiced
O	horns
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	accompanied
O	by
O	his
O	young
O	wife
O	,
O	came
O	hunting
O	through
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	pretty
O	spring
O	near
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	hut
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	party
O	came
O	to
O	a

O	Out
O	ran
O	the

O	two

O	,
O	to
O	see

O	And
O	a

O	it
O	was
O	,

O	,
O	to

O	the

O	very

O	the
O	charcoal-burner
O	himself
O	lifted
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	up
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	King
O	'
O	s
O	saddle
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	waved
O	good-bye
O	to
O	his
O	two
O	little
O	ragged
O	foster-brothers
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	howling
O	as
O	if
O	their
O	hearts
O	would
O	break
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	away
O	with
O	the
O	King
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	hours
O	the
O	company
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	splendid
O	castle
O	of
O	shining
O	white
O	stone
O	,
O	standing
O	in
O	beautiful
O	green
O	gardens
O	running
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Once
O	at
O	home
O	,
O	the
O	Queen
O	commanded
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	winged
O	boy
O	be
O	washed
O	and
O	tidied
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	charcoal-burner
O	'
O	s
O	rags
O	replaced
O	with
O	a
O	pretty
O	black
O	velvet
O	suit
O	.
O	You
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	was
O	washed
O	and
O	dressed
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	handsomer
O	,
O	more
O	winning
O	little
O	boy
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	became
O	the
O	best
O	beloved
O	playmate
O	of
O	the
O	Queen
O	'
O	s
O	only
O	child
O	,
O	her
O	darling
O	Rosabella
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	if
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	was
O	the
O	prettiest
O	little
O	boy
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	Rosabella
O	was
O	the
O	prettiest
O	little
O	girl
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	sweet
O	disposition
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	a
O	gift
O	even
O	more
O	precious
O	than
O	the
O	gift
O	of
O	beauty
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	lovely
O	picture
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	children
O	building
O	toy
O	castles
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	of
O	the
O	nursery

O	,
O	the

O	streaming
O	on
O	the
O	black-brown
O	hair
O	and
O	silver
O	white
O	wings
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	boy
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	golden
O	curls
O	of
O	Rosabella
O	.
O	Twelve
O	years
O	passed
O	.
O	The
O	bird-boy
O	grew
O	into
O	a
O	handsome
O	lad;
O	Rosabella
O	into
O	the
O	loveliest
O	of
O	princesses
O	.
O	Twice
O	had
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	saved
O	Rosabella
O	'
O	s
O	life
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	saved
O	her
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	by
O	swooping
O	down
O	and
O	catching
O	her
O	in
O	his
O	wings
O	just
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	tread
O	on
O	a
O	wicked
O	yellow
O	viper;
O	he
O	had
O	saved
O	her
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	way
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	fallen
O	over
O	a
O	cliff
O	at
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Every
O	year
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	'
O	s
O	birthday
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	gray
O	bird
O	would
O	fly
O	in
O	from
O	over
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	circle
O	the
O	castle
O	thrice
O	,
O	and
O	disappear
O	,
O	crying
O	mournfully
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	and
O	Rosabella
O	were
O	in
O	their
O	seventeenth
O	year
O	,
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	the
O	King
O	was
O	summoned
O	to
O	war
O	.
O	His
O	enemy
O	was
O	no
O	other
O	than
O	the
O	wicked
O	chamberlain
O	Malefico
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	succeeded
O	to
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	'
O	s
O	father
O	,
O	when
O	that
O	Prince
O	had
O	died
O	some
O	years
O	before
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	good
O	King
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	real
O	father
O	to
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	,
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	shining
O	armor
O	,
O	kissed
O	his
O	dear
O	wife
O	and
O	child
O	good-bye
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	off
O	to
O	the
O	battlefield
O	.
O	The
O	bird-boy
O	begged
O	and
O	pleaded
O	to
O	be
O	taken
O	with
O	him
O	as
O	his
O	squire
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	King
O	would
O	not
O	hear
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	insisted
O	that
O	he
O	remain
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	to
O	take
O	care
O	of
O	the
O	Queen
O	and
O	Rosabella
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	little
O	cheer
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	that
O	unhappy
O	evening
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	night
O	long
O	,
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	thought
O	he
O	could
O	hear
O	the
O	wings
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	bird
O	beating
O	fiercely
O	against
O	the
O	window-panes
O	.
O	A
O	month
O	passed
O	,
O	an
O	unhappy
O	month
O	in
O	which
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	tidings
O	from

O	King
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	one
O	rainy
O	morning
O	,
O	a
O	messenger
O	who
O	had
O	ridden
O	so
O	hard
O	that
O	his
O	poor
O	horse
O	could
O	scarcely
O	stagger
O	,
O	rode
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	gate
O	bearing
O	very
O	evil
O	news
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	battle
O	had
O	been
O	fought
O	,
O	the
O	army
O	of
O	Rosabella
O	'
O	s
O	father
O	had
O	been
O	completely
O	defeated
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	troops
O	of
O	the
O	wicked
O	Malefico
O	were
O	hurrying
O	toward
O	the
O	castle
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	come
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	it
O	was;
O	for

O	time
O	to

O	When
O	Malefico
O	saw

O	to

O	.
O	As

O	But
O	scarcely

O	the
O	bird
O	'
O	s
O	claws
O	touched
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	when
O	there

O	of
O	flame
O	,
O	and
O	the

O	'
O	s
O	mother
O	stood
O	before

O	.
O	She
O	took
O	her
O	son
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	all
O	his
O	history
O	and
O	her
O	misfortunes
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	she
O	had
O	watched
O	over
O	him
O	year
O	after
O	year
O	and
O	gathered
O	the
O	birds
O	to
O	save
O	him
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	troops
O	of
O	Malefico
O	saw
O	their
O	former
O	Queen
O	and
O	heard
O	her
O	story
O	,

O	acclaimed
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	as
O	their
O	rightful
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	him
O	back
O	in
O	triumph
O	into
O	his
O	own
O	country
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	bird-boy
O	became
O	a
O	king
O	,
O	married
O	Rosabella
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	happily

O	was
O	very
O	little
O	wind
O	,
O	and

O	light
O	of
O	the
O	late
O	dawn
O	,
O	the
O	broad
O	,
O	low
O	billows
O	went
O	slowly
O	and
O	unrippled
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	The
O	fisherman
O	cast
O	anchor
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	overboard
O	his
O	lines
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	his
O	boat
O	moved
O	uneasily

O	to
O	its
O	side
O	the
O	oily
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	pale
O	sea
O	broke
O	into
O	a

O	of
O	foam
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	troubled
O	waters
O	,
O	the
O	fisherman
O	beheld
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	astonishment
O	,
O	a
O	man
O	clad
O	in
O	a
O	strange
O	garment
O	of
O	gleaming
O	black
O	scales
O	,
O	struggling
O	with
O	an
O	enormous
O	scarlet
O	fish
O	.
O	A
O	battle
O	of
O	life
O	and
O	death
O	they
O	fought
O	,
O	the
O	man
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	trying
O	to
O	stab
O	the
O	fish
O	with
O	a
O	short
O	dagger
O	of
O	shining
O	steel
O	,
O	the
O	fish
O	trying

O	,
O	to
O	tear
O	at

O	Now

O	swift
O	lash
O	of
O	its
O	bright
O	scarlet
O	body
O	,
O	the
O	fish

O	a
O	long
O	sure
O	stroke
O	of
O	his
O	powerful
O	arms
O	,
O	the
O	man
O	would
O	escape
O	the
O	attack
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	the
O	fish
O	hurled
O	itself
O	clear
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,

O	falling
O	against

O	,
O	the
O	good
O	ship
O	lifted
O	itself
O	from

O	.
O	The
O	Princess
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	human
O	being

O	on

O	.
O	Only
O	the
O	cords
O	which

O	her
O	to
O	the
O	mast
O	had
O	saved
O	her
O	from
O	being
O	swept
O	away
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	water
O	swept
O	the

O	silver
O	fish
O	which

O	at

O	alive

O	over

O	into
O	the

O	.
O	The

O	The

O	Suddenly

O	,
O	a

O	appeared
O	a

O	Toward

O	,
O	over
O	whose

O	the

O	Tied

O	to
O	the

O	cry
O	of
O	the
O	breakers
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	spell-bound
O	,
O	watched
O	the

O	.
O	Now

O	The

O	he

O	Once

O	to

O	The

O	I

O	forgotten
O	exactly
O	what
O	the
O	quarrel
O	was
O	about
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	think
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	the
O	best
O	spell
O	for
O	causing
O	castles
O	to
O	fall
O	to

O	.
O	At
O	any

O	,
O	who
O	considered
O	himself
O	quite
O	the
O	most
O	wonderful
O	enchanter
O	in
O	Fairyland
O	,
O	was
O	furious
O	at
O	being
O	opposed
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	the
O	old
O	enchanter
O	,
O	very
O	angrily
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	to

O	any
O	more
O	and
O	must
O	leave
O	the

O	So
O	the
O	poor

O	up

O	,
O	put

O	,
O	as
O	was
O	to

O	in

O	while
O	the
O	dog
O	,
O	although
O	a
O	good
O	student
O	,
O	had
O	a
O	fancy
O	for
O	writing
O	doggerel
O	.
O	Many
O	and
O	many
O	a
O	time
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	enchanter
O	and
O	his
O	wonderful
O	animals
O	were
O	seated
O	in
O	their
O	armchairs
O	round
O	a
O	blazing
O	fire
O	,
O	talking
O	exactly
O	as
O	any
O	three
O	good
O	friends
O	might
O	talk
O	,
O	a
O	nose
O	would
O	flatten
O	itself
O	against
O	the
O	panes
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	three
O	companions
O	would
O	see
O	looking
O	in
O	at
O	them
O	some
O	stranger
O	whose
O	curiosity
O	had
O	got
O	the
O	better
O	of
O	his
O	manners
O	.
O	The
O	dog
O	,
O	I
O	may
O	say
O	,
O	had
O	grown
O	up
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	fine
O	fellow
O	of
O	the
O	short-haired
O	,
O	white
O	bull
O	terrier

O	the

O	had
O	grown
O	to
O	be
O	as
O	aristocratic
O	as
O	a
O	panther
O	.
O	When
O	their
O	education
O	was
O	complete
O	,
O	the
O	animals
O	came
O	to
O	their

O	him
O	to
O	let
O	them
O	go
O	away

O	.
O	For

O	the
O	enchanter
O	,
O	who
O	loved
O	his

O	but
O	the

O	The
O	echoes
O	of
O	the

O	woman
O	'
O	s
O	boots
O	went
O	rolling
O	along

O	The

O	beckoned
O	them
O	to
O	follow
O	this
O	new

O	disappeared
O	again
O	into
O	the

O	,

O	,
O	all
O	of
O	which
O	she
O	carefully
O	locked

O	Soon
O	the

O	Then
O	,
O	little

O	Through

O	and
O	the
O	sound

O	heard
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	old
O	enchanter
O	gave
O	his
O	arm
O	to
O	the
O	Fairy

O	Then
O	came
O	the
