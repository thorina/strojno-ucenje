O	There
O	was
O	once
O	a
O	king
O	who

O	three

O	handsome
O	in

O	,

O	in
O	their
O	tempers
O	brave
O	and
O	noble
O	.
O	Some
O	wicked
O	courtiers
O	made
O	the
O	king
O	believe
O	that
O	the
O	princes
O	were
O	impatient
O	to
O	wear
O	the
O	crown
O	,
O	and
O	that

O	were
O	contriving
O	a
O	plot
O	to
O	deprive
O	him
O	of
O	his
O	sceptre
O	and
O	his
O	kingdom
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	felt

O	therefore
O	,

O	might
O	pass
O	the

O	his
O	days
O	peaceably

O	the

O	in
O	such
O	a

O	,
O	as
O	at
O	once

O	them
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	succeeding
O	to
O	the
O	crown

O	the

O	they
O	might
O	otherwise
O	spend
O	in
O	so

O	sent

O	The

O	He
O	looked
O	into
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	perceived
O	more

O	five
O	hundred
O	cats
O	,
O	busily

O	for
O	the

O	,
O	for

O	a
O	day

O	.
O	Presently
O	the

O	The

O	in
O	a

O	all
O	the
O	rats
O	and
O	mice
O	ran
O	away
O	in

O	.
O	Every

O	being
O	ready
O	,
O	the
O	horns
O	sounded
O	,
O	and
O	away
O	they
O	went;
O	no
O	hunting
O	was
O	ever
O	more
O	agreeable;
O	the
O	cats
O	ran
O	faster
O	than
O	the
O	hares
O	and
O	rabbits;
O	and
O	when

O	caught
O	any
O	they
O	were
O	hunted
O	in
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	the
O	white
O	cat
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	thousand
O	cunning
O	tricks
O	were
O	played
O	.
O	Nor
O	were
O	the
O	birds
O	in
O	safety;
O	for
O	the
O	monkey
O	made
O	nothing
O	of
O	climbing
O	up
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	white
O	cat
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	nest
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	eagles
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	hunting
O	was
O	over
O	,
O	the
O	whole

O	returned
O	to
O	the

O	ate
O	heartily

O	afterwards
O	partook
O	with

O	of
O	the
O	most
O	delicious

O	at
O	my
O	window
O	.
O	This
O	they
O	readily
O	complied
O	with
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	I
O	completed
O	a
O	ladder
O	long
O	enough
O	to
O	reach
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	I
O	now
O	sent
O	my
O	parrot
O	to
O	the
O	prince
O	,
O	to
O	beg
O	he
O	would
O	come
O	to
O	his
O	usual
O	place
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	wished
O	to
O	speak
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	fail
O	,
O	and
O	finding
O	the
O	ladder
O	,
O	mounted
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	quickly
O	entered
O	my
O	tower
O	.
O	This
O	at
O	first
O	alarmed
O	me;
O	but
O	the
O	charms
O	of
O	his
O	conversation
O	had
O	restored
O	me
O	to
O	tranquillity
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	the
O	window
O	opened
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fairy
O	Violent
O	,
O	mounted
O	on
O	the
O	dragon
O	'
O	s
O	back
O	,
O	rushed
O	into
O	the
O	tower
O	.
O	My
O	beloved
O	prince
O	thought
O	of
O	nothing
O	but
O	how
O	to
O	defend
O	me
O	from
O	their
O	fury;
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	had
O	time
O	to
O	relate
O	to
O	him
O	my
O	story
O	,
O	previous
O	to
O	this
O	cruel
O	interruption;
O	but
O	their
O	numbers
O	overpowered
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fairy
O	Violent
O	had
O	the
O	barbarity
O	to
O	command
O	the
O	dragon
O	to
O	devour
O	my
O	prince
O	before
O	my
O	eyes
O	.
O	In
O	my
O	despair
O	,
O	I
O	would
O	have
O	thrown
O	myself
O	also
O	into
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	horrible
O	monster
O	,
O	but
O	this
O	they
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	prevent
O	,
O	saying
O	my
O	life
O	should
O	be
O	preserved
O	for
O	greater
O	punishment
O	.
O	The
O	fairy
O	then
O	touched
O	me
O	with
O	her
O	wand
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	instantly
O	became
O	a
O	white
O	cat
O	.
O	She
O	next
O	conducted
O	me
O	to
O	this
O	palace
O	,
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	my
O	father
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	train
O	of
O	cats
O	for
O	my
O	attendants
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	the
O	twelve
O	hands
O	which
O	waited
O	on
O	your
O	highness
O	.
O	She
O	then
O	informed
O	me
O	of
O	my
O	birth
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	my
O	parents
O	,
O	and
O	pronounced
O	upon
O	me
O	what
O	she
O	imagined
O	the
O	greatest
O	of
O	maledictions:
O	That

O	should
O	not
