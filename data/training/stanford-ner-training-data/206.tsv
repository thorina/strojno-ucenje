O	It
O	was
O	dreadfully
O	cold
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	snowing
O	fast
O	,
O	and
O	almost
O	dark;
O	the
O	evening--the
O	last
O	evening
O	of
O	the
O	Old
O	Year--was
O	drawing
O	in
O	.
O	But
O	cold
O	and
O	dark
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	,
O	a
O	poor
O	little
O	girl
O	,
O	with
O	bare
O	head
O	and
O	feet
O	,
O	was
O	still
O	wandering
O	about
O	the
O	streets
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	left
O	her
O	home
O	she
O	had
O	slippers
O	on
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	much
O	too
O	large
O	for
O	her--indeed
O	,
O	really
O	,
O	they
O	belonged
O	to
O	her
O	mother--and
O	had
O	dropped
O	off
O	her
O	feet
O	while
O	she
O	was
O	running
O	very
O	fast
O	across
O	the
O	road
O	,
O	to
O	get
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	way
O	of
O	two
O	carriages
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	the
O	slippers
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	found;
O	the
O	other
O	had
O	been
O	snatched
O	up
O	by
O	a
O	little
O	boy
O	,
O	who
O	ran
O	off
O	with
O	it
O	thinking
O	it
O	might
O	serve
O	him
O	as
O	a
O	doll's
O	cradle
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	now
O	walked
O	on
O	,
O	her
O	bare
O	feet
O	quite
O	red
O	and
O	blue
O	with
O	the
O	cold
O	.
O	She
O	carried
O	a
O	small
O	bundle
O	of
O	matches
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	good
O	many
O	more
O	in
O	her
O	tattered
O	apron
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	had
O	bought
O	any
O	of
O	them
O	the
O	livelong
O	day--no
O	one
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	a
O	single
O	penny
O	.
O	Trembling
O	with
O	cold
O	and
O	hunger
O	she
O	crept
O	on
O	,
O	the
O	picture
O	of
O	sorrow;
O	poor
O	little
O	child
O	!
O	The
O	snowflakes
O	fell
O	on
O	her
O	long
O	fair
O	hair
O	,
O	which
O	curled
O	in
O	such
O	pretty
O	ringlets
O	over
O	her
O	shoulders;
O	but
O	she
O	thought
O	not
O	of
O	her
O	own
O	beauty
O	,
O	nor
O	of
O	the
O	cold
O	.
O	Lights
O	were
O	glimmering
O	through
O	every
O	window
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	savor
O	of
O	roast
O	goose
O	reached
O	her
O	from
O	several
O	houses
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	New
O	Year's
O	Eve
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	of
O	this
O	that
O	she
O	thought
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	corner
O	formed
O	by
O	two
O	houses
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	which
O	projected
O	beyond
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	she
O	sat
O	down
O	,
O	drawing
O	her
O	little
O	feet
O	close
O	under
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	vain--she
O	could
O	not
O	warm
O	them
O	.
O	She
O	dared
O	not
O	go
O	home
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	sold
O	no
O	matches
O	,
O	earned
O	not
O	a
O	single
O	penny
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	her
O	father
O	would
O	beat
O	her
O	.
O	Besides
O	her
O	home
O	was
O	almost
O	as
O	cold
O	as
O	the
O	street--it
O	was
O	an
O	attic;
O	and
O	although
O	the
O	larger
O	of
O	the
O	many
O	chinks
O	in
O	the
O	roof
O	were
O	stopped
O	up
O	with
O	straw
O	and
O	rags
O	,
O	the
O	wind
O	and
O	snow
O	often
O	came
O	through
O	.
O	Her
O	hands
O	were
O	nearly
O	dead
O	with
O	cold;
O	one
O	little
O	match
O	from
O	her
O	bundle
O	would
O	warm
O	them
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	if
O	she
O	dare
O	light
O	it
O	.
O	She
O	drew
O	one
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	it
O	against
O	the
O	wall
O	.
O	Bravo
O	!
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	bright
O	,
O	warm
O	flame
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	held
O	her
O	hands
O	over
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	quite
O	an
O	illumination
O	for
O	that
O	poor
O	little
O	girl--nay
O	,
O	call
O	it
O	rather
O	a
O	magic
O	taper--for
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	her
O	as
O	though
O	she
O	were
O	sitting
O	before
O	a
O	large
O	iron
O	stove
O	with
O	brass
O	ornaments
O	,
O	so
O	beautifully
O	blazed
O	the
O	fire
O	within
O	!
O	The
O	child
O	stretched
O	out
O	her
O	feet
O	to
O	warm
O	them
O	also
O	.
O	Alas
O	!
O	in
O	an
O	instant
O	the
O	flame
O	had
O	died
O	away
O	,
O	the
O	stove
O	vanished
O	,
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	sat
O	cold
O	and
O	comfortless
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	burnt
O	match
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	.
O	A
O	second
O	match
O	was
O	struck
O	against
O	the
O	wall
O	.
O	It
O	kindled
O	and
O	blazed
O	,
O	and
O	wherever
O	its
O	light
O	fell
O	the
O	wall
O	became
O	transparent
O	as
O	a
O	veil--the
O	little
O	girl
O	could
O	see
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	within
O	.
O	She
O	saw
O	the
O	table
O	spread
O	with
O	a
O	snow-white
O	damask
O	cloth
O	,
O	whereon
O	were
O	ranged
O	shining
O	china
O	dishes;
O	the
O	roast
O	goose
O	,
O	stuffed
O	with
O	apples
O	and
O	dried
O	plums
O	,
O	stood
O	at
O	one
O	end
O	,
O	smoking
O	hot
O	,
O	and--which
O	was
O	pleasantest
O	of
O	all
O	to
O	see-the
O	goose
O	,
O	with
O	knife
O	and
O	fork
O	still
O	in
O	her
O	breast
O	,
O	jumped
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	dish
O	,
O	and
O	waddled
O	along
O	the
O	floor
O	right
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	poor
O	child
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	match
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	only
O	the
O	thick
O	,
O	hard
O	wall
O	was
O	beside
O	her
O	.
O	She
O	kindled
O	a
O	third
O	match
O	.
O	Again
O	up
O	shot
O	the
O	flame
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	she
O	was
O	sitting
O	under
O	a
O	most
O	beautiful
O	Christmas
O	tree
O	,
O	far
O	larger
O	,
O	and
O	far
O	more
O	prettily
O	decked
O	out
O	,
O	than
O	the
O	one
O	she
O	had
O	seen
O	last
O	Christmas
O	Eve
O	through
O	the
O	glass
O	doors
O	of
O	the
O	rich
O	merchant's
O	house

O	Hundreds
O	of
O	wax
O	tapers
O	lighted
O	up
O	the
O	green
O	branches
O	,
O	and
O	tiny
O	painted
O	figures
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	seen
O	in
O	the
O	shop
O	windows
O	,
O	looked
O	down
O	from
O	the

O	The
O	child
O	stretched
O	out
O	her
O	hands
O	towards
O	them
O	in
O	delight
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	that
O	moment
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	match
O	was
O	quenched
O	.
O	Still
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	Christmas
O	candles
O	burned
O	higher
O	and
O	higher--she
O	beheld
O	them
O	beaming
O	like
O	stars
O	in
