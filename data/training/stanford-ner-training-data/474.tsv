O	Long
O	,
O	long
O	before
O	Columbus
O	came
O	to
O	America
O	,
O	the
O	Red
O	Children
O	were
O	here
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	the
O	first
O	and
O	only
O	real
O	Americans
O	.
O	From
O	the
O	Big
O	Sea
O	Water
O	on
O	the
O	east
O	to
O	the
O	Big
O	Sea
O	Water
O	on
O	the
O	west
O	,
O	ranged
O	these
O	Children
O	of
O	the
O	Sun
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	called
O	themselves
O	.
O	Happy
O	and
O	free
O	as
O	the
O	sunlight
O	and
O	air
O	about
O	them
O	,
O	they
O	ran
O	through
O	wide
O	forests
O	all
O	their
O	own
O	,
O	or
O	plied
O	their
O	bark
O	canoes
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	streams
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Indian
O	had
O	a
O	dream
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	long
O	before
O	Columbus
O	dreamed
O	his
O	dream
O	of
O	the
O	Western
O	World
O	.
O	In
O	his
O	dream
O	the
O	Indian
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	White
O	Bird
O	coming
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	east
O	.
O	Its
O	wings
O	were
O	stretched
O	wide
O	to
O	the
O	north
O	and
O	south
O	.
O	With
O	great
O	strength
O	and
O	speed
O	,
O	it
O	swept
O	toward
O	the
O	setting
O	sun
O	.
O	In
O	fear
O	and
O	wonder
O	the
O	Indian
O	watched
O	this
O	giant
O	White
O	Bird
O	appear
O	and
O	disappear
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	its
O	meaning
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Indian's
O	heart
O	was
O	sad
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	White
O	man
O	came
O	.
O	From
O	the
O	Big
O	Sea
O	Water
O	on
O	the
O	east
O	he
O	came
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	great
O	white-winged
O	canoe
O	.
O	With
O	one
O	hand
O	pointing
O	to
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	extended
O	to
O	the
O	Red
O	man
O	he
O	came
O	.
O	He
O	asked
O	for
O	a
O	small
O	seat
O	.
O	A
O	seat
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	a
O	buffalo
O	skin
O	would
O	be
O	quite
O	large
O	enough
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	,
O	the
O	Red
O	Children
O	greeted
O	the
O	White
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	him
O	"""brother"
O	.
O	""""
O	They
O	gave
O	him
O	the
O	seat
O	he
O	asked
O	.
O	They
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	large
O	buffalo
O	skin
O	also
O	,
O	and
O	showed
O	him
O	where
O	he
O	could
O	spread
O	it
O	by
O	their
O	council
O	fire
O	.
O	The
O	White
O	man
O	took
O	the
O	buffalo
O	skin
O	.
O	He
O	thanked
O	his
O	Red
O	brother
O	in
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	cut
O	the
O	skin
O	into
O	many
O	,
O	many
O	small
O	strips
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	whole
O	buffalo
O	skin
O	had
O	been
O	cut
O	into
O	narrow
O	strips
O	,
O	he
O	tied
O	the
O	strips
O	together
O	.
O	They
O	made
O	a
O	long
O	cord
O	that
O	would
O	reach
O	over
O	a
O	long
O	trail
O	.
O	In
O	amazement
O	the
O	Indians
O	watched
O	the
O	White
O	man
O	while
O	he
O	measured
O	off
O	a
O	seat
O	as
O	long
O	and
O	as
O	broad
O	as
O	this
O	cord
O	would
O	reach
O	around
O	.
O	The
O	"""small"
O	seat
O	,
O	""""
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	a
O	buffalo
O	skin
O	,
O	became
O	a
O	tract
O	of
O	land
O	.
O	Soon
O	the
O	White
O	man
O	asked
O	for
O	another
O	seat
O	.
O	This
O	time
O	his
O	seat
O	took
O	in
O	the
O	Indians'
O	lodges
O	and
O	camp
O	fire
O	.
O	He
O	asked
O	the
O	Indians
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	move
O	on
O	a
O	few
O	arrow
O	flights
O	.
O	This
O	they
O	did
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	White
O	man
O	wanted
O	another
O	seat
O	.
O	Each
O	time
O	it
O	took
O	a
O	larger
O	skin
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	sit
O	upon
O	.
O	This
O	time
O	the
O	skin
O	stretched
O	so
O	far
O	that
O	it
O	covered
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	Indians'
O	hunting
O	and
O	fishing
O	grounds
O	.
O	Again
O	the
O	Indians
O	moved
O	on
O	.
O	Again
O	the
O	White
O	man
O	followed
O	.
O	Each
O	time
O	his
O	seat
O	grew
O	larger
O	,
O	until
O	the
O	Indian
O	had
O	a
O	place
O	but
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	a
O	buffalo
O	skin
O	on
O	which
O	to
O	sit
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	the
O	White
O	man
O	came
O	.
O	Like
O	a
O	great
O	White
O	Bird
O	that
O	swept
O	from
O	the
O	Big
O	Sea
O	Water
O	on
O	the
O	east
O	to
O	the
O	Big
O	Sea
O	Water
O	on
O	the
O	west
O	,
O	the
O	White
O	man
O	came;
O	and
O	he
O	drove
O	the
O	Indian
O	from
O	the
O	rising
O	to
O	the
O	setting
O	sun
O	.
