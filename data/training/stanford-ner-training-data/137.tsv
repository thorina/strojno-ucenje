O	All
O	alone
O	he
O	sat
O	save
O	for

O	,
O	the

O	And
O	it
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	loved
O	its
O	master
O	well
O	,
O	blinked
O	a
O	tear
O	from
O	its
O	eye
O	as
O	it
O	peered
O	into
O	Lord

O	,

O	and

O	again

O	grown
O	.
O	'Now
O	what

O	it
O	ruffled
O	its

O	in
O	its
O	distress
O	.
O	Lord
O	William
O	looked
O	up
O	and
O	stroked

O	the
O	tired
O	face
O	of
O	his
O	master
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	began
O	to

O	sorely
O	did
O	he
O	grieve
O	when
O	he
O	saw

O	Then
O	her
O	father
O	pledged
O	his
O	word
O	that
O	all
O	should
O	be
O	done
O	as
O	she
O	wished
O	.
O	Now
O	as
O	her
O	father
O	left
O	her
O	room
O	,
O	the
O	lady
O	sent
O	her
O	four-and-twenty
O	maidens
O	down

O	a
O	sleeping

O	which
O	she
O	had
O	already
O	prepared
O	in

O	.
O	This
O	draught
O	would

O	Her
O	cruel

O	came
O	up

O	the
O	room
O	.
O	She
O	did

O	,
O	and
O	when

O	placing
O	some
O	lead
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	goblet
O	,

O	over
O	the

O	with
O	an

O	When
O	the

O	on
O	to
O	the

O	shouted
O	the
O	cruel
O	stepmother

O	to
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	room
O	,
O	for
O	now
O	she
O	believed
O	the
O	maiden
O	was
O	really
O	dead
O	.
O	'Alas
O	,
O	alas

O	'
O	cried
O	her
O	father
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	and
O	saw
O	his
O	daughter
O	lying
O	on
O	her
O	white

O	,
O	so
O	pale

O	'Alas
O	,
O	alas

O	Then
O	her
O	seven
O	brothers
O	wept
O	for

O	beautiful
O	sister;
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	dried
O	their
O	tears
O	,
O	they
O	arose
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	There
O	they
O	cut
O	down
O	a
O	tall
O	oak-tree
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	bier
O	for
O	the
O	maiden
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	covered
O	the
O	oak
O	with
O	silver
O	.
O	Her
O	seven
O	sisters
O	wept
O	for
O	their
O	beautiful
O	sister
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	that
O	she
O	neither
O	stirred
O	nor
O	moaned
O	.
O	They
O	wept
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	dried
O	their
O	tears
O	they
O	arose
O	and
O	sewed
O	a
O	shroud
O	for
O	the
O	maiden
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	each
O	stitch
O	they
O	took
O	they
O	fastened
O	into
O	it
O	a
O	little
O	silver
O	bell
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	duke
O	,
O	her
O	father
O	,
O	had
O	pledged
O	his
O	word
O	that
O	his
O	daughter
O	should
O	be
O	carried
O	,
O	ere
O	she
O	was
O	buried
O	,
O	to
O	St
O	.
O	Mary's
O	Church
O	.
O	Her
O	seven
O	brothers
O	therefore
O	set
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	long
O	sad
O	journey
O	toward
O	the
O	gloomy
O	north
O	country
O	,
O	carrying
O	their
O	sister
O	in
O	the
O	silver-mounted
O	bier
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	clad
O	in
O	the
O	shroud
O	her
O	seven
O	sisters
O	had
O	sewed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	silver
O	bells
O	tinkled
O	softly
O	at
O	each
O	step
O	her
O	seven
O	strong
O	brothers
O	took
O	along
O	the
O	road
O	.
O	The
O	stepmother
O	had
O	no
O	tears
O	to
O	shed
O	.
O	Indeed
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	time
O	to
O	weep
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	must
O	keep
O	strict
O	watch
O	over
O	the
O	dead
O	maiden's
O	seven
O	sisters
O	,
O	lest
O	they
O	too
O	grew
O	ill
O	and
O	thus
O	escaped
O	her
O	power
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	poor
O	old
O	father
O	,
O	he
O	shut
O	himself
O	up
O	alone
O	to
O	grieve
O	for
O	his
O	dear
O	lost
O	child
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	seven
O	brothers
O	reached
O	the
O	first
O	church
O	,
O	they
O	remembered
O	their
O	father's
O	promise
O	to
O	their
O	sister
O	.
O	They
O	set
O	down
O	the
O	bier
O	and
O	waited
O	,
O	that
O	a
O	mass
O	might
O	be
O	sung
O	for
O	the
O	lady's
O	soul
O	.
O	Then
O	on
O	again
O	they
O	journeyed
O	until
O	before
O	them
O	they
O	saw
O	another
O	church
O	.
O	'Here
O	will
O	we
O	rest
O	until
O	the
O	bell
O	has
O	been
O	tolled
O	,

O	they
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	again
O	the
O	bier
O	was
O	placed
O	in
O	the
O	holy
O	church
O	.
O	'We
O	will
O	come
O	to
O	St
O	.
O	Mary's
O	ere
O	we
O	tarry
O	again
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	seven
O	brothers
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	they
O	knew
O	that
O	their
O	journey
O	would
O	be
O	over
O	.
O	Yet
O	little
O	did
O	they
O	know
O	in
O	how
O	strange
O	a
O	way
O	it
O	would
O	end
O	.
O	Slow
O	and
O	careful
O	were
O	the
O	brothers'
O	steps
O	as
O	they
O	drew
O	near
O	to
O	the
O	church
O	of
O	St
O	.
O	Mary
O	,
O	slow
O	and
O	sad
O	,
O	for
O	there
O	they
O	must
O	part
O	from
O	their
O	beautiful
O	pale
O	sister
O	.
O	The
O	chime
O	of
O	the
O	silver
O	bells
O	floated
O	on
O	the
O	still
O	air
O	,
O	dulling
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	the
O	seven
O	strong
O	brothers'
O	footsteps
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	close
O	to
O	St
O	.
O	Mary's
O	now
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	they
O	laid
O	the
O	bier
O	down
O	the
O	brothers
O	started
O	,
O	for
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	shadows
O	crept
O	tall
O	armed
O	men
O	,

O	in

O	midst
O	stood
O	Lord
O	William
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	come
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	bidden
O	to

O	cold

O	Lord

O	goodwill
O	for
O	the

O	grew
O	rosy
O	,

O	the
O	colour
O	crept
O	into
