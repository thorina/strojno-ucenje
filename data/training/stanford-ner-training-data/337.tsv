O	Thus
O	Arthur
O	was
O	made
O	King
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	fight
O	for
O	his
O	own;
O	for
O	eleven
O	great
O	kings
O	drew
O	together
O	and
O	refused
O	to
O	acknowledge
O	him
O	as
O	their
O	lord
O	,
O	and
O	chief
O	among
O	the
O	rebels
O	was
O	King
O	Lot
O	of
O	Orkney
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	married
O	Arthur's
O	sister
O	,
O	Bellicent
O	.
O	By
O	Merlin's
O	advice
O	,
O	Arthur
O	sent
O	for
O	help
O	overseas
O	,
O	to
O	Ban
O	and
O	Bors
O	,
O	the
O	two
O	great
O	kings
O	who
O	ruled
O	in
O	Gaul
O	.
O	With
O	their
O	aid
O	,
O	he
O	overthrew
O	his
O	foes
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	battle
O	near
O	the
O	river
O	Trent;
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	passed
O	with
O	them
O	into
O	their
O	own
O	lands
O	and
O	helped
O	them
O	drive
O	out
O	their
O	enemies
O	.
O	So
O	there
O	was
O	ever
O	great
O	friendship
O	between
O	Arthur
O	and
O	the
O	Kings
O	Ban
O	and
O	Bors
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	their
O	kindred
O	,
O	and
O	afterward
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	famous
O	Knights
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	were
O	of
O	that
O	kin
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Arthur
O	set
O	himself
O	to
O	restore
O	order
O	throughout
O	his
O	kingdom
O	.
O	To
O	all
O	who
O	would
O	submit
O	and
O	amend
O	their
O	evil
O	ways
O	,
O	he
O	showed
O	kindness;
O	but
O	those
O	who
O	persisted
O	in
O	oppression
O	and
O	wrong
O	he
O	removed
O	,
O	putting
O	in
O	their
O	places
O	others
O	who
O	would
O	deal
O	justly
O	with
O	the
O	people
O	.
O	And
O	because
O	the
O	land
O	had
O	become
O	overrun
O	with
O	forest
O	during
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	misrule
O	,
O	he
O	cut
O	roads
O	through
O	the
O	thickets
O	,
O	that
O	no
O	longer
O	wild
O	beasts
O	and
O	men
O	,
O	fiercer
O	than
O	the
O	beasts
O	,
O	should
O	lurk
O	in
O	their
O	gloom
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	harm
O	of
O	the
O	weak
O	and
O	defenceless
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	soon
O	the
O	peasant
O	plowed
O	his
O	fields
O	in
O	safety
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	had
O	been
O	wastes
O	,
O	men
O	dwelt
O	again
O	in
O	peace
O	and
O	prosperity
O	.
O	Among
O	the
O	lesser
O	kings
O	whom
O	Arthur
O	helped
O	to
O	rebuild
O	their
O	towns
O	and
O	restore
O	order
O	,
O	was
O	King
O	Leodegrance
O	of
O	Cameliard
O	.
O	Now
O	Leodegrance
O	had
O	one
O	fair
O	child
O	,
O	his
O	daughter
O	Guenevere;
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	first
O	he
O	saw
O	her
O	,
O	Arthur
O	gave
O	her
O	all
O	his
O	love
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	sought
O	counsel
O	of
O	Merlin
O	,
O	his
O	chief
O	adviser
O	.
O	Merlin
O	heard
O	the
O	king
O	sorrowfully
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	said:
O	"""Sir"
O	king
O	,
O	when
O	a
O	man's
O	heart
O	is
O	set
O	,
O	he
O	may
O	not
O	change
O	.
O	Yet
O	had
O	it
O	been
O	well
O	if
O	ye
O	had
O	loved
O	another
O	.
O	""""
O	So
O	the
O	king
O	sent
O	his
O	knights
O	to
O	Leodegrance
O	,
O	to
O	ask
O	of
O	him
O	his
O	daughter;
O	and
O	Leodegrance
O	consented
O	,
O	rejoicing
O	to
O	wed
O	her
O	to
O	so
O	good
O	and
O	knightly
O	a
O	king
O	.
O	With
O	great
O	pomp
O	,
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	conducted
O	to
O	Canterbury
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	the
O	king
O	met
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	two
O	were
O	wed
O	by
O	the
O	archbishop
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	cathedral
O	,
O	amid
O	the
O	rejoicings
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	.
O	On
O	that
O	same
O	day
O	did
O	Arthur
O	found
O	his
O	Order
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	,
O	the
O	fame
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	to
O	spread
O	throughout
O	Christendom
O	and
O	endure
O	through
O	all
O	time
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	had
O	been
O	made
O	for
O	King
O	Uther
O	Pendragon
O	by
O	Merlin
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	meant
O	thereby
O	to
O	set
O	forth
O	plainly
O	to
O	all
O	men
O	the
O	roundness
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	After
O	Uther
O	died
O	,
O	King
O	Leodegrance
O	had
O	possessed
O	it;
O	but
O	when
O	Arthur
O	was
O	wed
O	,
O	he
O	sent
O	it
O	to
O	him
O	as
O	a
O	gift
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	was
O	the
O	king's
O	joy
O	at
O	receiving
O	it
O	.
O	One
O	hundred
O	and
O	fifty
O	knights
O	might
O	take
O	their
O	places
O	about
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	them
O	Merlin
O	made
O	sieges
O	or
O	seats
O	.
O	One
O	hundred
O	and
O	twenty-eight
O	did
O	Arthur
O	knight
O	at
O	that
O	great
O	feast;
O	thereafter
O	,
O	if
O	any
O	sieges
O	were
O	empty
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	high
O	festival
O	of
O	Pentecost
O	new
O	knights
O	were
O	ordained
O	to
O	fill
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	magic
O	was
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	each
O	knight
O	found
O	inscribed
O	,
O	in
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	proper
O	siege
O	.
O	One
O	seat
O	only
O	long
O	remained
O	unoccupied
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	was
O	the
O	Siege
O	Perilous
O	.
O	No
O	knight
O	might
O	occupy
O	it
O	until
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	Sir
O	Galahad;
O	for
O	,
O	without
O	danger
O	to
O	his
O	life
O	,
O	none
O	might
O	sit
O	there
O	who
O	was
O	not
O	free
O	from
O	all
O	stain
O	of
O	sin
O	.
O	With
O	pomp
O	and
O	ceremony
O	did
O	each
O	knight
O	take
O	upon
O	him
O	the
O	vows
O	of
O	true
O	knighthood:
O	to
O	obey
O	the
O	king;
O	to
O	show
O	mercy
O	to
O	all
O	who
O	asked
O	it;
O	to
O	defend
O	the
O	weak;
O	and
O	for
O	no
O	worldly
O	gain
O	to
O	fight
O	in
O	a
O	wrongful
O	cause:
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	rejoiced
O	together
O	,
O	doing
O	honor
O	to
O	Arthur
O	and
O	to
O	his
O	queen
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	rode
O	forth
O	to
O	right
O	the
O	wrong
O	and
O	help
O	the
O	oppressed
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	their
O	aid
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	held
O	his
O	realm
O	in
O	peace
O	,
O	doing
O	justice
O	to
O	all
O	.
