O	cavern
O	on
O	St

O	Michael's

O	to

O	drew
O	close
O	up
O	to

O	a
O	blow
O	at

O	sword
O	of
O	sharpness;
O	but

O	missed
O	his
O	aim

O	only
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	nose
O	.

O	roared

O	pain
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	roars
O	were
O	like
O	claps

O	He
O	took
O	up

O	behind

O	and
O	jumping
O	upon
O	the
O	block
O	of
O	wood

O	Having

O	killed

O	Jack
O	entered

O	and
O	began
O	to
O	run
O	,
O	the
O	giant
O	following
O	him
O	like
O	a
O	walking
O	castle
O	.
O	Jack
O	led
O	him
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	ran
O	over
O	the
O	drawbridge
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	giant
O	rushed
O	after
O	him
O	with
O	his
O	club
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	bridge
O	,
O	where
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	cut
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	,
O	his
O	great
O	weight
O	broke
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	tumbled
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	.
O	Jack
O	now
O	got
O	a
O	cart
O	rope
O	and
O	flung
O	it
O	over
O	his
O	two
O	heads
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	a
O	team
O	of
O	horses
O	,
O	drew
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	moat
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	heads
O	.
O	Once
O	again
O	,
O	Jack
O	set
O	out
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	new
O	adventures
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	over
O	fields
O	and
O	dales
O	without
O	meeting
O	with
O	any
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	a
O	high
O	mountain
O	.
O	Here
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	lonely
O	house;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	knocked
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	it
O	was
O	opened
O	by
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	with
O	a
O	beard
O	as
O	white
O	as
O	snow
O	.
O	This
O	old
O	man
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	hermit
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	Jack
O	had
O	eaten
O	well
O	,
O	he
O	said:
O	"""My"
O	son
O	,
O	I
O	know
O	that
O	you
O	are
O	the
O	famous
O	conqueror
O	of
O	giants
O	.
O	I
O	know
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	this
O	mountain
O	there
O	is
O	an
O	enchanted
O	castle
O	,
O	kept
O	by
O	a
O	giant
O	named
O	Galligantes
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	help
O	of
O	a
O	magician
O	,
O	gets
O	many
O	knights
O	into
O	his
O	power--whom
O	he
O	changes
O	into
O	beasts
O	.
O	Above
O	all
O	,
O	I
O	lament
O	the
O	hard
O	fate
O	of
O	a
O	duke's
O	daughter
O	,
O	whom
O	they
O	have
O	changed
O	into
O	a
O	deer
O	.
O	Many
O	knights
O	have
O	tried
O	to
O	destroy
O	the
O	enchantment
O	,
O	yet
O	none
O	have
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	do
O	so
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	two
O	fiery
O	griffins
O	who
O	guard
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	you
O	,
O	my
O	son
O	,
O	have
O	an
O	invisible
O	coat
O	,
O	you
O	may
O	pass
O	them
O	by
O	without
O	being
O	seen
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	you
O	will
O	find
O	engraved
O	the
O	means
O	by
O	which
O	the
O	enchantment
O	may
O	be
O	broken
O	.
O	""""
O	Jack
O	promised
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	he
O	would
O	risk
O	his
O	life
O	in
O	an
O	endeavor
O	to
O	break
O	the
O	enchantment;
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	a
O	sound
O	sleep
O	,
O	he
O	arose
O	early
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	on
O	his
O	attempt
O	.
O	He
O	passed
O	by
O	the
O	fiery
O	griffins
O	without
O	the
O	least
O	fear
O	of
O	danger;
O	for
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	him
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	his
O	invisible
O	coat
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	castle
O	gate
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	golden
O	trumpet
O	hanging
O	,
O	under
O	which
O	were
O	written
O	these
O	words--
O	"""Whoever"
O	can
O	this
O	trumpet
O	blow
O	,
O	Shall
O	cause
O	the
O	giant's
O	overthrow
O	.
O	""""
O	Jack
O	seized
O	the
O	golden
O	trumpet
O	and
O	blew
O	a
O	mighty
O	blast
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	the
O	gates
O	fly
O	open
O	and
O	shook
O	the
O	castle
O	to
O	its
O	foundations
O	.
O	The
O	giant
O	and
O	the
O	magician
O	,
O	knowing
O	that
O	their
O	end
O	was
O	now
O	near
O	,
O	stood
O	biting
O	their
O	thumbs
O	and
O	shaking
O	with
O	terror
O	.
O	Jack
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	magic
O	sword
O	,
O	soon
O	killed
O	the
O	giant
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	magician
O	was
O	carried
O	off
O	by
O	a
O	whirlwind
O	.
O	The
O	castle
O	vanished
O	away
O	like
O	smoke
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	duke's
O	daughter
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	and
O	lovely
O	ladies
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	turned
O	into
O	birds
O	and
O	beasts
O	returned
O	to
O	their
O	proper
O	shape
O	.
O	Jack's
O	fame
O	rang
O	through
O	the
O	whole
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	large
O	estate
O	to
O	reward
O	him
O	for
O	all
O	his
O	brave
O	and
O	knightly
O	deeds
O	.
O	And
O	Jack
O	married
O	the
O	duke's
O	daughter
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	in
O	joy
O	and
O	contentment
O	for
O	the
O	rest

O	his
O	days
O	.
