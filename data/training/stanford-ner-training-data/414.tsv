O	could
O	not
O	sleep
O	,
O	but
O	watched
O	and
O	wept
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	sang
O	to
O	her
O	baby
O	as
O	they
O	floated;
O	and
O	the
O	song
O	which
O	she
O	sang
O	you
O	shall
O	learn
O	yourselves
O	some
O	day
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	they
O	are
O	past
O	the
O	last
O	blue
O	headland
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	open
O	sea;
O	and
O	there
O	is
O	nothing
O	round
O	them
O	but
O	the
O	waves
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wind
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	waves
O	are
O	gentle
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sky
O	is
O	clear
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	breeze
O	is
O	tender
O	and
O	low
O	.
O	So
O	a
O	night
O	passed
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	long
O	day
O	it
O	was
O	for
O	Danae;
O	and
O	another
O	night
O	and
O	day
O	beside
O	,
O	till
O	Danae
O	was
O	faint
O	with
O	hunger
O	and
O	weeping
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	no
O	land
O	appeared
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	the
O	babe
O	slept
O	quietly;
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	poor
O	Danae
O	drooped
O	her
O	head
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	likewise
O	with
O	her
O	cheek
O	against
O	the
O	babe's
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	while
O	she
O	was
O	awakened
O	suddenly;
O	for
O	the
O	chest
O	was
O	jarring
O	and
O	grinding
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	air
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	sound
O	.
O	She
O	looked
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	over
O	her
O	head
O	were
O	mighty
O	cliffs
O	,
O	all
O	red
O	in
O	the
O	setting
O	sun
O	,
O	and
O	around
O	her
O	rocks
O	and
O	breakers
O	,
O	and
O	flying
O	flakes
O	of
O	foam
O	.
O	She
O	clasped
O	her
O	hands
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	shrieked
O	aloud
O	for
O	help
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	she
O	cried
O	,
O	help
O	met
O	her:
O	for
O	now
O	there
O	came
O	over
O	the
O	rocks
O	a
O	tall
O	and
O	stately
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	down
O	wonderingly
O	upon
O	poor
O	Danae
O	tossing
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	chest
O	among
O	the
O	waves
O	.
O	He
O	wore
O	a
O	rough
O	cloak
O	of
O	frieze
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	his
O	head
O	a
O	broad
O	hat
O	to
O	shade
O	his
O	face;
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	he
O	carried
O	a
O	trident
O	for
O	spearing
O	fish
O	,
O	and
O	over
O	his
O	shoulder
O	was
O	a
O	casting-net;
O	but
O	Danae
O	could
O	see
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	no
O	common
O	man
O	by
O	his
O	stature
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	walk
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	flowing
O	golden
O	hair
O	and
O	beard;
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	two
O	servants
O	who
O	came
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	carrying
O	baskets
O	for
O	his
O	fish
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	had
O	hardly
O	time
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	him
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	laid
O	aside
O	his
O	trident
O	and
O	leapt
O	down
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	and
O	thrown
O	his
O	casting-net
O	so
O	surely
O	over
O	Danae
O	and
O	the
O	chest
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	drew
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	baby
O	,
O	safe
O	upon
O	a
O	ledge
O	of
O	rock
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	fisherman
O	took
O	Danae
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	lifted
O	her
O	out
O	of
O	the

O	in

O	the

O	,

O	bade
O	the

O	bring

O	.
O	So
O	they

O	a

O	and
O	who
O	so

O	And
O	when

O	Perseus
O	hired
O	Phoenicians
O	from
O	Tyre
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	down
O	cedars
O	,
O	and
O	built
O	himself
O	a
O	a
O	noble
O	galley;
O	and
O	painted
O	its
O	cheeks
O	with
O	vermilion
O	and
O	pitched
O	its
O	sides
O	with
O	pitch;
O	and
O	in
O	it
O	he
O	put
O	Andromeda
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	her
O	dowry
O	of

O	,
O	and

O	great
O	was
O	the
O	weeping
O	when
O	they
O	rowed
O	away
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	remembrance
O	of
O	his
O	brave
O	deed
O	was
O	left
O	behind;
O	and
O	Andromeda's
O	rock
O	was
O	shown
O	at
O	Iopa
O	in
O	Palestine
O	till
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	thousand
O	years
O	were
O	past
O	.
O	So
O	Perseus
O	and
O	the
O	Phoenicians
O	rowed
O	to
O	the
O	westward
O	,
O	across
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	pleasant
O	Isles
O	of
O	Hellas
O	,
O	and
O	Seriphos
O	,
O	his
O	ancient
O	home
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	left
O	his
O	galley
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	up
O	as
O	of
O	old;
O	and
O	he
O	embraced
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	and
O	Dictys
O	his
O	good
O	foster-father
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	wept
O	over
O	each
O	other
O	a
O	long
O	while
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	seven
O	years
O	and
O	more
O	since
O	they
O	had
O	met
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	went
O	home
O	to
O	Argos
O	,
O	and
O	reigned
O	there
O	well
O	with
O	fair
O	Andromeda
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	the
O	gods
O	was
O	accomplished
O	towards
O	Acrisius
O	,
O	his
O	grandfather
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	died
O	from
O	the
O	falling
O	of
O	a
O	quoit
O	which
O	Perseus
O	had
O	thrown
O	in
O	a
O	game
O	.
O	Perseus
O	and
O	Andromeda
O	had
O	four
O	sons
O	and
O	three
O	daughters
O	,
O	and
O	died
O	in
O	a
O	good

O	.
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	died
O	,
O	the
O	ancients
O	say
O	,
O	Athene
O	took
O	them
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	with
O	Cepheus
O	and
O	Cassiopoeia
O	.
O	And
O	there
O	on
O	starlight
O	nights
O	you
O	may
O	see
O	them
O	shining
O	still;
O	Cepheus
O	with
O	his
O	kingly
O	crown
O	,
O	and
O	Cassiopoeia
O	in
O	her
O	ivory
O	chair
O	,
O	plaiting
O	her
O	star-
O	spangled
O	tresses
O	,
O	and
O	Perseus
O	with
O	the
O	Gorgon's
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	fair
O	Andromeda
O	beside
O	him
O	,
O	spreading
O	her
O	long
O	white
O	arms
O	across
O	the
O	heavens
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	stood
O	when
O	chained
O	to
O	the
O	stone
O	for
O	the
O	monster
O	.
O	All
O	night
O	long
O	they
O	shine
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	beacon
O	to
O	wandering
O	sailors;
O	but
O	all
O	day
O	they
O	feast
O	with
O	the
O	gods
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	still
O	blue
O	peaks
O	of
