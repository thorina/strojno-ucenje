O	There
O	was
O	one
O	shadow
O	which
O	always
O	fell
O	over
O	Asgard
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	in
O	the
O	long
O	years
O	the
O	gods
O	almost
O	forgot
O	it
O	,
O	it
O	lay
O	so
O	far
O	off
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	dim
O	cloud
O	in
O	a
O	clear
O	sky;
O	but
O	Odin
O	saw
O	it
O	deepen
O	and
O	widen
O	as
O	he
O	looked
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	universe
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	last
O	great
O	battle
O	would
O	surely
O	come
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	gods
O	themselves
O	would
O	be
O	destroyed
O	and
O	a
O	long
O	twilight
O	would
O	rest
O	on
O	all
O	the
O	worlds;
O	and
O	now
O	the
O	day
O	was
O	close
O	at
O	hand
O	.
O	Misfortunes
O	never
O	come
O	singly
O	to
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	to
O	the
O	gods
O	.
O	Idun
O	,
O	the
O	beautiful
O	goddess
O	of
O	youth
O	,
O	whose
O	apples
O	were
O	the
O	joy
O	of
O	all
O	Asgard
O	,
O	made
O	a
O	resting
O	place
O	for
O	herself
O	among
O	the
O	massive
O	branches
O	of
O	Yggdrasil
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	every
O	evening
O	came
O	Brage
O	,
O	and
O	sang
O	so
O	sweetly
O	that
O	the
O	birds
O	stopped
O	to
O	listen
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	the
O	Norns
O	,
O	those
O	implacable
O	sisters
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	were
O	softened
O	by
O	the
O	melody
O	.
O	But
O	poetry
O	cannot
O	change
O	the
O	purposes
O	of
O	fate
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	evening
O	no
O	song
O	was
O	heard
O	of
O	Brage
O	or
O	birds
O	,
O	the
O	leaves
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	tree
O	hung
O	withered
O	and
O	lifeless
O	on
O	the
O	branches
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fountain
O	from
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	daily
O	been
O	sprinkled
O	was
O	dry
O	at
O	last
O	.
O	Idun
O	had
O	fallen
O	into
O	the
O	dark
O	valley
O	of
O	death
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	Brage
O	,
O	Heimdal
O	,
O	and
O	Loki
O	went
O	to
O	question
O	her
O	about
O	the
O	future
O	she
O	could
O	answer
O	them
O	only
O	with
O	tears
O	.
O	Brage
O	would
O	not
O	leave
O	his
O	beautiful
O	wife
O	alone
O	amid
O	the
O	dim
O	shades
O	that
O	crowded
O	the
O	dreary
O	valley
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	youth
O	and
O	genius
O	vanished
O	out
O	of
O	Asgard
O	forever
O	.
O	Balder
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	godlike
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	gods
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	purest
O	and
O	the
O	best
O	.
O	Wherever
O	he
O	went
O	his
O	coming
O	was
O	like
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	sunshine
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	beauty
O	of
O	summer
O	was
O	but
O	the
O	shining
O	of
O	his
O	face
O	.
O	When
O	men's
O	hearts
O	were
O	white
O	like
O	the
O	light
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	lives
O	clear
O	as
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	because
O	Balder
O	was
O	looking
O	down
O	upon
O	them
O	with
O	those
O	soft
O	,
O	clear
O	eyes
O	that
O	were
O	open
O	windows
O	to
O	the
O	soul
O	of
O	God
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	always
O	lived
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	glow
O	of
O	brightness
O	that
O	no
O	darkness
O	had
O	ever
O	touched
O	him;
O	but
O	one
O	morning
O	,
O	after
O	Idun
O	and
O	Brage
O	had
O	gone
O	,
O	Balder's
O	face
O	was
O	sad
O	and
O	troubled
O	.
O	He
O	walked
O	slowly
O	from
O	room
O	to
O	room
O	in
O	his
O	palace
O	Breidablik
O	,
O	stainless
O	as
O	the
O	sky
O	when
O	April
O	showers
O	have
O	swept
O	across
O	it
O	because
O	no
O	impure
O	thing
O	had
O	ever
O	crossed
O	the
O	threshold
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	eyes
O	were
O	heavy
O	with
O	sorrow
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	night
O	terrible
O	dreams
O	had
O	broken
O	his
O	sleep
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	it
O	a
O	long
O	torture
O	.
O	The
O	air
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	full
O	of
O	awful
O	changes
O	for
O	him
O	and
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	gods
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	in
O	his
O	soul
O	that
O	the
O	shadow
O	of
O	the
O	last
O	great
O	day
O	was
O	sweeping
O	on;
O	as
O	he
O	looked
O	out
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	worlds
O	lying
O	in
O	light
O	and
O	beauty
O	,
O	the
O	fields
O	yellow
O	with
O	waving
O	grain
O	,
O	the
O	deep
O	fiords
O	flashing
O	back
O	the
O	sunbeams
O	from
O	their
O	clear
O	depths
O	,
O	the
O	verdure
O	clothing
O	the
O	loftiest
O	mountains
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	that
O	over
O	all
O	this
O	darkness
O	and
O	desolation
O	would
O	come
O	,
O	with
O	silence
O	of
O	reapers
O	and
O	birds
O	,
O	with
O	fading
O	of
O	leaf
O	and
O	flower
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	sorrow
O	fell
O	on
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	Balder
O	could
O	bear
O	the
O	burden
O	no
O	longer
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	called
O	all
O	the
O	gods
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	the
O	terrible
O	dreams
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	.
O	Every
O	face
O	was
O	heavy
O	with
O	care
O	.
O	The
O	death
O	of
O	Balder
O	would
O	be
O	like
O	the
O	going
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	long
O	,
O	sad
O	council
O	the
O	gods
O	resolved
O	to
O	protect
O	him
O	from
O	harm
O	by
O	pledging
O	all
O	things
O	to
O	stand
O	between
O	him
O	and
O	any
O	hurt
O	.
O	So
O	Frigg
O	,
O	his
O	mother
O	,
O	went
O	forth
O	and
O	made
O	everything
O	promise
O	,
O	on
O	a
O	solemn
O	oath
O	,
O	not
O	to
O	injure
O	her
O	son
O	.
O	Fire
O	,
O	iron
O	,
O	all
O	kinds
O	of
O	metal
O	,
O	every
O	sort
O	of
O	stone
O	,
O	trees
O	,
O	earth
O	,
O	diseases
O	,
O	birds
O	,
O	beasts
O	,
O	snakes
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	anxious
O	mother
O	went
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	solemnly
O	pledged
O	themselves
O	that
O	no
O	harm
O	should
O	come
O	near
O	Balder
O	.
O	Everything
O	promised
O	,
O	and
O	Frigg
O	thought
O	she
O	had
O	driven
O	away
O	the
O	cloud;
O	but
O	fate
O	was
O	stronger
O	than
O	her
O	love
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	little
O	shrub
O	had
O	not
O	sworn
O	.
O	Odin
O	was
O	not
O	satisfied
O	even
O	with
O	these
O	precautions
O	,
O	for
O	whichever
O	way
O	he
O	looked
O	the
O	shadow
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	sorrow
O	spread
O	over
O	the
O	worlds
O	.
O	He
O	began
O	to
O	feel
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	no
O	longer
O	the
O	greatest
O	of
O	the
O	gods
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	almost
O	hear
O	the
O	rough
O	shouts
O	of
O	the
O	frost
O	giants
O	crowding
O	the
O	rainbow
O	bridge
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	into
O	Asgard
O	.
O	When
O	trouble
O	comes
O	to
O	men
O	it
O	is
O	hard
O	to
O	bear
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	a
O	god
O	who
O	had
O	so
O	many
O	worlds
O	to
O	guide
O	and
O	rule
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	new
O	and
O	terrible
O	thing
O	.
O	Odin
O	thought
O	and
O	thought
O	until
O	he
O	was
O	weary
O	,
O	but
O	no
O	gleam
O	of
O	light
O	could
O	he
O	find
O	anywhere;
O	it
O	was
O	thick
O	darkness
O	everywhere
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	could
O	bear
O	the
O	suspense
O	no
O	longer
O	,
O	and
O	saddling
O	his
O	horse
O	he
O	rode
O	sadly
O	out
O	of
O	Asgard
O	to
O	Niflheim
O	,
O	the
O	home
O	of
O	Hel
O	,
O	whose
O	face
O	was
O	as
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	death
O	itself
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	drew
O	near
O	the
O	gates
O	,
O	a
O	monstrous
O	dog
O	came
O	out
O	and
O	barked
O	furiously
O	,
O	but
O	Odin
O	rode
O	a
O	little
O	eastward
O	of
O	the
O	shadowy
O	gates
O	to
O	the
O	grave
O	of
O	a
O	wonderful
O	prophetess
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	cold
O	,
O	gloomy
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	soul
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	god
O	was
O	pierced
O	with
O	a
O	feeling
O	of
O	hopeless
O	sorrow
O	as
O	he
O	dismounted
O	from
O	Sleipner
O	,
O	and
O	bending
O	over
O	the
O	grave
O	began
O	to
O	chant
O	weird
O	songs
O	,
O	and
O	weave
