O	all
O	joining
O	in
O	a
O	chant
O	,
O	they
O	rose
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	.
O	Waupee
O	,
O	casting
O	off
O	his
O	disguise
O	,
O	walked
O	sorrowfully
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	lodge--but
O	ah
O	,
O	the
O	night
O	seemed
O	very
O	long
O	to
O	lonely
O	White
O	Hawk
O	!
O	His
O	whole
O	soul
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	beautiful
O	sister
O	.
O	Betimes
O	,
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	haunted
O	spot
O	,
O	hoping
O	and
O	fearing
O	,
O	and
O	sighing
O	as
O	though
O	his
O	very
O	soul
O	would
O	leave
O	his
O	body
O	in
O	its
O	anguish
O	.
O	He
O	reflected
O	upon
O	the
O	plan
O	he
O	should
O	follow
O	to
O	secure
O	success
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	already
O	failed
O	twice;
O	to
O	fail
O	a
O	third
O	time
O	would
O	be
O	fatal
O	.
O	Near
O	by
O	he
O	found
O	an
O	old
O	stump
O	,
O	much
O	covered
O	with
O	moss
O	,
O	and
O	just
O	then
O	in
O	use
O	as
O	the
O	residence
O	of
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	mice
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	stopped
O	there
O	on
O	a
O	pilgrimage
O	to
O	some
O	relatives
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	prairie
O	.
O	The
O	White
O	Hawk
O	was
O	so
O	pleased
O	with
O	their
O	tidy
O	little
O	forms
O	that
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	mouse
O	,
O	especially
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	by
O	no
O	means
O	formidable
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	at
O	all
O	likely
O	to
O	create
O	alarm
O	.
O	He
O	accordingly
O	,
O	having
O	first
O	brought
O	the
O	stump
O	and
O	set
O	it
O	near
O	the
O	ring
O	,
O	without
O	further
O	notice
O	became
O	a
O	mouse
O	,
O	and
O	peeped
O	and
O	sported
O	about
O	,
O	and
O	kept
O	his
O	sharp
O	little
O	eyes
O	busy
O	with
O	the
O	others;
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	forget
O	to
O	keep
O	one
O	eye
O	up
O	toward
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	ear
O	wide
O	open
O	in
O	the

O	It

O	at

O	She

O	well
O	as
O	the
O	most
O	dainty

O	One
O	day

O	in

O	her

O	.
O	As

O	she
O	commenced
O	her
O	magical
O	song
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	basket
O	rose
O	.
O	The
O	song

O	sad
O	,

O	of
O	a
O	lowly
O	and
O	mournful
O	cadence
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	wafted
O	far
O	away
O	by
O	the
O	wind
O	,
O	it
O	caught
O	her
O	husband's
O	ear
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	voice
O	which
O	he
O	well
O	knew
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	instantly
O	ran
O	to

O	ascended
O	beyond

O	He
O	lifted
O	up

O	voice
O	in
O	loud
O	appeals
O	,

O	they
O	were
O	unavailing

O	The
O	basket
O	still
O	went
O	up

O	He
O	watched
O	it
O	till
O	it
O	became
O	a
O	small
O	speck
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	it
O	vanished
O	in
O	the

O	He
O	then
O	bent
O	his
O	head
O	down
O	to

O	bewailed

O	In
