O	One
O	day
O	,
O	an
O	Indian
O	boy
O	was
O	playing
O	beside
O	a
O	stream
O	,
O	when
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	elf
O	men
O	came
O	along
O	in
O	his
O	canoe
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	had
O	his
O	bow
O	and
O	arrow
O	with
O	him;
O	so
O	had
O	the
O	little
O	elf
O	man
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	man
O	stopped
O	and
O	offered
O	to
O	trade
O	bows
O	and
O	arrows
O	.
O	The
O	Indian
O	boy
O	looked
O	first
O	at
O	his
O	bow
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	at
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	man
O	.
O	His
O	bow
O	was
O	large
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	man's
O	bow
O	was
O	very
O	small
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	thought
O	his
O	own
O	bow
O	was
O	better
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	said
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	trade
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	elf
O	man
O	laughed
O	and
O	drew
O	his
O	bow
O	.
O	"""You"

O	Then
