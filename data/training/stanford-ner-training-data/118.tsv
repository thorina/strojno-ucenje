O	,
O	or
O	from

O	gods
O	themselves
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	received
O	the
O	gift

O	.
O	It
O	chanced
O	one
O	day
O	that
O	as
O	Apollo
O	drove
O	his
O	chariot
O	on
O	its
O	all-conquering
O	round
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	boy
O	.
O	Hyacinthus
O	was
O	as
O	fair
O	to
O	look
O	upon
O	as
O	the
O	fairest
O	of
O	women
O	,
O	yet
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	only
O	full
O	of
O	grace
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	muscular
O	,
O	and
O	strong
O	as
O	a
O	straight
O	young
O	pine
O	on
O	Mount
O	Olympus
O	that
O	fears
O	not
O	the

O	rage
O	of
O	the
O	North
O	Wind
O	nor
O	the
O	angry
O	tempests
O	of
O	the
O	South
O	.
O	When
O	Apollo
O	had
O	spoken
O	with
O	him
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	Hyacinthus
O	did
O	not

O	the

O	,
O	and
O	gladly
O	the
O	god
O	felt
O	that
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	had
O	found
O	the
O	perfect
O	companion
O	,
O	the
O	ever
O	courageous
O	and
O	joyous
O	young
O	mate
O	,
O	whose
O	mood
O	was
O	always
O	ready
O	to
O	meet
O	his
O	own
O	.
O	Did
O	Apollo
O	desire
O	to
O	hunt
O	,
O	with
O	merry
O	shout
O	Hyacinthus
O	called
O	the
O	hounds
O	.
O	Did
O	the
O	great
O	god
O	deign
O	to
O	fish
O	,
O	Hyacinthus
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	fetch
O	the
O	nets
O	and
O	to
O	throw
O	himself
O	,
O	whole-souled
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	great
O	affair
O	of
O	chasing
O	and
O	of
O	landing
O	the
O	silvery
O	fishes
O	.
O	When
O	Apollo
O	wished
O	to
O	climb
O	the
O	mountains
O	,
O	to
O	heights
O	so
O	lonely
O	that
O	not
O	even
O	the
O	moving
O	of
O	an
O	eagle
O	'
O	s
O	wing
O	broke
O	the
O	everlasting
O	stillness
O	,
O	Hyacinthus--his
O	strong
O	limbs
O	too
O	perfect
O	for
O	the
O	chisel
O	of
O	any
O	sculptor
O	worthily
O	to
O	reproduce--was
O	ready
O	and
O	eager
O	for
O	the
O	climb
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	mountain
O	top
O	,
O	Apollo
O	gazed
O	in
O	silence
O	over
O	illimitable
O	space
O	,
O	and
O	watched
O	the
O	silver
O	car
O	of
O	his
O	sister
O	Diana
O	rising
O	slowly
O	into
O	the
O	deep
O	blue
O	of
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	silvering
O	land
O	and
O	water
O	as
O	she
O	passed
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	never
O	Hyacinthus
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	to
O	speak--with
O	words
O	to
O	break
O	the
O	spell
O	of
O	Nature
O	'
O	s
O	perfect
O	beauty
O	,
O	shared
O	in
O	perfect
O	companionship
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	times
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	when
O	Apollo
O	would
O	play
O	his
O	lyre
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	naught
O	but
O	the
O	music
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	making
O	could
O	fulfil
O	his
O	longing
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	those
O	times
O	came
O	,
O	Hyacinthus
O	would
O	lie
O	at
O	the
O	feet
O	of
O	his
O	friend--of
O	the
O	friend
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	god--and
O	would
O	listen
O	,
O	with
O	eyes
O	of
O	rapturous
O	joy
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	music
O	that
O	his
O	master
O	made
O	.
O	A
O	very
O	perfect
O	friend
O	was
O	this
O	friend
O	of
O	the
O	sun-god
O	.
O	Nor
O	was
O	it
O	Apollo
O	alone
O	who
O	desired
O	the
O	friendship
O	of
O	Hyacinthus
O	.
O	Zephyrus
O	,
O	god
O	of
O	the
O	South
O	Wind
O	,
O	had
O	known
O	him
O	before
O	Apollo
O	crossed
O	his
O	path
O	and
O	had
O	eagerly
O	desired
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	friend
O	.
O	But
O	who
O	could
O	stand
O	against
O	Apollo
O	?
O	Sulkily
O	Zephyrus
O	marked
O	their
O	ever-ripening
O	friendship
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	jealousy
O	grew
O	into
O	hatred
O	,
O	and
O	hatred
O	whispered
O	to
O	him
O	of
O	revenge
O	.
O	Hyacinthus
O	excelled
O	at
O	all
O	sports
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	played
O	quoits
O	it
O	was
O	sheer
O	joy
O	for
O	Apollo
O	,
O	who
O	loved
O	all
O	things
O	beautiful
O	,
O	to
O	watch
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	stood
O	to
O	throw
O	the
O	disc
O	,
O	his
O	taut
O	muscles
O	making
O	him
O	look
O	like
O	Hermes
O	,
O	ready
O	to
O	spurn
O	the
O	cumbering
O	earth
O	from
O	off
O	his
O	feet
O	.
O	Further
O	even
O	than
O	the
O	god
O	,
O	his
O	friend
O	,
O	could
O	Hyacinthus
O	throw
O	,
O	and
O	always
O	his
O	merry
O	laugh
O	when
O	he
O	succeeded
O	made
O	the
O	god
O	feel
O	that
O	nor
O	man
O	nor
O	god
O	could
O	ever
O	grow
O	old
O	.
O	And
O	so
O	there
O	came
O	that
O	day
O	,
O	fore-ordained
O	by
O	the
O	Fates
O	,
O	when
O	Apollo
O	and
O	Hyacinthus
O	played
O	a
O	match
O	together
O	.
O	Hyacinthus
O	made
O	a
O	valiant
O	throw
O	,
O	and
O	Apollo
O	took
O	his
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	cast
O	the
O	discus
O	high
O	and
O	far
O	.
O	Hyacinthus
O	ran
O	forward
O	eager
O	to
O	measure
O	the
O	distance
O	,
O	shouting
O	with
O	excitement
O	over
O	a
O	throw
O	that
O	had
O	indeed
O	been
O	worthy
O	of
O	a
O	god
O	.
O	Thus
O	did
O	Zephyrus
O	gain
O	his
O	opportunity
O	.
O	Swiftly
O	through
O	the
O	tree-tops
O	ran
O	the
O	murmuring
O	South
O	Wind
O	,
O	and
O	smote
O	the
O	discus
O	of
O	Apollo
O	with
O	a
O	cruel
O	hand
O	.
O	Against
O	the
O	forehead
O	of
O	Hyacinthus
O	it
O	dashed
O	,
O	smiting
O	the
O	locks
O	that
O	lay
O	upon
O	it
O	,
O	crashing
O	through
O	skin
O	and
O	flesh
O	and
O	bone
O	,
O	felling
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	Apollo
O	ran
O	towards
O	him
O	and
O	raised
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	Hyacinthus
O	fell
O	over
O	on
O	the
O	god

O	like
O	the
