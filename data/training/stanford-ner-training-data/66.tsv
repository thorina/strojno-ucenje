O	I
O	had
O	married
O	a
O	lady
O	of
O	great
O	beauty
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	having
O	heard
O	of
O	my
O	sporting
O	exploits
O	,
O	desired
O	,
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	after
O	our
O	marriage
O	,
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	with
O	me
O	on
O	a
O	shooting
O	expedition
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	in
O	front
O	to
O	start
O	something
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	soon
O	saw
O	my
O	dog
O	stop
O	before
O	several
O	hundred
O	coveys
O	of
O	partridges
O	.
O	I
O	waited
O	for
O	my
O	wife
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	following
O	me
O	with
O	my
O	lieutenant
O	and
O	a
O	servant
O	.
O	I
O	waited
O	a
O	long
O	time;
O	nobody
O	came
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	very
O	uneasy
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	half-way
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	my
O	wife
O	,
O	I
O	heard
O	lamentable
O	groans
O	.
O	They
O	seemed
O	quite
O	near
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	I
O	could
O	see
O	no
O	trace
O	of
O	a
O	human
O	being
O	.
O	I
O	jumped
O	off
O	my
O	horse;
O	I
O	put
O	my
O	ear
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	only
O	heard
O	the
O	groans
O	distinctly
O	rising
O	from
O	beneath
O	,
O	but
O	my
O	wife
O	'
O	s
O	voice
O	and
O	those
O	of
O	my
O	lieutenant
O	and
O	servant
O	.
O	I
O	remarked
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	,
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	spot
O	,
O	the
O	shaft
O	of
O	a
O	coal-pit
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	no
O	doubt
O	that
O	my
O	wife
O	and
O	her
O	unfortunate
O	companions
O	had
O	been
O	swallowed
O	up
O	in
O	it
O	.
O	I
O	rode
O	full
O	speed
O	to
O	the
O	nearest
O	village
O	to
O	fetch
O	the
O	miners
O	,
O	who
O	after
O	great
O	efforts
O	succeeded
O	in
O	drawing
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	individuals
O	buried
O	in
O	the
O	pit--which
O	measured
O	ninety
O	feet--to
O	the
O	surface
O	.
O	They
O	first
O	drew
O	up
O	the
O	man-servant;
O	then
O	his
O	horse;
O	next
O	the
O	lieutenant;
O	next
O	his
O	horse;
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	my
O	wife
O	on
O	her
O	little
O	palfrey
O	.
O	The
O	most
O	curious
O	part
O	of
O	this
O	affair
O	was
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	the
O	awful
O	depth
O	to
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	fallen
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	was
O	hurt
O	,
O	not
O	even
O	the
O	horses
O	,
O	if
O	we
O	except
O	a
O	few
O	slight
O	contusions
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	had
O	had
O	a
O	terrible
O	fright
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	quite
O	unable
O	to
O	pursue
O	our
O	intended
O	sport
O	.
O	In
O	all
O	this
O	confusion
O	I
O	quite
O	forgot
O	my
O	setter
O	,
O	as
O	no
O	doubt
O	you
O	also
O	have
O	.
O	The

O	I
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	go
O	away
O	on
O	duty
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	return
O	home
O	for
O	a

O	.
O	On
O	my
O	return
O	I
O	asked
O	for
O	Diana
O	,
O	my
O	setter
O	.
O	No
