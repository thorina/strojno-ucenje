O	So
O	the

O	When

O	the

O	,
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	smart
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	burn
O	.
O	And
O	at

O	he
O	began
O	to
O	dance
O	,

O	danced
O	all
O	round
O	the
O	Rath

O	laughing

O	.
O	And
O	he
O	danced
O	till
O	he
O	cried
O	out
O	with
O	weariness
O	,
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	shake
O	the
O	shoes
O	off
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	stuck
O	fast
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fairies
O	drove
O	him
O	over
O	,
O	the
O	ditch
O	,
O	and
O	through
O	the
O	prickly
O	furze-bushes
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	danced
O	away
O	.
O	Where
O	he
O	danced
O	to
O	,
O	I
O	cannot
O	tell

O	Whether

O	shoes
O	,
O	I
O	do

O	The
O	jewels
O	never
O	were
O	more
O	than
O	wayside
O	pebbles
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	swept
O	out
O	when
O	his
O	cabin
O	was
O	cleaned
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	not
O	too
O	soon
O	,
O	you
O	may

O	All
O	this
O	happened
O	long
O	ago;
O	but
O	there
O	are
O	those
O	who
O	say
O	that
O	the
O	covetous
O	cobbler
O	dances
O	still
O	,
O	between
O	sunset
