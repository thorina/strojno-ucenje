O	But
O	looking
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	windows
O	,
O	Gareth
O	saw
O	the
O	Lady
O	Liones
O	gazing
O	earnestly
O	upon
O	him;
O	then
O	he
O	caught
O	up
O	his
O	helmet
O	,
O	and
O	calling
O	to
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	,
O	bade
O	him
O	make
O	ready
O	for
O	the
O	battle;
O	"""And"

O	"""So"

O	said
O	the
O	Red

O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	smote
O	Gareth
O	on
O	the
O	hand
O	so
O	that
O	his
O	sword
O	flew
O	from
O	his
O	grasp
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	another
O	blow
O	he
O	brought
O	him
O	grovelling
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	At
O	the

O	and
O	hearing
O	her
O	,
O	Gareth
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	mighty
O	effort
O	,
O	threw
O	off
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	,
O	leaped
O	to
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	it
O	again
O	within
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	pressed
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	harder
O	than
O	ever
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	bore
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	,
O	and
O	unlacing
O	his
O	helm
O	,
O	made
O	ready
O	to
O	slay
O	him;
O	but
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	cried
O	aloud:
O	"""Mercy"
O	!
O	I
O	yield
O	.
O	""""
O	At
O	first
O	,
O	remembering
O	the
O	evil
O	deaths
O	of
O	the
O	forty
O	good
O	knights
O	,
O	Gareth
O	was
O	unwilling
O	to
O	spare
O	him;
O	but
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	besought
O	him
O	to
O	have
O	mercy
O	,
O	telling
O	him
O	how
O	,
O	against
O	his
O	will
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	bound
O	by
O	a
O	vow
O	to
O	make
O	war
O	on
O	Arthur's
O	knights
O	.
O	So
O	Sir
O	Gareth
O	relented
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	set
O	forth
O	at
O	once
O	for
O	Kink
O	Kenadon
O	and
O	entreat
O	the
O	king's
O	pardon
O	for
O	his
O	evil
O	past
O	.
O	And
O	this
O	the
O	Red
O	Knight
O	promised
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	Then
O	amid
O	much
O	rejoicing
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gareth
O	was
O	borne
O	into
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	There
O	his
O	wounds
O	were
O	dressed
O	by
O	the
O	Lady
O	Liones
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	rested
O	until
O	he
O	recovered
O	his
O	strength
O	.
O	And
O	having
O	won
O	her
O	love
O	,
O	when
O	Gareth
O	returned
O	to
O	Arthur's
O	court
O	the
O	Lady
O	Liones
O	rode
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	two
O	were
O	wed
O	with
O	great
O	pomp
O	in
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	the
O	whole
O	fellowship
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table;
O	the
O	king
O	rejoicing
O	much
O	that
O	his
O	nephew
O	had
O	done
O	so
O	valiantly
O	.
O	So
O	Sir
O	Gareth
O	lived
O	happily
O	with
O	Dame
O	Liones
O	,
O	winning
O	fame
O	and
O	the
O	love
O	of
O	all
O	true
O	knights
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	Linet
O	,
O	she
O	came
O	again
O	to
O	Arthur's
O	court
O	and
O	wedded
O	Sir
O	Gareth's
O	younger
O	brother
