O	The
O	old-time
O	Indians
O	say
O	that
O	long
O	,
O	long
O	ago
O	,
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	made
O	a
O	law
O	that
O	stories
O	must
O	not
O	be
O	told
O	in
O	summer
O	.
O	Summer
O	is
O	the
O	time
O	for
O	work
O	.
O	Bees
O	must
O	store
O	their
O	honey
O	.
O	Squirrels
O	must
O	gather
O	their
O	nuts
O	.
O	Men
O	must
O	grow
O	their
O	corn
O	.
O	Trees
O	and
O	plants
O	must
O	leaf
O	,
O	and
O	flower
O	,
O	and
O	bear
O	their
O	fruit
O	.
O	If
O	stories
O	were
O	told
O	,
O	plants
O	,
O	birds
O	,
O	animals
O	,
O	and
O	men
O	would
O	stop
O	their
O	work
O	to
O	listen
O	.
O	This
O	would
O	mean
O	poor
O	crops
O	and
O	hungry
O	people
O	.
O	Animals
O	would
O	forget
O	to
O	grow
O	their
O	winter
O	coats
O	and
O	lay
O	by
O	their
O	winter
O	stores
O	.
O	Birds
O	would
O	fail
O	to
O	start
O	in
O	time
O	for
O	the
O	South
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	Indians
O	say
O	that
O	the
O	story-teller
O	who
O	disobeys
O	this
O	law
O	of
O	_Jo
O	gah
O	oh_
O	will
O	suffer
O	some
O	misfortune
O	.
O	Winter
O	is
O	the
O	time
O	to
O	tell
O	the
O	stories
O	,
O	for
O	then
O	the
O	work
O	of
O	animals
O	,
O	plants
O	,
O	and
O	men
O	is
O	done
O	,
O	--and
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	are
O	fast
O	asleep
O	.
O	No
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	safe
O	to
O	tell
O	stories
O	in
O	summer
O	.
O	No
O	one
O	knows
O	when
O	a
O	bird
O	,
O	or
O	a
O	bee
O	,
O	or
O	a
O	butterfly
O	may
O	be
O	listening
O	,
O	and
O	may
O	tell
O	the
O	chief
O	of
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	.
O	Should
O	the
O	chief
O	of
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	be
O	offended
O	,
O	he
O	might
O	cause
O	something
O	dreadful
O	to
O	happen
O	to
O	the
O	story-teller
O	.
O	Last
O	summer
O	,
O	the
O	writer
O	of
O	these
O	stories
O	came
O	very
O	near
O	being
O	changed
O	into
O	an
O	animal
O	,
O	--or
O	something
O	worse
O	,
O	--just
O	for
O	telling
O	stories
O	.
O	So
O	an
O	old
O	Indian
O	said
O	.
O	She
O	does
O	not
O	know
O	now
O	how
O	she
O	escaped
O	.
O	She
O	thinks
O	it
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	because
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	White
O	Indian
O	.
O	This
O	is
O	how
O	it
O	happened
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	the
O	Harvest
O	Moon
O	.
O	_Yeh
O	sen
O	noh
O	wehs_
O	spoke
O	for
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	tribes
O	at
O	their
O	council
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	told
O	some
O	of
O	these
O	wonder
O	stories
O	.
O	All
O	went
O	well
O	until
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	.
O	Then
O	a
O	very
O	old
O	Indian
O	came
O	to
O	warn
O	her
O	of
O	her
O	danger
O	.
O	It
O	seems
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	at
O	the
O	council
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	heard
O	the
O	stories
O	told
O	,
O	many
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	knew
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	_Yeh
O	sen
O	noh
O	wehs_
O	he
O	had
O	expected
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	change
O	into
O	something
O	else
O	right
O	then
O	and
O	there
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	dare
O	to
O	tell
O	a
O	story
O	.
O	"""No"
O	,
O	no
O	,
O	me
O	'fraid
O	,
O	evil
O	come
O	!
O	""""
O	he
O	said
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	wanted
O	to
O	know
O	if
O	_Yeh
O	sen
O	noh
O	wehs_
O	was
O	a
O	real
O	Indian
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	told
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	White
O	Indian
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	her
O	tell
O	the
O	stories
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	real
O	Indian
O	.
O	When
O	_Yeh
O	sen
O	noh
O	wehs_
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	a
O	drop
O	of
O	Indian
O	blood
O	running
O	in
O	her
O	veins
O	,
O	he
O	looked
O	very
O	solemn
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	spoke
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	the
O	interpreter
O	to
O	tell
O	her
O	,
O	--for
O	he
O	spoke
O	but
O	a
O	few
O	words
O	of
O	English
O	,
O	--that
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	made
O	a
O	snake
O	,
O	a
O	snake;
O	a
O	fox
O	,
O	a
O	fox;
O	a
O	muskrat
O	,
O	a
O	muskrat;
O	a
O	coon
O	,
O	a
O	coon;
O	a
O	bear
O	,
O	a
O	bear;
O	an
O	Indian
O	,
O	an
O	Indian;
O	a
O	White
O	Indian
O	,
O	a
O	White
O	Indian
O	.
O	Each
O	must
O	be
O	snake
O	,
O	fox
O	,
O	coon
O	,
O	bear
O	,
O	Indian
O	or
O	White
O	Indian
O	,
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	he
O	lived
O	.
O	Each
O	must
O	be
O	himself
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	asked
O	what
O	disease
O	_Yeh
O	sen
O	noh
O	wehs_
O	had
O	,
O	that
O	made
O	her
O	go
O	around
O	with
O	a
O	feather
O	in
O	her
O	hair
O	,
O	acting
O	like
O	a
O	real
O	Indian
O	,
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	a
O	White
O	Indian
O	.
O	_Yeh
O	sen
O	noh
O	wehs_
O	had
O	no
O	answer
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	does
O	not
O	know
O	to
O	this
O	day
O	,
O	what
O	saved
O	her
O	from
O	being
O	changed
O	into
O	a
O	rabbit
O	,
O	a
O	katydid
O	,
O	or
O	something
O	worse
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	chief
O	of
O	the
O	Little
O	People
O	.
O	She
O	knows
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	is
O	very
O	glad
O	she
O	is
O	telling
O	the
O	stories
O	to
O	you
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	WINTER
O	time
O	.
