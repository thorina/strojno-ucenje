O	drink
O	the
O	one
O	and
O	keep
O	the
O	other
O	for
O	himself
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	few
O	more
O	toasts
O	,
O	Vich
O	Ian
O	Vohr
O	offered
O	to
O	take
O	Waverley
O	up
O	to
O	be
O	presented
O	to
O	his
O	sister
O	.
O	They
O	found
O	Flora
O	Mac-Ivor
O	in
O	her
O	parlour
O	,
O	a
O	plain
O	and
O	bare
O	chamber
O	with
O	a
O	wide
O	prospect
O	from
O	the
O	windows
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	her
O	brother's
O	dark
O	curling
O	hair
O	,
O	dark
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	lofty
O	expression
O	,
O	but
O	her
O	expression
O	seemed
O	sweeter
O	,
O	though
O	not
O	,
O	perhaps
O	,
O	softer
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	even
O	more
O	fiercely
O	Jacobite
O	than
O	her
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	devotion
O	to
O	"""the"
O	King
O	over
O	the
O	"Water"""
O	(
O	as
O	they
O	called
O	King
O	James
O	)
O	was
O	far
O	more
O	unselfish
O	than
O	that
O	of
O	Vich
O	Ian
O	Vohr
O	.
O	Flora
O	Mac-Ivor
O	had
O	been
O	educated
O	in
O	a
O	French
O	convent
O	,
O	yet
O	now
O	she
O	gave
O	herself
O	heart
O	and
O	soul
O	to
O	the
O	good
O	of
O	her
O	wild
O	Highland
O	clan
O	and
O	to
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	him
O	whom
O	she
O	looked
O	on
O	as
O	the
O	true
O	King
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	gracious
O	to
O	Edward
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	request
O	of
O	Fergus
O	,
O	told
O	him
O	the
O	meaning
O	of
O	the
O	war-song
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	listening
O	to
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	,
O	her
O	brother
O	said
O	,
O	famed
O	for
O	her
O	translations
O	from
O	Gaelic
O	into
O	English
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	the
O	present
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	persuaded
O	to
O	recite
O	any
O	of
O	these
O	to
O	Edward
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	better
O	fortune
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	finding
O	Flora
O	Mac-Ivor
O	in
O	a
O	wild
O	spot
O	by
O	a
O	waterfall
O	,
O	she
O	sang
O	him
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	accompaniment
O	of
O	a
O	harp
O	,
O	a
O	song
O	of
O	great
O	chiefs
O	and
O	their
O	deeds
O	which
O	fired
O	the
O	soul
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	admiring--he
O	almost
O	began
O	to
O	love
O	her
O	from
O	that
O	moment
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	reception
O	,
O	Edward
O	continued
O	very
O	willingly
O	at
O	Glennaquoich--both
O	because
O	of
O	his
O	growing
O	admiration
O	for
O	Flora
O	,
O	and
O	because
O	his
O	curiosity
O	increased
O	every
O	day
O	as
O	to
O	this
O	wild
O	race
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	life
O	so
O	different
O	from
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	hitherto
O	known
O	.
O	Nothing
O	occurred
O	for
O	three
O	weeks
O	to
O	disturb
O	his
O	pleasant
O	dreams
O	,
O	save
O	the
O	chance
O	discovery
O	,
O	made
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	writing
O	a
O	letter
O	to
O	the
O	Baron
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	somehow
O	lost
O	his
O	seal
O	with
O	the
O	arms
O	of
O	Waverley
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	wore
O	attached
O	to
O	his
O	watch
O	.
O	Flora
O	was
O	inclined
O	to
O	blame
O	Donald
O	Bean
O	Lean
O	for
O	the
O	theft
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	Chief
O	scouted
O	the
O	idea
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	impossible
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	when
O	Edward
O	was
O	his
O	guest
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	besides
O	(
O	he
O	added
O	slyly
O	)
O	,
O	Donald
O	would
O	never
O	have
O	taken
O	the
O	seal
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	watch
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	Edward
O	borrowed
O	Vich
O	Ian
O	Vohr's
O	seal
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	despatched
O	his
O	letter
O	,
O	thought
O	no
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	matter
O	.
O	Soon
O	afterwards
O	,
O	whilst
O	Waverley
O	still
O	remained
O	at
O	Glennaquoich
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	hunting
O	of
O	the
O	stag
O	,
O	to
O	which
O	Fergus
O	went
O	with
O	three
O	hundred
O	of
O	his
O	clan
O	to
O	meet
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	greatest
O	Highland
O	chiefs
O	,
O	his
O	neighbours
O	.
O	He
O	took
O	Edward
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	numbers
O	present
O	amounted
O	almost
O	to
O	those
O	of
O	a
O	formidable
O	army
O	.
O	While
O	the
O	clansmen
O	drove
O	in
O	the
O	deer
O	,
O	the
O	chiefs
O	sat
O	on
O	the
O	heather
O	in
O	little
O	groups
O	and
O	talked
O	in
O	low
O	tones
O	.
O	During
O	the
O	_drive_
O	,
O	the
O	main
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	deer
O	,
O	in
O	their
O	desperation
O	,
O	charged
O	right
O	upon
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	chief
O	sportsmen
O	were
O	waiting
O	in
O	ambush
O	.
O	The
O	word
O	was
O	given
O	for
O	every
O	one
O	to
O	fling
O	himself
O	down
O	on
O	his
O	face
O	.
O	Edward
O	,
O	not
O	understanding
O	the
O	language
O	,
O	remained
O	erect
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	life
O	was
O	only
O	saved
O	by
O	the
O	quickness
O	of
O	Vich
O	Ian
O	Vohr
O	,
O	who
O	seized
O	him
O	and
O	flung
O	him
O	down
O	,
O	holding
O	him
O	there
O	by
O	main
O	force
O	till
O	the
O	whole
O	herd
O	had
O	rushed
O	over
O	them
O	.
O	When
O	Edward
O	tried
O	to
O	rise
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	severely
O	sprained
O	his
O	ankle
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	among
O	those
O	present
O	at
O	the
O	_drive_
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	found
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	half-surgeon
O	,
O	half-conjurer
O	,
O	who
O	applied
O	hot
O	fomentations
O	,
O	muttering
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	the
O	operation
O	such
O	gibberish
O	as
O	_Gaspar-Melchior-Balthazar-max-prax-fax
O	!
O	_
O	Thus
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	,
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	disappointment
O	,
O	Edward
O	was
O	unable
O	to
O	accompany
O	the
O	clansmen
O	and
O	their
O	chiefs
O	any
O	farther
O	.
O	So
O	Vich
O	Ian
O	Vohr
O	had
O	Edward
O	placed
O	in
O	a
O	litter
O	,
O	woven
O	of
O	birch
O	and
O	hazel
O	,
O	and
O	walked
O	beside
O	this
O	rude
O	couch
O	to
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	a
O	smaller
O	chieftain
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	with
O	only
O	a
O	few
O	old
O	vassals
O	,
O	lived
O	a
O	retired
O	life
O	at
O	a
O	place
O	called
O	Tomanrait
O	.
O	Here
O	he
O	left
O	Edward
O	to
O	recruit
O	,
O	promising
O	to
O	come
O	back
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	that
O	by
O	that
O	time
O	Edward
O	would
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	ride
O	a
O	Highland
O	pony
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	Glennaquoich
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	sixth
O	morning
O	Fergus
O	returned
O	,
O	and
O	Edward
O	gladly
O	mounted
O	to
O	accompany
O	him
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	approached
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	,
O	with
O	pleasure
O	,
O	Flora
O	coming
O	to
O	meet
O	them
O	.
O	II
O	.
O	MISFORTUNES
O	NEVER
O	COME
O	SINGLE
O	The
O	Chief's
O	beautiful
O	sister
O	appeared
O	very
O	glad
O	to
O	see
O	Edward
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	her
O	brother
O	spoke
O	a
O	few
O	hasty
O	words
O	to
O	her
O	in
O	Gaelic
O	,
O	she
O	suddenly
O	clasped
O	her
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	looking
O	up
O	to
O	heaven
O	,
O	appeared
O	to
O	ask
O	a
O	blessing
O	upon
O	some
O	enterprise
O	.
O	She
O	then
O	gave
O	Edward
O	some
O	letters
O	that
O	had
O	arrived
O	for
O	him
O	during
O	his
O	absence
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	perhaps
O	as
O	well
O	that
O	Edward
O	took
O	these
O	to
O	his
O	room
O	to
O	open
O	,
O	considering
O	the
O	amount
O	of
O	varied
O	ill
O	news
O	that
O	he
O	found
O	in
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	was
O	from
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	just
O	been
O	dismissed
O	from
O	his
O	position
O	as
O	King's
O	minister
O	,
O	owing
O	(
O	as
O	he
O	put
O	it
O	)
O	to
O	the
O	ingratitude
O	of
O	the
O	great--but
O	really
O	,
O	as
O	was
O	proved
O	afterwards
O	,
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	some
O	political
O	plots
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	formed
O	against
O	his
O	chief
O	,
O	the
O	prime
O	minister
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	.
O	Then
O	his
O	generous
O	uncle
O	,
O	Sir
O	Everard
O	,
O	wrote
O	that
O	all
O	differences
O	were
O	over
O	between
O	his
O	brother
O	and
O	himself
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	espoused
O	his
O	quarrel
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	directed
O	Edward
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	send
O	in
O	the
O	resignation
O	of
O	his
O	commission
O	to
O	the
O	War
O	Office
O	without
O	any
O	preliminaries
O	,
O	forbidding
O	him
O	longer
O	to
O	serve
O	a
O	government
O	which
O	had
O	treated
O	his
O	father
O	so
O	badly
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	letter
O	which
O	touched
O	Edward
O	most
O	deeply
O	was
O	one
O	from
O	his
O	commanding
O	officer
O	at
O	Dundee
O	,
O	which
O	declared
O	curtly
O	that
O	if

O	did
O	not
O	report
O	himself
O	at
O	the
O	headquarters
O	of
O	the
O	regiment
O	within
O	three
O	days
O	after
O	the
O	date

O	writing
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	obliged
O	to
O	take
O	steps
O	in
O	the
O	matter
O	which
O	would
O	be
O	exceedingly
O	disagreeable
O	to
O	Captain
O	Waverley
O	.
O	Edward
O	at
O	once
O	sat
O	down
O	and
O	wrote
O	to
O	Colonel
O	Gardiner
O	that
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	thus
O	chosen
O	to
O	efface
O	the
