O	It
O	is
O	six
O	hundred
O	years
O	ago
O	since
O	Thomas
O	the
O	Rhymer
O	lived
O	and
O	rhymed
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	those
O	far-off
O	days
O	little
O	need
O	was
O	there
O	to
O	tell
O	his
O	tale
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	known
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	throughout
O	the
O	countryside
O	.
O	Thomas
O	was
O	known
O	as
O	Thomas
O	the
O	Rhymer
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	wonderful
O	songs
O	he
O	sang
O	.
O	Never
O	another
O	harper
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	land
O	had
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	gift
O	as
O	he
O	.
O	But
O	at
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	marvelled
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	,
O	that
O	is
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	who
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	gained
O	his
O	gift
O	in
O	Elfland
O	.
O	When
O	Thomas
O	took
O	his
O	harp
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	touched
O	the
O	strings
O	,
O	a
O	hush
O	would
O	fall
O	upon
O	those
O	who
O	heard
O	,
O	were
O	they
O	princes
O	or
O	were
O	they
O	peasants
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	magic
O	of
O	his
O	music
O	reached
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	all
O	who
O	stood
O	around
O	him
O	.
O	Were
O	the
O	strains
O	merry
O	,
O	gleeful
O	?
O	The
O	faces
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	heard
O	were
O	wreathed
O	in
O	smiles
O	.
O	Were
O	they
O	sad
O	,
O	melancholy
O	?
O	The
O	faces
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	looked
O	upon
O	the
O	harpist
O	were
O	bathed
O	in
O	tears
O	.
O	Truly
O	Thomas
O	the
O	Rhymer
O	held
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	minstrel
O	had
O	another
O	name
O	,
O	wonderful
O	as
O	the
O	one
O	I
O	have
O	already
O	told
O	to
O	you
O	.
O	Thomas
O	the
O	Rhymer
O	was
O	named
O	True
O	Thomas
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	was
O	because
O	,
O	even
O	had
O	he
O	wished
O	it
O	,
O	Thomas
O	could
O	not
O	say
O	or
O	sing
O	what
O	was
O	not
O	true
O	.
O	This
O	gift
O	too
O	,
O	as
O	you
O	will
O	hear
O	,
O	was
O	given
O	to
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	Queen
O	of
O	Elfland
O	.
O	And
O	yet
O	another
O	name
O	had
O	this
O	wonderful
O	singer
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	born
O	,
O	so
O	the
O	folk
O	said
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	village
O	called
O	Ercildoune
O	.
O	He
O	lived
O	there
O	,
O	so
O	the
O	folk
O	knew
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	castle
O	strongly
O	built
O	on
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	river
O	.
O	Thus
O	to
O	those
O	who
O	dwelt
O	in
O	the
O	countryside
O	the
O	Rhymer
O	was
O	known
O	as
O	Thomas
O	of
O	Ercildoune
O	.
O	The
O	river
O	which
O	flowed
O	past
O	the
O	castle
O	was
O	the
O	Leader
O	.
O	It
O	flowed
O	broader
O	and
O	deeper
O	until
O	two
O	miles
O	beyond
O	the
O	village
O	it
O	ran
O	into
O	the
O	beautiful
O	river
O	Tweed
O	.
O	And
O	to-day
O	the
O	ruins
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	tower
O	are
O	visited
O	by
O	many
O	folk
O	who
O	have
O	heard
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	once
O	the
O	home
O	of
O	the
O	ancient
O	harpist
O	.
O	Thomas
O	of
O	Ercildoune
O	,
O	Thomas
O	the
O	Rhymer
O	,
O	and
O	True
O	Thomas
O	were
O	thus
O	only
O	different
O	names
O	for
O	one
O	marvellous
O	man
O	who
O	sang
O	and
O	played
O	,
O	never
O	told
O	an
O	untruth
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	,
O	moreover
O	,
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	tell
O	beforehand
O	events
O	that
O	were
O	going
O	to
O	take
O	place
O	.
O	Listen
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	tell
O	you
O	how
O	Thomas
O	of
O	Ercildoune
O	came
O	to
O	visit
O	Elfland
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	one
O	beautiful
O	May
O	morning
O	that
O	Thomas
O	felt
O	something
O	stirring
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	.
O	Spring
O	had
O	come
O	,
O	spring
O	was
O	calling
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	could
O	stay
O	no
O	longer
O	in
O	the
O	grim
O	tower
O	on
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	Leader
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	away
O	,
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	woods
O	where
O	the
O	thrush
O	and
O	the
O	jay
O	were
O	singing
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	violets
O	were
O	peeping
O	forth
O	with
O	timid
O	eyes
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	green
O	buds
O	were
O	bursting
O	their
O	bonds
O	for
O	very
O	joy
O	.
O	Thomas
O	hastened
O	to
O	the
O	woods
O	and
O	threw
O	himself
O	down
O	by
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	brook
O	.
O	Ah
O	yes
O	!
O	spring
O	has
O	come
O	.
O	How
O	the
O	little
O	birds
O	sing
O	,
O	how
O	the
O	gentle
O	breezes
O	whisper
O	!
O	Yet
O	listen
O	!
O	what
O	is
O	it
O	Thomas
O	hears
O	beyond
O	the
O	song
O	of
O	the
O	birds
O	,
O	the
O	whisper
O	of
O	the
O	breeze
O	?
O	On
O	the
O	air
O	floats
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	silver
O	bells
O	.
O	Thomas
O	raises
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	Tinkle
O	,
O	tinkle
O	,
O	tinkle
O	!
O	The
O	sound
O	draws
O	nearer
O	,
O	clearer
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	music
O	such
O	as
O	one
O	might
O	hear
O	in
O	Elfland
O	.
O	Beyond
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	over
O	the
O	lonely
O	moors
O	,
O	rode
O	a
O	lady
O	.
O	So
O	fair
O	a
O	lady
O	had
O	Thomas
O	never
O	seen
O	.
O	Her
O	palfrey
O	was
O	dapple-grey
O	and
O	she
O	herself
O	shone
O	as
O	the
O	summer
O	sun
O	.
O	Her
O	saddle
O	was
O	of
O	pure
O	ivory
O	,
O	bright
O	with
O	many
O	precious
O	stones
O	and
O	hung
O	with
O	cloth
O	of
O	richest
O	crimson
O	.
O	The
O	girths
O	of
O	her
O	saddle
O	were
O	of
O	silk
O	and
O	the
O	buckles
O	were
O	each
O	one
O	a
O	beryl
O	.
O	Her
O	stirrups
O	of
O	clear
O	crystal
O	and
O	adorned
O	with
O	pearls
O	hung
O	ready
O	for
O	her
O	fairy
O	feet
O	.
O	The
O	trappings
O	of
O	her
O	palfrey
O	were
O	of
O	finest
O	embroidery
O	,
O	her
O	bridle
O	was
O	a
O	chain
O	of
O	gold
O	.
O	From
O	the
O	palfrey's
O	mane
O	hung
O	little
O	silver
O	bells
O	,
O	nine-and-fifty
O	little
O	silver
O	bells
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	fairy
O	music
O	of
O	the
O	bells
O	that
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	ears
O	of
O	Thomas
O	as
O	he
O	lay
O	dreaming
O	on
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	brook
O	.
O	The
O	lady's
O	skirt
O	was
O	green
O	,
O	green
O	as
O	the
O	leaves
O	of
O	spring
O	,
O	her
O	cloak
O	was
O	of
O	fine
O	velvet
O	.
O	Her
O	long
O	black
O	hair
O	hung
O	round
O	her
O	as
O	a
O	veil
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	brow
O	was
O	adorned
O	with
O	gems
O	.
O	By
O	her
O	side
O	were
O	seven
O	greyhounds
O	,
O	other
O	seven
O	she
O	led
O	by
O	a
O	leash
O	.
O	From
O	her
O	neck
O	hung
O	a
O	horn
O	and
O	in
O	her
O	belt
O	was
O	thrust
O	a
O	sheath
O	of
O	arrows
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	as
O	though
O	the
O	lady
O	gay
O	were
O	on
O	her
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	hunting-field
O	.
O	Now
O	she
O	would
O	blow
O	her
O	horn
O	until
O	the
O	echoes
O	answered
O	merrily
O	,
O	merrily;
O	now
O	she
O	would
O	trill
O	her
O	songs
O	,
O	until
O	the
O	wild
O	birds
O	answered
O	gaily
O	,
O	gaily
O	.
O	Thomas
O	of
O	Ercildoune
O	gazed
O	,
O	and
O	Thomas
O	of
O	Ercildoune
O	listened
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	heart
O	gave
O	a
O	great
O	bound
O	as
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	'Now
O	,
O	by
O	my
O	troth
O	,
O	the
O	lady
O	is
O	none
O	of
O	mortal
O	birth
O	.
O	She
O	is
O	none
O	other
O	than
O	Mary
O	,
O	the
O	Queen
O	of
O	Heaven
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	up
O	sprang
O	Thomas
O	from
O	the
O	little
O	woodland
O	brook
O	and
O	away
O	sped
O	he
O	over
O	the
O	mountain-side
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	,
O	so
O	it
O	were
O	possible
O	,
O	reach
O	her
O	as
O	she
O	rode
O	by
O	the
O	Eildon
O	tree
O	,
O	which
O	tree
O	grew
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	Eildon
O	hills
O	.
O	'For
O	certainly
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Thomas
O	,
O	'if
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	speak
O	with
O	that
O	lady
O	bright
O	,
O	my
O	heart
O	will
O	break
O	in
O	three
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	in
O	sooth
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	dismounted
O	under
O	the
O	Eildon
O	tree
O	,
O	Thomas
O	met
O	the
O	lady
O	,
O	and
O	kneeling
O	low
O	beneath
O	the
O	greenwood
O	,
O	he
O	spoke
O	,
O	thus
O	eager
O	was
O	he
O	to
O	win
O	a
O	benison
O	from
O	the
O	Queen
O	of
O	Heaven
O	.
O	'Lovely
O	lady
O	,
O	have
O	pity
O	upon
O	me
O	,
O	even
O	as

O	the
O	Child

O	died
O	for
O	me
O	.
O	'
O	'Nay
O	now
O	,
O	nay
O	now
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	lady
O	gay
O	,
O	'no
O	Queen
O	of
O	Heaven
O	am
O	I
O	.
O	I
O	come
O	but
O	from
O	the
O	country
O	thou
O	dost
O	call
O	Elfland
O	,
O	though
O	queen
O	of
O	that
O	country

O	truth
O	I

O	I
O	do

O	'
O	And
O	she
O	blew
O	on
O	her
O	horn
O	merrily
O	,
O	merrily
O	.
O	Now
O	Thomas
O	did
O	not
O	wish
O	to
O	lose
O	sight
O	of
O	so
O	fair
O	a
O	lady
O	.
O	'Go
O	not

O	he
O	pleaded
O	.
O	'Nay

O	said
O	the

O	'should

O	my

O	But
O	Thomas
O	did
O	not

O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	bold
O	man
O	,
O	he
O	drew
O	near
O	and
O	kissed
O	the
O	rosy
O	lips
O	of
O	the
O	Elfland
O	Queen
O	.
O	Alas
O	,

O	!
O	no
O	sooner
O	had

O	kissed
O	her
O	than
O	the
O	lady
O	fair
O	changed
O	into
O	a
O	tired
O	old

O	She
O	no
O	longer
O	wore
O	a
O	skirt
O	of
O	beautiful
O	green
O	,
O	but
O	a

O	The
O	light
O	,
O	bright
O	as
O	the

O	sun

O	shone
O	around
O	her
O	,
O	faded

O	Her
O	eyes
O	no

O	dull

O	'Thou

O	'
O	Then
O	Thomas
O	fell
O	upon
O	his
O	knees
O	and
O	prayed
O	to
O	Mary
O	mild
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	pity
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	he
O	arose
O	the
O	Queen
O	of
O	Elfland
O	bade
O	him
O	mount
O	behind
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	Thomas
O	could
O	do
O	nought
O	save
O	obey
O	her
O	command
O	.
O	Her
O	steed
O	flew
O	forward
O	,
O	the
O	Eildon
O	hills
O	opened
O	,
O	and
O	horse
O	and
O	riders
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	caverns
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	.
O	Thomas
O	felt
O	darkness
O	close
O	around
O	him
O	.
O	On
O	they
O	rode
O	,
O	on
O	and
O	yet
O	on;
O	swift
O	as
O	the
O	wind
O	they
O	rode
O	.
O	Water
O	reached
O	to
O	his
O	knee
O	,
O	above
O	and
O	around
O	him
O	was
O	darkness
O	,
O	and
O	ever
O	and
O	anon
O	the
O	booming
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	.
O	For
O	three
O	days
O	they
O	rode
O	.
O	Then
O	Thomas
O	grew
O	faint
O	with
O	hunger
O	and
O	cried
O	,
O	'Woe
O	is
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	shall
O	die
O	for
O	lack
O	of

O	'
O	As
O	he
O	cried
O	,
O	the
O	darkness
O	grew
O	less
O	thick
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	riding
O	forward
O	into
O	light
O	.
O	Bright
O	sunlight
O	lay
O	around
O	them
O	as
O	they
O	rode
O	toward
O	a
O	garden
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	garden
O	such
O	as
O	Thomas
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	on
O	earth
O	.
O	All
O	manner
O	of
O	fruit
O	was
O	there
O	,
O	apples
O	and
O	pears
O	,
O	dates
O	and
O	damsons
O	,
O	figs
O	and
O	currants
O	,
O	all
O	ripe
O	,
O	ready
O	to
O	be
O	plucked
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	beautiful
O	garden
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	birds
O	,
O	nightingales
O	building
O	their
O	nests
O	,
O	gay
O	popinjays
O	flitting
O	hither
O	and
O	thither
O	among
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	thrushes
O	singing
O	their
O	sweetest
O	songs
O	.
O	But
O	these
O	Thomas
O	neither
O	saw
O	nor
O	heard
O	.
O	Thomas
O	had
O	eyes
O	only
O	for
O	the
O	fruit
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	thrust
O	forth
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	pluck
O	it
O	,
O	so
O	hungry
O	,
O	so
O	faint
O	was
O	he
O	.
O	'Let
O	be
O	the
O	fruit
O	,
O	Thomas
O	,
O	'
O	cried
O	the
O	lady
O	,
O	'let

O	For
O	dost
O	thou

O	Leave
O	the

O	,
O	Thomas
O	,
O	and
O	come
O	lay
O	thy
O	head
O	upon
O	my
O	knee
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	show
O	thee
O	a
O	sight
O	fairer
O	than

O	seen
O	.
O	And
O	Thomas
O	,
O	being
O	fain
O	to
O	rest
O	,
O	lay
O	down
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	bid
O	,
O	and
O	closed
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	'Now
O	open
O	thine

O	,
O	Thomas
O	,

O	said
O	the
O	lady
O	,
O	'and
O	thou
O	shalt

O	it
O	to

O	there
O	,
O	for
O	thorns
O	and
O	briars
O	grow
O	thick
O	,
O	and
O	spread
O	themselves
O	across
O	the

O	.
O	Straight
O	up
O	over
O	the
O	mountain-tops
O	on

O	'Look

O	,
O	Thomas
O	,

O	said
O	the
O	lady
O	.
O	And
O	Thomas
O	saw
O	stretching
O	before
O	him
O	a
O	long
O	white
O	road
O	.
O	It
O	ran
O	smooth
O	and
O	broad
O	across
O	a
O	grassy
O	plain
O	,
O	and
O	roses
O	blossomed
O	,
O	and
O	lilies
O	bloomed
O	by
O	the
O	wayside
O	.
O	'That

O	said
O	the

O	'
O	Thomas
O	said
O	no
O	word
O	,
O	but
O	lay
O	looking
O	at
O	the
O	third
O	pathway
O	as
O	it
O	twisted
O	and
O	twined
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	amid
O	the
O	cool
O	,
O	green
O	nooks
O	of
O	the
O	woodland
O	.
O	Tiny
O	rills
O	caught
O	the
O	sunlight
O	and
O	tossed
O	it
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	cold
O	,
O	grey
O	rock
O	down
O	which
O	they
O	trickled;
O	tiny
O	ferns
O	waved
O	a
O	welcome
O	from
O	their
O	sheltered
O	crevices
O	.
O	'This
O	,

O	said
O	the
O	lady
O	,
O	'this

O	Then

O	Thomas
O	mounted
O	behind
O	the

O	and
O	hard
O	and
O	fast
O	did
O	they
O	ride
O	until
O	they
O	saw
O	before
O	them
O	a
O	castle

O	on
O	a
O	high
O	hill

O	strong
O	,

O	reined
O	in

O	white
O	steed
O	.
O	'See

O	Thomas
O	listened

O	Thomas
O	stood
O	still
O	,
O	still
O	as
O	a
O	stone
O	,
O	and
O	gazed
O	upon
O	the
O	lady
O	,
O	and
O	lo
O	!
O	a
O	great
O	wonder
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	.
O	Once
O	more
O	the
O	lady
O	shone
O	bright
O	as
O	the
O	sun
O	upon
O	a
O	summer's
O	morn
O	,
O	once
O	more
O	she

O	green
O	as

O	her
O	velvet

O	Her
O	eyes
O	flashed
O	and

O	long
O	hair

O	once

O	And
O	Thomas
O	,
O	looking
O	at
O	his
O	own
O	garments
O	,
O	started
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	they
O	too
O	were
O	changed
O	.
O	For
O	he
O	was
O	now
O	clothed
O	in
O	a
O	suit
O	of
O	beautiful
O	soft
O	cloth
O	,
O	and
O	on

O	of
O	green
O	velvet

O	.
O	Clear

O	the

O	forward
O	she

O	gate
O	.
O	Then
O	down
O	to
O	welcome
O	their
O	queen
O	trooped
O	all
O	the
O	fairy
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	kneeling
O	low
O	before
O	her
O	,
O	they
O	did
O	her
O	reverence
O	.
O	Into
O	the

O	stepped
O	,
O	Thomas
O	following
O	close
O	at

O	silent
O	as
O	one
O	who
O	had
O	no

O	.
O	They
O	crowded
O	around
O	him
O	,
O	the
O	knights
O	and
O	squires;
O	they
O	asked
O	him
O	questions
O	about

O	,
O	yet
O	no

O	Then
O	arose
O	great
O	revelry
O	and
O	feasting
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	the
O	Elfin
O	Queen
O	.
O	Harps
O	and
O	fiddles
O	played
O	their
O	wildest
O	and
O	most
O	gladsome
O	tunes
O	,
O	knights
O	and
O	ladies
O	danced
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	went
O	merry
O	as
O	a
O	marriage
O	bell
O	.
O	Across
O	the
O	hall
O	Thomas
O	looked
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	a
O	strange
O	sight
O	met
O	his
O	glance
O	.
O	Thirty
O	harts
O	and
O	as
O	many
O	deer
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	oaken
O	floor
O	,
O	and
O	bending
O	over
O	them
O	,
O	their
O	knives
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	,
O	were
O	elfin
O	cooks
O	,
O	making
O	ready
O	for
O	the
O	feast
O	.
O	Thomas
O	wondered
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	but
O	a
O	dream
O	,
O	so
O	strange
O	seemed
O	the
O	sights
O	he
O	saw
O	.
O	Gaily
O	passed
O	the
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	Thomas
O	had
O	no
O	wish
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	strange
O	Elfland
O	.
O	But
O	a
O	day
O	came
O	when
O	the
O	queen
O	said
O	to
O	Thomas
O	,
O	'Now

O	'Nay

O	'with

O	She
O	turned
O	to

O	away
O	to
O	Elfland

O	Then
O	Thomas
O	was
O	sad
O	,
O	and
O	tears
O	streamed
O	from

O	Then
O	loud
O	and
O	clear
O	blew
O	she
O	her
O	horn
O	and
O	rode
O	away
O	.
O	Thus
O	Thomas
O	parted
O	from
O	the
O	Elfin
O	Queen
O	.
O	On
O	earth
O	seven
O	slow
O	long
O	years
O	had
O	passed
O	away
O	since
O	Thomas
O	had
O	been
O	seen
O	in
O	the
O	little
O	village
O	of
O	Ercildoune
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	villagers
O	rubbed
O	their
O	eyes
O	and
O	stared
O	with
O	open
O	mouth
O	as
O	they
O	saw
O	him
O	once
O	again
O	in
O	their
O	midst
O	.
O	Ofttimes
O	now
O	Thomas
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	wandering
O	down
O	from
O	his
O	grim
O	old
O	castle
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	bonny
O	greenwood
O	.
O	Ofttimes
O	was
O	he
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	brook
O	that
O	babbled
O	to
O	itself
O	as
O	it
O	ran
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	or
O	under
O	the
O	Eildon
O	tree
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	met
O	the
O	Elf
O	Queen
O	so
O	long
O	before
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	be
O	dreaming
O	as
O	he
O	lay
O	there
O	of
O	the
O	songs
O	he
O	would
O	sing
O	to
O	the
O	country
O	folk
O	.
O	So
O	beautiful
O	were
O	these
O	songs
O	that
O	people
O	hearing
O	them
O	knew
O	that
O	Thomas
O	the
O	Rhymer
O	had
O	a
O	gift
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	given
O	to
O	him
O	by
O	no
O	mortal
O	hand
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	be
O	thinking
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	lay
O	by
O	the
O	babbling
O	brook
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	wars
O	and
O	dangers
O	that
O	in
O	years
O	to
O	come
O	would
O	fall
O	upon
O	his
O	country
O	.
O	And
O	those
O	who
O	hearkened
O	to
O	the
O	woes
O	he
O	uttered
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	True
O	Thomas
O	never
O	failed
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	pass
O	.
O	Seven
O	long
O	years
O	passed
O	away
O	since
O	Thomas
O	had
O	parted
O	from
O	the
O	Elfland
O	Queen
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	another
O	seven
O	.
O	War
O	had
O	raged
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	throughout
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	when
O	on
O	a
O	time
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
O	the
O	Scottish
O	army
O	encamped
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	Ercildoune
O	where
O	Thomas
O	the
O	Rhymer
O	dwelt
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	time
O	of
O	truce
O	,
O	and
O	Thomas
O	wished
O	to
O	give
O	a
O	feast
O	to
O	the
O	gallant
O	soldiers
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	fighting
O	for
O	their
O	country
O	.
O	Thus
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	the
O	doors
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	castle
O	were
O	flung
O	wide
O	,
O	and
O	noise
O	and
O	laughter
O	filled
O	the
O	banquet-hall
O	.
O	Merry
O	were
O	the
O	tales
O	,
O	loud
O	the
O	jests
O	,
O	bright
O	the
O	minstrel
O	strains
O	that
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	Ercildoune
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	feast
O	was
O	over
O	Thomas
O	himself
O	arose
O	,
O	the
O	harp
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	from
O	Elfland
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	hush
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	throng
O	,
O	upon
O	lords
O	and
O	ladies
O	,
O	and
O	upon
O	rough
O	armed
O	men
O	.
O	The
O	cheeks
O	of
O	rugged
O	warriors
O	that
O	day
O	were
O	wet
O	ere
O	ever
O	Thomas
O	ceased
O	to
O	sing
O	.
O	Nor
O	ever
O	in
O	the
O	years
O	to
O	come
O	did
O	those
O	who
O	heard
O	forget
O	the
O	magic
O	of
O	his
O	song
O	.
O	Night
O	fell
O	,
O	those
O	who
O	had
O	feasted
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	rest
O	,
O	when
O	in
O	the
O	bright
O	moonlight
O	a
O	strange
O	sight
O	was
O	seen
O	by
O	the
O	village
O	folk
O	.
O	Along
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	Leader
O	there
O	paced
O	side
O	by
O	side
O	a
O	hart
O	and
O	a
O	hind
O	,
O	each
O	white
O	,
O	white
O	as
O	newly
O	fallen
O	snow
O	.
O	Slowly
O	and
O	with
O	stately
O	steps
O	they
O	moved
O	,
O	nor
O	were
O	they
O	affrighted
O	by
O	the
O	crowd
O	which
O	gathered
O	to
O	gaze
O	at
O	them
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	for
O	True
O	Thomas
O	would
O	know
O	the
O	meaning
O	of
O	so
O	strange
O	a
O	sight
O	,
O	then
O	a
O	messenger
O	was
O	sent
O	in
O	haste
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	Ercildoune
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	tale
O	the
O	messenger
O	brought
O	,
O	Thomas
O	started
O	up
O	out
O	of
O	bed
O	and
O	in
O	haste
O	he
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	clothes
O	.
O	Pale
O	and
O	red
O	did
O	he
O	grow
O	in
O	turn
O	as
O	he
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	tale
O	,
O	yet
O	all
O	he
O	said
O	was
O	this:
O	'My
O	sand
O	is
O	run
O	,
O	my
O	thread
O	is
O	spun
O	,
O	this
O	token
O	is
O	for

O	Thomas
O	hung
O	his
O	elfin
O	harp
O	around
O	his
O	neck
O	,
O	his
O	minstrel
O	cloak
O	across
O	his
O	shoulders
O	,
O	and
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	pale
O	moonlight
O	he
O	walked
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	he
O	walked
O	the
O	wind
O	touched
O	the
O	strings
O	of
O	the
O	elfin
O	harp
O	and
O	drew
O	forth
O	a
O	wail
O	so
O	full
O	of
O	dole
O	that
O	those
O	who
O	heard
O	it
O	whispered:
O	'It
O	is
O	a
O	note
O	of
O	death
O	.

O	On
O	walked
O	Thomas
O	,
O	slow
O	and
O	sad
O	,
O	and
O	oft
O	he
O	turned
O	to
O	look
O	again
O	at
O	the
O	grim
O	walls
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	knew
O	he
O	would
O	never
O	see
O	again
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	moonbeams
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	grey
O	tower
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	soft
O	light
O	the
O	walls
O	grew
O	less
O	grim
O	,
O	less
O	stern
O	,
O	so
O	thought
O	Thomas
O	.
O	'Farewell
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	cried
O	,
O	'farewell

O	tarried
O	for
O	a

O	look
O	,
O	the
O	hart
O	and
O	the
O	hind
O	drew
O	near

O	Onward

O	went
O	with

O	crossed
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	nevermore
O	was

O	come
O	again
O	to
