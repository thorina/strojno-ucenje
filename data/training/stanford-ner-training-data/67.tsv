O	,
O	the

O	hardly

O	the

O	Moreover
O	,

O	a
O	war
O	not

O	on
O	the
O	men
O	but
O	on
O	their
O	gods
O	.
O	The
O	Persians
O	were
O	zealous
O	adorers
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	and
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	they
O	abhorred
O	the
O	idol-worship
O	of
O	the
O	Greeks
O	,
O	and
O	defiled
O	and
O	plundered
O	every
O	temple
O	that
O	fell
O	in

O	Death

O	the

O	that
O	could
O	be
O	looked
O	for
O	at
O	such
O	hands--slavery
O	and
O	torture
O	from
O	cruelly
O	barbarous
O	masters
O	would
O	only
O	too
O	surely
O	be
O	the
O	lot
O	of
O	numbers
O	,
O	should
O	their
O	land
O	fall
O	a
O	prey
O	to
O	the
O	conquerors
O	.
O	The
O	muster
O	place
O	was
O	at
O	Sardis
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	Greek
O	spies
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	multitudes
O	assembling
O	and
O	the
O	state
O	and
O	magnificence
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	attendants
O	.
O	Envoys
O	had
O	come
O	from
O	him
O	to
O	demand
O	earth
O	and
O	water
O	from
O	each
O	state
O	in
O	Greece
O	,
O	as
O	emblems
O	that
O	land
O	and
O	sea
O	were
O	his
O	,
O	but
O	each
O	state
O	was
O	resolved
O	to
O	be
O	free
O	,
O	and
O	only
O	Thessaly
O	,
O	that
O	which
O	lay
O	first
O	in
O	his
O	path
O	,
O	consented
O	to
O	yield
O	the
O	token
O	of
O	subjugation
O	.
O	A
O	council
O	was
O	held
O	at
O	the
O	Isthmus
O	of
O	Corinth
O	,
O	and
O	attended
O	by
O	deputies

O	of
O	Greece
O	to
O	consider
O	of
O	the
O	best
O	means
O	of
O	defense
O	.
O	The
O	ships
O	of
O	the
O	enemy
O	would
O	coast
O	round
O	the
O	shores
O	of
O	the
O	aegean
O	Sea
O	,
O	the
O	land
O	army
O	would
O	cross
O	the
O	Hellespont
O	on
O	a
O	bridge
O	of
O	boats
O	lashed
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	march
O	southwards
O	into
O	Greece
O	.
O	The
O	only
O	hope
O	of
O	averting
O	the
O	danger
O	lay
O	in
O	defending
O	such
O	passages
O	as
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	nature
O	of
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	were
O	so
O	narrow
O	that
O	only
O	a
O	few
O	persons
O	could
O	fight
O	hand
O	to
O	hand
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	courage
O	would
O	be
O	of
O	more
O	avail
O	than
O	numbers
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	of
O	these
O	passes
O	was
O	called
O	Tempe
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	body
O	of
O	troops
O	was
O	sent
O	to
O	guard
O	it;
O	but
O	they
O	found
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	useless
O	and
O	impossible
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	back
O	again
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	was
O	at
O	Thermopylae
O	.
O	Look
O	in
O	your
O	map
O	of
O	the
O	Archipelago
O	,
O	or
O	aegean
O	Sea
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	then
O	called
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	great
O	island
O	of
O	Negropont
O	,
O	or
O	by
O	its
O	old
O	name
O	,
O	Euboea
O	.
O	It
O	looks
O	like
O	a
O	piece
O	broken
O	off
O	from
O	the
O	coast
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	the
O	north
O	is
O	shaped
O	like
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	a
O	bird
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	beak
O	running
O	into
O	a
O	gulf
O	,
O	that
O	would
O	fit
O	over
O	it
O	,
O	upon
O	the
O	main
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	between
O	the
O	island
O	and
O	the
O	coast
O	is
O	an
O	exceedingly
O	narrow
O	strait
O	.
O	The
O	Persian
O	army
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	march
O	round
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	gulf
O	.
O	They
O	could
O	not
O	cut
O	straight
O	across
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	ridge
O	of
O	mountains
O	called
O	Oeta
O	rose
O	up
O	and
O	barred
O	their
O	way
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	rocks
O	,
O	and
O	precipices
O	came
O	down
O	so
O	near
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	two
O	places
O	there
O	was
O	only
O	room
O	for
O	one
O	single
O	wheel
O	track
O	between
O	the
O	steeps
O	and
O	the
O	impassable
O	morass
O	that
O	formed
O	the
O	border
O	of
O	the
O	gulf
O	on
O	its
O	south
O	side
O	.
O	These
O	two
O	very
O	narrow
O	places
O	were
O	called
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	the
O	pass
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	about
O	a
O	mile
O	apart
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	width
O	left
O	in
O	the
O	intervening
O	space;
O	but
O	in
O	this
O	there
O	were
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	springs
O	of
O	warm
O	mineral
O	water
O	,
O	salt
O	and
O	sulphurous
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	used
O	for
O	the
O	sick
O	to
O	bathe
O	in
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	the
O	place
O	was
O	called
O	Thermopylae
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	Hot
O	Gates
O	.
O	A
O	wall
O	had
O	once
O	been
O	built
O	across
O	the
O	westernmost
O	of
O	these
O	narrow
O	places
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	Thessalians
O	and
O	Phocians
O	,
O	who
O	lived
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	had
O	been
O	at
O	war
O	with
O	one
O	another;
O	but
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	allowed
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	decay
O	,
O	since
O	the
O	Phocians
O	had
O	found
O	out
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	steep
O	narrow
O	mountain
O	path
O	along
O	the
O	bed
O	of
O	a
O	torrent
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	it
O	was
O	possible
O	to
O	cross
O	from
O	one
O	territory
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	without
O	going
O	round
O	this
O	marshy
O	coast
O	road
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	an
O	excellent
O	place
O	to
O	defend
O	.
O	The
O	Greek
O	ships
O	were
O	all
O	drawn
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	further
O	side
O	of
O	Euboea
O	to
O	prevent
O	the
O	Persian
O	vessels
O	from
O	getting
O	into
O	the
O	strait
O	and
O	landing
O	men
O	beyond
O	the
O	pass
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	division
O	of
O	the
O	army
O	was
O	sent
O	off
O	to
O	guard
O	the
O	Hot
O	Gates
O	.
O	The
O	council
O	at
O	the
O	Isthmus
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	pathway
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	that
O	all
O	would
O	be
O	safe
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	the
O	Persians
O	were
O	kept
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	coast
O	path
O	.
O	The
O	troops
O	sent
O	for
O	this
O	purpose
O	were
O	from
O	different
O	cities
O	,
O	and
O	amounted
O	to
O	about
O	4
O	,
O	000
O	who
O	were
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	pass
O	against
O	two
O	millions
O	.
O	The
O	leader
O	of
O	them
O	was
O	Leonidas
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	newly
O	become
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	kings
O	of
O	Sparta
O	,
O	the
O	city
O	that
O	above
O	all
O	in
O	Greece
O	trained
O	its
O	sons
O	to
O	be
O	hardy
O	soldiers
O	,
O	dreading
O	death
O	infinitely
O	less
O	than
O	shame
O	.
O	Leonidas
O	had
O	already
O	made
O	up
O	his
O	mind
O	that
O	the
O	expedition
O	would
O	probably
O	be
O	his
O	death
O	,
O	perhaps
O	because
O	a
O	prophecy
O	had
O	been
O	given
O	at
O	the
O	Temple
O	at
O	Delphi
O	that
O	Sparta
O	should
O	be
O	saved
O	by
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	kings
O	of
O	the
O	race
O	of
O	Hercules
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	allowed
O	by
O	law
O	to
O	take
O	with
O	him
O	300
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	these
O	he
O	chose
O	most
O	carefully
O	,
O	not
O	merely
O	for
O	their
O	strength
O	and
O	courage
O	,
O	but
O	selecting
O	those
O	who
O	had
O	sons
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	no
O	family
O	might
O	be
O	altogether
O	destroyed
O	.
O	These
O	Spartans
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	helots
O	or
O	slaves
O	,
O	made
O	up
O	his
O	own
O	share
O	of
O	the
O	numbers
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	the
O	army
O	was
O	under
O	his
O	generalship
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	even
O	said
O	that
O	the
O	300
O	celebrated
O	their
O	own
O	funeral
O	rites
O	before
O	they
O	set
O	out
O	lest
O	they
O	should
O	be
O	deprived
O	of
O	them
O	by
O	the
O	enemy
O	,
O	since
O	,
O	as
O	we
O	have
O	already
O	seen
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	Greek
O	belief
O	that
O	the
O	spirits
O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	found
O	no
O	rest
O	till
O	their
O	obsequies
O	had
O	been
O	performed
O	.
O	Such
O	preparations
O	did
O	not
O	daunt
O	the
O	spirits
O	of
O	Leonidas
O	and
O	his
O	men
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	Gorgo
O	,
O	not
O	a
O	woman
O	to
O	be
O	faint-hearted
O	or
O	hold
O	him
O	back
O	.
O	Long
O	before
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	little
O	girl
O	,
O	a
O	word
O	of
O	hers
O	had
O	saved
O	her
O	father
O	from
O	listening
O	to
O	a
O	traitorous
O	message
O	from
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Persia;
O	and
O	every
O	Spartan
O	lady
O	was
O	bred
O	up
O	to
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	say
O	to
O	those
O	she
O	best
O	loved
O	that
O	they
O	must
O	come

O	from
O	battle

O	it
O	victoriously
O	or
O	borne
O	upon
O	it
O	as
O	a
O	corpse
O	.
O	When
O	Leonidas
O	came
O	to
O	Thermopylae
O	,
O	the
O	Phocians
O	told
O	him
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	path
O	through
O	the
O	chestnut
O	woods
O	of
O	Mount
O	aeta
O	,
O	and
O	begged
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	privilege
O	of
O	guarding
O	it
O	on
O	a
O	spot
O	high
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	mountain
O	side
O	,
O	assuring
O	him
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	hard
O	to
O	find
O	at
O	the
O	other
O	end
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	every
O	probability
O	that
O	the
O	enemy
O	would
O	never
O	discover
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	consented
O	,
O	and
O	encamping
O	around
O	the
O	warm
O	springs
O	,
O	caused
O	the
O	broken
O	wall
O	to
O	be
O	repaired
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	ready
O	to
O	meet
O	the
O	foe
O	.
O	The
O	Persian
O	army
O	were
O	seen
O	covering
O	the
O	whole
O	country
O	like
O	locusts
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	southern
O	Greeks
O	in
O	the
O	pass
O	began
O	to
O	sink
O	.
O	Their
O	homes
O	in
O	the
O	Peloponnesus
O	were
O	comparatively
O	secure--had
O	they
O	not
O	better
O	fall
O	back
O	and
O	reserve
O	themselves
O	to
O	defend
O	the
O	Isthmus

O	Corinth
O	?
O	But
O	Leonidas
O	,
O	though
O	Sparta
O	was
O	safe
O	below
O	the
O	Isthmus
O	,
O	had
O	no
O	intention
O	of
O	abandoning
O	his
O	northern
O	allies
O	,
O	and
O	kept
O	the

O	to
O	their

O	,
O	only
O	sending

O	Presently
O	a
O	Persian
O	on
O	horseback
O	rode
O	up
O	to
O	reconnoiter
O	the

O	He

O	but
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	ramparts
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	Spartans
O	,
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	engaged
O	in
O	active
O	sports
O	,
O	and
O	others
O	in
O	combing
O	their
O	long
O	hair
O	.
O	He
O	rode
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	.
O	Now
O	Xerxes
O	had
O	in
O	his
O	camp
O	an
O	exiled
O	Spartan
O	prince
O	,
O	named
O	Demaratus
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	become
O	a
O	traitor
O	to
O	his
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	serving
O	as
O	counselor
O	to
O	the
O	enemy
O	.
O	Xerxes
O	sent
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	whether
O	his
O	countrymen
O	were
O	mad
O	to
O	be
O	thus
O	employed
O	instead
O	of
O	fleeing
O	away;
O	but
O	Demaratus
O	made
O	answer
O	that
O	a
O	hard
O	fight
O	was
O	no
O	doubt
O	in
O	preparation
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	custom
O	of
O	the
O	Spartans
O	to
O	array
O	their
O	hair
O	with
O	especial
O	care
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	about
O	to
O	enter
O	upon
O	any
O	great
O	peril
O	.
O	Xerxes
O	would
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	not
O	believe
O	that
O	so
O	petty
O	a
O	force
O	could
O	intend
O	to
O	resist
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	waited
O	four
O	days
O	,
O	probably
O	expecting
O	his
O	fleet
O	to
O	assist
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	,
O	the
O	attack
O	was
O	made
O	.
O	The
O	Greeks
O	,
O	stronger
O	men
O	and
O	more
O	heavily
O	armed
O	,
O	were
O	far
O	better
O	able
O	to
O	fight
O	to
O	advantage
O	than
O	the
O	Persians
O	with
O	their
O	short
O	spears
O	and
O	wicker
O	shields
O	,
O	and
O	beat
O	them
O	off
O	with
O	great
O	ease
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	said
O	that
O	Xerxes
O	three
O	times
O	leapt
O	off
O	his
O	throne
O	in
O	despair
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	his
O	troops
O	being
O	driven
O	backwards;
O	and
O	thus
O	for
O	two
O	days
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	easy
O	to
O	force
O	a
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	Spartans
O	as
O	through
O	the
O	rocks
O	themselves
O	.
O	Nay
O	,
O	how
O	could
O	slavish
O	troops
O	,
O	dragged
O	from
O	home
O	to
O	spread
O	the
O	victories
O	of
O	an
O	ambitious
O	king
O	,
O	fight
O	like
O	freemen
O	who
O	felt
O	that
O	their
O	strokes
O	were
O	to
O	defend
O	their
O	homes
O	and
O	children
O	?
O	That
O	evening
O	a
O	wretched
O	man
O	,
O	named
O	Ephialtes
O	,
O	crept
O	into
O	the
O	Persian
O	camp
O	,
O	and
O	offered
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	great
O	sum
O	of
O	money
O	,
O	to
O	show
O	the
O	mountain
O	path
O	that
O	would
O	enable
O	the
O	enemy
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	brave
O	defenders
O	in
O	the
O	rear
O	!
O	A
O	Persian
O	general
O	,
O	named
O	Hydarnes
O	,
O	was
O	sent
O	off
O	at
O	nightfall
O	with
O	a
O	detachment
O	to
O	secure
O	this
O	passage
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	guided
O	through
O	the
O	thick
O	forests
O	that
O	clothed
O	the
O	hill-side
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	stillness
O	of
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	at
O	daybreak
O	,
O	the
O	Phocian
O	guards
O	of
O	the
O	path
O	were
O	startled
O	by
O	the
O	crackling
O	of
O	the
O	chestnut
O	leaves
O	under
O	the
O	tread
O	of
O	many
O	feet
O	.
O	They
O	started
O	up
O	,
O	but
O	a
O	shower
O	of
O	arrows
O	was
O	discharged
O	on
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	forgetting
O	all
O	save
O	the
O	present
O	alarm
O	,
O	they
O	fled
O	to
O	a
O	higher
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	enemy
O	,
O	without
O	waiting
O	to
O	pursue
O	them
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	descend
O	.
O	As
O	day
O	dawned
O	,
O	morning
O	light
O	showed
O	the
O	watchers
O	of
O	the
O	Grecian
O	camp
O	below
O	a
O	glittering
O	and
O	shimmering
O	in
O	the
O	torrent
O	bed
O	where
O	the
O	shaggy
O	forests
O	opened;
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	the
O	sparkle
O	of
O	water
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	shine
O	of
O	gilded
O	helmets
O	and
O	the
O	gleaming
O	of
O	silvered
O	spears
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	a
O	man
O	crept
O	over
O	to
O	the
O	wall
O	from
O	the
O	Persian
O	camp
O	with
O	tidings
O	that
O	the
O	path
O	had
O	been
O	betrayed
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	enemy
O	were
O	climbing
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	come
O	down
O	beyond
O	the
O	Eastern
O	Gate
O	.
O	Still
O	,
O	the
O	way
O	was
O	rugged
O	and
O	circuitous
O	,
O	the
O	Persians
O	would
O	hardly
O	descend
O	before
O	midday
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	ample
O	time
O	for
O	the
O	Greeks
O	to
O	escape
O	before
O	they
O	could
O	thus
O	be
O	shut
O	in
O	by
O	the
O	enemy
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	short
O	council
O	held
O	over
O	the
O	morning
O	sacrifice
O	.
O	Megistias
O	,
O	the
O	seer
O	,
O	on
O	inspecting
O	the
O	entrails
O	of
O	the
O	slain
O	victim
O	,
O	declared
O	that
O	their
O	appearance
O	boded
O	disaster
O	.
O	Leonidas
O	ordered
O	him
O	to
O	retire
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	refused
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	sent
O	home
O	his
O	only
O	son
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	disgrace
O	in
O	leaving
O	a
O	post
O	that
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	held
O	,
O	and
O	Leonidas
O	recommended
O	all
O	the
O	allied
O	troops
O	under
O	his
O	command
O	to
O	march
O	away
O	while
O	yet
O	the
O	way
O	was
O	open
O	.
O	As
O	to
O	himself
O	and
O	his
O	Spartans
O	,
O	they
O	had
O	made
O	up
O	their
O	minds

O	die
O	at
O	their
O	post
O	,
O	and
O	there

O	no
O	doubt

O	the

O	of
O	such
O	a

O	would
O	do
O	more
O	to

O	All
