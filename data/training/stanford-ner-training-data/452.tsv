O	certain
O	German
O	swindler
O	,
O	named

O	in
O	some

O	the

O	,
O	Lovel
O	remembered

O	seen
O	the

O	in
O	the

O	at
O	Fairport
O	,
O	where

O	,
O	and
O	his
O	black
O	dress
O	bore
O	the

O	The
O	Antiquary's
O	gruff

O	was
O	moved
O	toward

O	there
O	was
O	no
O	reason
O	why
O	they
O	should
O	ever

O	His
O	lands
O	were
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	power

O	Lovel

O	that
O	before

O	he
O	would

O	pay
O	Monkbarns
O	a
O	long
O	visit
O	.
O	While
O	the
O	Antiquary
O	remained
O	talking
O	thus
O	to

O	in

O	a
O	party
O	which

O	Ruth's
O	Priory
O	on

O	to
O	dine
O	and
O	spend
O	the
O	evening
O	at
O	Knockwinnock
O	Castle
O	.
O	Sir
O	Arthur
O	added
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	the
O	same
O	proposal
O	to
O	the
O	family
O	at
O	Monkbarns
O	.
O	So
O	it
O	was
O	agreed
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	go
O	together
O	,
O	Lovel
O	on
O	horseback
O	,
O	and
O	Oldbuck
O	and
O	his

O	(
O	as

O	The

O	dawned

O	in
O	better
O	spirits

O	he
O	had
O	known
O	of

O	With

O	to

O	,

O	his
O	thanks
O	to
O	his
O	preserver
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	of
O	storm
O	,
O	Sir
O	Arthur
O	introduced
O	Lovel
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	man's
O	instinctive
O	dislike
O	at
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	impostor
O	was
O	evidently
O	shared
O	in
O	by
O	the
O	Antiquary
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	lowering
O	of
O	his
O	shaggy
O	eyebrow
O	clearly
O	proclaimed
O	as
O	much
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	the
O	first
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	went
O	well
O	on
O	the
O	whole
O	.
O	Oldbuck
O	took
O	upon
O	himself
O	the
O	office
O	of
O	guide
O	,
O	explaining
O	and
O	translating
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	,
O	leading
O	the
O	company
O	from
O	point
O	to
O	point
O	till
O	they
O	were
O	almost
O	as
O	much
O	at
O	home
O	as
O	himself
O	among
O	the
O	ruins
O	of
O	the
O	Priory

O	Ruth

O	But
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	day
O	were
O	interrupted
O	by
O	the
O	arrival
O	of
O	a
O	young
O	horseman
O	in
O	military
O	undress
O	,
O	whom
O	the

O	who

O	the

O	,

O	his
O	own
O	presence
O	with
O	a
O	haughty
O	and
O	disapproving

O	.
O	Captain
O	MacIntyre
O	attached
O	himself
O	immediately
O	to
O	Miss

O	,
O	and
O	even

O	to

O	to
O	take

O	,
O	after
O	submitting
O	to
O	this
O	close
O	attendance
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	presently
O	turned
O	sharply
O	round
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	a
O	question
O	of
O	the
O	Antiquary
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	date
O	at
O	which
O	the
O	Priory
O	of
O	St

O	Ruth
O	was
O	built
O	.
O	Of
O	course
O	Mr

O	Oldbuck
O	started
O	off
O	like
O	a
O	warhorse
O	at
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	the
O	trumpet
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	long
O	harangue
O	which
O	ensued
O	,
O	mixed
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	with
O	additions
O	and

O	from
O	Sir
O	Arthur
O	and
O	the

O	,
O	Captain
O	MacIntyre
O	found
O	no
O	further
O	chance
O	of
O	appropriating
O	Miss

O	.
O	He
O	left
O	her
O	,
O	accordingly
O	,
O	and
O	walked
O	sulkily
O	by
O	his
O	sister's
O	side
O	.
O	From
O	her
O	he
O	demanded
O	to

O	this
O	Mr
O	.
O	Lovel
O	might
O	be
O	,
O	whom

O	found
O	so

O	at

O	a
O	circle
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	looked
O	forward
O	to
O	shining
O	alone
O	.
O	Mary
O	MacIntyre
O	answered
O	sensibly
O	that
O	,
O	as
O	to
O	who
O	he
O	was
O	,
O	her
O	brother
O	had

O	Captain
