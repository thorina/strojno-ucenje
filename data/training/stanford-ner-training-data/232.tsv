O	A
O	poor
O	man
O	,
O	called
O	Iena
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	Wanderer
O	,
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	roaming
O	about
O	from
O	place
O	to
O	place
O	,
O	forlorn
O	,
O	without
O	relations
O	,
O	and
O	almost
O	helpless
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	often
O	wished
O	for
O	a
O	companion
O	to
O	share
O	his
O	solitude;
O	but
O	who
O	would
O	think
O	of
O	joining
O	their
O	fortunes
O	with
O	those
O	of
O	a
O	poor
O	wanderer
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	no
O	shelter
O	but
O	such
O	as
O	his
O	leather
O	hunting-shirt
O	provided
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	other
O	household
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	than
O	the
O	bundle
O	which
O	he
O	carried
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	which
O	his
O	hunting-shirt
O	was
O	laid
O	away
O	?
O	One
O	day
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	a
O	hunting
O	excursion
O	,
O	to
O	relieve
O	himself
O	of
O	the
O	burden
O	of
O	carrying
O	it
O	,
O	Iena
O	hung
O	up
O	his
O	bundle
O	on
O	the
O	branch
O	of
O	a
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	set
O	out
O	in
O	quest
O	of
O	game
O	.
O	On
O	returning
O	to
O	the
O	spot
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	surprised
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	small
O	but
O	neat
O	lodge
O	built
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	his
O	bundle;
O	and
O	on
O	looking
O	in
O	he
O	beheld
O	a
O	beautiful
O	female
O	,
O	sitting
O	on
O	the
O	further
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	bundle
O	lying
O	beside
O	her
O	.
O	During
O	the
O	day
O	Iena
O	had
O	so
O	far
O	prospered
O	in
O	his
O	sport
O	as
O	to
O	kill
O	a
O	deer
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	now
O	cast
O	down
O	at
O	the
O	lodge
O	door
O	.
O	Without
O	pausing
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	least
O	notice
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	give
O	a
O	word
O	of
O	welcome
O	to
O	the
O	hunter
O	,
O	the
O	woman
O	ran
O	out
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	see
O	whether
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	large
O	deer
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	.
O	In
O	her
O	haste
O	she
O	stumbled
O	and
O	fell
O	at
O	the
O	threshold
O	.
O	Iena
O	looked
O	at
O	her
O	with
O	astonishment
O	,

O	to
O	himself
