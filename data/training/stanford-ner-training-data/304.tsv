O	came
O	down
O	.
O	What
O	a
O	jolly
O	time
O	they
O	had
O	among
O	the
O	strawberries
O	!
O	The
O	Large
O	Doll
O	sat
O	under
O	a
O	vine
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	strawberries
O	dropped
O	into
O	her
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	stiffer
O	dolls
O	stood
O	up
O	and
O	helped
O	themselves
O	.
O	Such
O	fun
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	!
O	They
O	got
O	strawberries
O	all
O	over
O	their
O	faces
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	light
O	dresses
O	!
O	This
O	they
O	liked
O	so
O	much
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	usually
O	had
O	to
O	be
O	careful
O	.
O	How
O	they
O	chatted
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	told
O	how
O	the
O	squirrels
O	lived
O	,
O	and
O	another
O	about
O	the
O	robins
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Spanish
O	Doll
O	told
O	how
O	delightful
O	it
O	was
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	Oriole
O	'
O	s
O	nest
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	half
O	a
O	mind
O	to
O	hire
O	it
O	for
O	the
O	summer
O	.
O	All
O	this
O	was
O	much
O	more
O	charming
O	than
O	their
O	dull
O	baby-house;
O	though
O	the
O	Large
O	Doll
O	declared
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	used
O	all
O	her
O	life
O	to
O	better
O	society
O	than
O	she
O	had
O	yet
O	found
O	in
O	the
O	melon
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	this
O	festivity
O	was
O	put
O	an
O	end
O	to
O	by
O	a
O	sudden
O	shower
O	.
O	The
O	Spanish
O	Doll
O	,
O	afraid
O	for
O	her
O	black
O	lace
O	,
O	made
O	for
O	a
O	hen-coop
O	,
O	where
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	battle
O	with
O	a
O	Poland
O	.
O	The
O	rest
O	ran
O	into
O	the
O	summer-house
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	rain
O	ceased
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	all
O	came
O	out
O	from
O	their
O	hiding-places
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	beautiful
O	rainbow
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	dolls
O	walked
O	down
O	the
O	alley
O	,
O	they
O	suddenly
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	garden
O	gate
O	was
O	open
O	.
O	They
O	ran
O	eagerly
O	toward
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	were
O	out
O	in
O	the
O	Wide
O	World
O	!
O	They
O	crossed
O	the
O	broad
O	road
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	fields
O	,
O	into
O	the
O	meadows
O	.
O	They
O	stumbled
O	through
O	a
O	potato-patch
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	of
O	cornstalks
O	.
O	In
O	their
O	hurry
O	they
O	had
O	to
O	stop
O	to
O	breathe
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	all
O	but
O	one
O	Doll
O	whose
O	mouth
O	was
O	always
O	open
O	.
O	They
O	reached
O	a
O	little
O	stream
O	and
O	ran
O	along
O	its
O	border
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	stopped
O	till
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	shady
O	place
O	among
O	some
O	trees
O	,
O	by
O	mossy
O	rocks
O	.
O	Here
O	they
O	might
O	be
O	safe
O	,
O	and
O	here
O	they
O	stopped
O	to
O	think
O	.
O	Hunger
O	was
O	their
O	first
O	sensation
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	the
O	dolls
O	drew
O	from
O	her
O	pocket
O	a
O	pewter
O	gridiron
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	snatched
O	from
O	the
O	kitchen
O	fire
O	when
O	they
O	fled
O	,
O	the
O	night
O	before
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	three
O	fish
O	on
O	it
O	,
O	one
O	red
O	,
O	one
O	yellow
O	,
O	one
O	blue
O	.
O	These
O	they
O	shared
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	satisfied
O	for
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	.
O	How
O	lovely
O	was
O	the
O	spot
O	,
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	say
O	.
O	How
O	charming
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	to
O	set
O	up
O	housekeeping
O	among
O	the
O	rushes
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	even
O	suggested
O	that
O	,
O	from
O	time
O	to
O	time
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	might
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	deserted
O	baby-house
O	,
O	and
O	bring
O	from
O	it
O	comfortable
O	furniture--a
O	dish
O	here
O	,
O	a
O	flat-iron
O	there
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	their
O	cheerful
O	talk
O	,
O	a
O	terrible
O	accident
O	!
O	The
O	Spanish
O	Doll
O	was
O	thirsty
O	,
O	and
O	leaning
O	over
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	a
O	brook
O	,
O	she
O	lost
O	her
O	balance
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	!
O	The
O	exhausted
O	dolls
O	all
O	rushed
O	to
O	the
O	rescue
O	.
O	All
O	their
O	efforts
O	were
O	vain;
O	but
O	a
O	large
O	Bull-frog
O	kindly
O	came
O	to
O	help
O	,
O	and
O	lifted
O	the
O	Spanish
O	Doll
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	from
O	the
O	stream
O	,
O	and
O	propped
O	it
O	up
O	against
O	the
O	reeds
O	.
O	But
O	what
O	a
O	state
O	she
O	was
O	in
O	!
O	The
O	bright
O	color
O	washed
O	from
O	her
O	cheeks
O	,
O	her
O	raven
O	hair
O	all
O	dimmed
O	,
O	the
O	lustre
O	of
O	her
O	eyes
O	all
O	gone
O	.
O	A
O	fashionable
O	Doll
O	in
O	vain
O	attempted
O	consolation
O	,
O	suggesting
O	the
O	greater
O	charms
O	of
O	light
O	hair
O	and
O	rats;
O	in
O	vain
O	did
O	the
O	Large
O	Doll
O	speak
O	of
O	the
O	romance
O	of
O	the
O	adventure
O	,
O	and
O	call
O	the
O	Bullfrog
O	their
O	Don
O	Quixote;
O	a
O	heavy
O	gloom
O	hung
O	over
O	all
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	Spanish
O	Doll
O	that
O	had
O	led
O	them
O	on
O	,
O	that
O	had
O	kept
O	up
O	their
O	spirits;
O	now
O	hers
O	had
O	failed
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	her
O	feet
O	still
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	she
O	leaned
O	her
O	head
O	wearily
O	against
O	the
O	reeds
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	voices
O	were
O	heard
O	!
O	Steps
O	approached
O	!
O	Each
O	doll
O	rushed
O	to
O	a
O	hiding
O	place
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	Angelica
O	Maria
O	herself
O	!
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	picnic
O	party
O	had
O	decided
O	to
O	walk
O	down
O	the
O	stream
O	,
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	home
O	,
O	and
O	Angelica
O	Maria
O	was
O	among
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	Spanish
O	Doll
O	had
O	drawn
O	a
O	reed
O	across
O	her
O	face
O	,
O	to
O	hide
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	Large
O	Doll
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	fly
O	quickly
O	enough
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	left
O	in
O	full
O	view
O	,
O	leaning
O	against
O	a
O	mullein
O	.
O	A
O	blush
O	suffused
O	her
O	cheek
O	.
O	What

O	Angelica

O	'
O	s

O	!

O	was

O	,
O	--that
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	lifted
O	up

O	But
O	she
O	was

O	.
O	How
O	could
O	she
O	have
O	borne
O	to
O	be

O	?
O	For
O	she
O	felt
O	that

O	of
O	her
O	feet
O	was
O	washed
O	off
O	by
O	the
O	flowing

O	,
O	and
O	her
O	gay
O	yellow
O	and
O	black
O	dress
O	soiled
O	and
O	torn
O	.
O	The
O	Bull-frog
O	at
O	last
O	succeeded
O	in
O	lifting
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	A
O	kindly
O	Musk-rat
O	begged

O	to

O	and
O	was
O	grateful
O	even
O	for

O	humble
O	abode
O	.
O	Often
O	she
O	thought
O	of

O	and
O	cheered
O	the

O	,
O	with
O	the

O	and
O	how

O	been
O	the

O	an
O	Oriole
O	.
O	But

O	Angelica

O	must
O	have
O	retired
O	to

O	.
O	This
O	cheered
O	Angelica

O	fitting
O	new

O	for
O	the
O	poor

O	So
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	Flight
O	of
O	the
O	Dolls
O	.
O	You
O	can

O	ever
O	tried
O	it
O	again
O	,
O	or
O	rested
O	satisfied
O	with

O	A
O	few
O	days
O	after
O	,
O	Angelica
O	Maria
O	saw
O	a
O	little
O	head
O	peeping
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	withered
O	fox-glove
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	littlest
O	China
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	much
O	emaciated
O	,

O	had
O	nothing
O	to

O	but
O	a
O	few
O	drops
O	of
O	honey
O	brought
O	her
O	by
O	a
O	benevolent
O	Bee
O	.
O	Even
O	these
O	had
O	cloyed
O	.
O	Years
O	after
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	spout
O	of
O	the
O	wood-house
O	was
O	cleared
O	out
O	,
O	the
O	boots
O	of
O	a
O	middling-sized
O	Doll
O	were
O	seen
O	.
O	They
O	belonged
O	to
O	the
O	middling-sized
O	Doll
O	with
O	boots
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	clambered
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	dovecote
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	lost
O	her
O	balance
O	in
O	the
O	gutter
O	.
O	She
O	had
O	passed
O	a
O	miserable
O	existence
O	,
O	summer
O	and
O	winter
O	,
O	bewailing
O	her
O	fate
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	at
O	her
O	boots
O	.
