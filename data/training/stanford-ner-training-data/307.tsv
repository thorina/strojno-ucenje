O	The

O	was
O	given
O	to

O	Ephraim

O	.
O	Ephraim
O	had
O	a
O	good
O	house
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	took
O	his

O	,
O	and
O	Atherton
O	went
O	to
O	live
O	in
O	the
O	old

O	.
O	His

O	had
O	been
O	poor
O	enough;
O	he
O	had
O	not

O	so

O	,
O	and
O	had
O	been
O	unable
O	to
O	live
O	as
O	well
O	.
O	It
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	great
O	cross
O	to
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	Dorcas
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	very
O	high
O	spirited
O	.
O	She

O	the

O	household

O	with
O	the

O	Now
O	,

O	eagerly
O	at
O	the
O	opportunity
O	of
O	improving
O	her
O	style
O	of

O	.
O	The

O	house
O	was
O	quite
O	a

O	for
O	those

O	.
O	All
O	the
O	drawback
O	to

O	was
O	,
O	that
O	Grandma
O	should
O	have
O	the
O	southwest

O	.
O	She
O	wanted
O	to

O	Properly
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	the

O	right
O	across
O	the
O	entry
O	from
O	the

O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
