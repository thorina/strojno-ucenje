O	There
O	was
O	once
O	a
O	Merchant
O	who
O	had
O	three
O	daughters
O	,
O	the
O	youngest
O	of
O	whom
O	was
O	so
O	beautiful
O	that
O	everybody
O	called
O	her
O	Beauty
O	.
O	This
O	made
O	the
O	two
O	eldest
O	very
O	jealous;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	spiteful
O	and
O	bad-tempered
O	by
O	nature
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	loving
O	their
O	younger
O	sister
O	they
O	felt
O	nothing
O	but
O	envy
O	and
O	hatred
O	towards
O	her
O	.
O	After
O	some
O	years
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	terrible
O	storm
O	at
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	most
O	of
O	the
O	Merchant's
O	ships
O	were
O	sunk
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	became
O	very
O	poor
O	.
O	He
O	and
O	his
O	family
O	were
O	obliged
O	to
O	live
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	small
O	house
O	and
O	do
O	without
O	the
O	servants
O	and
O	fine
O	clothes
O	to
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	used
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	eldest
O	sisters
O	did
O	nothing
O	but
O	weep
O	and
O	lament
O	for
O	their
O	lost
O	fortune
O	,
O	but
O	Beauty
O	did
O	her
O	best
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	house
O	bright
O	and
O	cheerful
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	her
O	father
O	might
O	not
O	miss
O	too
O	much
O	all
O	the
O	comfort
O	and
O	luxury
O	to
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	used
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	the
O	Merchant
O	told
O	his
O	daughters
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	journey
O	into
O	foreign
O	lands
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	recovering
O	some
O	of
O	his
O	property
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	asked
O	them

O	The
O	eldest

O	the

O	Then
O	he
O	said
O	good-bye
O	to
O	his
O	children

O	set
O	out
O	on

O	travels
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	away
O	for
O	nearly
O	a
