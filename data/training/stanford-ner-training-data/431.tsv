O	so

O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	so
O	tall

O	his
O	portraits
O	have

O	,
O	and
O	another

O	across
O	the
O	Rappahannock
O	at
O	Fredericksburg
O	.
O	The
O	stone
O	was

O	about

O	spanned

O	river

O	and
O	it
O	took
O	the

O	at

O	on

O	their
O	friends
O	when
O	they
O	would
O	try
O	their
O	powers
O	at
O	a
O	high
O	jump
O	put
O	up
O	in
O	our
O	yard
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	younger
O	children
O	he
O	petted
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	,
O	and
O	our
O	greatest
O	treat
O	was
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	his
O	bed
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	and
O	lie
O	close
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	listening
O	while
O	he
O	talked
O	to
O	us
O	in
O	his
O	bright
O	,
O	entertaining
O	way
O	.
O	This
O	custom
O	we
O	kept
O	up
O	until
O	I
O	was
O	ten
O	years
O	old
O	and
O	over
O	.
O	Although
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	joyous
O	and
O	familiar
O	with
O	us
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	firm
O	on
O	all
O	proper
O	occasions
O	,
O	never
O	indulged
O	us
O	in
O	anything
O	that
O	was
O	not
O	good
O	for
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	exacted
O	the
O	most
O	implicit
O	obedience
O	.
O	I
O	always
O	knew
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	impossible
O	to
O	disobey
O	my
O	father
O	.
O	I
O	felt
O	it
O	in
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	never
O	thought
O	why
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	perfectly
O	sure
O	when
O	he
O	gave
O	an
O	order
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	to
O	be
O	obeyed
O	.
O	My
O	mother
O	I
O	could
O	sometimes
O	circumvent
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	times
O	took
O	liberties
O	with
O	her
O	orders
O	,
O	construing
O	them
O	to
O	suit
O	myself;
O	but
O	exact
O	obedience
O	to
O	every
O	mandate
O	of
O	my
O	father
O	was
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	my
O	life
O	and
O	being
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	.
O	In
O	January
O	,
O	1849
O	,
O	Captain
O	Lee
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	a
O	board
O	of
O	army
O	officers
O	appointed
O	to
O	examine
O	the
O	coasts
O	of
O	Florida
O	and
O	its
O	defences
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	recommend
O	locations
O	for
O	new
O	fortifications
O	.
O	In
O	April
O	he
O	was
O	assigned
O	to
O	the
O	duty
O	of
O	the
O	construction
O	of
O	Fort
O	Carroll
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	Patapsco
O	River
O	,
O	below
O	Baltimore
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	there
O	,
O	I
O	think
O	,
O	for
O	three
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	house
O	on
O	Madison
O	Street
O	,
O	three
O	doors
O	above
O	Biddle
O	.
O	I
O	used
O	to
O	go
O	down
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	Fort
O	quite
O	often
O	.
O	We
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	wharf
O	in
O	a
O	""""
O	bus
O	,
O	""""
O	and
O	there
O	we
O	were
O	met
O	by
O	a
O	boat
O	with
O	two
O	oarsmen
O	,
O	who
O	rowed
O	us
O	down
O	to
O	Sellers
O	Point
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	was
O	generally
O	left
O	under
O	the
O	care
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	who
O	lived
O	there
O	,
O	while
O	my
O	father
O	went
O	over
O	to
O	the
O	Fort
O	,
O	a
O	short
O	distance
O	out
O	in
O	the
O	river
O	.
O	These
O	days
O	were
O	very
O	happy
O	ones
O	for
O	me
O	.
O	The
O	wharves
O	,
O	the
O	shipping
O	,
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	the
O	boat
O	and
O	oarsmen
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	country
O	dinner
O	we
O	had
O	at
O	the
O	house
O	at
O	Sellers
O	Point
O	,
O	all
O	made
O	a
O	strong
O	impression
O	on
O	me
O	,
O	but
O	above
O	all
O	I
O	remember
O	my
O	father;
O	his
O	gentle
O	,
O	loving
O	care
O	for
O	me
O	,
O	his
O	bright
O	talk
O	,
O	his
O	stories
O	,
O	his
O	maxims
O	and
O	teachings
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	very
O	proud
O	of
O	him
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	evident
O	respect
O	for
O	and
O	trust
O	in
O	him
O	every
O	one
O	showed
O	.
O	These
O	impressions
O	,
O	obtained
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	have
O	never
O	left
O	me
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	favourite
O	in
O	Baltimore
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	everywhere
O	,
O	especially
O	with
O	ladies
O	and
O	little
O	children
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	and
O	my
O	mother
O	went
O	out
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	to
O	some
O	entertainment
O	,
O	we
O	were
O	often
O	allowed
O	to
O	sit
O	up
O	and
O	see
O	them
O	off;
O	my
O	father
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	remember
O	,
O	always
O	in
O	full
O	uniform
O	,
O	always
O	ready
O	and
O	waiting
O	for
O	my
O	mother
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	generally
O	late
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	then
O	chide
O	her
O	gently
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	playful
O	way
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	bright
O	smile
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	then
O	bid
O	us
O	good-bye
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	would
O	go
O	to
O	sleep
O	with
O	this
O	beautiful
O	picture
O	on
O	my
O	mind
O	,
O	the
O	golden
O	epaulets
O	and
O	all--
O	chiefly
O	the
O	epaulets
O	.
O	In
O	Baltimore
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	my
O	first
O	school
O	,
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	Mr
O	.
O	Rollins
O	on
O	Mulberry
O	Street
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	remember
O	how
O	interested
O	my
O	father
O	was
O	in
O	my
O	studies
O	,
O	my
O	failures
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	little
O	triumphs
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	always
O	,
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	at
O	school
O	and
O	college
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	only
O	wish
O	that
O	all
O	of
O	the
O	kind
O	,
O	sensible
O	,
O	useful
O	letters
O	he
O	wrote
O	me
O	had
O	been
O	preserved
O	.
O	My
O	memory
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	move
O	from
O	Baltimore
O	,
O	which
O	occurred
O	in
O	1852
O	,
O	is
O	very
O	dim
O	.
O	I
O	think
O	the
O	family
O	went
O	to
O	Arlington
O	to
O	remain
O	until
O	my
O	father
O	had
O	arranged
O	for
O	our
O	removal
O	to
O	the
O	new
O	home
O	at
O	West
O	Point
O	.
O	My
O	recollection
O	of
O	my
O	father
O	as
O	Superintendent
O	of
O	the
O	West
O	Point
O	Military
O	Academy
O	is
O	much
O	more
O	distinct
O	.
O	He
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	which
O	is
O	still
O	occupied
O	by
O	the
O	Superintendent
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	built
O	of
O	stone
O	,
O	large
O	and
O	roomy
O	,
O	with
O	gardens
O	,
O	stables
O	,
O	and
O	pasture
O	lots
O	.
O	We
O	,
O	the
O	two
O	youngest
O	children
O	,
O	enjoyed
O	it
O	all
O	.
O	Grace
O	Darling
O	and
O	Santa
O	Anna
O	were
O	with
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	a
O	fine
O	ride
O	did
O	I
O	have
O	with
O	my
O	father
O	in
O	the
O	afternoons
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	released
O	from
O	his
O	office
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	mount
O	his
O	old
O	mare
O	and
O	,
O	with
O	Santa
O	Anna
O	carrying
O	me
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	,
O	take
O	a
O	five
O	or
O	ten-mile
O	trot
O	.
O	Though
O	the
O	pony
O	cantered
O	delightfully
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	make
O	me
O	keep
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	trot
O	,
O	saying
O	playfully
O	that
O	the
O	hammering
O	I
O	sustained
O	was
O	good
O	for
O	me
O	.
O	We
O	rode
O	the
O	dragoonseat
O	,
O	no
O	posting
O	,
O	and
O	until
O	I
O	became
O	accustomed
O	to
O	it
O	I
O	used
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	tired
O	by
O	the
O	time
O	I
O	got
O	back
O	.
O	My
O	father
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	punctual
O	man
O	I
O	ever
O	knew
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	always
O	ready
O	for
O	family
O	prayers
O	,
O	for
O	meals
O	,
O	and
O	met
O	every
O	engagement
O	,
O	social
O	or
O	business
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	moment
O	.
O	He
O	expected
O	all
O	of
O	us
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	same
O	,
O	and
O	taught
O	us
O	the
O	use
O	and
O	necessity
O	of
O	forming
O	such
O	habits
O	for
O	the
O	convenience
O	of
O	all
O	concerned
O	.
O	I
O	never
O	knew
O	him
O	late
O	for
O	Sunday
O	service
O	at
O	the
O	Post
O	Chapel
O	.
O	He
O	used
O	to
O	appear
O	some
O	minutes
O	before
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	us
O	,
O	in
O	uniform
O	,
O	jokingly
O	rallying
O	my
O	mother
O	for
O	being
O	late
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	forgetting
O	something
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	moment
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	could
O	wait
O	no
O	longer
O	for
O	her
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	say
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	march
O	along
O	to
O	church
O	by
O	himself
O	or
O	with
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	children
O	who
O	were
O	ready
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	sat
O	very
O	straight--well
O	up
O	the
O	middle
O	aisle--
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	remember
O	,
O	always
O	became
O	very
O	sleepy
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	even
O	took
O	a
O	little
O	nap
O	during
O	the
O	sermon
O	.
O	At
O	that
O	time
O	,
O	this
O	drowsiness
O	of
O	my
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	was
O	something
O	awful
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	inexplicable
O	.
O	I
O	know
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	hard

O	me
O	to
O	keep

O	did

O	He
O	at

O	through
O	the

O	performed
O	my
O	duty
O	properly
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	think
O	I
O	enjoyed
O	this

O	However
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	kept
O	at

O	very

O	My

O	in
O	every
O	healthy
O	outdoor
O	exercise
O	and
O	sport
O	.
O	He
O	taught

O	giving
O	me
O	minute
O	instructions
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	reasons
O	for

O	.
O	He
O	gave
O	me
O	my
O	first
O	sled
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	used
O	to
O	come
O	out
O	where
O	we
O	boys
O	were
O	coasting
O	to
O	look
O	on

O	He
O	gave
O	me
O	my
O	first
O	pair
O	of
O	skates
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	care
O	of
O	a
O	trustworthy
O	person
O	,
O	inquiring
O	regularly
O	how
O	I
O	progressed
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	the
