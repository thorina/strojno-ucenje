O	The

O	again
O	the

O	the

O	Thirty
O	thousand

O	was
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	his
O	sentence
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	Prometheus
O	knew
O	that
O	at
O	any

O	he
O	could
O	have
O	brought
O	his
O	torment
O	to
O	an

O	.
O	A
O	secret
O	was

O	secret
O	,
O	the
O	revelation
O	of
O	which

O	in
O	the
O	favour
O	of
O	the
O	all-powerful
O	god
O	.
O	Yet
O	did
O	he
O	prefer
O	to
O	endure
O	his
O	agonies
O	rather
O	than
O	to
O	free
O	himself
O	by
O	bowing
O	to
O	the
O	desires
O	of
O	a

O	who
O	had

O	raised
O	him
O	almost

O	.
O	Thus
O	for

O	the

O	centuries
O	dragged
O	by--in
