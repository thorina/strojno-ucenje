O	A
O	long
O	,
O	long
O	time

O	,
O	some
O	Indians
O	were
O	running
O	along
O	a
O	trail
O	that
O	led
O	to
O	an
O	Indian
O	settlement
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	ran
O	,
O	a
O	rabbit
O	jumped
O	from
O	the
O	bushes
O	and
O	sat
O	before
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	Indians
O	stopped
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	rabbit
O	still
O	sat
O	up
O	before
O	them
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	move
O	from
O	the
O	trail
O	.
O	They
O	shot
O	their
O	arrows
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	arrows
O	came
O	back
O	unstained
O	with
O	blood
O	.
O	A
O	second
O	time
O	they
O	drew
O	their
O	arrows
O	.
O	Now
O	no
O	rabbit
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	Instead
O	,
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	stood
O	on
O	the
O	trail
O	.
O	He
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	weak
O	and
O	sick
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	man
O	asked
O	them
O	for
O	food
O	and
O	a
O	place
O	to
O	rest
O	.
O	They
O	would
O	not
O	listen
O	but
O	went
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	settlement
O	.
O	Slowly
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	followed
O	them
O	,
O	down
O	the
O	trail
O	to
O	the
O	wigwam

O	In
O	front

O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	skin

O	This

O	he
O	stopped
O	at
O	a

O	a

O	shell
O	was
O	hanging
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	family
O	would
O	not

O	He
O	tried
O	a
