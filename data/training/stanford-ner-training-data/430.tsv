O	I
O	hope
O	you
O	have
O	not
O	forgotten
O	,
O	my
O	dear
O	child
O	,
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	cruel
O	wars
O	of
O	Scotland
O	arose
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	debate
O	between
O	the
O	great
O	lords
O	who
O	claimed
O	the
O	throne
O	after
O	King
O	Alexander
O	the
O	Third's
O	death
O	.
O	The
O	Scottish
O	nobility
O	rashly
O	submitted
O	the
O	decision
O	of
O	that
O	matter
O	to
O	King
O	Edward
O	I
O	of
O	England
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	opened
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	his
O	endeavouring
O	to
O	seize
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Scotland
O	to
O	himself
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	natural
O	that
O	such
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	as
O	were
O	still
O	determined
O	to
O	fight
O	for
O	the
O	deliverance
O	of
O	their
O	country
O	from
O	the
O	English
O	,
O	should
O	look
O	round
O	for
O	some
O	other
O	King
O	,
O	under
O	whom
O	they
O	might
O	unite
O	themselves
O	,
O	to
O	combat
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	England
O	.
O	Amongst
O	these
O	,
O	the
O	principal
O	candidates
O	,
O	were
O	two
O	powerful
O	noblemen
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	was
O	Robert
O	Bruce
O	,
O	Earl
O	of
O	Carrick;
O	the
O	other
O	was
O	John
O	Comyn
O	,
O	or
O	Cuming
O	,
O	of
O	Badenoch
O	,
O	usually
O	called
O	the
O	Red
O	Comyn
O	,
O	to
O	distinguish
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	kinsman
O	,
O	the
O	Black
O	Comyn
O	,
O	so
O	named
O	from
O	his
O	swarthy
O	complexion
O	.
O	These
O	two
O	great
O	and
O	powerful
O	barons
O	had
O	taken
O	part
O	with
O	Sir
O	William
O	Wallace
O	in
O	the
O	wars
O	against
O	England;
O	but
O	,
O	after
O	his
O	defeat
O	,
O	being
O	careful
O	of
O	losing
O	their
O	great
O	estates
O	,
O	and
O	considering
O	the
O	freedom
O	of
O	Scotland
O	as
O	beyond
O	the
O	possibility
O	of
O	being
O	recovered
O	,
O	both
O	Bruce
O	and
O	Comyn
O	had
O	not
O	only
O	submitted
O	themselves
O	to
O	Edward
O	,
O	and
O	acknowledged
O	his
O	title
O	as
O	King
O	of
O	Scotland
O	,
O	but
O	even
O	borne
O	arms
O	,
O	along
O	with
O	the
O	English
O	,
O	against
O	such
O	of
O	their
O	countrymen
O	as
O	still
O	continued
O	to
O	resist
O	the
O	usurper
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	feelings
O	of
O	Bruce
O	concerning
O	the
O	baseness
O	of
O	this
O	conduct
O	,
O	are
O	said
O	,
O	by
O	the
O	old
O	tradition
O	of
O	Scotland
O	,
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	awakened
O	by
O	the
O	following
O	incident
O	.
O	In
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	numerous
O	battles
O	,
O	or
O	skirmishes
O	,
O	which
O	took
O	place
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	between
O	the
O	English
O	and
O	their
O	adherents
O	on
O	the
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	insurgent
O	or
O	patriotic
O	Scots
O	upon
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	Robert
O	the
O	Bruce
O	was
O	present
O	,
O	and
O	assisted
O	the
O	English
O	to
O	gain
O	the
O	victory
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	battle
O	was
O	over
O	,
O	he
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	dinner
O	among
O	his
O	southern
O	friends
O	and
O	allies
O	,
O	without
O	washing
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	there
O	still
O	remained
O	spots
O	of
O	the
O	blood
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	shed
O	during
O	the
O	action
O	.
O	The
O	English
O	lords
O	,
O	observing
O	this
O	whispered
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	in
O	mockery
O	,

O	""""
O	Bruce
O	heard
O	what

O	began
O	to
O	reflect
O	that
O	the

O	might
O	be

O	laughed
O	at
O	and
O	mocked
O	him

O	unnatural

O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	shocked
O	and
O	disgusted
O	that
O	he
O	arose
O	from
O	table
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	going
O	into
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	chapel
O	,
O	shed
O	many
O	tears
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	asking
O	pardon
O	of
O	God
O	for
O	the
O	great
O	crime
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	guilty
O	of
O	,
O	made
O	a
O	solemn
O	vow
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	atone
O	for
O	it
O	by
O	doing
O	all
O	in
O	his
O	power
O	to
O	deliver
O	Scotland
O	from
O	the
O	foreign
O	yoke
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	he
O	left
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	said
O	,
O	the
O	English
O	army
O	,
O	and
O	never

O	watching
O	an
O	opportunity
O	for
O	restoring
O	the
O	freedom
O	of
O	his
O	country
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	this
O	Robert
O	the
O	Bruce
O	was
O	held
O	the
O	best
O	warrior
O	in
O	Scotland
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	very
O	wise
O	and
O	prudent
O	,
O	and
O	an
O	excellent
O	general;
O	that
O	is
O	,
O	he
O	knew
O	how
O	to
O	conduct
O	an
O	army
O	,
O	and
O	place
O	them
O	in
O	order
O	for
O	battle
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	or
O	better
O	than
O	any
O	great
O	man
O	of
O	his
O	time
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	generous
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	and
O	courteous
O	by
O	nature;
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	some
O	faults
O	,
O	which
O	perhaps
O	belonged
O	as
O	much
O	to
O	the
O	fierce
O	period
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	lived
O	as
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	character
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	rash
O	and
O	passionate
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	passion
O	he
O	was
O	sometimes
O	relentless
O	and
O	cruel
O	.
O	Robert
O	the
O	Brace
O	had
O	fixed
O	his
O	purpose
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	told
O	you
O	,
O	to
O	attempt
O	once
O	again
O	to
O	drive
O	the
O	English
O	out
O	of
O	Scotland
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	desired
O	to
O	prevail
O	upon
O	Sir
O	John
O	,
O	the
O	Red
O	Comyn
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	his
O	rival
O	in
O	his
O	pretensions
O	to
O	the
O	throne
O	,
O	to
O	join
O	with
O	him
O	in
O	expelling
O	the
O	foreign
O	enemy
O	by
O	their
O	common
O	efforts
O	.
O	With
O	this
O	purpose
O	,
O	Bruce
O	requested
O	an
O	interview
O	with
O	John
O	Comyn
O	.
O	They
O	met
O	in
O	the
O	Church
O	of
O	the
O	Minorites
O	in
O	Dunfries
O	,
O	before
O	the
O	high
O	altar
O	.
O	What
O	passed
O	betwixt
O	them
O	is
O	not
O	known
O	with
O	certainty;
O	but
O	they
O	quarrelled
O	,
O	either
O	concerning
O	their
O	mutual
O	pretensions
O	to
O	the
O	Crown
O	,
O	or
O	because
O	Comyn
O	refused
O	to
O	join
O	Bruce
O	in
O	the
O	proposed
O	insurrection
O	against
O	the
O	English;
O	or
O	,
O	as
O	many
O	writers
O	say
O	,
O	because
O	Bruce
O	charged
O	Comyn
O	with
O	having
O	betrayed
O	to
O	the
O	English
O	his
O	purpose
O	of
O	rising
O	up
O	against
O	King
O	Edward
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	certain
O	,
O	that
O	these
O	two
O	haughty
O	barons
O	came
O	to
O	high
O	and
O	abusive
O	words
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	length
O	Bruce
O	forgot
O	the
O	sacred
O	character
O	of
O	the
O	place
O	in
O	which
O	they
O	stood
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	Comyn
O	a
O	blow
O	with
O	his
O	dagger
O	.
O	Having
O	done
O	this
O	rash
O	deed
O	,
O	he
O	instantly
O	ran
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	church
O	and
O	called
O	for
O	his
O	horse
O	.
O	Two
O	friends
O	of
O	Bruce
O	were
O	in
O	attendance
O	on
O	him
O	.
O	Seeing
O	him
O	pale
O	,
O	bloody
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	much
O	agitation
O	they
O	eagerly
O	inquired
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter
O	.
O	"""I"
O	doubt
O	,
O	""""
O	said
O	Bruce
O	,
O	"""that"

O	Accordingly
O	,
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	companion
O	rushed
O	into
O	the
O	church
O	and
O	made
O	the
O	matter
O	certain
O	with
O	a
O	vengeance
O	,
O	by
O	dispatching
O	the
O	wounded
O	Comyn
O	with
O	their
O	daggers
O	.
O	His
O	uncle
O	,
O	Sir
O	Robert
O	Comyn
O	,
O	was
O	slain
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	.
O	This
O	slaughter
O	of
O	Comyn
O	was
O	a
O	rash
O	and
O	cruel
O	action
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	followed
O	by
O	the
O	displeasure
O	of
O	Heaven;
O	for
O	no
O	man
O	ever
O	went
O	through
O	more
O	misfortunes
O	than
O	Robert
O	Bruce
O	,
O	although
O	he
O	at
O	length
O	rose
O	to
O	great
O	honour
O	.
O	After
O	the
O	deed
O	was
O	done
O	,
O	Bruce
O	might
O	be
O	called
O	desperate
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	committed
O	an
O	action
O	which
O	was
O	sure
O	to
O	bring
O	down
O	upon
O	him
O	the
O	vengeance
O	of
O	all
O	Comyn's
O	relations
O	,
O	the
O	resentment
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	England
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	displeasure
O	of
O	the
O	Church
O	,
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	having
O	slain
O	his
O	enemy
O	within
O	consecrated
O	ground
O	.
O	He
O	determined
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	to
O	bid
O	them
O	all
O	defiance
O	at
O	once
O	,

O	to
O	assert
O	his
O	pretensions
O	to
O	the
O	throne
O	of
O	Scotland
O	.
O	He
O	drew
O	his
O	own
O	followers
O	together
O	,
O	summoned
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	such
O	barons
O	as
O	still
O	entertained
O	hopes
O	of
O	the
O	freedom
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	crowned
O	King
O	at
O	the
O	Abbey
O	of
O	Scone
O	,
O	the
O	usual
O	place
O	where
O	the

O	Everything
O	relating

O	A

O	Macduff

O	whose
O	duty
O	it
O	was
O	to

O	King's

O	.
O	Though
O	now
O	old

O	feeble
O	,
O	and
O	sickly
O	,
O	he
O	made

O	would
O	never
O	again
O	draw
O	his
O	sword
O	upon
O	a
O	Christian
O	,
O	but
O	would

O	against
O	Bruce
O	accordingly
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	a
O	powerful
O	army
O	.
O	The
O	commencement
O	of
O	Bruce's
O	undertaking
O	was
O	most
O	disastrous
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	crowned
O	on
O	the
O	twenty-ninth
O	of
O	March
O	,
O	1306
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	eighteenth
O	of
O	May
O	he
O	was
O	ex-communicated
O	by
O	the
O	Pope
O	,
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	murder
O	of
O	Comyn
O	within
O	consecrated
O	ground
O	,
O	a
O	sentence
O	which
O	excluded
O	him
O	from
O	all
O	benefits
O	of
O	religion
O	,
O	and
O	authorized
O	any
O	one
O	to
O	kill
O	him
O	.
O	Finally
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	nineteenth
O	of
O	June
O	,
O	the
O	new
O	King
O	was
O	completely
O	defeated
O	near
O	Methven
O	by
O	the
O	English
O	Earl
O	of
O	Pembroke
O	.
O	Robert's
O	horse
O	was
O	killed
O	under
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	action
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	for
O	a
O	moment
O	a
O	prisoner
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	had
O	fallen
O	into
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	a
O	Scottish
O	knight
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	served
O	in
O	the
O	English
O	army
O	,
O	did
O	not
O	choose
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	instrument
O	of
O	putting
O	Bruce
O	into
O	their
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	allowed
O	him
O	to
O	escape
O	.
O	Bruce
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	few
O	brave
O	adherents
O	,
O	among
O	whom
O	was
O	the
O	young
O	lord
O	of
O	Douglas
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	afterward
O	called
O	the
O	Good
O	Lord
O	James
O	,
O	retired
O	into
O	the
O	Highland
O	mountains
O	.
O	The
O	Bruce's
O	wife
O	,
O	now
O	Queen
O	of
O	Scotland
O	,
O	with
O	several
O	other
O	ladies
O	,
O	accompanied
O	her
O	husband
O	and
O	his
O	few
O	followers
O	during
O	their
O	wanderings
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	way
O	of
O	providing
O	for
O	them
O	save
O	by
O	hunting
O	and
O	fishing
O	.
O	Driven
O	from
O	one
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	Highlands
O	to
O	another
O	,
O	starved
O	out
O	of
O	some
O	districts
O	,
O	and
O	forced
O	from
O	others
O	by
O	the
O	opposition
O	of
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	,
O	Bruce
O	attempted
O	to
O	force
O	his
O	way
O	into
O	Lorn;
O	but
O	he
O	found
O	enemies
O	everywhere
O	.
O	The
O	MacDougals
O	,
O	a
O	powerful
O	family
O	,
O	then
O	called
O	Lords
O	of
O	Lorn
O	,
O	were
O	friendly
O	to
O	the
O	English
O	,
O	and
O	attacked
O	Bruce
O	and
O	his
O	wandering
O	companions
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	attempted
O	to
O	enter
O	their
O	territory
O	.
O	The
O	chief
O	,
O	called
O	John
O	of
O	Lorn
O	,
O	hated
O	Bruce
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	having
O	slain
O	the
O	Red
O	Comyn
O	,
O	to
O	whom
O	this
O	MacDougal
O	was
O	nearly
O	related
O	.
O	Bruce
O	was
O	again
O	defeated
O	by
O	this
O	chief
O	.
O	He
O	directed
O	his
O	men
O	to
O	retreat
O	through
O	a
O	narrow
O	pass
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	placing
O	himself
O	last
O	of
O	the
O	party
O	,
O	he
O	fought
O	with
O	and
O	slew
O	such
O	of
O	the
O	enemy
O	as
O	attempted
O	to
O	press
O	hard
O	on
O	them
O	.
O	Three
O	followers
O	of
O	MacDougal
O	,
O	a
O	father
O	and
O	two
O	sons
O	,
O	called
O	MacAndrosser
O	,
O	all
O	very
O	strong
O	men
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	Bruce
O	thus
O	protecting
O	the
O	retreat
O	of
O	his
O	followers
O	,
O	rushed
O	on
O	the
O	King
O	at
O	once
O	.
O	Bruce
O	was
O	on
O	horseback
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	strait
O	pass
O	betwixt
O	a
O	precipitous
O	rock
O	and
O	a
O	deep
O	lake
O	.
O	He
O	struck
O	the
O	first
O	man
O	a
O	blow
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	,
O	as
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	freed
O	the
O	bridle
O	.
O	The
O	man
O	bled
O	to
O	death
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	brother
O	had
O	meantime
O	grasped
O	Bruce
O	by
O	the
O	leg
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	attempting
O	to
O	throw
O	him
O	from
O	horseback
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	,
O	setting
O	spurs
O	to
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	made
O	the
O	animal
O	suddenly
O	spring
O	forward
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	Highlander
O	fell
O	under
O	the
O	horse's
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	endeavouring
O	to
O	rise
O	again
O	,
O	Bruce
O	cleft
O	his
O	head
O	in
O	two
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	.
O	The
O	father
O	,
O	seeing
O	his
O	two
O	sons
O	thus
O	slain
O	,
O	flew
O	desperately
O	at
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	and
O	grasped
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	mantle
O	so
O	close
O	to
O	his
O	body
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	have
O	room
O	to
O	wield
O	his
O	long
O	sword
O	.
O	But
O	with
O	the
O	heavy
O	pummel
O	of
O	that
O	weapon
O	the
O	King
O	struck
O	this
O	third
O	assailant
O	so
O	dreadful
O	a
O	blow
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	dashed
O	out
O	his
O	brains
O	.
O	Still
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	Highlander
O	kept
O	his
O	dying
O	grasp
O	on
O	the
O	King's
O	mantle;
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	free
O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	body
O	,
O	Bruce
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	undo
O	the
O	brooch
O	,
O	or
O	clasp
O	,
O	by
O	which
O	it
O	was
O	fastened
O	,
O	and
O	leave
O	that
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	mantle
O	itself
O	,
O	behind
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	brooch
O	,
O	which
O	fell
O	thus
O	into
O	the
O	possession
O	of
O	MacDougal
O	of
O	Lorn
O	,
O	is
O	still
O	preserved
O	in
O	that
O	ancient
O	family
O	as
O	a
O	memorial
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	met
O	with
O	many
O	such
O	encounters
O	amidst
O	his
O	dangerous
O	and
O	dismal
O	wanderings;
O	yet
O	,
O	though
O	almost
O	always
O	defeated
O	by
O	the
O	superior
O	numbers
O	of
O	the
O	English
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	such
O	Scots
O	as
O	sided
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	he
O	still
O	kept
O	up
O	his
O	own
O	spirits
O	and
O	those
O	of
O	his
O	followers
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	better
O	scholar
O	than
O	was
O	usual
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	except
O	clergymen
O	,
O	few
O	people
O	learned
O	to
O	read
O	and
O	write
O	.
O	But
O	King
O	Robert
O	could
O	do
O	both
O	very
O	well;
O	and
O	we
O	are
O	told
O	that
O	he
O	sometimes
O	read
O	aloud
O	to
O	his
O	companions
O	,
O	to
O	amuse
O	them
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	crossing
O	the
O	great
O	Highland
O	lakes
O	,
O	in
O	such
O	wretched
O	leaky
O	boats
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	find
O	for
O	that
O	purpose
O	.
O	Loch
O	Lomond
O	,
O	in
O	particular
O	,
O	is
O	said
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	the
O	scene
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	lecture
O	.
O	You
O	may
O	see
O	by
O	this
O	,
O	how
O	useful
O	it
O	is
O	to
O	possess
O	knowledge
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	dangers
O	increased
O	so
O	much
O	around
O	the
O	brave
O	King
O	Robert
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	separate
O	himself
O	from
O	his
O	Queen
O	and
O	her
O	ladies
O	.
O	So
O	Bruce
O	left
O	his
O	Queen
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	Countess
O	of
O	Buchan
O	and
O	others
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	only
O	castle
O	which
O	remained
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	called
O	Kildrummie
O	,
O	and
O	is
O	situated
O	near
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	Don
O	in
O	Aberdeenshire
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	also
O	left
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	Nigel
O	Bruce
O	,
O	to
O	defend
O	the
O	castle
O	against
O	the
O	English;
O	and
O	he
O	himself
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	second
O	brother
O	Edward
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	brave
O	man
O	,
O	went
O	over
O	to
O	an
O	island
O	called
O	Rachrin
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	Ireland
O	,
O	where
O	Bruce
O	and
O	the
O	few
O	men
O	who
O	followed
O	his
O	fortunes
O	passed
O	the
O	winter
O	of
O	1306
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	Kildrummie
O	was
O	taken
O	by
O	the
O	English
O	,
O	and
O	Nigel
O	Bruce
O	,
O	a
O	beautiful
O	and
O	brave
O	youth
O	,
O	was
O	cruelly
O	put
O	to
O	death
O	by
O	the
O	victors
O	.
O	The
O	ladies
O	who
O	had
O	attended
O	on
O	Robert's
O	Queen
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	Queen
O	herself
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Countess
O	of
O	Buchan
O	,
O	were
O	thrown
O	into
O	strict
O	confinement
O	.
O	The
O	Countess
O	of
O	Buchan
O	had
O	given
O	Edward
O	great
O	offence
O	by
O	being
O	the
O	person
O	who
O	placed
O	the
O	crown
O	on
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	Robert
O	Bruce
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	imprisoned
O	within
O	the
O	Castle
O	of
O	Berwick
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	cage
O	.
O	The
O	cage
O	was
O	a
O	strong
O	wooden
O	and
O	iron
O	piece
O	of
O	frame-work
O	,
O	placed
O	within
O	an
O	apartment
O	,
O	and
O	resembling
O	one
O	of
O	those
O	places
O	in
O	which
O	wild-beasts
O	are
O	confined
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	such
O	cages
O	in
O	most
O	old
O	prisons
O	to
O	which
O	captives
O	were
O	consigned
O	,
O	who
O	were
O	to
O	be
O	confined
O	with
O	peculiar
O	rigour
O	.
O	The
O	news
O	of
O	the
O	taking
O	of
O	Kildrummie
O	,
O	the
O	captivity
O	of
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	execution
O	of
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	reached
O	Bruce
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	residing
O	in
O	a
O	miserable
O	dwelling
O	at
O	Rachrin
O	,
O	and
O	reduced
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	despair
O	.
O	After
O	receiving
O	the
O	intelligence
O	from
O	Scotland
O	,
O	Bruce
O	was
O	lying
O	one
O	morning
O	on
O	his
O	wretched
O	bed
O	,
O	and
O	deliberating
O	with
O	himself
O	whether
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	better
O	resign
O	all
O	thoughts
O	of
O	again
O	attempting
O	to
O	make
O	good
O	his
O	right
O	to
O	the
O	Scottish
O	crown
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	dismissing
O	his
O	followers
O	,
O	transport
O	himself
O	and
O	his
O	brothers
O	to
O	the
O	Holy
O	Land
O	,
O	and
O	spend
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	his
O	life
O	in
O	fighting
O	against
O	the
O	Saracens
O	.
O	But
O	then
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	hand
O	,
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	both
O	criminal
O	and
O	cowardly
O	to
O	give
O	up
O	his
O	attempts
O	to
O	restore
O	freedom
O	to
O	Scotland
O	while
O	there
O	yet
O	remained
O	the
O	least
O	chance
O	of
O	his
O	being
O	successful
O	in
O	an
O	undertaking
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	rightly
O	considered
O	,
O	was
O	much
O	more
O	his
O	duty
O	than
O	to
O	drive
O	the
O	infidels
O	out
O	of
O	Palestine
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	was
O	divided
O	betwixt
O	these
O	reflections
O	,
O	and
O	doubtful
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	should
O	do
O	,
O	Bruce
O	was
O	looking
O	upward
O	to
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	the
O	cabin
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	lay;
O	and
O	his
O	eye
O	was
O	attracted
O	by
O	a
O	spider
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	hanging
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	a
O	long
O	thread
O	of
O	its
O	own
O	spinning
O	,
O	was
O	endeavouring
O	to
O	swing
O	itself
O	from
O	one
O	beam
O	in
O	the
O	roof
O	to
O	another
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	purpose
O	of

O	there
O	very
O	lately
O	a
O	body

O	an
O	English
O	governor
O	of
O	the

O	and
O	were

O	amusing

O	The

O	guided
O	to
O	the

O	most
O	frequented
O	,
O	there

O	the
O	chief
O	of
O	the
O	strangers
O	who
O	had
O	taken
O	the

O	was
O	James
O	Douglas

O	one
O	of
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	Bruce's
O	friends
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	accompanied
O	by
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	bravest
O	of
O	that
O	patriotic
O	band
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	heard
O	Robert
O	Bruce's
O	horn
O	,
O	he
O	knew
O	the
O	sound
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	cried
O	out
O	,
O	that
O	yonder
O	was
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	he
O	knew
O	by
O	his

O	So
O	he
O	and
O	his

O	to

O	.
O	They

O	men
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	looked
O	forward
O	to
O	freeing
O	their

O	.
O	The
O	Bruce
O	was
O	now
O	where
O	the
O	people
O	were
O	most
O	likely
O	to
O	be
O	attached
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	continued
O	to
O	keep
O	himself
O	concealed
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	earldom
O	of
O	Carrick
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	neighboring
O	country
O	of
O	Galloway
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	should
O	have
O	matters
O	ready
O	for
O	a
O	general
O	attack
O	upon
O	the
O	English
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	obliged
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	meantime
O	,
O	to
O	keep
O	very
O	few
O	men
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	both
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	secrecy
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	difficulty
O	of
O	finding
O	provisions
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	Galloway
O	were
O	unfriendly
O	to
O	Bruce
O	.
O	They
O	lived
O	under
O	the
O	government
O	of
O	one
O	MacDougal
O	,
O	related
O	to
O	the
O	Lord
O	of
O	Lorn
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	defeated
O	Bruce
O	.
O	These
O	Galloway
O	men
O	had
O	heard
O	that
O	Bruce
O	was
O	in
O	their
O	country
O	,
O	having
O	no
O	more
O	than
O	sixty
O	men
O	with
O	him;
O	so
O	they
O	resolved
O	to
O	attack
O	him
O	by
O	surprise
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	this
O	purpose
O	they
O	got
O	together
O	and
O	brought
O	with
O	them
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	bloodhounds
O	.
O	At
O	that
O	time
O	bloodhounds
O	,
O	or
O	sleuthhounds
O	,
O	were
O	used
O	for
O	the
O	purpose
O	of
O	pursuing
O	great
O	criminals
O	.
O	The
O	men
O	of
O	Galloway
O	thought
O	that
O	if
O	they
O	missed
O	taking
O	Bruce
O	,
O	or
O	killing
O	him
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	onset
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	he
O	should
O	escape
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	they
O	would
O	find
O	him
O	out
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	these
O	bloodhounds
O	.
O	The
O	good
O	King
O	Robert
O	Bruce
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	always
O	watchful
O	and
O	vigilant
O	,
O	received
O	some
O	information
O	of
O	the
O	intention
O	of
O	the
O	party
O	to
O	come
O	upon
O	him
O	suddenly
O	and
O	by
O	night
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	he
O	quartered
O	his
O	little
O	troop
O	of
O	sixty
O	men
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	a
O	deep
O	and
O	swift-running
O	river
O	,
O	that
O	had
O	very
O	steep
O	and
O	rocky
O	banks
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	but
O	one
O	ford
O	by
O	which
O	this
O	river
O	could
O	be
O	crossed
O	in
O	that
O	neighbourhood
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	ford
O	was
O	deep
O	and
O	narrow
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	two
O	men
O	could
O	scarcely
O	get
O	through
O	abreast;
O	the
O	ground
O	on
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	to
O	land
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	where
O	the
O	King
O	was
O	,
O	was
O	steep
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	path
O	which
O	led
O	upward
O	from
O	the
O	water's
O	edge
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	bank
O	,
O	extremely
O	narrow
O	and
O	difficult
O	.
O	Bruce
O	caused
O	his
O	men
O	to
O	lie
O	down
O	to
O	take
O	some
O	sleep
O	,
O	at
O	a
O	place
O	about
O	half
O	a
O	mile
O	distant
O	from
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	himself
O	,
O	with
O	two
O	attendants
O	,
O	went
O	down
O	to
O	watch
O	the
O	ford
O	.
O	He
O	stood
O	looking
O	at
O	the
O	ford
O	,
O	and
O	thinking
O	how
O	easily
O	the
O	enemy
O	might
O	be
O	kept
O	from
O	passing
O	there
O	,
O	provided
O	it
O	was
O	bravely
O	defended
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	,
O	always
O	coming
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	,
O	the
O	baying
O	of
O	a
O	hound
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	the
O	bloodhound
O	which
O	was
O	tracing
O	the
O	King's
O	steps
O	to
O	the
O	ford
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	crossed
O	,
O	and
O	two
O	hundred
O	Galloway
O	men
O	were
O	along
O	with
O	the
O	animal
O	,
O	and
O	guided
O	by
O	it
O	.
O	Bruce
O	at
O	first
O	thought
O	of
O	going
O	back
O	to
O	awaken
O	his
O	men;
O	but
O	then
O	he
O	reflected
O	that
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	only
O	some
O	shepherd's
O	dog
O	.
O	"""My"

O	So
O	he
O	stood
O	and

O	by
O	and
O	by
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	cry
O	of
O	the
O	hound
O	came
O	nearer
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	hear
O	a
O	trampling
O	of
O	horses
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	voices

O	sure

O	So

O	,
O	and

O	deep

O	therefore
O	sent

O	The

O	of
O	the
O	horses
O	increased
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	moon
O	being
O	bright
O	,
O	Bruce
O	beheld
O	the
O	glancing
O	arms

O	two
O	hundred

O	on

O	,
O	on

O	and
O	so
O	prevented
O	the
O	others
O	who
O	were
O	following
O	from
O	getting
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	.
O	Bruce
O	had
O	thus
O	an
O	opportunity
O	of
O	dealing
O	his
O	blows
O	among
O	them
O	,
O	while
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	strike
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	confusion
O	,
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	of
O	the
O	enemy
O	were
O	slain
O	,
O	or
O	,
O	having
O	been
O	borne
O	down
O	with
O	the
O	current
O	,
O	were
O	drowned
O	.
O	The
O	rest
O	were
O	terrified
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	back
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	Galloway
O	men
O	looked
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	they
O	were
O	opposed
O	by
O	only
O	one
O	man
O	,
O	they
O	themselves
O	being
O	so
O	many
O	,
O	they
O	cried
O	out
O	,
O	that
O	their
O	honour
O	would
O	be
O	lost
O	forever
O	if
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	force
O	their
O	way;
O	and
O	encouraged
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	with
O	loud
O	cries
O	,
O	to
O	plunge
O	through
O	and
O	assault
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	King's
O	soldiers
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	his
O	assistance
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Galloway
O	men
O	gave
O	up
O	their
O	enterprise
O	.
O	About
O	the
O	time
O	when
O	the
O	Bruce
O	was
O	yet
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	but
O	few
O	men
O	,
O	Sir
O	Aymer
O	de
O	Valence
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	Earl
O	of
O	Pembroke
O	,
O	together
O	with
O	Sir
O	John
O	of
O	Lorn
O	,
O	came
O	into
O	Galloway
O	,
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	being
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	a
O	large
O	body
O	of
O	men
O	.
O	John
O	of
O	Lorn
O	had
O	a
O	bloodhound
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	which
O	it
O	was
O	said
O	had
O	formerly
O	belonged
O	to
O	Robert
O	Bruce
O	himself;
O	and
O	having
O	been
O	fed
O	by
O	the
O	King
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	hands
O	,
O	it
O	became
O	attached
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	follow
O	his
O	footsteps
O	anywhere
O	,
O	as
O	dogs
O	are
O	well
O	known
O	to
O	trace
O	their
O	master's
O	steps
O	,
O	whether
O	they
O	be
O	bloodhounds
O	or
O	not
O	.
O	By
O	means
O	of
O	this
O	hound
O	,
O	John
O	of
O	Lorn
O	thought
O	he
O	should
O	certainly
O	find
O	out
O	Bruce
O	,
O	and
O	take
O	revenge
O	on
O	him
O	for
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	his
O	relation
O	Comyn
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	saw
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	followed
O	by
O	a
O	large
O	body
O	,
O	and
O	being
O	determined
O	to
O	escape
O	from
O	them
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	who
O	were
O	with
O	him
O	disperse
O	themselves
O	different
O	ways
O	,
O	thinking
O	thus
O	that
O	the
O	enemy
O	must
O	needs
O	lose
O	trace
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	kept
O	only
O	one
O	man
O	along
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	was
O	his
O	own
O	foster-brother
O	,
O	or
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	his
O	nurse
O	.
O	When
O	John
O	of
O	Lorn
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	Bruce's
O	companions
O	had
O	dispersed
O	themselves
O	,
O	the
O	bloodhound
O	,
O	after
O	it
O	had
O	sniffed
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	for
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	quitted
O	the
O	footsteps
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	other
O	fugitives
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	barking
O	upon
O	the
O	track
O	of
O	two
O	men
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	whole
O	number
O	.
O	Then
O	John
O	of
O	Lorn
O	knew
O	that
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	two
O	must
O	needs
O	be
O	King
O	Robert
O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	he
O	commanded
O	five
O	of
O	his
O	men
O	that
O	were
O	speedy
O	of
O	foot
O	to
O	chase
O	after
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	either
O	make
O	him
O	prisoner
O	or
O	slay
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	Highlanders
O	started
O	off
O	accordingly
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	so
O	fast
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	gained
O	sight
O	of
O	Robert
O	and
O	his
O	foster-brother
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	asked
O	his
O	companion
O	what
O	help
O	he
O	could
O	give
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	foster-brother
O	answered
O	he
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	do
O	his
O	best
O	.
O	So
O	these
O	two
O	turned
O	on
O	the
O	five
O	men
O	of
O	John
O	of
O	Lorn
O	,
O	and
O	killed
O	them
O	all
O	.
O	But
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	Bruce
O	very
O	much
O	fatigued
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	they
O	dared
O	not
O	sit
O	down
O	to
O	take
O	any
O	rest;
O	for
O	whenever
O	they
O	stopped
O	for
O	an
O	instant
O	,
O	they
O	heard
O	the
O	cry
O	of
O	the
O	bloodhound
O	behind
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	knew
O	by
O	that
O	,
O	that
O	their
O	enemies
O	were
O	coming
O	up
O	fast
O	after
O	them
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	,
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	wood
O	,
O	through
O	which
O	ran
O	a
O	small
O	river
O	.
O	Then
O	Bruce
O	said
O	to
O	his
O	foster-brother
O	,
O	"""Let"

O	.
O	""""
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	his
O	attendant
O	walked
O	a
O	great
O	way
O	down
O	the
O	stream
O	,
O	taking
O	care
O	to
O	keep
O	their
O	feet
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	which
O	could
O	not
O	retain
O	any
O	scent
O	where
O	they
O	had
O	stepped
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	came
O	ashore
O	on
O	the
O	further
O	side
O	from
O	the
O	enemy
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	deep
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	before
O	they
O	stopped
O	to
O	rest
O	themselves
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meanwhile
O	,
O	the
O	hound
O	led
O	John
O	of
O	Lorn
O	straight
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	King
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	the
O	dog
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	puzzled
O	,
O	not
O	knowing
O	where
O	to
O	go
O	next
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	John
O	of
O	Lorn
O	,
O	seeing
O	the

O	had
O	lost
O	track

O	,

O	returned
O	to

O	But
O	King

O	when
O	he
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	marching
O	into
O	Scotland
O	.
O	His
O	son
O	Edward
O	II
O	neglected
O	the
O	Scottish
O	war
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	lost
O	the
O	opportunity
O	of
O	defeating
O	Bruce
O	,
O	when
O	his
O	force
O	was
O	small
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	Sir
O	Philip
O	Mowbray
O	,
O	the
O	governor
O	of
O	Stirling
O	,
O	came
O	to
O	London
O	,
O	to
O	tell
O	the
O	King
O	,
O	that
O	Stirling
O	,
O	the
O	last
O	Scottish
O	town
O	of
O	importance
O	which
O	remained
O	in
O	possession
O	of
O	the
O	English
O	,
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	surrendered
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	not
O	relieved
O	by
O	force
O	of
O	arms
O	before
O	midsummer
O	,
O	then
O	all
O	the
O	English
O	nobles
O	called
O	out
O	,
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	sin
O	and
O	shame
O	to
O	permit
O	the
O	fair
O	conquest
O	which
O	Edward
O	I
O	had
O	made
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	forfeited
O	to
O	the
O	Scots
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	fighting
O	.
O	King
O	Edward
O	II
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	assembled
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	greatest
O	armies
O	which
O	a
O	King
O	of
O	England
O	ever
O	commanded
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	troops
O	brought
O	from
O	all
O	his
O	dominions
O	,
O	many
O	brave
O	soldiers
O	from
O	the
O	French
O	provinces
O	,
O	many
O	Irish
O	,
O	many
O	Welsh
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	great
O	English
O	nobles
O	and
O	barons
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	followers
O	.
O	The
O	number
O	was
O	not
O	less
O	than
O	one
O	hundred
O	thousand
O	men
O	.
O	King
O	Robert
O	the
O	Brace
O	summoned
O	all
O	his
O	nobles
O	and
O	barons
O	to
O	join
O	him
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	preparations
O	which
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	England
O	was
O	making
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	not
O	so
O	numerous
O	as
O	the
O	English
O	by
O	many
O	thousand
O	men
O	.
O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	his
O	whole
O	army
O	did
O	not
O	very
O	much
O	exceed
O	thirty
O	thousand
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	much
O	worse
O	armed
O	than
O	the
O	wealthy
O	Englishmen;
O	but
O	then
O	,
O	Robert
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	expert
O	generals
O	of
O	the
O	time;
O	and
O	the
O	officers
O	he
O	had
O	under
O	him
O	,
O	were
O	his
O	brother
O	Edward
O	,
O	his
O	faithful
O	follower
O	the
O	Douglas
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	brave
O	and
O	experienced
O	leaders
O	.
O	His
O	men
O	had
O	been
O	accustomed
O	to
O	fight
O	and
O	gain
O	victories
O	under
O	every
O	disadvantage
O	of
O	situation
O	and
O	numbers
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	,
O	on
O	his
O	part
O	,
O	studied
O	how
O	he
O	might
O	supply
O	,
O	by
O	address
O	and
O	stratagem
O	,
O	what
O	he
O	wanted
O	in
O	numbers
O	and
O	strength
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	the
O	superiority
O	of
O	the
O	English
O	in
O	their
O	heavy-armed
O	cavalry
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	their
O	archers
O	.
O	Both
O	these
O	advantages
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	provide
O	against
O	.
O	With
O	this
O	purpose
O	,
O	he
O	led
O	his
O	army
O	down
O	into
O	a
O	plain
O	near
O	Stirling
O	.
O	The
O	English
O	army
O	must
O	needs
O	pass
O	through
O	a
O	boggy
O	country
O	,
O	broken
O	with
O	water-courses
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	Scots
O	occupied
O	hard
O	dry
O	ground
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	caused
O	all
O	the
O	ground
O	upon
O	the
O	front
O	of
O	his
O	line
O	of
O	battle
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	dug
O	full
O	of
O	holes
O	,
O	about
O	as
O	deep
O	as
O	a
O	man's
O	knee
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	light
O	brushwood
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	turf
O	was
O	laid
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	appeared
O	a
O	plain
O	field
O	,
O	while
O	in
O	reality
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	full
O	of
O	these
O	pits
O	as
O	a
O	honeycomb
O	is
O	of
O	holes
O	.
O	He
O	also
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	said
O	,
O	caused
O	steel
O	spikes
O	,
O	called
O	calthrops
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	scattered
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	plain
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	English
O	cavalry
O	were
O	most
O	likely
O	to
O	advance
O	,
O	trusting
O	in
O	that
O	manner
O	to
O	lame
O	and
O	destroy
O	their
O	horses
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	Scottish
O	army
O	was
O	drawn
O	up
O	,
O	the
O	line
O	stretched
O	north
O	and
O	south
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	south
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	terminated
O	by
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	brook
O	called
O	Bannockburn
O	,
O	which
O	are
O	so
O	rocky
O	,
O	that
O	no
O	troops
O	could
O	attack
O	them
O	there
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	left
O	,
O	the
O	Scottish
O	line
O	extended
O	near
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	of
O	Stirling
O	.
O	Bruce
O	reviewed
O	his
O	troops
O	very
O	carefully
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	spoke
O	to
O	the
O	soldiers
O	,
O	and
O	expressed
O	his
O	determination
O	to
O	gain
O	the
O	victory
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	lose
O	his
O	life
O	on
O	the
O	field
O	of
O	battle
O	.
O	He
O	desired
O	that
O	all
O	those
O	who
O	did
O	not
O	propose
O	to
O	fight
O	to
O	the
O	last
O	,
O	should
O	leave
O	the
O	field
O	before
O	the
O	battle
O	began
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	none
O	should
O	remain
O	except
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	determined
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	issue
O	of
O	victory
O	or
O	death
O	,
O	as
O	God
O	should
O	send
O	it
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	main
O	body
O	of
O	his
O	army
O	was
O	thus
O	placed
O	in
O	order
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	dispatched
O	James
O	of
O	Douglas
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Robert
O	Keith
O	,
O	the
O	Mareschal
O	of
O	the
O	Scottish
O	army
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	survey
O	the
O	English
O	force
O	.
O	They
O	returned
O	with
O	information
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	approach
O	of
O	that
O	vast
O	host
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	and
O	terrible
O	sights
O	which
O	could
O	be
O	seen--that
O	the
O	whole
O	country
O	seemed
O	covered
O	with
O	men-at-arms
O	on
O	horse
O	and
O	foot
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	upon
O	the
O	twenty-third
O	of
O	June
O	,
O	1314
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Scotland
O	heard
O	the
O	news
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	English
O	army
O	was
O	approaching
O	Stirling
O	.
O	The
O	van
O	now
O	came
O	in
O	sight
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	their
O	bravest
O	knights
O	drew
O	near
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	the
O	Scots
O	were
O	doing
O	.
O	They
O	saw
O	King
O	Robert
O	dressed
O	in
O	his
O	armour
O	,
O	and
O	distinguished
O	by
O	a
O	gold
O	crown
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	wore
O	over
O	his
O	helmet
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	not
O	mounted
O	on
O	his
O	great
O	war-horse
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	expect
O	to
O	fight
O	that
O	evening
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	rode
O	on
O	a
O	little
O	pony
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	ranks
O	of
O	his
O	army
O	,
O	putting
O	his
O	men
O	in
O	order
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	battle-axe
O	made
O	of
O	steel
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	King
O	saw
O	the
O	English
O	horsemen
O	draw
O	near
O	,
O	he
O	advanced
O	a
O	little
O	before
O	his
O	own
O	men
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	look
O	at
O	them
O	more
O	nearly
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	knight
O	among
O	the
O	English
O	,
O	called
O	Sir
O	Henry
O	de
O	Bohun
O	,
O	who
O	thought
O	this
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	good
O	opportunity
O	to
O	gain
O	great
O	fame
O	to
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	an
O	end
O	to
O	the
O	war
O	,
O	by
O	killing
O	King
O	Robert
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	being
O	poorly
O	mounted
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	no
O	lance
O	,
O	Bohun
O	galloped
O	on
O	him
O	suddenly
O	and
O	furiously
O	,
O	thinking
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	long
O	spear
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	tall
O	,
O	powerful
O	horse
O	,
O	easily
O	to
O	bear
O	him
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	King
O	Robert
O	saw
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	permitted
O	him
O	to
O	come
O	very
O	near
O	,
O	then
O	suddenly
O	turned
O	his
O	pony
O	a
O	little
O	to
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	Sir
O	Henry
O	missed
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	lance-point
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	act
O	of
O	being
O	carried
O	past
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	career
O	of
O	his
O	horse
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	he
O	passed
O	,
O	King
O	Robert
O	rose
O	up
O	in
O	his
O	stirrups
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	Sir
O	Henry
O	on
O	the
O	head
O	with
O	his
O	battle-axe
O	so
O	terrible
O	a
O	blow
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	broke
O	to
O	pieces
O	his
O	iron
O	helmet
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	nut-shell
O	,
O	and
O	hurled
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	saddle
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	dead
O	before
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	ground
O	.
O	This
O	gallant
O	action
O	was
O	blamed
O	by
O	the
O	Scottish
O	leaders
O	,
O	who
O	thought
O	Bruce
O	ought
O	not
O	to
O	have
O	exposed
O	himself
O	to
O	so
O	much
O	danger
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	safety
O	of
O	the
O	whole
O	army
O	depended
O	on
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	only
O	kept
O	looking
O	at
O	his
O	weapon
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	injured
O	by
O	the
O	force
O	of
O	the
O	blow
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	"""I"
O	have
O	broken
O	my
O	good
O	battle-axe
O	.
O	""""
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	the
O	English
O	King
O	ordered
O	his
O	men
O	to
O	begin
O	the
O	battle
O	.
O	The
O	archers
O	then
O	bent
O	their
O	bows
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	shoot
O	so
O	closely
O	together
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	arrows
O	fell
O	like
O	flakes
O	of
O	snow
O	on
O	a
O	Christmas
O	day
O	.
O	They
O	killed
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	Scots
O	,
O	and
O	might
O	have
O	decided
O	the
O	victory;
O	but
O	Bruce
O	was
O	prepared
O	for
O	them
O	.
O	A
O	body
O	of
O	men-at-arms
O	,
O	well
O	mounted
O	,
O	rode
O	at
O	full
O	gallop
O	among
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	archers
O	had
O	no
O	weapons
O	save
O	their
O	bows
O	and
O	arrows
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	use
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	attacked
O	hand
O	to
O	hand
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	cut
O	down
O	in
O	great
O	numbers
O	by
O	the
O	Scottish
O	horsemen
O	,
O	and
O	thrown
O	into
O	total
O	confusion
O	.
O	The
O	fine
O	English
O	cavalry
O	then
O	advanced
O	to
O	support
O	their
O	archers
O	.
O	But
O	coming
O	over
O	the
O	ground
O	which
O	was
O	dug
O	full
O	of
O	pits
O	the
O	horses
O	fell
O	into
O	these
O	holes
O	and
O	the
O	riders
O	lay
O	tumbling
O	about
O	,
O	without
O	any
O	means
O	of
O	defence
O	,
O	and
O	unable
O	to
O	rise
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	weight
O	of
O	their
O	armour
O	.
O	While
O	the
O	battle
O	was
O	obstinately
O	maintained
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	,
O	an
O	event
O	happened
O	which
O	decided
O	the
O	victory
O	.
O	The
O	servants
O	and
O	attendants
O	on
O	the
O	Scottish
O	camp
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	behind
O	the
O	army
O	to
O	a
O	place
O	afterward
O	called
O	the
O	Gillies'
O	hill
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	that
O	their
O	masters
O	were
O	likely
O	to
O	gain
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	they
O	rushed
O	from
O	their
O	place
O	of
O	concealment
O	with
O	such
O	weapons
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	get
O	,
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	have
O	their
O	share
O	in
O	the
O	victory
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	spoil
O	.
O	The
O	English
O	,
O	seeing
O	them
O	come
O	suddenly
O	over
O	the
O	hill
O	,
O	mistook
O	this
O	disorderly
O	rabble
O	for
O	a
O	new
O	army
O	coming
O	up
O	to
O	sustain
O	the
O	Scots
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	losing
O	all
O	heart
O	,
O	began
O	to
O	shift
O	every
O	man
O	for
O	himself
O	.
O	Edward
O	himself
O	left
O	the
O	field
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	ride
O	.
O	The
O	English
O	,
O	after
O	this
O	great
O	defeat
O	,
O	were
O	no
O	longer
O	in
O	a
O	condition
O	to
O	support
O	their
O	pretensions
O	to
O	be
O	masters
O	of
O	Scotland
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	continue
O	to
O	send
O	armies
O	into
O	that
O	country
O	to
O	overcome
O	it
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	contrary
O	,
O	they
O	became
O	for
O	a
O	time
O	scarce
O	able
O	to
O	defend
O	their
O	own
O	frontiers
O	against
O	King
O	Robert
O	and
O	his
O	soldiers
O	.
O	Thus
O	did
O	Robert
O	Bruce
O	arise
O	from
O	the
O	condition
O	of
O	an
O	exile
O	,
O	hunted
O	with
O	bloodhounds
O	like
O	a
O	stag
O	or
O	beast
O	of
O	prey
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	rank
O	of
O	an
O	independent
O	sovereign
O	,
O	universally
O	acknowledged
O	to
O	be
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	wisest
O	and
O	bravest
O	Kings
O	who
O	then
O	lived
O	.
O	The
O	nation
O	of
O	Scotland
O	was
O	also
O	raised
O	once
O	more
O	from
O	the
O	situation
O	of
O	a
O	distressed
O	and
O	conquered
O	province
O	to
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	free
O	and
O	independent
O	state
O	,
O	governed
O	by
O	its
O	own
O	laws
O	.
O	Robert
O	Bruce
O	continued
O	to
O	reign
O	gloriously
O	for
O	several
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Scots
O	seemed
O	,
O	during
O	his
O	government
O	,
O	to
O	have
O	acquired
O	a
O	complete
O	superiority
O	over
O	their
O	neighbours
O	.
O	But
O	then
O	we
O	must
O	remember
O	,
O	that
O	Edward
O	II
O	who
O	then
O	reigned
O	in
O	England
O	,
O	was
O	a
O	foolish
O	prince
O	,
O	and
O	listened
O	to
O	bad
O	counsels;
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	is
O	no
O	wonder
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	beaten
O	by
O	so
O	wise
O	and
O	experienced
O	a
O	general
O	as
O	Robert
O	Bruce
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	fought
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	crown
O	through
O	so
O	many
O	disasters
O	,
O	and
O	acquired
O	in
O	consequence
O	so
O	much
O	renown
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	last
O	year
O	of
O	Robert
O	the
O	Bruce's
O	reign
O	,
O	he
O	became
O	extremely
O	sickly
O	and
O	infirm
O	,
O	chiefly
O	owing
O	to
O	a
O	disorder
O	called
O	the
O	leprosy
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	caught
O	during
O	the
O	hardships
O	and
O	misfortunes
O	of
O	his
O	youth
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	frequently
O	obliged
O	to
O	hide
O	himself
O	in
O	woods
O	and
O	morasses
O	,
O	without
O	a
O	roof
O	to
O	shelter
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	lived
O	at
O	a
O	castle
O	called
O	Cardross
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	beautiful
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	Clyde
O	,
O	near
O	to
O	where
O	it
O	joins
O	the
O	sea;
O	and
O	his
O	chief
O	amusement
O	was
O	to
O	go
O	upon
O	the
O	river
O	,
O	and
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	sea
O	in
O	a
O	ship
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	kept
O	for
O	his
O	pleasure
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	able
O	to
O	sit
O	upon
O	his
O	war-horse
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	lead
O	his
O	army
O	to
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	While
O	Bruce
O	was
O	in
O	this
O	feeble
O	state
O	,
O	Edward
O	II
O	,
O	King
O	of
O	England
O	,
O	died
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	succeeded
O	by
O	his
O	son
O	Edward
O	III
O	.
O	He
O	turned
O	out
O	afterward
O	to
O	be
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	wisest
O	and
O	bravest
O	Kings
O	whom
O	England
O	ever
O	had;
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	first
O	mounted
O	the
O	throne
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	young
O	.
O	The
O	war
O	between
O	the
O	English
O	and
O	the
O	Scots
O	still
O	lasted
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	.
O	But
O	finally
O	a
O	peace
O	was
O	concluded
O	with
O	Robert
O	Bruce
O	,
O	on
O	terms
O	highly
O	honourable
O	to
O	Scotland;
O	for
O	the
O	English
O	King
O	renounced
O	all
O	pretensions
O	to
O	the
O	sovereignty
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	Good
O	King
O	Robert
O	did
O	not
O	long
O	survive
O	this
O	joyful
O	event
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	not
O	aged
O	more
O	than
O	four-and-fifty
O	years
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	bad
O	health
O	was
O	caused
O	by
O	the
O	hardships
O	which
O	he
O	sustained
O	during
O	his
O	youth
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	became
O	very
O	ill
O	.
O	Finding
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	recover
O	,
O	he
O	assembled
O	around
O	his
O	bedside
O	the
O	nobles
O	and
O	counsellors
O	in
O	whom
O	he
O	most
O	trusted
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	them
O	,
O	that
O	now
O	,
O	being
O	on
O	his
O	death-bed
O	,
O	he
O	sorely
O	repented
O	all
O	his
O	misdeeds
O	,
O	and
O	particularly
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	passion
O	,
O	killed
O	Comyn
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	hand
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	church
O	and
O	before
O	the
O	altar
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	lived
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	intended
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	Jerusalem
O	to
O	make
O	war
O	upon
O	the
O	Saracens
O	who
O	held
O	the
O	Holy
O	Land
O	,
O	as
O	some
O	expiation
O	for
O	the
O	evil
O	deeds
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	.
O	But
O	since
O	he
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	die
O	,
O	he
O	requested
O	of
O	his
O	dearest
O	friend
O	and
O	bravest
O	warrior
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	was
O	the
O	good
O	Lord
O	James
O	Douglas
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	carry
O	his
O	heart
O	to
O	the
O	Holy
O	Land
O	.
O	Douglas
O	wept
O	bitterly
O	as
O	he
O	accepted
O	this
O	office--the
O	last
O	mark
O	of
O	the
O	Brace's
O	confidence
O	and
O	friendship
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	soon
O	afterward
O	expired;
O	and
O	his
O	heart
O	was
O	taken
O	out
O	from
O	his
O	body
O	and
O	embalmed
O	,
O	that
O	is
O	,
O	prepared
O	with
O	spices
O	and
O	perfumes
O	,
O	that
O	it
O	might
O	remain
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	fresh
O	and
O	uncorrupted
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Douglas
O	caused
O	a
O	case
O	of
O	silver
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	,
O	into
O	which
O	he
O	put
O	the
O	Bruce's
O	heart
O	,
O	and
O	wore
O	it
O	around
O	his
O	neck
O	,
O	by
O	a
O	string
O	of
O	silk
O	and
O	gold
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	set
O	forward
O	for
O	the
O	Holy
O	Land
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	gallant
O	train
O	of
O	the
O	bravest
O	men
O	in
O	Scotland
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	to
O	show
O	their
O	value
O	of
O	and
O	sorrow
O	for
O	their
O	brave
O	King
O	Robert
O	Bruce
O	,
O	resolved
O	to
O	attend
O	his
O	heart
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Jerusalem
O	.
O	In
O	going
O	to
O	Palestine
O	Douglas
O	landed
O	in
O	Spain
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	Saracen
O	King
O	,
O	or
O	Sultan
O	of
O	Granada
O	,
O	called
O	Osmyn
O	,
O	was
O	invading
O	the
O	realms
O	of
O	Alphonso
O	,
O	the
O	Spanish
O	King
O	of
O	Castile
O	.
O	King
O	Alphonso
O	received
O	Douglas
O	with
O	great
O	honour
O	and
O	distinction
O	,
O	and
O	easily
O	persuaded
O	the
O	Scottish
O	Earl
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	do
O	good
O	service
O	to
O	the
O	Christian
O	cause
O	,
O	by
O	assisting
O	him
O	to
O	drive
O	back
O	the
O	Saracens
O	of
O	Granada
O	before
O	proceeding
O	on
O	his
O	voyage
O	to
O	Jerusalem
O	.
O	Lord
O	Douglas
O	and
O	his
O	followers
O	went
O	accordingly
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	battle
O	against
O	Osmyn
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	little
O	difficulty
O	in
O	defeating
O	the
O	Saracens
O	.

O	were
O	repairing
O	the
O	church
O	at
O	Dunfermline
O	,
O	and
O	removing
O	the
O	rubbish
O	,
O	lo
O	!
O	they
O	found
O	fragments
O	of
O	the
O	marble
O	tomb
O	of
O	Robert
O	Bruce
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	dig
O	farther
O	,
O	thinking
O	to
O	discover
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	this
O	celebrated
O	monarch;
O	and
O	at
O	length
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	skeleton
O	of
O	a
O	tall
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	knew
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	that
O	of
O	King
O	Robert
O	,
O	both
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	known
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	buried
O	in
O	a
O	winding
O	sheet
O	of
O	cloth
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	many
O	fragments
O	were
O	found
O	about
O	this
O	skeleton
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	because
O	the
O	breastbone
O	appeared
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	sawed
O	through
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	heart
O	.
O	A
O	new
O	tomb
O	was
O	prepared
O	into
O	which
O	the
O	bones
O	were
O	laid
O	with
O	profound
O	respect
O	.
