O	It
O	was
O	after
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	had
O	made
O	all
O	the
O	beautiful
O	birds
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	Evil
O	Spirit
O	came
O	along
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	the
O	beautiful
O	birds
O	and
O	heard
O	their
O	beautiful
O	songs
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	earth
O	people
O	liked
O	the
O	birds
O	and
O	liked
O	to
O	hear
O	them
O	sing
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	Evil
O	Spirit
O	did
O	not
O	wish
O	people
O	to
O	be
O	happy
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	""""
O	I
O	will
O	make
O	a
O	bird
O	that
O	will
O	make
O	people

O	I
O	will

O	a
O	big
O	bird
O	that
O	will
O	not
O	sing
O	,
O	but
O	will
O	make
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	.
O	""""
O	So
O	the
O	Evil
O	Spirit
O	went
O	to
O	work
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	a
O	big
O	bird
O	,
O	that
O	could
O	not
O	sing
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	drum
O	.
O	The
O	big
O	bird
O	flew
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	That
O	night
O	a
O	drumming
O	noise
O	was
O	heard
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	The
O	people
O	were
O	afraid
O	.
O	They
O	could
O	not
O	sleep
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	noise
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	,
O	they
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	to
O	search
O	for
O	the
O	noise
O	.
O	Deep
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	could
O	still
O	be
O	heard
O	that
O	strange
O	drumming
O	.
O	They
O	followed
O	it
O	,
O	until
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	deep
O	,
O	dark
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	loud
O	fluttering
O	and
O	whirring
O	of
O	wings
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	bird
O	flew
O	out
O	from
O	among
O	them
O	,
O	along
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	over
O	the
O	trees
O	.
O	The
O	people
O	were
O	afraid
O	.
O	They
O	called
O	to
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	to
O	help
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	was
O	near
O	.
O	He
O	heard
O	their
O	cry
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	after
O	the
O	bird
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	angry
O	.
O	The
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	said
O	,
O	""""
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	have
O	my
O	people
O	frightened
O	by
O	this
O	great
O	bird;
O	it
O	shall
O	die
O	.
O	""""
O	The
O	big
O	bird
O	gave
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	a
O	long
O	chase
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	Great
O	Spirit
O	came
O	upon
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	seized
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	it
O	against
O	a
O	large
O	tree
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	big
O	bird
O	struck
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	drops
O	of
O	blood
O	flew
O	in
O	all
O	directions
O	.
O	They
O	changed
O	into
O	smaller
O	birds
O	that
O	went
O	whirring
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	big
O	bird
O	had
O	done
O	.
O	There
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	drum
O	.
O	Like
O	the
O	big
O	bird
O	,
O	these
O	smaller
O	birds
O	like
O	to
O	startle
O	people
O	.
O	They
O	flutter
O	out
O	from
O	under
O	the
O	leaves
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	whirring
O	noise
O	they
O	fly
O	far
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	.
O	There
O	they
O	perch
O	on
O	an
O	old
O	log
O	,
O	or
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	drum
O	with
O	their
O	wings
O	.
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	people
O	say
O	they
O	are
O	drumming
O	for
O	their
O	mates
O	.
O	But
O	others
O	still
O	think
O	that
O	the
O	birds
O	drum
O	to
O	make
O	people
O	afraid
O	.
O	So
O	this
O	is
O	how
O	the
O	Indians
O	say
O	the
O	partridges
O	came
O	to
O	be
O	.
O	This
O	is
O	why
O	they
O	drum
O	,
O	and
O	why
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	children
O	still
O	love
O	to
O	hunt
O	partridges
O	.
