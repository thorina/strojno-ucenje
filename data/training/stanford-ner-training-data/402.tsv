O	felt

O	upon

O	Without

O	,
O	and
O	unseen
O	of

O	,
O	somewhat
O	before

O	being
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	warmest
O	days
O	in
O	July--he
O	armed
O	himself
O	from
O	head
O	to

O	,
O	mounted
O	on
O	Rozinante
O	,
O	laced
O	on
O	his

O	,
O	gathered
O	up

O	,
O	and
O	through

O	yard
O	sallied

O	into

O	and

O	see
O	how

O	he
O	had
O	started
O	on
O	his

O	by
O	a

O	,
O	and
O	one
O	which
O	did
O	well-nigh
O	overthrow
O	all
O	his
O	plans
O	.
O	For
O	he
O	recollected
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	never

O	knighted
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	,

O	without

O	upon

O	until

O	should
O	win

O	by

O	to
O	which
O	he
O	might
O	retire
O	for
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	an
O	inn
O	near
O	the
O	highway
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	as
O	welcome
O	a

O	to
O	him
O	as
O	if

O	Spurring
O	his

O	he
O	rode
O	towards
O	it
O	and
O	arrived
O	there
O	about
O	nightfall
O	.
O	There
O	stood
O	by
O	chance
O	at
O	the

O	door
O	two
O	jolly
O	peasant
O	women

O	up
O	their

O	in
O	that
O	inn
O	the
O	same
O	evening
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	our
O	knight-errant
O	believed
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	saw
O	or
O	heard
O	to
O	take
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	read
O	in
O	his
O	books
O	,
O	he
O	no
O	sooner
O	saw
O	the
O	inn
O	than
O	he
O	fancied
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	castle
O	with
O	four
O	turrets
O	and
O	pinnacles

O	Drawing
O	slowly
O	towards
O	it
O	,
O	he
O	checked
O	Rozinante
O	with
O	the
O	bridle

O	was
O	close
O	to

O	to

O	would
O	mount
O	on
O	the

O	give
O	warning
O	with
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	a

O	some

O	did
O	approach
O	the

O	way
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	women
O	served
O	his
O	turn
O	at
O	that
O	,
O	and
O	helped
O	to
O	feed
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	give
O	him
O	drink
O	after
O	that
O	manner
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	remained
O	dry
O	for
O	ever
O	if
O	the
O	innkeeper
O	had
O	not
O	bored
O	a
O	cane
O	,
O	and
O	putting
O	one
O	end
O	in
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	poured
O	the
O	wine
O	down
O	the
O	other
O	.
O	And
O	all
O	this
O	he
O	suffered
O	rather
O	than
O	cut
O	the
O	ribands
O	of
O	his
O	helmet
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	he
O	sat
O	at
O	supper
O	the
O	swineherd
O	again
O	sounded
O	his
O	horn
O	,
O	and
O	Don
O	Quixote
O	was
O	still
O	firm
O	in
O	the
O	belief
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	some
O	famous
O	castle
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	served
O	with
O	music
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	stale
O	haddock
O	was
O	fresh
O	trout
O	,
O	the
O	bread
O	of
O	the
O	finest
O	flour
O	,
O	the
O	two
O	women
O	high-born
O	damsels
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	innkeeper
O	the
O	constable
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	.
O	Thus
O	he
O	thought
O	his
O	career
O	of
O	knight-errant
O	was
O	well
O	begun
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	still
O	greatly
O	troubled
O	by
O	the
O	thought
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	dubbed
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	therefore
O	rightly
O	follow
O	his
O	adventures
O	until
O	he
O	received
O	the
O	honour
O	of
O	knighthood
O	.
