O	Danaë

O	for

O	in
O	the

O	,

O	oracle
O	.
O	With

O	he

O	from

O	for

O	a

O	great
O	Zeus
O	himself
O	looked
O	down

O	,

O	Danaë
O	became

O	,
O	and
O	for
O	many
O	hundreds
O	of
O	years
O	it
O	stood
O	there
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Egyptians
O	said
O	that
O	ever
O	and
O	again
O	Perseus
O	returned
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	the
O	Nile
O	rose
O	high
O	and
O	the
O	season
O	was
O	fruitful
O	because
O	he
O	had
O	blessed
O	their
O	land
O	.
O	Far
O	down
O	below
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	flew
O	one
O	day
O	he
O	saw
O	something
O	white
O	on
O	a
O	purple
O	rock
O	in
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	too
O	large
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	snowy-plumaged
O	bird
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	darted
O	swiftly
O	downward
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	see
O	more
O	clearly
O	.
O	The
O	spray
O	lashed
O	against
O	the
O	steep
O	rocks
O	of
O	the
O	desolate
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	showered
O	itself
O	upon
O	a
O	figure
O	that
O	at
O	first
O	he
O	took
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	statue
O	of
O	white
O	marble
O	.
O	The
O	figure
O	was
O	but
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	girl
O	,
O	slight
O	and
O	very
O	youthful
O	,
O	yet
O	more
O	fair
O	even
O	than
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	nymphs
O	of
O	the
O	Hesperides
O	.
O	Invisible
O	in
O	his
O	Helmet
O	of
O	Darkness
O	,
O	Perseus
O	drew
O	near
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	fragile
O	white
O	figure
O	was
O	shaken
O	by
O	shivering
O	sobs
O	.
O	The
O	waves
O	,
O	every
O	few
O	moments
O	,
O	lapped
O	up
O	on
O	her
O	little
O	cold
O	white
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	heavy
O	chains
O	held
O	her
O	imprisoned
O	to
O	that
O	chilly
O	rock
O	in
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	anger
O	stirred
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	Perseus
O	,
O	and
O	swiftly
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	helmet
O	from
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	stood
O	beside
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	maid
O	gave
O	a
O	cry
O	of
O	terror
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	evil
O	thing
O	in
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	Perseus
O	.
O	Naught
O	but
O	strength
O	and
O	kindness
O	and
O	purity
O	shone
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	steady
O	eyes
O	.
O	Thus
O	when
O	,
O	very
O	gently
O	,
O	he
O	asked
O	her
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	meaning
O	of
O	her
O	cruel
O	imprisonment
O	,
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	the
O	piteous
O	story
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	little
O	child
O	tells
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	its
O	grief
O	to
O	the
O	mother
O	who
O	comforts
O	it
O	.
O	Her
O	mother
O	was
O	queen
O	of
O	Ethiopia
O	,
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	,
O	very
O	beautiful
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	queen
O	had
O	boasted
O	that
O	no
O	nymph
O	who
O	played
O	amongst
O	the
O	snow-crested
O	billows
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	was
O	as
O	fair
O	as
O	she
O	,
O	a
O	terrible
O	punishment
O	was
O	sent
O	to
O	her
O	.
O	All
O	along
O	the
O	coast
O	of
O	her
O	father's
O	kingdom
O	a
O	loathsome
O	sea-monster
O	came
O	to
O	hold
O	its
O	sway
O	,
O	and
O	hideous
O	were
O	its
O	ravages
O	.
O	Men
O	and
O	women
O	,
O	children
O	and
O	animals
O	,
O	all
O	were
O	equally
O	desirable
O	food
O	for
O	its
O	insatiate
O	maw
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	whole
O	land
O	of
O	Ethiopia
O	lay
O	in
O	mourning
O	because
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	her
O	father
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	had
O	consulted
O	an
O	oracle
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	find
O	help
O	to
O	rid
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	monster
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	oracle
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	only
O	when
O	his
O	fair
O	daughter
O	,
O	Andromeda
O	,
O	had
O	been
O	sacrificed
O	to
O	the
O	creature
O	that
O	scourged
O	the
O	sea-coast
O	would
O	the
O	country
O	go
O	free
O	.
O	Thus
O	had
O	she
O	been
O	brought
O	there
O	by
O	her
O	parents
O	that
O	one
O	life
O	might
O	be
O	given
O	for
O	many
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	her
O	mother's
O	broken
O	heart
O	might
O	expiate
O	her
O	sin
O	of
O	vanity
O	.
O	Even
O	as
O	Andromeda
O	spoke
O	,
O	the
O	sea
O	was
O	broken
O	by
O	the
O	track
O	of
O	a
O	creature
O	that
O	cleft
O	the
O	water
O	as
O	does
O	the
O	forerunning
O	gale
O	of
O	a
O	mighty

O	.
