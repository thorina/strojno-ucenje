O	The

O	The

O	A
O	few
O	feet
O	above
O	Siva
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	was
O	a
O	platform
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	lay
O	a
O	young
O	lady
O	of
O	exquisite
O	beauty
O	.
O	The
O	prince
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	platform
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	lady
O	was
O	separated
O	from
O	her
O	body
O	.
O	Horrified
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	what
O	to
O	make
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	a
O	stream
O	of
O	blood
O	trickling
O	from
O	the
O	severed
O	head
O	,
O	falling
O	upon
O	the
O	matted
O	head
O	of
O	Siva
O	,
O	and
O	running
O	into
O	the
O	ocean
O	in
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	rubies
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	little
O	two
O	small
O	rods
O	,
O	one
O	of
O	silver
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	lying
O	near
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	lady
O	,
O	attracted
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	took
O	up
O	the
O	rods
O	in
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	the
O	golden
O	rod
O	accidentally
O	fell
O	upon
O	the
O	head
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	head
O	immediately
O	joined
O	itself
O	to
O	the
O	body
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	lady
O	got
O	up
O	.
O	Astonished
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	a
O	human
O	being
O	,
O	the
O	lady
O	asked
O	the
O	prince
O	who
O	he
O	was
O	and
O	how
O	he
O	had
O	got
O	there
O	.
O	After
O	hearing
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	the
O	prince
O	'
O	s
O	adventures
O	,
O	the
O	lady
O	said
O	,
O	""""
O	Unhappy
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	depart
O	instantly
O	from
O	this
O	place;
O	for
O	when
O	Siva
O	finishes
O	his
O	meditations
O	he
O	will
O	turn
O	you
O	to
O	ashes
O	by
O	a
O	single
O	glance
O	of
O	his
O	eyes
O	.
O	""""
O	The
O	young
O	man
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	would
O	not
O	go
O	except
O	in
O	her
O	company
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	over
O	head
O	and
O	ears
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	the
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	they
O	both
O	contrived
O	to
O	run
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	coming
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	ocean
O	they
O	climbed
O	into
O	the
O	boat
O	near
O	the
O	centre
O	of
O	the
O	whirlpool
O	,
O	and
O	sailed
O	away
O	toward
O	land
O	,
O	having
O	previously
O	laden
O	the
O	vessel
O	with
O	a

O	Early

O	the

O	rubies
O	,
O	through
O	a
O	servant

O	.
O	His
O	daughter
