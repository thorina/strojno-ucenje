O	A
O	sorrowful
O	defeat
O	was
O	that
O	for
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	put
O	himself
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	his
O	army
O	and
O	hastened
O	through
O	Portugal
O	to
O	besiege
O	his
O	brother
O	in
O	Santarem
O	.
O	The
O	Portugueze
O	and
O	Galegos
O	took
O	counsel
O	together
O	what
O	they
O	should
O	do
O	.
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	Frojaz
O	said
O	unto
O	the
O	king
O	that
O	it
O	behoved
O	him
O	above
O	all
O	things
O	to
O	put
O	his
O	kingdom
O	upon
O	the
O	hazard
O	of
O	a
O	battle;
O	for
O	his
O	brother
O	being
O	a
O	greater
O	lord
O	of
O	lands
O	than
O	he
O	,
O	and
O	richer
O	in
O	money
O	and
O	more
O	powerful
O	in
O	vassals
O	,
O	could
O	maintain
O	the
O	war
O	longer
O	than
O	he
O	could
O	,
O	who
O	peradventure
O	would
O	find
O	it
O	difficult
O	another
O	year
O	to
O	gather
O	together
O	so
O	good
O	an
O	army
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	now
O	ready
O	.
O	For
O	this
O	cause
O	he
O	advised
O	him
O	to
O	put
O	his
O	trust
O	in
O	God
O	first
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	in
O	the
O	hidalgos
O	who
O	were
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	without
O	fear
O	give
O	battle
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	over
O	whom
O	God
O	and
O	his
O	good
O	cause
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	glorious
O	victory
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	the
O	two
O	hosts
O	were
O	ready
O	to
O	join
O	battle
O	,
O	Alvar
O	Fanez
O	came
O	to
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	Sir
O	,
O	I
O	have
O	played
O	away
O	my
O	horse
O	and
O	arms;
O	I
O	beseech
O	you
O	give
O	me
O	others
O	for
O	this
O	battle
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	be
O	a
O	right
O	good
O	one
O	for
O	you
O	this
O	day;
O	if
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	for
O	you
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	six
O	knights
O	,
O	hold
O	me
O	for
O	a
O	traitor
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	ordered
O	that
O	horse
O	and
O	arms
O	should
O	be
O	given
O	him
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	armies
O	joined
O	battle
O	bravely
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	sharp
O	onset;
O	many
O	were
O	the
O	heavy
O	blows
O	which
O	were
O	given
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	were
O	the
O	horses
O	that
O	were
O	slain
O	at
O	that
O	encounter
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	the
O	men
O	.
O	Now
O	my
O	Cid
O	had
O	not
O	yet
O	come
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	Now
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	Frojaz
O	and
O	his
O	brethren
O	and
O	the
O	knights
O	who
O	were
O	with
O	them
O	had
O	resolved
O	to
O	make
O	straight
O	for
O	the
O	banner
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Castille
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	broke
O	through
O	the
O	ranks
O	of
O	the
O	Castillians
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	their
O	way
O	into
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	enemy's
O	host
O	,
O	doing
O	marvellous
O	feats
O	of
O	arms
O	.
O	Then
O	was
O	the
O	fight
O	at
O	the
O	hottest
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	did
O	their
O	best
O	to
O	win
O	the
O	banner
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	others
O	to
O	defend
O	it;
O	the
O	remembrance
O	of
O	what
O	they
O	had
O	formerly
O	done
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	gaining
O	more
O	honours
O	,
O	heartened
O	them;
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	Castillians
O	there
O	was
O	their
O	king
O	,
O	giving
O	them
O	brave
O	example
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	brave
O	words
O	.
O	The
O	press
O	of
O	the
O	battle
O	was
O	here
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	banner
O	of
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	was
O	beaten
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	king
O	himself
O	also
O	,
O	and
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	made
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	press
O	and
O	laid
O	hands
O	on
O	him
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	in
O	the
O	struggle
O	he
O	lost
O	much
O	blood
O	,
O	and
O	perceiving
O	that
O	his
O	strength
O	was
O	failing
O	,
O	he
O	sent
O	to
O	call
O	the
O	King
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	with
O	all
O	speed
O	.
O	And
O	as
O	the
O	king
O	came
O	,
O	the
O	Count
O	Don
O	Pedro
O	Frojaz
O	met
O	him
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	An
O	honourable
O	gift
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	hath
O	my
O	brother
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	to
O	give
O	you
O	,
O	but
O	you
O	lose
O	him
O	in
O	gaining
O	it
O	.
O	And
O	tears
O	fell
O	from
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	made
O	answer
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	It
O	may
O	indeed
O	be
O	that
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	may
O	lose
O	his
O	life
O	in
O	serving
O	me
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	good
O	name
O	which
O	he
O	hath
O	gained
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	honour
O	which
O	he
O	leaveth
O	to
O	his
O	descendants
O	,
O	death
O	cannot
O	take
O	away
O	.
O	Saying
O	this
O	,
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	gave
O	into
O	his
O	hands
O	the
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	his
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	three
O	times
O	if
O	he
O	was
O	discharged
O	of
O	his
O	prisoner;
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	answered
O	Yes
O	,
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	said
O	,
O	For
O	me
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	the
O	joy
O	which
O	I
O	have
O	in
O	your
O	victory
O	is
O	enough;
O	give
O	the
O	rewards
O	to
O	these
O	good
O	Portugueze
O	,
O	who
O	with
O	so
O	good
O	a
O	will
O	have
O	put
O	their
O	lives
O	upon
O	the
O	hazard
O	to
O	serve
O	you
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	all
O	things
O	follow
O	their
O	counsel
O	,
O	and
O	you
O	will
O	not
O	err
O	therein
O	.
O	Having
O	said
O	this
O	he
O	kissed
O	the
O	king's
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	lying
O	upon
O	his
O	shield
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	felt
O	his
O	breath
O	fail
O	him
O	,
O	with
O	his
O	helmet
O	for
O	a
O	pillow
O	,
O	he
O	kissed
O	the
O	cross
O	of
O	his
O	sword
O	in
O	remembrance
O	of
O	that
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	Son
O	of
O	God
O	had
O	died
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	rendered
O	up
O	his
O	soul
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	his
O	Creator
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	worthy
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	Frojaz
O	.
O	In
O	all
O	the
O	conquests
O	which
O	King
O	Don
O	Ferrando
O	had
O	made
O	from
O	the
O	Moors
O	of
O	Portugal
O	,
O	great
O	part
O	had
O	he
O	borne
O	,
O	insomuch
O	that
O	that
O	king
O	was
O	wont
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	other
O	princes
O	might
O	have
O	more
O	dominions
O	than
O	he
O	,
O	but
O	two
O	such
O	knights
O	as
O	his
O	two
O	Rodrigos
O	,
O	meaning
O	my
O	Cid
O	and
O	this
O	good
O	knight
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	none
O	but
O	himself
O	who
O	had
O	for
O	vassals
O	.
O	King
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	being
O	desirous
O	to
O	be
O	in
O	the
O	pursuit
O	himself
O	,
O	delivered
O	his
O	brother
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	six
O	knights
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	guard
O	him
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	ought
O	not
O	to
O	have
O	done
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	gone
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	said
O	unto
O	the
O	knights
O	,
O	Let
O	me
O	go
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	depart
O	out
O	of
O	your
O	country
O	and
O	never
O	enter
O	it
O	again;
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	reward
O	ye
O	well
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	ye
O	live;
O	but
O	they
O	answered
O	him
O	,
O	that
O	for
O	no
O	reward
O	would
O	they
O	commit
O	such
O	disloyalty
O	,
O	but
O	would
O	guard
O	him
O	well
O	,
O	not
O	offering
O	him
O	any
O	injury
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	had
O	delivered
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	the
O	King
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	.
O	While
O	they
O	were
O	parleying
O	Alvar
O	Fanez
O	came
O	up
O	,
O	he
O	to
O	whom
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	given
O	horse
O	and
O	arms
O	before
O	the
O	battle;
O	and
O	he
O	seeing
O	the
O	king
O	held
O	prisoner
O	,
O	cried
O	out
O	with
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	,
O	Let
O	loose
O	my
O	lord
O	the
O	king:
O	and
O	he
O	spurred
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	made
O	at
O	them;
O	and
O	before
O	his
O	lance
O	was
O	broken
O	he
O	overthrew
O	two
O	of
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	bestirred
O	himself
O	that
O	he
O	put
O	the
O	others
O	to
O	flight;
O	and
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	horses
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	smote
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	one
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	mounted
O	upon
O	the
O	other
O	himself
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	was
O	hurt
O	in
O	the
O	rescue;
O	and
O	they
O	went
O	together
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	rising
O	ground
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	yet
O	a
O	small
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	of
O	their
O	party
O	,
O	and
O	Alvar
O	Fanez
O	cried
O	out
O	to
O	them
O	aloud
O	,
O	Ye
O	see
O	here
O	the
O	king
O	our
O	lord
O	,
O	who
O	is
O	free;
O	now
O	then
O	remember
O	the
O	good
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	Castillians
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	us
O	not
O	lose
O	it
O	this
O	day
O	.
O	And
O	about
O	four
O	hundred
O	knights
O	gathered
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	while
O	they
O	stood
O	there
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	Cid
O	Ruydiez
O	coming
O	up
O	with
O	three
O	hundred
O	knights
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	in
O	the
O	battle
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	knew
O	his
O	green
O	pennon
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	beheld
O	it
O	his
O	heart
O	rejoiced
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	Now
O	let
O	us
O	descend
O	into
O	the
O	plain
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	of
O	good
O	fortune
O	cometh:
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	Be
O	of
O	good
O	heart
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	is
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	God
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	recover
O	my
O	kingdom
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	have
O	escaped
O	from
O	captivity
O	,
O	and
O	seen
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	Don
O	Rodrigo
O	Frojaz
O	who
O	took
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	Ruydiez
O	the
O	fortunate
O	one
O	cometh
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	went
O	down
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	welcomed
O	him
O	right
O	joyfully
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	In
O	happy
O	time
O	are
O	you
O	come
O	,
O	my
O	fortunate
O	Cid;
O	never
O	vassal
O	succoured
O	his
O	lord
O	in
O	such
O	season
O	as
O	you
O	now
O	succour
O	me
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	king
O	my
O	brother
O	had
O	overcome
O	me
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Cid
O	answered
O	,
O	Sir
O	,
O	be
O	sure
O	that
O	you
O	shall
O	recover
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	or
O	I
O	will
O	die;
O	for
O	wheresoever
O	you
O	go
O	,
O	either
O	you
O	shall
O	be
O	victorious
O	or
O	I
O	will
O	meet
O	my
O	death
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	King
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	returned
O	from
O	the
O	pursuit
O	,
O	singing
O	as
O	he
O	came
O	full
O	joyfully
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	his
O	brother
O	was
O	a
O	prisoner
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	great
O	power
O	overthrown
O	.
O	But
O	there
O	came
O	one
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	was
O	rescued
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	field
O	again
O	,
O	ready
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	battle
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	.
O	Bravely
O	was
O	that
O	second
O	battle
O	fought
O	on
O	both
O	sides;
O	and
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	for
O	the
O	great
O	prowess
O	of
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	the
O	end
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	been
O	as
O	it
O	was:
O	in
O	the
O	end
O	the
O	Galegos
O	and
O	Portugueze
O	were
O	discomfited
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	taken
O	in
O	his
O	turn
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	put
O	his
O	brother
O	in
O	better
O	ward
O	than
O	his
O	brother
O	three
O	hours
O	before
O	had
O	put
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	put
O	him
O	in
O	chains
O	and
O	sent
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	strong
O	castle
O	of
O	Luna
O	.
O	When
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	had
O	done
O	this
O	he
O	took
O	unto
O	himself
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Galicia
O	and
O	of
O	Portugal
O	,
O	and
O	without
O	delay
O	sent
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	,
O	commanding
O	him
O	to
O	yield
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Leon
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	his
O	by
O	right
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Leon
O	troubled
O	at
O	heart;
O	howbeit
O	he
O	answered
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	yield
O	up
O	his
O	kingdom
O	,
O	but
O	do
O	his
O	utmost
O	to
O	defend
O	it
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	entered
O	Leon
O	,
O	slaying
O	and
O	laying
O	waste
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	as
O	an
O	army
O	of
O	infidels
O	would
O	have
O	done;
O	and
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	sent
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	bid
O	him
O	cease
O	from
O	this
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	inhuman
O	work
O	to
O	kill
O	and
O	plunder
O	the
O	innocent:
O	and
O	he
O	defied
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	pitched
O	battle
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	to
O	whichsoever
O	God
O	should
O	give
O	the
O	victory
O	,
O	to
O	him
O	also
O	would
O	he
O	give
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Leon:
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Castille
O	accepted
O	the
O	defiance
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	was
O	fixed
O	for
O	the
O	battle
O	.
O	Both
O	kings
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	field
O	that
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	full
O	hardily
O	was
O	the
O	battle
O	contested
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	was
O	the
O	mortality
O	on
O	either
O	side
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	hatred
O	which
O	used
O	to
O	be
O	between
O	Moors
O	and
O	Christians
O	was
O	then
O	between
O	brethren
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	destroyed
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	yield
O	up
O	his
O	kingdom:
O	and
O	he
O	sent
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	to
O	bid
O	him
O	battle
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	whosoever
O	conquered
O	should
O	then
O	certainly
O	remain
O	King
O	of
O	Leon
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	armies
O	met
O	and
O	joined
O	battle
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	of
O	Leon
O	had
O	the
O	victory
O	,
O	for
O	my
O	Cid
O	was
O	not
O	in
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	And
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	had
O	pity
O	upon
O	the
O	Castillians
O	because
O	they
O	were
O	Christians
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	orders
O	not
O	to
O	slay
O	them;
O	and
O	his
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	fled
O	.
O	Now
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	flying
O	,
O	my
O	Cid
O	came
O	up
O	with
O	his
O	green
O	pennon;
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	his
O	lord
O	had
O	been
O	conquered
O	it
O	grieved
O	him
O	sorely:
O	howbeit
O	he
O	encouraged
O	him
O	saying
O	,
O	This
O	is
O	nothing
O	,
O	sir
O	!
O	to
O	fail
O	or
O	to
O	prosper
O	is
O	as
O	God
O	pleases
O	.
O	But
O	do
O	you
O	gather
O	together
O	your
O	people
O	who
O	are
O	discomfited
O	,
O	and
O	bid
O	them
O	take
O	heart
O	.
O	The
O	Leonese
O	and
O	Galegos
O	are
O	with
O	the
O	king
O	your
O	brother
O	,
O	secure
O	as
O	they
O	think
O	themselves
O	in
O	their
O	lodging
O	,
O	and
O	taking
O	no
O	thought
O	of
O	you;
O	for
O	it
O	is
O	their
O	custom
O	to
O	extol
O	themselves
O	when
O	their
O	fortune
O	is
O	fair
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	mock
O	at
O	others
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	this
O	boastfulness
O	will
O	they
O	spend
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	we
O	shall
O	find
O	them
O	sleeping
O	at
O	break
O	of
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	will
O	fall
O	upon
O	them
O	.
O	And
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	said
O	.
O	The
O	Leonese
O	lodged
O	themselves
O	in
O	Vulpegera
O	,
O	taking
O	no
O	thought
O	of
O	their
O	enemies
O	,
O	and
O	setting
O	no
O	watch;
O	and
O	Ruydiez
O	arose
O	betimes
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	and
O	fell
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	subdued
O	them
O	before
O	they
O	could
O	take
O	their
O	arms
O	.
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	fled
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	of
O	Carrion
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	three
O	leagues
O	distant
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	fortified
O	himself
O	there
O	in
O	the
O	Church
O	of
O	St
O	.
O	Mary
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	surrounded
O	and
O	constrained
O	to
O	yield
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	knights
O	of
O	Leon
O	gathered
O	together
O	in
O	their
O	flight
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	their
O	king
O	they
O	were
O	greatly
O	ashamed
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	turned
O	back
O	and
O	smote
O	the
O	Castillians;
O	and
O	as
O	it
O	befell
O	,
O	they
O	encountered
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	alone
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	prisoner
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	people
O	considered
O	the
O	victory
O	as
O	their
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	was
O	in
O	confusion
O	.
O	And
O	thirteen
O	knights
O	took
O	him
O	in
O	their
O	ward
O	and
O	were
O	leading
O	him
O	away
O	,
O	--but
O	my
O	Cid
O	beheld
O	them
O	and
O	galloped
O	after
O	them:
O	he
O	was
O	alone
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	no
O	lance
O	,
O	having
O	broken
O	his
O	in
O	the
O	battle
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	them
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Knights
O	,
O	give
O	me
O	my
O	lord
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	unto
O	you
O	yours
O	.
O	They
O	knew
O	him
O	by
O	his
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	made
O	answer
O	,
O	Ruydiez
O	,
O	return
O	in
O	peace
O	and
O	seek
O	not
O	to
O	contend
O	with
O	us
O	,
O	otherwise
O	we
O	will
O	carry
O	you
O	away
O	prisoner
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	waxed
O	wroth
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Give
O	me
O	but
O	a
O	lance
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	,
O	single
O	as
O	I
O	am
O	,
O	rescue
O	my
O	lord
O	from
O	all
O	of
O	ye:
O	by
O	God's
O	help
O	I
O	will
O	do
O	it
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	held
O	him
O	as
O	nothing
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	but
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	lance
O	.
O	But
O	he
O	attacked
O	them
O	therewith
O	so
O	bravely
O	that
O	he
O	slew
O	eleven
O	of
O	the
O	thirteen
O	,
O	leaving
O	two
O	only
O	alive
O	,
O	on
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	mercy;
O	and
O	thus
O	did
O	he
O	rescue
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Castillians
O	rejoiced
O	greatly
O	at
O	the
O	king's
O	deliverance:
O	and
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	went
O	to
O	Burgos
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	with
O	him
O	his
O	brother
O	prisoner
O	.
O	Great
O	was
O	the
O	love
O	which
O	the
O	Infanta
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	bore
O	to
O	her
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	heard
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	made
O	prisoner
O	,
O	she
O	feared
O	lest
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	put
O	to
O	death:
O	and
O	she
O	took
O	with
O	her
O	the
O	Count
O	Don
O	Peransures
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	Burgos
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	spake
O	with
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	and
O	besought
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	join
O	with
O	them
O	and
O	intercede
O	with
O	the
O	king
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	release
O	his
O	brother
O	from
O	prison
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	him
O	become
O	a
O	monk
O	.
O	Full
O	willing
O	was
O	the
O	Cid
O	to
O	serve
O	in
O	any
O	thing
O	the
O	Infanta
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	went
O	with
O	her
O	before
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	knelt
O	down
O	before
O	the
O	king
O	her
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	besought
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	let
O	their
O	brother
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	take
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	St
O	.
O	Benedict
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	royal
O	Monastery
O	of
O	Sahagun
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	took
O	my
O	Cid
O	aside
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	counsel
O	of
O	him
O	what
O	he
O	should
O	do;
O	and
O	the
O	Cid
O	said
O	,
O	that
O	if
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	were
O	willing
O	to
O	become
O	a
O	monk
O	,
O	he
O	would
O	do
O	well
O	to
O	set
O	him
O	free
O	upon
O	that
O	condition
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	besought
O	him
O	so
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	,
O	at
O	my
O	Cid's
O	request
O	,
O	granted
O	to
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	what
O	she
O	had
O	asked
O	.
O	And
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	became
O	a
O	monk
O	in
O	the
O	Monastery
O	at
O	Sahagun
O	,
O	more
O	by
O	force
O	than
O	of
O	free
O	will
O	.
O	And
O	being
O	in
O	the
O	monastery
O	he
O	spake
O	with
O	Don
O	Peransures
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	counsel
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	fled
O	away
O	by
O	night
O	from
O	the
O	monks
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	among
O	the
O	Moors
O	to
O	King
O	Alimaymon
O	of
O	Toledo
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	Moorish
O	king
O	welcomed
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	good
O	will
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	great
O	honour
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	great
O	possessions
O	and
O	many
O	gifts
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	heard
O	how
O	his
O	brother
O	had
O	fled
O	from
O	the
O	monastery
O	,
O	he
O	drew
O	out
O	his
O	host
O	and
O	went
O	against
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Leon
O	.
O	The
O	Leonese
O	would
O	fain
O	have
O	maintained
O	the
O	city
O	against
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Leon
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	towns
O	and
O	castles
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	under
O	the
O	dominion
O	of
O	his
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	he
O	put
O	the
O	crown
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	himself
O	king
O	of
O	the
O	three
O	kingdoms
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	fair
O	knight
O	and
O	of
O	marvellous
O	courage
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	both
O	Moors
O	and
O	Christians
O	were
O	dismayed
O	at
O	what
O	they
O	saw
O	him
O	do
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	saw
O	that
O	nothing
O	which
O	he
O	willed
O	to
O	take
O	by
O	force
O	could
O	stand
O	against
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	went
O	forth
O	with
O	his
O	army
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	from
O	the
O	Infanta
O	Donya
O	Elvira
O	the
O	half
O	of
O	the
O	Infantazgo
O	[:
O	Inherited
O	land]
O	which
O	she
O	possessed
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	from
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	the
O	other
O	half
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	went
O	against
O	Toro
O	,
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Donya
O	Elvira
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	Zamora
O	to
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	,
O	bidding
O	her
O	yield
O	him
O	up
O	the
O	city
O	,
O	and
O	saying
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	give
O	her
O	lands
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	she
O	required
O	in
O	the
O	plain
O	country
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	returned
O	for
O	answer
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	in
O	no
O	manner
O	yield
O	unto
O	him
O	that
O	which
O	the
O	king
O	her
O	father
O	had
O	given
O	her;
O	and
O	she
O	besought
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	suffer
O	her
O	to
O	continue
O	to
O	dwell
O	peaceably
O	therein
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	no
O	disservice
O	should
O	ever
O	be
O	done
O	against
O	him
O	on
O	her
O	part
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	went
O	to
O	Burgos
O	,
O	because
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	season
O	for
O	besieging
O	a
O	town
O	,
O	being
O	winter
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	sent
O	his
O	letters
O	through
O	all
O	the
O	land
O	,
O	calling
O	upon
O	his
O	vassals
O	to
O	assemble
O	together
O	upon
O	the
O	first
O	day
O	of
O	March
O	in
O	Sahagun
O	,
O	upon
O	pain
O	of
O	forfeiting
O	his
O	favour
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	assembled
O	together
O	in
O	Sahagun
O	on
O	the
O	day
O	appointed;
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	king
O	heard
O	in
O	what
O	readiness
O	they
O	were
O	,
O	it
O	gladdened
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	hands
O	to
O	God
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Blessed
O	be
O	thy
O	name
O	,
O	O
O	Lord
O	,
O	because
O	thou
O	hast
O	given
O	me
O	all
O	the
O	kingdoms
O	of
O	my
O	father
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	said
O	this
O	he
O	ordered
O	proclamation
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	through
O	the
O	streets
O	of
O	Burgos
O	,
O	that
O	all
O	should
O	go
O	forth
O	to
O	protect
O	the
O	host
O	and
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	their
O	lord
O	.
O	They
O	made
O	such
O	speed
O	that
O	in
O	five
O	days
O	they
O	arrived
O	before
O	Zamora
O	,
O	and
O	pitched
O	their
O	tents
O	upon
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	Douro
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	mounted
O	on
O	horseback
O	with
O	his
O	bidalgos
O	and
O	rode
O	round
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	and
O	beheld
O	how
O	strongly
O	it
O	was
O	situated
O	upon
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	with
O	strong
O	walls
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	and
O	strong
O	towers
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	river
O	Douro
O	running
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	thereof;
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	unto
O	his
O	knights
O	,
O	Ye
O	see
O	how
O	strong
O	it
O	is
O	,
O	neither
O	Moor
O	nor
O	Christian
O	can
O	prevail
O	against
O	it;
O	if
O	I
O	could
O	have
O	it
O	from
O	my
O	sister
O	either
O	for
O	money
O	or
O	exchange
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	Lord
O	of
O	Spain
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	king
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	tents
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	for
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	Cid
O	,
O	you
O	well
O	know
O	how
O	manifoldly
O	you
O	are
O	bound
O	unto
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	have
O	ever
O	shown
O	favour
O	unto
O	you
O	,
O	and
O	you
O	have
O	ever
O	served
O	me
O	as
O	the
O	loyalest
O	vassal
O	that
O	ever
O	did
O	service
O	to
O	his
O	lord
O	.
O	Now
O	therefore
O	I
O	beseech
O	you
O	as
O	my
O	friend
O	and
O	true
O	vassal
O	,
O	that
O	you
O	go
O	to
O	Zamora
O	to
O	my
O	sister
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	,
O	and
O	say
O	unto
O	her
O	again
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	beseech
O	her
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	the
O	town
O	either
O	for
O	a
O	price
O	,
O	or
O	in
O	exchange
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	to
O	her
O	Medina
O	de
O	Rioseco
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	whole
O	Infantazgo
O	,
O	from
O	Villalpando
O	to
O	Valladolid
O	,
O	and
O	Tiedra
O	also
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	a
O	good
O	Castle;
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	swear
O	unto
O	her
O	,
O	with
O	twelve
O	knights
O	of
O	my
O	vassals
O	,
O	never
O	to
O	break
O	this
O	covenant
O	between
O	us;
O	but
O	if
O	she
O	refuseth
O	to
O	do
O	this
O	I
O	will
O	take
O	away
O	the
O	town
O	from
O	her
O	by
O	force
O	.
O	And
O	my
O	Cid
O	kissed
O	the
O	hand
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	said
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	This
O	bidding
O	,
O	sir
O	,
O	should
O	be
O	for
O	other
O	messenger
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	is
O	a
O	heavy
O	thing
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	deliver
O	it;
O	for
O	I
O	was
O	brought
O	up
O	in
O	Zamora
O	by
O	your
O	father's
O	command
O	,
O	with
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	and
O	with
O	his
O	sons
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	fitting
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	the
O	bearer
O	of
O	such
O	bidding
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	king
O	persisted
O	in
O	requiring
O	of
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	go
O	,
O	insomuch
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	constrained
O	to
O	obey
O	his
O	will
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	took
O	with
O	him
O	fifteen
O	of
O	his
O	knights
O	and
O	rode
O	towards
O	Zamora
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	drew
O	nigh
O	he
O	called
O	unto
O	those
O	who
O	kept
O	guard
O	in
O	the
O	towers
O	not
O	to
O	shoot
O	their
O	arrows
O	at
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	Ruydiez
O	of
O	Bivar
O	,
O	who
O	came
O	to
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	with
O	the
O	bidding
O	of
O	her
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	.
O	With
O	that
O	there
O	came
O	down
O	a
O	knight
O	who
O	had
O	the
O	keeping
O	of
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	bade
O	the
O	Cid
O	enter
O	.
O	It
O	pleased
O	the
O	Infanta
O	well
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	the
O	messenger
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	bade
O	him
O	come
O	before
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	know
O	what
O	was
O	his
O	bidding
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	Cid
O	entered
O	the
O	palace
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	advanced
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	greeted
O	him
O	full
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	seated
O	themselves
O	both
O	upon
O	the
O	Estrado
O	.
O	And
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	said
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	Cid
O	,
O	you
O	well
O	know
O	that
O	you
O	were
O	brought
O	up
O	with
O	me
O	here
O	in
O	Zamora
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	my
O	father
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	death
O	he
O	charged
O	you
O	that
O	you
O	should
O	always
O	counsel
O	his
O	sons
O	the
O	best
O	you
O	could
O	.
O	Now
O	tell
O	me
O	I
O	beseech
O	you
O	what
O	is
O	it
O	which
O	my
O	brother
O	goes
O	about
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	now
O	that
O	he
O	has
O	called
O	up
O	all
O	Spain
O	in
O	arms
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	what
O	lands
O	he
O	thinks
O	to
O	go
O	,
O	whether
O	against
O	Moors
O	or
O	Christians
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	Cid
O	answered
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Lady
O	,
O	give
O	me
O	safe
O	assurance
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	tell
O	unto
O	you
O	that
O	which
O	the
O	king
O	your
O	brother
O	hath
O	sent
O	me
O	to
O	say
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	said
O	she
O	would
O	do
O	as
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	should
O	advise
O	her
O	.
O	And
O	Don
O	Arias
O	answered
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	well
O	to
O	hear
O	what
O	the
O	king
O	her
O	brother
O	had
O	sent
O	to
O	say
O	.
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	then
O	said
O	to
O	the
O	Cid
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	speak
O	his
O	bidding
O	safely
O	.
O	Then
O	said
O	my
O	Cid
O	,
O	The
O	king
O	your
O	brother
O	sends
O	to
O	greet
O	you
O	,
O	and
O	beseeches
O	you
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	this
O	town
O	of
O	Zamora
O	,
O	either
O	for
O	a
O	price
O	or
O	in
O	exchange;
O	and
O	he
O	will
O	give
O	to
O	you
O	Medina
O	de
O	Rio-seco
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	whole
O	Infantazgo
O	,
O	from
O	Villalpando
O	to
O	Valladolid
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	good
O	castle
O	of
O	Tiedra
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	will
O	swear
O	unto
O	you
O	,
O	with
O	twelve
O	knights
O	his
O	vassals
O	,
O	never
O	to
O	do
O	you
O	hurt
O	or
O	harm;
O	but
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	not
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	he
O	will
O	take
O	it
O	against
O	your
O	will
O	.
O	When
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	heard
O	this
O	she
O	lamented
O	aloud
O	,
O	saying
O	,
O	Wretch
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	,
O	many
O	are
O	the
O	evil
O	messages
O	which
O	I
O	have
O	heard
O	since
O	my
O	father's
O	death
O	!
O	He
O	hath
O	disherited
O	my
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Garcia
O	of
O	his
O	kingdom
O	,
O	and
O	taken
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	holds
O	him
O	in
O	irons
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	a
O	thief
O	or
O	a
O	Moor:
O	and
O	he
O	hath
O	taken
O	his
O	lands
O	from
O	my
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	,
O	and
O	forced
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	among
O	the
O	Moors
O	,
O	and
O	live
O	there
O	exiled
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	traitor;
O	and
O	he
O	hath
O	taken
O	her
O	lands
O	from
O	my
O	sister
O	Donya
O	Elvira
O	against
O	her
O	will
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	would
O	he
O	take
O	Zamora
O	from
O	me
O	also
O	!
O	Now
O	then
O	let
O	the
O	earth
O	open
O	and
O	swallow
O	me
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	may
O	not
O	see
O	so
O	many
O	troubles
O	!
O	I
O	am
O	a
O	woman
O	,
O	and
O	well
O	know
O	that
O	I
O	cannot
O	strive
O	with
O	him
O	in
O	battle;
O	but
O	I
O	will
O	have
O	him
O	slain
O	either
O	secretly
O	or
O	openly
O	.
O	Then
O	Don
O	Arias
O	Gonzalo
O	stood
O	up
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Lady
O	,
O	give
O	order
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Zamora
O	assemble
O	in
O	St
O	.
O	Salvador's
O	and
O	know
O	of
O	them
O	whether
O	they
O	will
O	hold
O	with
O	you
O	,
O	seeing
O	that
O	your
O	father
O	gave
O	them
O	to
O	you
O	to
O	be
O	your
O	vassals
O	.
O	If
O	they
O	will
O	hold
O	with
O	you
O	,
O	then
O	give
O	not
O	up
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	neither
O	for
O	a
O	price
O	,
O	nor
O	in
O	exchange;
O	but
O	if
O	they
O	will
O	not
O	,
O	let
O	us
O	then
O	go
O	to
O	Toledo
O	among
O	the
O	Moors
O	,
O	where
O	your
O	brother
O	King
O	Don
O	Alfonso
O	abideth
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	did
O	as
O	her
O	foster-father
O	had
O	advised
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	proclaimed
O	through
O	the
O	streets
O	that
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Zamora
O	should
O	meet
O	in
O	council
O	at
O	St
O	.
O	Salvador's
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	assembled
O	,
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	arose
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	Don
O	Sancho
O	bids
O	me
O	give
O	him
O	Zamora
O	,
O	either
O	for
O	a
O	price
O	or
O	in
O	exchange
O	.
O	Now
O	concerning
O	this
O	I
O	would
O	know
O	whereunto
O	ye
O	advise
O	me
O	.
O	Then
O	by
O	command
O	of
O	the
O	Council
O	there
O	rose
O	up
O	a
O	knight
O	who
O	was
O	called
O	Don
O	Nuno
O	,
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	worth
O	,
O	aged
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	fair
O	speech;
O	and
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	We
O	beseech
O	you
O	give
O	not
O	up
O	Zamora
O	,
O	neither
O	for
O	price
O	nor
O	for
O	exchange
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	who
O	besieges
O	you
O	upon
O	the
O	rock
O	would
O	soon
O	drive
O	you
O	from
O	the
O	plain
O	.
O	The
O	Council
O	of
O	Zamora
O	will
O	do
O	your
O	bidding
O	,
O	and
O	will
O	not
O	desert
O	you
O	.
O	Sooner
O	,
O	lady
O	,
O	will
O	we
O	expend
O	all
O	our
O	possessions
O	,
O	and
O	eat
O	our
O	mules
O	and
O	horses
O	,
O	than
O	give
O	up
O	Zamora
O	,
O	unless
O	by
O	your
O	command
O	.
O	And
O	they
O	all
O	with
O	one
O	accord
O	confirmed
O	what
O	Don
O	Nuno
O	had
O	said
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	Infanta
O	Donya
O	Urraca
O	heard
O	this
O	she
O	was
O	well
O	pleased
O	,
O	and
O	praised
O	them
O	greatly;
O	and
O	she
O	turned
O	to
O	the
O	Cid
O	and
O	said
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	I
O	beseech
O	you
O	help
O	me
O	now
O	against
O	my
O	brother
O	,
O	and
O	intreat
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	will
O	not
O	seek
O	to
O	disherit
O	me;
O	but
O	if
O	he
O	will
O	go
O	on
O	with
O	what
O	he
O	hath
O	begun
O	,
O	say
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	I
O	will
O	rather
O	die
O	with
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Zamora
O	and
O	they
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	than
O	give
O	him
O	up
O	the
O	town
O	,
O	either
O	for
O	price
O	or
O	exchange
O	.
O	And
O	with
O	this
O	answer
O	did
O	the
O	Cid
O	return
O	unto
O	the
O	king
O	.
