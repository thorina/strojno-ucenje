O	North

O	There

O	,
O	and
O	lay

O	When

O	over

O	The

O	The

O	A

O	No

O	.
O	Old

O	Winter
O	carries
O	a

O	and

O	and
O	the

O	One

O	Winter
O	was
O	stalking
O	through
O	a

O	,
O	he
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	hunter
O	'
O	s
O	lodge
O	.
O	For
O	days

O	had
O	been
O	falling
O	.
O	No
O	track
O	of
O	deer
O	or
O	rabbit
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hunter
O	and
O	his
O	little
O	boy
O	sat
O	within
O	,
O	weak
O	from
O	hunger
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	also
O	very
O	cold
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	fire
O	in
O	the
O	lodge
O	burned
O	low
O	.
O	Old
O	Man
O	Winter
O	laughed
O	and
O	shook
O	his
O	hammer
O	in
O	glee
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	drew
O	near
O	.
O	Once
O	,
O	twice
O	,
O	three
O	times
O	,
O	he
O	rapped
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	boy
O	within
O	heard
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	rapped
O	three
O	times
O	in
O	reply
O	,
O	--just
O	as
O	Old
O	Man
O	Winter
O	had
O	done
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	hunter
O	spoke
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	the
O	boy
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	not
O	mock
O	a
O	nature
O	spirit
O	,
O	lest
O	some
O	harm
O	should
O	come
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	might
O	be
O	captured
O	and
O	made
O	to
O	serve
O	that
O	spirit
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	Old
O	Man
O	Winter
O	heard
O	the
O	mocking
O	raps
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	boy
O	within
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	angry
O	.
O	He
O	breathed
O	fiercely
O	upon
O	the
O	little
O	lodge
O	.
O	It
O	shrank
O	and
O	shivered
O	at
O	his
O	touch
O	like
O	a
O	living
O	thing
O	.
O	He
O	struck
O	it
O	several
O	sharp
O	blows
O	with
O	his
O	hammer
O	,
O	and
O	passed
O	on
O	.
O	The
O	fire
O	inside
O	the
O	lodge
O	burned
O	lower
O	and
O	lower
O	.
O	The
O	hunter
O	and
O	his
O	little
O	son
O	drew
O	closer
O	and
O	watched
O	the
O	last
O	flame
O	flicker
O	and
O	die
O	out
O	.
O	As
O	they
O	sat
O	by
O	the
O	ashes
O	,
O	numb
O	with
O	the
O	cold
O	,
O	all
O	of
O	a
O	sudden
O	a
O	new
O	warmth
O	filled
O	the
O	lodge
O	.
O	The
O	South
O	Wind
O	gently
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	young
O	chieftain
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	face
O	like
O	the
O	sun
O	,
O	entered
O	.
O	He
O	saw
O	the
O	dying
O	hunter
O	and
O	the
O	boy
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	warmed
O	them
O	back
O	to
O	life
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	were
O	stronger
O	,
O	he
O	helped
O	them
O	to
O	rekindle
O	the
O	fire
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	told
O	them
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	few
O	dried
O	blackberries
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	in
O	the
O	lodge
O	,
O	and
O	boil
O	them
O	in
O	water
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	they
O	must
O	eat
O	a
O	portion
O	of
O	the
O	blackberries
O	,
O	and
O	throw
O	the
O	rest
O	at
O	Old
O	Man
O	Winter
O	when
O	he
O	returned
O	.
O	This
O	would
O	frighten
O	him
O	away
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	terribly
O	afraid
O	of
O	blackberries
O	.
O	Blackberries
O	mean
O	sunshine
O	and
O	summer
O	heat
O	.
O	Old
O	Man
O	Winter
O	cannot
O	stay
O	where
O	they
O	are
O	.
O	He
O	never
O	visits
O	the
O	earth
O	at
O	blackberry
O	time
O	.
O	The
O	hunter
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	boy
O	said
O	they
O	would
O	do
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	told
O	.
O	Soon
O	the
O	young
O	chieftain
O	left
O	the

O	.
O	Not

O	Winter
O	returned
O	,
O	and

O	at

O	.
O	But
O	this

O	the

O	and
O	the
