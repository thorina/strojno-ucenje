O	had
O	a

O	that
O	she
O	quite
O	forgot
O	what
O	her
O	Fairy
O	Godmother
O	had
O	said
O	,
O	until
O	suddenly
O	she
O	heard
O	the
O	clock
O	begin
O	to
O	strike
O	twelve
O	.
O	She
O	remembered
O	that
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	finished
O	striking
O	,
O	all
O	her
O	fine
O	clothes
O	would
O	turn
O	to
O	rags
O	again;
O	and
O	,
O	jumping
O	up
O	in
O	alarm
O	,
O	she
O	ran
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	ran
O	after
O	her
O	,
O	trying
O	to
O	overtake
O	her;
O	and
O	Cinderella
O	in
O	her
O	fright
O	ran
O	so
O	fast
O	that
O	she
O	left
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	little
O	glass
O	slippers
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	behind
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	Prince
O	stopped
O	to
O	pick
O	it
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	gave
O	Cinderella
O	time
O	to
O	escape;
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	only
O	just
O	in
O	time
O	.
O	Just
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	crossing
O	the
O	Palace
O	yard
O	,
O	the
O	clock
O	finished
O	striking
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	all
O	her
O	finery
O	vanished;
O	and
O	there
O	she
O	was
O	,
O	dressed
O	in
O	her
O	old
O	ragged
O	frock
O	again
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	Prince
O	came
O	out
O	upon
O	the
O	Palace
O	steps
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	no
O	sign
O	of
O	the
O	lovely
O	Princess
O	.
O	The
O	guards
O	at
O	the
O	gate
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	nobody
O	at
O	all
O	had
O	passed
O	that
O	way
O	,
O	except
O	a
O	little
O	ragged
O	kitchenmaid;
O	and
O	the
O	Prince
O	had
O	to
O	go
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	ball
O	with
O	only
O	a
O	little
O	glass
O	slipper
O	to
O	remind
O	him
O	of
O	the
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	with
O	whom
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	desperately
O	in
O	love
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	the
O	King
O	sent
O	out
O	all
O	his
O	heralds
O	and
O	trumpeters
O	with
O	a
O	Proclamation
O	,
O	saying
O	that
O	the
O	Prince
O	would
O	marry
O	the
O	lady
O	whose
O	foot
O	the
O	slipper
O	fitted
O	.
O	But
O	though
O	all
O	the
O	ladies
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	tried
O	on
O	the
O	slipper
O	it
O	would
O	fit
O	none
O	of
O	them--their
O	feet
O	were
O	all
O	too
O	big
O	!
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	heralds
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	house
O	where
O	Cinderella
O	lived
O	.
O	The
O	eldest
O	stepsister
O	tried
O	the
O	slipper
O	on
O	first
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	impossible
O	for
O	her
O	to
O	get
O	her
O	foot
O	into
O	it
O	,
O	for
O	her
O	great
O	toe
O	was
O	too
O	big
O	.
O	Then
O	her
O	mother
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	watching
O	eagerly
O	,
O	fetched
O	a
O	carving-knife
O	.
O	"""Be"

O	So
O	the

O	cut
O	off
O	her
O	big

O	,
O	but
O	it

O	the
O	slipper
O	would

O	she
O	was
O	obliged
O	to

O	sister
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	other
O	sister
O	had
O	no
O	better

O	She
O	did
O	,
O	indeed

O	get
O	her
O	toes

O	her
O	foot
O	was
O	much
O	too
O	long
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	heel
O	stuck
O	out
O	behind
O	.
O	The
O	mother
O	urged
O	her
O	to
O	cut
O	it
O	off
O	.
O	"""What"

O	But
O	although

O	cut
O	her

O	the

O	at
