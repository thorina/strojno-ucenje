O	Carthaginians
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	dispute
O	between
O	Rome
O	and
O	Carthage
O	was
O	about
O	their
O	possession

O	the
O	island
O	of
O	Sicily;
O	and
O	the
O	war
O	thus
O	begun
O	had
O	lasted
O	eight
O	years
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	resolved

O	army
O	to
O	fight
O	the
O	Carthaginians
O	on
O	their

O	.
O	The
O	army
O	and

O	were
O	placed
O	under
O	the
O	command
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	consuls
O	,
O	Lucius
O	Manlius
O	and
O	Marcus
O	Attilius
O	Regulus
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	way
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	sea-fight
O	with
O	the
O	Carthaginian
O	fleet
O	,
O	and
O	this

O	the
O	first
O	naval
O	battle
O	that
O	the
O	Romans
O	ever
O	gained
O	.
O	It
O	made
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	Africa
O	free;
O	but
O	the
O	soldiers
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	so
O	far
O	from
O	home
O	before
O	,
O	murmured
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	expected
O	to
O	meet
O	not
O	only
O	human
O	enemies
O	,
O	but
O	monstrous
O	serpents
O	,
O	lions
O	,
O	elephants
O	,
O	asses
O	with
O	horns
O	,
O	and
O	dog-headed
O	monsters
O	,
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	scorching
O	sun
O	overhead
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	noisome
O	marsh
O	under
O	their
O	feet
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	Regulus
O	sternly
O	put
O	a
O	stop
O	to
O	all
O	murmurs
O	,
O	by
O	making
O	it
O	known
O	that
O	disaffection
O	would
O	be
O	punished
O	by
O	death
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	army
O	safely
O	landed
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	up
O	a
O	fortification
O	at
O	Clypea
O	,
O	and
O	plundered
O	the
O	whole
O	country
O	round
O	.
O	Orders
O	here
O	came
O	from
O	Rome
O	that
O	Manlius
O	should
O	return
O	thither
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	Regulus
O	should
O	remain
O	to
O	carry
O	on
O	the
O	war
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	grief
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	poor
O	man
O	,
O	with
O	nothing
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	but
O	a
O	little
O	farm
O	of
O	seven
O	acres
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	person
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	employed
O	to
O	cultivate
O	it
O	had
O	died
O	in
O	his
O	absence;
O	a
O	hired
O	laborer
O	had
O	undertaken
O	the
O	care
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	had
O	been
O	unfaithful
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	run
O	away
O	with
O	his
O	tools
O	and
O	his
O	cattle
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	afraid
O	that
O	,
O	unless
O	he
O	could
O	return
O	quickly
O	,
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	children
O	would
O	starve
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	the
O	Senate
O	engaged
O	to
O	provide
O	for
O	his
O	family
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	remained
O	,
O	making
O	expeditions
O	into
O	the
O	country
O	round
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	course
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	Romans
O	really
O	did
O	fall
O	in
O	with
O	a
O	serpent
O	,
O	as
O	monstrous
O	as
O	their
O	imagination
O	had
O	depicted
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	said
O	to
O	be
O	120
O	feet
O	long
O	,
O	and
O	dwelt
O	upon
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	Bagrada
O	,
O	where
O	it
O	used
O	to
O	devour
O	the
O	Roman
O	soldiers
O	as
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	fetch
O	water
O	.
O	It
O	had
O	such
O	tough
O	scales
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	obliged
O	to
O	attack
O	it
O	with
O	their
O	engines
O	meant
O	for
O	battering
O	city
O	walls;
O	and
O	only
O	succeeded
O	with
O	much
O	difficulty
O	in
O	destroying
O	it
O	.
O	The
O	country
O	was
O	most
O	beautiful
O	,
O	covered
O	with
O	fertile
O	corn-fields
O	and
O	full
O	of
O	rich
O	fruit-trees
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	rich
O	Carthaginians
O	had
O	country-houses
O	and
O	gardens
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	made
O	delicious
O	with
O	fountains
O	,
O	trees
O	,
O	land
O	flowers
O	.
O	The
O	Roman
O	soldiers
O	,
O	plain
O	,
O	hardy
O	,
O	fierce
O	,
O	and
O	pitiless
O	,
O	did
O	,
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	feared
O	,
O	cruel
O	damage
O	among
O	these
O	peaceful
O	scenes;
O	they
O	boasted
O	of
O	having
O	sacked
O	300
O	villages
O	,
O	and
O	mercy
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	known
O	to
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	Carthaginian
O	army
O	,
O	though
O	strong
O	in
O	horsemen
O	and
O	in
O	elephants
O	,
O	kept
O	upon
O	the
O	hills
O	and
O	did
O	nothing
O	to
O	save
O	the
O	country
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	wild
O	desert
O	tribes
O	of
O	Numidians
O	came
O	rushing
O	in
O	to
O	plunder
O	what
O	the
O	Romans
O	had
O	left
O	.
O	The
O	Carthaginians
O	sent
O	to
O	offer
O	terms
O	of
O	peace;
O	but
O	Regulus
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	become
O	uplifted
O	by
O	his
O	conquests
O	,
O	made
O	such
O	demands
O	that
O	the
O	messengers
O	remonstrated
O	.
O	He
O	answered
O	,
O	"""Men"

O	His

O	mercy
O	on
O	himself
O	than
O	on

O	.
O	The
O	Carthaginians
O	were
O	driven
O	to
O	extremity
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	horrible
O	offerings
O	to

O	,

O	a
O	slow
O	poison
O	,
O	and
O	that

O	could
O	not

O	insisted
O	that
O	no

O	be
