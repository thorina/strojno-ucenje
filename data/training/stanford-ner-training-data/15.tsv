O	""""
O	Then
O	the
O	little
O	frog
O	went
O	and
O	brought
O	the
O	box
O	.
O	Afterwards
O	they
O	gave
O	the
O	princess
O	food
O	and
O	drink
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	her
O	to
O	a
O	beautifully-made
O	bed
O	,
O	all
O	of
O	silk
O	and

O	she
O	laid
O	herself
O	in
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	slept
O	peacefully
O	.
O	When
O	day
O	came
O	she
O	arose
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	frog
O	gave
O	her
O	three
O	needles
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	box
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	with
O	her
O	.
O	They
O	would
O	be
O	very
O	necessary
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	go
O	over
O	a
O	high
O	glass
O	mountain
O	,
O	and
O	three
O	sharp
O	swords
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	sea;
O	if
O	she
O	passed
O	all
O	those
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	recover
O	her
O	dearest
O	prince
O	.
O	The
O	frog
O	also
O	gave
O	her
O	,
O	besides
O	the
O	three
O	needles
O	,
O	other
O	gifts
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	was
O	to
O	take
O	great
O	care
O	of--namely
O	,
O	a
O	plough-wheel
O	,
O	and
O	three
O	nuts
O	.
O	With
O	these
O	she
O	set
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	slippery
O	glass
O	mountain
O	,
O	she
O	stuck
O	the
O	three
O	needles
O	into
O	it
O	as
O	she
O	walked--some
O	before
O	her
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	behind--and
O	so
O	managed
O	to
O	get
O	across
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	,
O	she
O	hid
O	the
O	needles
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	place
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	noticed
O	particularly
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	her
O	way
O	.
O	Afterwards
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	sharp-cutting
O	swords
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	set
O	herself
O	on
O	her
O	plough-wheel
O	and
O	rolled
O	safely
O	over
O	them
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	came
O	before
O	a
O	great
O	lake
O	,
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	to
O	sail
O	across
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	done
O	so
O	she
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	castle
O	.
O	She
O	went
O	in
O	and
O	said
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	poor
O	maiden
O	,
O	who
O	wished
O	very
O	much
O	to
O	hire
O	herself
O	out
O	,
O	if
O	she
O	might
O	be
O	taken
O	in
O	there
O	as
O	a
O	servant
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	frogs
O	had
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	the
O	king's
O	son
O	,
O	whom
O	she
O	had
O	released
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	Iron
O	Stove
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	wood
O	,
O	dwelt
O	there;
O	so
O	she
O	was
O	content
O	to
O	be
O	taken
O	as
O	kitchen-maid
O	,
O	for
O	very
O	small
O	pay
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	king's
O	son
O	had
O	thought
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	dead;
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	now
O	with
O	him
O	another
O	maiden
O	,
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	persuaded
O	he
O	ought
O	to
O	marry
O	,
O	which
O	grieved
O	the
O	poor
O	kitchen-maid
O	very
O	much
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	evening
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	washed
O	up
O	the
O	dishes
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	done
O	all
O	her
O	work
O	,
O	she
O	felt
O	in
O	her
O	pocket
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	three
O	nuts
O	which
O	the
O	old
O	frog
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	.
O	She
O	bit
O	one
O	open
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	eat
O	the
O	kernel
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	behold
O	,
O	inside
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	dress
O	imaginable--so
O	beautiful
O	that
O	the
O	bride
O	soon
O	heard
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	came
O	and
O	asked
O	to
O	see
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	wanted
O	to
O	buy
O	it
O	,
O	saying
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	dress
O	for
O	a
O	kitchen-maid
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	kitchen-maid
O	thought
O	differently
O	,
O	and
O	refused
O	to
O	sell
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	offered
O	to
O	give
O	it
O	as
O	a
O	present
O	,
O	if
O	the
O	bride
O	would
O	grant
O	her
O	one
O	favour--namely
O	,
O	to
O	sleep
O	one
O	night
O	on
O	the
O	mat
O	outside
O	the
O	bridegroom's
O	door
O	.
O	The
O	bride
O	gave
O	her
O	leave
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	dress
O	was
O	so
O	beautiful
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	had
O	none
O	like
O	it
O	.
O	Now
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	evening
O	,
O	she
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	bridegroom:
O	"""The"
O	foolish
O	kitchen-maid

O	"""If"

O	said
O	he
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	bride
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	glass
O	of
O	wine
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	put
O	a
O	sleeping
O	draught;
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	slept
O	so
O	soundly
O	,
O	nothing
O	could
O	wake

O	.
O	While
O	,
O	outside
O	the

O	the

O	wept

O	open;

O	they
O	came
O	at

O	,
O	as
O	they
O	went
O	in
O	,
O	lo
O	!
O	it
O	changed
O	to

O	turned
O	to

O	,
O	and
O	received
O	them
O	both
O	with
O	great
O	joy
O	.
O	There
O	the
O	wedding
O	was
O	celebrated
O	,

O	they
O	remained

O	the
O	princess's
O	father
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	lamented
O	very
O	much
O	his
O	daughter's
O	loss
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	own
O	loneliness
O	,
O	they
O	soon
O	went
O	and
O	fetched
O	him
O	home
O	to
O	themselves
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	had
O	two
O	kingdoms
O	,
O	instead
