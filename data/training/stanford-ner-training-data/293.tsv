O	In
O	the
O	days
O	when
O	King
O	Arthur
O	had
O	established
O	his
O	kingdom
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	called
O	Emperor
O	of
O	Britain
O	and
O	its
O	three
O	islands
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	kings
O	who
O	were
O	rulers
O	in
O	their
O	own
O	lands
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	held
O	their
O	sovereignty
O	of
O	Arthur
O	and
O	had
O	done
O	homage
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	sworn
O	fealty
O	.
O	In
O	Wales
O	there
O	were
O	two
O	kings
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	north
O	were
O	eleven
O	kings
O	,
O	and
O	these
O	he
O	had
O	conquered
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	battle
O	by
O	Sherwood
O	Forest;
O	in
O	Cornwall
O	were
O	two
O	kings
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	Ireland
O	three
O	kings
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	gave
O	service
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	King
O	Arthur
O	.
O	That
O	part
O	of
O	Cornwall
O	which
O	was
O	called
O	the
O	lands
O	of
O	Tintagel
O	formed
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	a
O	prince
O	named
O	Mark
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	owed
O	certain
O	yearly
O	tribute
O	or
O	truage
O	to
O	King
O	Anguish
O	of
O	South
O	Ireland
O	.
O	It
O	befell
O	one
O	day
O	that
O	King
O	Anguish
O	sent
O	a
O	messenger
O	,
O	who
O	came
O	to
O	King
O	Mark
O	as
O	he
O	sat
O	in
O	hall
O	,
O	and
O	said:
O	'Sir
O	king
O	,
O	my
O	master
O	bids
O	me
O	say
O	that
O	the
O	truage
O	which
O	you
O	owe
O	unto
O	him
O	is
O	unpaid
O	for
O	seven
O	years
O	past
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	it
O	be
O	not
O	paid
O	he
O	will
O	demand
O	of
O	you
O	double
O	the
O	sum
O	.
O	'
O	Now
O	King
O	Mark
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	a
O	mean
O	and
O	covetous
O	mind
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	loved
O	not
O	to
O	give
O	money
O	.
O	Therefore
O	,
O	to
O	put
O	off
O	the
O	payment
O	for
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	answer
O	thus:
O	'Tell
O	your
O	master
O	that
O	we
O	will
O	pay
O	him
O	no
O	truage;
O	and
O	if
O	your
O	lord
O	says
O	he
O	will
O	have
O	it
O	,
O	let
O	him
O	send
O	a
O	trusty
O	knight
O	of
O	his
O	land
O	that
O	will
O	fight
O	for
O	his
O	right
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	will
O	find
O	another
O	to
O	do
O	battle
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	When
O	King
O	Anguish
O	heard
O	the
O	message
O	he
O	was
O	wondrous
O	wroth
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	into
O	him
O	the
O	brother
O	of
O	his
O	queen
O	,
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	,
O	a
O	good
O	knight
O	of
O	prowess
O	nobly
O	proved
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	besides
O	,
O	a
O	knight
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	craved
O	of
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	do
O	battle
O	for
O	the
O	truage
O	due
O	from
O	Mark
O	of
O	Cornwall
O	.
O	'Sir
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	,
O	'I
O	will
O	gladly
O	go
O	and
O	do
O	battle
O	for
O	you
O	on
O	this
O	saucy
O	king
O	or
O	his
O	knight
O	.
O	I
O	ween
O	ye
O	shall
O	have
O	your
O	truage
O	to
O	the
O	last
O	groat
O	,
O	for

O	,
O	unless

O	Lancelot
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	doubt
O	not
O	King
O	Mark
O	hath
O	no
O	knight
O	of
O	such
O	worth
O	and
O	prowess
O	as
O	I
O	.
O	'
O	So
O	in
O	all
O	haste
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	set
O	forth
O	in
O	a
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	cast
O	anchor
O	fast
O	by
O	the
O	shore
O	where
O	,
O	on
O	two
O	high
O	cliffs
O	,
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	Tintagel
O	frowned
O	upon
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	When
O	King
O	Mark
O	understood
O	that
O	so
O	noble
O	a
O	knight
O	as
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	do
O	battle
O	for
O	the
O	truage
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	sorrow
O	,
O	and
O	wept
O	as
O	he
O	looked
O	upon
O	the
O	bags
O	of
O	gold
O	in
O	his
O	treasure-chest
O	.
O	He
O	knew
O	of
O	no
O	knight
O	of
O	his
O	court
O	that
O	durst
O	face
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	feared
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	part
O	with
O	his
O	gold
O	.
O	Daily
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	sent
O	a
O	message
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	gate
O	,
O	demanding
O	payment
O	of
O	the
O	truage
O	,
O	or
O	that
O	a
O	knight
O	should
O	come
O	forth
O	to
O	do
O	battle
O	against
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Mark
O	let
O	make
O	a
O	proclamation
O	through
O	all
O	the
O	lands
O	,
O	that
O	if
O	a
O	knight
O	would
O	fight
O	to
O	save
O	the
O	truage
O	of
O	Cornwall
O	he
O	should
O	fare
O	the
O	better
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	he
O	lived
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	days
O	and
O	weeks
O	went
O	by
O	and
O	no
O	knight
O	came
O	forward
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	sent
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	a
O	message
O	which
O	said
O	,
O	that
O	if
O	within
O	a
O	day
O	and
O	a
O	night
O	a
O	champion
O	for
O	King
O	Mark
O	came
O	not
O	forward
O	,
O	he
O	should
O	depart
O	.
O	All
O	that
O	day
O	King
O	Mark
O	was
O	sore
O	and
O	ill
O	of
O	mind
O	and
O	haggard
O	of
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	could
O	never
O	stay
O	still
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	for
O	ever
O	faring
O	with
O	his
O	barons
O	to
O	where
O	he
O	could
O	look
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	ship
O	of
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	,
O	and
O	see
O	the
O	knight
O	waiting
O	in
O	his
O	armour
O	.
O	Late
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	king
O	stood
O	thus
O	,
O	gnawing
O	his
O	nails
O	for
O	rage
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	hot
O	and
O	wrathful
O	that
O	none
O	of
O	his
O	barons
O	dare
O	speak
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	two
O	horsemen
O	riding
O	swiftly
O	into
O	the
O	courtyard
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	their
O	horses'
O	feet
O	King
O	Mark
O	turned
O	eagerly
O	.
O	A
O	young
O	squire
O	was
O	the
O	foremost
O	rider
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	youth
O	full
O	handsome
O	and
O	tall
O	,
O	with
O	brown
O	curly
O	hair
O	and
O	blue
O	eyes
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	dressed
O	in
O	a
O	surcoat
O	of
O	red
O	satin
O	and
O	a
O	mantle
O	of
O	crimson
O	,
O	trimmed
O	with
O	gold;
O	and
O	on
O	his
O	head
O	was
O	a
O	cap
O	of
O	rich
O	purple
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	feet
O	and
O	legs
O	were
O	clad
O	in
O	fine
O	leather
O	,
O	with
O	gold
O	bosses
O	on
O	his
O	shoes
O	.
O	Alighting
O	easily
O	,
O	he
O	doffed
O	his
O	hat
O	and
O	came
O	towards
O	the
O	king:
O	'Sir
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	'if
O	ye
O	will
O	give
O	me
O	the
O	order
O	of

O	shall
O	do
O	battle
O	to

O	with
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	of
O	Ireland

O	'
O	King
O	Mark
O	looked
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	young
O	of
O	age
O	,
O	yet
O	he
O	was
O	passing
O	well
O	made
O	of
O	body
O	,
O	with
O	broad
O	shoulders
O	and
O	of
O	big
O	limbs
O	.
O	The
O	heart
O	of
O	King
O	Mark
O	became
O	light
O	.
O	'Fair
O	son
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	barons
O	marvelled
O	at
O	his
O	soft
O	words
O	,
O	'what

O	whence

O	'Sir

O	sister
O	Elizabeth
O	,
O	who
O	died
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	King
O	Talloch
O	of
O	Lyones
O	.
O	'
O	At
O	these
O	words
O	the
O	king
O	rose
O	from
O	his
O	seat
O	and
O	embraced
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	crying:
O	'Now
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	Heaven
O	,
O	thou
O	art
O	right
O	heartily
O	welcome
O	unto
O	me
O	,
O	dear
O	nephew
O	.
O	'
O	That
O	evening
O	he
O	made
O	great
O	cheer
O	of
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	his
O	bed
O	made
O	next
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	royal
O	chamber
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morrow
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	horsed
O	and
O	armed
O	in
O	the
O	best
O	manner
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	sent
O	a
O	trumpeter
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	and
O	let
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	know
O	that
O	a
O	better
O	born
O	man
O	than
O	he
O	was
O	himself
O	would
O	fight
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	his
O	name
O	was
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	of
O	Lyones
O	,
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Lyones
O	and
O	his
O	queen
O	Elizabeth
O	,
O	King
O	Mark's
O	sister
O	.
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	was
O	right
O	blithe
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	have
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	such
O	a
O	gentleman
O	.
O	Then
O	it
O	was
O	ordained
O	that
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	should
O	battle
O	on
O	a
O	little
O	island
O	near
O	the
O	ship
O	of
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	young
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	and
O	his
O	squire
O	were
O	rowed
O	thereunto
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	departed
O	,
O	King
O	Mark
O	and
O	his
O	barons
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	common
O	people
O	were
O	rejoiced
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	young
O	knight's
O	noble
O	and
O	high
O	bearing
O	,
O	and
O	wished
O	him
O	Godspeed
O	.
O	When
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	landed
O	he
O	saw
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	waiting
O	armed
O	in
O	the
O	shadow
O	of
O	his
O	ship
O	.
O	Sir
O	Tristram's
O	squire
O	brought
O	his
O	master's
O	horse
O	to
O	land
O	,
O	and
O	clad
O	his
O	master
O	in
O	his
O	armour
O	as
O	was
O	right
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	young
O	knight
O	mounted
O	upon
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	rode
O	towards
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	yet
O	six
O	spear-lengths
O	from
O	him
O	the
O	knight
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	cried
O	unto
O	him:
O	'Young
O	knight
O	,
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	what
O	doest
O	thou
O	here
O	?
O	I
O	grieve
O	me
O	of
O	thy
O	courage
O	,
O	for
O	ye
O	are
O	untried
O	,
O	while
O	I
O	have
O	been
O	well
O	essayed
O	in
O	jousts
O	and
O	tournaments
O	with
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	best
O	men
O	of
O	their
O	hands
O	as
O	are
O	now
O	living
O	.
O	I
O	counsel
O	thee
O	to
O	go
O	back
O	.
O	'
O	'Fair
O	and
O	well-proved
O	knight
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	'I
O	am
O	for
O	thy
O	sake
O	made
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	have
O	promised
O	to
O	fight
O	thee
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	do
O	so
O	,
O	as
O	much
O	for
O	mine
O	uncle's
O	sake
O	as
O	for
O	what
O	worship
O	I
O	may
O	win
O	from
O	doing
O	battle
O	with
O	ye
O	,
O	who
O	are
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	best
O	renowned
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	'
O	'Then
O	I
O	would
O	have
O	ye
O	know
O	,
O	fair
O	sir
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	,
O	'that
O	no
O	worship
O	shalt
O	thou
O	lose
O	if
O	thou
O	canst
O	only
O	stand
O	against
O	three
O	strokes
O	of
O	mine
O	,
O	for
O	,
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	my
O	noble
O	deeds
O	,
O	seen
O	and
O	proved
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	made
O	me
O	knight
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	answered
O	him
O	naught
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	they
O	dressed
O	their
O	spears
O	and
O	spurred
O	their
O	horses
O	,
O	and
O	ran
O	so
O	fiercely
O	each
O	against
O	the
O	other
O	that
O	both
O	were
O	smitten
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	both
O	horses
O	and
O	men
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	had
O	struck
O	a
O	great
O	wound
O	in
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	yet
O	so
O	eager
O	was
O	the
O	young
O	knight
O	that
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	They
O	leaped
O	up
O	and
O	avoided
O	their
O	horses
O	,
O	and
O	drew
O	out
O	their
O	swords
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	shield
O	on
O	arm
O	they
O	lashed
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	like
O	fierce
O	wild
O	boars
O	.
O	Yet
O	for
O	all
O	Sir
O	Marhaus'
O	strong
O	and
O	bitter
O	strokes
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	beat
O	down
O	the
O	young
O	knight's
O	guard
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	despite
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	aim
O	at
O	his
O	vizor
O	and
O	his
O	neck
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	was
O	wroth
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	him
O	more
O	furiously
O	.
O	Thus
O	for
O	two
O	hours
O	the
O	battle
O	waged
O	,
O	and
O	both
O	were
O	sore
O	wounded
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	was
O	the
O	fresher
O	and
O	better
O	winded
O	and
O	bigger
O	of
O	limb
O	and
O	reach;
O	and
O	suddenly
O	he
O	heaved
O	his
O	sword
O	up
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	closing
O	upon
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	he
O	smote
O	him
O	with
O	so
O	mighty
O	a
O	buffet
O	upon
O	his
O	helm
O	that
O	the
O	blade
O	shore
O	through
O	the
O	steel
O	even
O	into
O	the
O	brain-pan
O	.
O	So
O	fierce
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	stroke
O	that
O	the
O	sword
O	stuck
O	fast
O	in
O	the
O	bone
O	and
O	the
O	helmet
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	pulled
O	thrice
O	at
O	his
O	sword
O	before
O	it
O	would
O	loosen
O	.
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	sank
O	to
O	his
O	knees
O	with
O	a
O	deathly
O	groan;
O	then
O	he
O	threw
O	away
O	his
O	sword
O	and
O	shield
O	,
O	and
O	rising
O	,
O	staggered
O	away
O	towards
O	his
O	ship
O	.
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	swooned
O	and
O	fell;
O	and
O	his
O	squire
O	came
O	running
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	men
O	of
O	Sir
O	Marhaus'
O	ship
O	came
O	and
O	drew
O	their
O	master
O	on
O	board
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	swiftly
O	set
O	their
O	sail
O	and
O	flew
O	over
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	Great
O	was
O	the
O	mourning
O	of
O	the
O	barons
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	Cornwall
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	known
O	how
O	deep
O	and
O	wide
O	was
O	the
O	wound
O	which
O	Tristram
O	had
O	received
O	from
O	the
O	lance
O	of
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	.
O	Many
O	famous
O	leeches
O	came
O	and
O	searched
O	the
O	wound
O	and
O	strove
O	to
O	close
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	none
O	availed
O	.
O	When
O	two
O	months
O	had
O	passed
O	,
O	came
O	an
O	old
O	,
O	old
O	woman
O	,
O	a
O	witch
O	wise
O	in
O	leechcraft
O	beyond
O	all
O	others
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	called
O	the
O	Mother
O	of
O	the
O	Mists
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	Great
O	Shuddering
O	Moor
O	,
O	where
O	only
O	trolls
O	dwelled
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	man
O	ever
O	dared
O	to
O	go
O	.
O	She
O	also
O	came
O	and
O	searched
O	his
O	wound
O	at
O	the
O	king's
O	desire
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	had
O	made
O	her
O	search
O	,
O	with
O	many
O	mumblings
O	and
O	strange
O	words
O	,
O	she
O	turned
O	and
O	looked
O	keenly
O	at
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	Her
O	eyes
O	gleamed
O	like
O	beads
O	,
O	her
O	skin
O	was
O	wrinkled
O	and
O	dark
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	laughed
O	a
O	little
O	soft
O	laugh
O	.
O	'Lord
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	'this
O	fine
O	man's
O	wound
O	is
O	poisoned
O	,
O	and
O	naught
O	can
O	heal
O	it
O	this
O	side
O	the
O	great
O	water
O	.
O	But
O	if
O	he
O	goeth
O	whither
O	the
O	spear
O	came
O	from
O	which
O	poisoned
O	it
O	,
O	he
O	shall
O	get
O	whole
O	of
O	that
O	wound
O	.
O	'
O	''Tis
O	well
O	,

O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'he
O	shall
O	be
O	sent
O	to
O	Ireland
O	.
O	'
O	'Ay
O	,
O	ay
O	,
O	ay
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	,
O	and
O	laughed
O	in
O	Sir
O	Tristram's
O	face
O	.
O	'Thou
O	shalt
O	be
O	healed
O	,

O	chief
O	,

O	the
O	hand

O	thee
O	a

O	healed
O	this
O	side

O	.
O	'
O	Forthwith
O	King
O	Mark
O	let
O	a
O	fair
O	ship
O	be
O	purveyed
O	and
O	well
O	stored
O	with
O	necessary
O	victuals
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	was
O	carried
O	thereto
O	and
O	laid
O	on
O	his
O	couch
O	on
O	the
O	deck
O	,
O	and
O	Governale
O	,
O	his
O	faithful
O	squire
O	,
O	went
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	sunshine
O	and
O	the
O	brisk
O	wind
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	felt
O	joyful
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	merry
O	waves
O	slapped
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	full
O	prettily
O	as
O	it
O	cleaved
O	through
O	the
O	blue
O	seas
O	towards
O	the
O	west
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	evening
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	white
O	cliffs
O	and
O	the
O	brown
O	rocks
O	of
O	Ireland
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	took
O	his
O	harp
O	and
O	played
O	thereon
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	learned
O	to
O	harp
O	most
O	featly
O	in
O	France
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	lived
O	seven
O	years
O	,
O	to
O	learn
O	all
O	manner
O	of
O	courtly
O	and
O	noble
O	pastimes
O	.
O	Soon
O	the
O	shipmen
O	cast
O	anchor
O	in
O	a
O	wide
O	sheltered
O	cove
O	beneath
O	a
O	castle
O	which
O	stood
O	on
O	a
O	high
O	rock
O	beside
O	a
O	fair
O	town
O	.
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	asked
O	the
O	master
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	that
O	town
O	.
O	'Cro-na-Shee
O	,
O	if
O	it
O	please
O	you
O	,
O	my
O	lord

O	said
O	the
O	master
O	.
O	'It
O	pleases
O	me
O	well
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Tristram;
O	'it
O	should
O	mean
O	that

O	'
O	Out
O	of
O	the
O	merriness
O	of
O	his
O	heart
O	he
O	thrummed
O	his
O	harp
O	with
O	so
O	blithe
O	and
O	strange
O	a
O	tune
O	that
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	the
O	very
O	folk
O	upon
O	the
O	shore
O	came
O	listening
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	began
O	to
O	dance
O	,
O	while
O	others
O	looked
O	sad
O	.
O	For
O	though
O	the
O	tune
O	was
O	very
O	merry
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	sadness
O	also
O	peeping
O	from
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	happened
O	that
O	King
O	Anguish
O	and
O	his
O	court
O	were
O	in
O	that
O	castle
O	by
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	handmaiden
O	of
O	the
O	queen
O	came
O	to
O	where
O	they
O	sat
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	of
O	the
O	knight
O	that
O	sat
O	in
O	his
O	ship
O	and
O	harped
O	so
O	strange
O	a
O	lay
O	that
O	it
O	made
O	one
O	glad
O	and
O	sorry
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Anguish
O	sent
O	a
O	knight
O	and
O	begged
O	the
O	harper
O	to
O	take
O	cheer
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	was
O	brought
O	in
O	a
O	litter
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	damsels
O	were
O	sad
O	at
O	his
O	sickness
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	knights
O	sorrowed
O	that
O	a
O	knight
O	so
O	noble-looking
O	should
O	be
O	so
O	wounded
O	.
O	King
O	Anguish
O	asked
O	him
O	who
O	he
O	was
O	and
O	how
O	he
O	came
O	by
O	his
O	wound
O	.
O	And
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	having
O	learned
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Ireland
O	,
O	whose
O	champion
O	he
O	had
O	worsted
O	in
O	the
O	battle
O	,
O	and
O	thinking
O	that
O	his
O	own
O	name
O	would
O	be
O	known
O	,
O	replied:
O	'I
O	am
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	of
O	Lyones
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	name
O	is
O	Sir
O	Tramor
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	wound
O	was
O	got
O	in
O	battle
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	fought
O	for
O	a
O	lady's
O	right
O	.
O	'
O	'I
O	pity
O	thee
O	,
O	sir
O	knight
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	right
O	noble
O	king
O	and
O	lovable
O	,
O	'and
O	by
O	Heaven's
O	aid
O	,
O	ye
O	shall
O	have
O	all
O	the
O	help
O	in
O	this
O	country
O	that
O	ye
O	may
O	need
O	.
O	'
O	The
O	king
O	told
O	him
O	of
O	the
O	battle
O	which
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	had
O	had
O	on
O	his
O	behalf
O	with
O	a
O	knight
O	named
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	had
O	come
O	home
O	wounded
O	unto
O	death
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	dead
O	this
O	two
O	months
O	.
O	On
O	which
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	feigned
O	to
O	be
O	sorry
O	,
O	but
O	said
O	not
O	much
O	thereon
O	.
O	Then
O	did
O	the
O	king
O	order
O	his
O	daughter
O	to
O	come
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	called
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	,
O	for
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	lovely
O	damsel
O	in
O	all
O	Ireland
O	and
O	the
O	Out-Isles
O	,
O	and
O	withal
O	gentle
O	and
O	kind;
O	and
O	her
O	father
O	bade
O	her
O	tend
O	and
O	minister
O	to
O	this
O	stranger
O	knight
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	Ireland
O	to
O	heal
O	him
O	of
O	his
O	wound
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	weeks
O	,
O	so
O	soft
O	was
O	she
O	of
O	her
O	hands
O	and
O	so
O	learned
O	in
O	leechcraft
O	,
O	she
O	had
O	cleaned
O	Tristram's
O	wound
O	of
O	all
O	poison
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	hale
O	and
O	strong
O	again
O	.
O	As
O	some
O	reward
O	he
O	taught
O	her
O	to
O	harp
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	her
O	many
O	good
O	and
O	costly
O	presents
O	.
O	These
O	she
O	took
O	,
O	but
O	valued
O	them
O	not
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	his
O	kind
O	words
O	and
O	smiles
O	.
O	More
O	and
O	more
O	she
O	loved
O	to
O	hear
O	his
O	voice
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	gone
O	out
O	hawking
O	or
O	looking
O	at
O	jousts
O	she
O	was
O	sad
O	and
O	thoughtful
O	,
O	sitting
O	with
O	her
O	fair
O	hands
O	in
O	her
O	lap
O	and
O	her
O	eyes
O	looking
O	far
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	heard
O	his
O	step
O	or
O	his
O	voice
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	,
O	then
O	would
O	her
O	sad
O	eyes
O	light
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	merry
O	tune
O	would
O	hum
O	upon
O	her
O	lips
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	would
O	gaily
O	talk
O	with
O	her
O	handmaidens
O	,
O	who
O	,
O	whispering
O	and
O	glancing
O	and
O	nodding
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	as
O	they
O	sat
O	about
O	her
O	at
O	their
O	spinning
O	frames
O	,
O	knew
O	of
O	her
O	love
O	for
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	before
O	she
O	was
O	aware
O	of
O	it
O	herself
O	.
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	cared
O	not
O	overmuch
O	to
O	be
O	with
O	ladies
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	more
O	joyful
O	to
O	be
O	in
O	hall
O	,
O	talking
O	of
O	hunting
O	,
O	jousting
O	and
O	hawking
O	.
O	All
O	men
O	regarded
O	him
O	highly
O	for
O	his
O	great
O	knowledge
O	of
O	these
O	things
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	yet
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	hurting
O	his
O	wound
O	which
O	was
O	but
O	freshly
O	healed
O	,
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	forbade
O	him
O	gently
O	to
O	take
O	violent
O	exercise
O	.
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	was
O	impatient
O	to
O	be
O	in
O	the
O	saddle
O	again
O	,
O	with
O	lance
O	in
O	rest
O	and
O	his
O	great
O	charger
O	leaping
O	beneath
O	him
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	King
O	Anguish
O	there
O	had
O	lately
O	come
O	a
O	knight
O	named
O	Sir
O	Palomides
O	,
O	famed
O	for
O	his
O	knightly
O	deeds
O	,
O	though
O	still
O	a
O	pagan
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	well
O	favoured
O	both
O	of
O	King
O	Anguish
O	and
O	his
O	queen
O	.
O	Sir
O	Palomides
O	came
O	and
O	made
O	great
O	court
O	to
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	,
O	and
O	proffered
O	her
O	many
O	gifts
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	loved
O	her
O	passing
O	well
O	.
O	Indeed
O	,
O	for
O	her
O	sake
O	he
O	declared
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	christened
O	and
O	become
O	a
O	Christian
O	knight;
O	but
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	had
O	no
O	care
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	avoided
O	him
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	she
O	might
O	.
O	On
O	a
O	certain
O	day
O	King
O	Anguish
O	made
O	a
O	great
O	cry
O	that
O	a
O	joust
O	and
O	tournament
O	would
O	be
O	held
O	,
O	wherein
O	only
O	unmarried
O	knights
O	should
O	join
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	prize
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	fair
O	lady
O	called
O	the
O	Lady
O	of
O	the
O	Laundes
O	,
O	near
O	cousin
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	The
O	heralds
O	further
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	who
O	should
O	win
O	her
O	should
O	marry
O	her
O	three
O	days
O	after
O	,
O	and
O	have
O	all
O	her
O	lands
O	with
O	her
O	.
O	This
O	cry
O	was
O	made
O	in
O	all
O	Ireland
O	and
O	Wales
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	Logres
O	and
O	Alban
O	,
O	which
O	are
O	now
O	called
O	England
O	and
O	Scotland
O	.
O	It
O	befell
O	the
O	same
O	day
O	that
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	came
O	to
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	seemed
O	distressed
O	of
O	mind
O	and
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	wept
O	secretly
O	.
O	'Sir
O	Tramor
O	,
O	'
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	'this
O	tournament
O	shall
O	exalt
O	Sir
O	Palomides
O	beyond
O	all
O	other

O	a
O	better

O	forward
O	and
O	overcome
O	him
O	.

O	'Fair

O	On
O	the

O	of

O	Sir
O	Palomides
O	came
O	with

O	many
O	of
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	,
O	as
O	Sir
O	Gawaine

O	le
O	Desirous
O	,
O	Sir
O	Owen
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	little
O	page-boy
O	who
O	had
O	saved
O	King
O	Arthur's
O	life
O	in
O	his
O	hall
O	at
O	Caerleon
O	,
O	and
O	three

O	knights
O	.
O	All
O	these
O	he
O	struck
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	others
O	were
O	adread
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	people
O	had
O	great
O	marvel
O	,
O	and
O	acclaimed
O	him
O	with
O	much
O	worship
O	as
O	the
O	victor
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	day

O	The

O	proudly
O	flourishing

O	the
O	lists
O	,
O	dressed
O	his
O	lance
O	,

O	together
O	they
O	put
O	their
O	horses
O	in
O	motion
O	.
O	Like
O	two
O	bulls
O	the
O	knights
O	thundered
O	against
O	each
O	other
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	of
O	the
O	lists
O	.
O	The
O	white
O	knight's

O	hit
O	the

O	Palomides
O	full
O	in
O	the
O	centre
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	shock
O	the
O	pagan
O	knight
O	was
O	lifted
O	from
O	his
O	saddle
O	,
O	carried
O	beyond
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	thud
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	while
O	his
O	horse
O	careered
O	onward
O	riderless
O	.
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	and
O	his
O	fellows
O	marvelled
O	who

O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Palomides
O	,
O	rising
O	from

O	,
O	caught
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	full
O	of
O	shame
O	,
O	would
O	have
O	slunk
O	from
O	the
O	field
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	white
O	knight
O	rode
O	after
O	him
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	turn
O	,
O	'for

O	,
O	alighting
O	,
O	they
O	lashed
O	at
O	each

O	swords
O	.
O	Now
O	Sir
O	Palomides
O	was
O	a
O	powerful
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	strokes
O	were
O	passing
O	heavy
O	,

O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	for
O	the

O	he
O	,
O	felt
O	so
O	full

O	swiftness
O	was
O	a

O	on
O	the

O	'Thou--thou

O	against

O	queen
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	and

O	and
O	all
O	the
O	court
O	marvelled
O	who
O	should
O	be
O	the
O	stranger
O	knight
O	,
O	and
O	why
O	he
O	had
O	departed
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	suspected
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	but
O	none

O	his
O	squire

O	and
O	none
O	dared
O	charge
O	him
O	therewith
O	.
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	kept
O	her
O	counsel
O	,
O	and
O	strove
O	to
O	seem
O	lighthearted
O	.
O	It
O	fell
O	upon
O	a
O	day
O	that
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	was
O	disporting
O	himself
O	with
O	other
O	knights
O	at
O	a
O	game
O	of
O	ball
O	upon
O	the
O	green
O	before
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	left
O	his
O	sword
O	hung
O	upon
O	the
O	post
O	beside
O	his
O	seat
O	in
O	hall
O	.
O	The
O	queen
O	,
O	with
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	,
O	passed
O	through
O	the
O	hall
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	men
O	at
O	their
O	sport
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	her
O	way
O	she
O	espied
O	Sir
O	Tristram's
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	strange
O	device
O	of
O	a
O	serpent
O	which
O	was
O	upon
O	the
O	handle
O	.
O	She
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	marvellous
O	piece
O	of
O	work
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	had
O	she
O	seen
O	the
O	like
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	by
O	ill
O	hap
O	,
O	she
O	drew
O	the
O	sword
O	from
O	the
O	scabbard
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	both
O	admired
O	it
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	,
O	looking
O	at
O	its
O	keenness
O	and
O	brightness
O	and
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	mystery
O	engraved
O	on
O	it
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	the
O	queen
O	gave
O	a
O	little
O	cry
O	as
O	of
O	terror
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	pointed
O	to
O	where
O	,
O	within
O	a
O	foot
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	of
O	the
O	point
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	piece
O	broken
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	edge
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	very
O	hastily
O	,
O	the
O	queen
O	ran
O	with
O	the
O	sword
O	into
O	her
O	bower
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	her
O	treasure-chest
O	she
O	drew
O	a
O	casket
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	casket
O	she
O	drew
O	a
O	tiny
O	piece
O	of
O	doeskin
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	that
O	she
O	took
O	a
O	fragment
O	of
O	steel
O	.
O	While
O	her
O	daughter
O	marvelled
O	what
O	it
O	all
O	might
O	mean
O	,
O	the
O	queen
O	took
O	the
O	piece
O	of
O	steel
O	and
O	placed
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	broken
O	part
O	of
O	Sir
O	Tristram's
O	sword
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	fitted
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	break
O	could
O	hardly
O	be
O	seen
O	.
O	'Alas
O	!
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	'this
O	is
O	the
O	piece

O	befall
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	her
O	mother's
O	rage
O	.
O	The
O	queen
O	caught
O	up
O	the
O	sword
O	fiercely
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	and
O	rushed
O	from
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	Midway
O	through
O	the
O	hall
O	there
O	met
O	her
O	Sir

O	himself
O	with
O	his
O	squire
O	Governale
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	queen
O	sped
O	to
O	him

O	would
O	have
O	run
O	him
O	through
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	Governale
O	,
O	who
O	snatched
O	the
O	sword
O	from
O	her
O	,
O	though
O	she
O	wounded
O	him
O	in

O	wrath
O	.

O	rage
O	thus
O	put
O	to
O	naught

O	ran
O	to

O	,

O	her
O	kin
O	.
O	'
O	'Sir
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	'I
O	thank
O	you
O	for
O	your
O	goodness
O	and
O	for
O	the
O	kind

O	which
O	I
O	have
O	had
O	here
O	of
O	yourself
O	and
O	your
O	queen
O	and
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	.
O	I
O	will
O	depart
O	straightway
O	when
O	I
O	have
O	bidden
O	your
O	daughter
O	farewell
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	owe
O	my
O	life
O	to
O	her
O	gentle
O	hands;
O	and
O	I
O	promise
O	this
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	will
O	be
O	your
O	daughter's

O	knight
O	in
O	right
O	or

O	to

O	may

O	in
O	her
O	behalf
O	,
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	I
O	live
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	took
O	he
O	his
O	leave
O	of
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	all
O	how
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	that
O	land
O	.
O	He
O	thanked
O	her
O	heartily
O	for
O	all
O	her
O	gentleness
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	for
O	her
O	healing
O	of
O	his
O	wound
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	she
O	stood
O	silent
O	,
O	changing
O	red
O	and
O	white
O	of
O	face
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	downcast
O	eyes
O	,
O	her
O	fingers
O	straining
O	about
O	each
O	other
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	swore
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	her
O	knight
O	,
O	to
O	fight
O	for
O	her
O	whenever
O	she
O	should
O	send
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	bade
O	her
O	good-bye
O	,
O	she
O	took
O	the
O	hand
O	which
O	he
O	held
O	forth
O	,
O	but
O	would
O	not
O	look
O	at
O	him
O	.
O	Tristram
O	wondered
O	why
O	her
O	fair
O	hand
O	was
O	so
O	cold
O	.
O	'Good-bye
O	and
O	God
O	be
O	with
O	ye
O	always
O	,
O	'
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	replied
O	in
O	a
O	faint
O	voice
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	turned
O	and
O	went
O	from
O	him
O	.
O	Tristram
O	thought
O	she
O	was
O	angered
O	with
O	him
O	for
O	the
O	slaying
O	of
O	her
O	uncle
O	.
O	So
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	he
O	rode
O	forth
O	with
O	Governale
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	and
O	looked
O	back
O	not
O	once
O	.
O	There
O	he
O	entered
O	by
O	a
O	ship
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	good
O	wind
O	he
O	arrived
O	at
O	Tintagel
O	in
O	Cornwall
O	,
O	and
O	King
O	Mark
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	barons
O	were
O	glad
O	that
O	Tristram
O	was
O	whole
O	again
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	went
O	to
O	his
O	father
O	King
O	Talloch
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	made
O	great
O	cheer
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	wide
O	lands
O	were
O	given
O	him
O	.
O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	rest
O	long
O	in
O	one
O	place
O	,
O	but
O	went
O	into
O	Logres
O	and
O	Alban
O	and
O	Wales
O	,
O	seeking
O	adventures
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	fame
O	for
O	prowess
O	was
O	almost
O	as
O	great
O	as
O	the
O	fame
O	of
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	.
O	Whereever
O	he
O	went
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	harp
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	hall
O	and
O	bower
O	his
O	favourite
O	songs
O	were
O	those
O	that
O	praised
O	the
O	beauty
O	of
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	,
O	her
O	gentle
O	ways
O	and
O	her
O	soft
O	white
O	hands
O	.
O	After
O	a
O	year
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	King
O	Mark
O	and
O	lived
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	and
O	ladies
O	admired
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	praise
O	of
O	his
O	courtesy
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	mouths
O	of
O	all
O	,
O	noble
O	and
O	simple
O	,
O	high
O	and
O	low
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Mark
O	his
O	uncle
O	began
O	to
O	hate
O	him
O	for
O	the
O	love
O	that
O	all
O	bore
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	since
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	married
O	and
O	had
O	no
O	son
O	to
O	whom
O	his
O	kingdom
O	should
O	go
O	after
O	his
O	death
O	,
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	would
O	have
O	it
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	his
O	next
O	kin
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	with
O	Lyones
O	and
O	Tintagel
O	,
O	the
O	fame
O	and
O	power
O	of
O	Tristram
O	would
O	increase
O	abundantly
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	king
O	began
O	to
O	cast
O	about
O	in
O	his
O	mind
O	for
O	a
O	way
O	whereby
O	he
O	might
O	do
O	some
O	hurt
O	to
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	or
O	even
O	destroy
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	called
O	the
O	young
O	knight
O	to
O	him
O	one
O	day
O	and
O	said:
O	'Dear
O	nephew
O	,
O	I
O	have
O	been
O	thinking
O	a
O	long
O	while
O	of
O	taking
O	unto
O	myself
O	a
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	hear
O	much
O	of
O	the
O	beauty
O	and
O	goodness
O	of
O	the
O	king's
O	daughter
O	of
O	Ireland
O	,
O	whom
O	men
O	call
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	.
O	Now
O	I
O	would
O	that
O	you
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	bear
O	my
O	message
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	was
O	troubled
O	in
O	mind
O	at
O	these
O	words
O	.
O	Since
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	he
O	had
O	had
O	no
O	ease
O	of
O	spirit
O	,
O	for
O	now
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	loved
O	her
O	.
O	Though
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	angered
O	with
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	slaying
O	her
O	uncle
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	queen
O	and
O	other
O	kinsfolk
O	of
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	would
O	surely
O	slay
O	him
O	if
O	they
O	could
O	,
O	yet
O	had
O	he
O	hoped
O	in
O	a
O	while
O	to
O	have
O	gone
O	to
O	King
O	Anguish
O	and
O	found
O	some
O	way
O	to
O	win
O	Isoude
O	for
O	his
O	wife
O	.
O	'Ye
O	are
O	feared
O	to
O	go
O	,
O	then
O	?
O	'
O	sneered
O	King
O	Mark
O	,
O	noting
O	the
O	silence
O	of
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	.
O	'Then
O	I
O	will
O	e'en
O	send

O	.
O	'
O	At
O	that
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	flushed
O	hotly
O	and
O	said:
O	'I
O	fear
O	not
O	to
O	go
O	there
O	or
O	anywhere
O	,
O	and
O	I

O	bear

O	'
O	'It

O	well

O	said
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	'I

O	will
O	get
O	my
O	scrivener
O	to
O	write
O	my

O	'
O	Now
O	King
O	Mark
O	said
O	all
O	this
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	his
O	craft
O	and
O	treachery
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	heard
O	how
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	had
O	been
O	full
O	of
O	the
O	praises
O	of
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	,
O	while
O	yet
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	learned
O	,
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	had
O	not
O	promised
O	himself
O	in
O	love
O	to
O	her
O	.
O	By
O	his
O	crafty
O	speech
O	King
O	Mark
O	had
O	hoped
O	to
O	make
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	promise
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	Ireland
O	to
O	obtain
O	her
O	,
O	not
O	for
O	himself
O	,
O	but
O	for
O	King
O	Mark
O	.
O	So
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	if
O	the
O	king
O	married
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	,
O	this
O	would
O	cause
O	some
O	grief
O	and
O	hurt
O	to
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	.
O	But
O	King
O	Mark
O	cared
O	not
O	overmuch
O	whether
O	he
O	wedded
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	or
O	not
O	.
O	He
O	believed
O	that
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	would
O	of
O	a
O	surety
O	be
O	slain
O	by
O	the
O	kin
O	of
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	in
O	Ireland
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	if
O	so
O	,
O	King
O	Mark's
O	plot
O	would
O	succeed
O	to
O	the
O	full
O	.
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	sad
O	and
O	troubled
O	,
O	went
O	apart
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	into
O	a
O	forest
O	,
O	for
O	now
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	himself
O	an
O	ill

O	.
O	The

O	he
O	loved

O	he
O	had
O	now
O	promised
O	to
O	woo
O	for
O	another
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	rode
O	moodily
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	drive
O	,
O	a
O	knight
O	came
O	swiftly
O	riding
O	on
O	a
O	great
O	horse
O	,
O	its

O	.
O	'Fair

O	horse
O	reared
O	in

O	alighted

O	,

O	there
O	they
O	lashed
O	at

O	mighty
O	strokes
O	on

O	men

O	while
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	beat
O	not
O	so
O	many
O	false
O	blows
O	,
O	but
O	each
O	was
O	sure
O	,
O	though
O	slower
O	.
O	Yet
O	Sir
O	Blamor
O	would
O	not
O	rest
O	,

O	make
O	a
O	heavy
O	stroke
O	which
O	Sir

O	avoided
O	,
O	and
O	ere
O	the

O	could
O	recover
O	,
O	Sir
O	Tristram's
O	sword
O	descended
O	on
O	his
O	helm
O	with
O	so
O	great
O	a
O	stroke
O	that
O	Sir
O	Blamor
O	fell
O	upon
O	his
O	side
O	.
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	leaped
O	upon
O	him
O	and
O	placed
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	his
O	sword
O	between
O	the
O	bars
O	of
O	Sir
O	Blamor's
O	vizor
O	,
O	bidding
O	him
O	yield
O	.
O	When
O	Sir
O	Blamor
O	got
O	his
O	breath
O	he
O	panted
O	forth:
O	'Nay

O	of
O	the
O	judges
O	,
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	and
O	Sir
O	Bleobaris
O	took
O	up
O	Sir
O	Blamor;
O	and
O	the
O	two

O	each
O	other
O	and
O	swore
O	friendship
O	with
O	him
O	for
O	ever
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Blamor
O	and
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	kissed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	brothers
O	,
O	their
O	hands
O	clasping
O	those
O	of
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	swore
O	that
O	there
O	should
O	for
O	ever
O	be
O	peace
O	and
O	love
O	between

O	and
O	this
O	did
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	swear
O	also
O	.
O	Inasmuch
O	as
O	,
O	of
O	his
O	nobleness
O	and
O	generosity
O	,
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	would
O	not
O	take
O	Sir
O	Blamor's
O	life
O	because
O	he
O	refused
O	to
O	yield
O	him
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	kinsmen
O	loved
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	ever
O	his
O	friends
O	and
O	spoke
O	well
O	and
O	knightly
O	of
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	King
O	Anguish
O	and
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	took
O	their
O	leave
O	and
O	sailed
O	into
O	Ireland
O	with
O	great
O	joy;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	arrived
O	there
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	let
O	make
O	a
O	great
O	cry
O	throughout
O	his
O	dominions
O	,
O	of
O	the
O	manner
O	in
O	which
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	had
O	fought
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	for
O	that
O	deed
O	he
O	accounted
O	him
O	the
O	noblest
O	knight
O	among
O	his
O	friends
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	all
O	should
O	treat
O	him
O	with
O	friendship
O	and
O	no
O	deceit
O	.
O	When
O	,
O	also
O	,
O	the
O	queen
O	and
O	the
O	kin
O	of
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	heard
O	how
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	had
O	borne
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	trial
O	by
O	combat
O	,
O	they
O	agreed
O	that
O	now
O	they
O	should
O	not
O	seek
O	to
O	slay
O	him
O	,
O	since
O	his
O	great
O	help
O	in
O	this
O	matter
O	had
O	wiped
O	out
O	his
O	ill-doing
O	in
O	the
O	slaying
O	of
O	Sir
O	Marhaus
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	queen
O	and
O	the
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	and
O	the
O	common
O	people
O	made
O	much
O	of
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	wheresoever
O	he
O	went;
O	but
O	the
O	joy
O	that
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	had
O	in
O	her
O	heart
O	no
O	tongue
O	may
O	tell
O	.
O	When
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	was
O	led
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	they
O	met
O	after
O	so
O	long
O	an
O	absence
O	from
O	each
O	other
O	,
O	men
O	saw
O	the
O	lovely
O	face
O	light
O	up
O	with
O	so
O	sweet
O	and
O	high
O	a
O	look
O	that
O	they
O	marvelled
O	at
O	her
O	beauty
O	.
O	Yet
O	they
O	saw
O	how
O	straitly
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	held
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	not
O	much
O	of
O	his
O	meeting
O	with
O	her
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	seek
O	her
O	company
O	.
O	Then
O	on
O	a
O	day
O	King
O	Anguish
O	asked
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	boon
O	he
O	craved
O	.
O	'But
O	whatever
O	it
O	be
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'it
O	is
O	yours
O	without
O	fail
O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	Tristram's
O	face
O	went
O	hard
O	and
O	white
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	he
O	said:
O	'It
O	is
O	this
O	,
O	my
O	lord
O	.
O	I
O	bear
O	a
O	request
O	from
O	my
O	uncle
O	,
O	King
O	Mark
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	that
O	you
O	give
O	him
O	your
O	daughter
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	for
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	ye
O	let
O	me
O	take
O	her
O	unto
O	him
O	,
O	for
O	so
O	I
O	have
O	promised
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	'Alas
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	full
O	heavily
O	into
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	'I
O	had
O	liefer
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	land
O	that
O	I
O	have
O	that
O	ye
O	should
O	wed
O	her
O	yourself
O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	turned
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	this
O	reply:
O	'I
O	have
O	given
O	my
O	promise
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	were
O	ashamed
O	for

O	in
O	the
O	world
O	if
O	I
O	did
O	aught
O	else
O	.
O	I
O	require
O	you
O	to
O	hold
O	to

O	promise
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	let
O	your
O	daughter
O	depart
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	be
O	wedded
O	to
O	my

O	'As
O	I
O	have
O	promised
O	,
O	so
O	will
O	I
O	do
O	,

O	said
O	the
O	king
O	.
O	'But
O	I
O	let
O	you
O	know
O	'tis
O	with
O	a
O	heavy
O	heart

O	'
O	Nor
O	would
O	the
O	king
O	say
O	more
O	,
O	knowing
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	make
O	bad
O	worse
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	surprise
O	and
O	grief
O	of
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	,
O	when
O	she
O	knew
O	that
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	was
O	to
O	take
O	her
O	to
O	be
O	wife
O	not
O	unto
O	himself
O	but
O	to
O	a
O	stranger
O	,
O	what
O	tongue
O	may
O	tell
O	and
O	what
O	words
O	may
O	say
O	?
O	Nightly
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	days
O	when

O	wept
O	full
O	sorely
O	in
O	the
O	arms
O	of
O	her
O	mother
O	or
O	of
O	Bragwine
O	her
O	faithful
O	gentlewoman;
O	but
O	in
O	hall
O	or
O	abroad
O	she
O	was
O	ever
O	calm
O	and
O	cold
O	,
O	though
O	pale
O	.
O	The
O	queen
O	,
O	her
O	mother
O	,
O	feared
O	much
O	of
O	this
O	marriage
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	sent
O	a
O	swift
O	message
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	witch
O	who
O	dwelled
O	in
O	a
O	dark
O	wet
O	valley
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of

O	Purple
O	Hills
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	much
O	gold
O	a
O	potent
O	philtre
O	was
O	prepared
O	.
O	Then
O	,
O	on

O	and
O	giving
O	her
O	a
O	little
O	golden
O	flasket
O	,

O	Anon
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	and
O	La
O	Belle
O	Isoude
O	took
O	ship
O	and
O	got
O	to
O	sea
O	.
O	During
O	the
O	voyage
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	kept
O	himself
O	much
O	with
O	the

O	and
O	rarely
O	sat
O	with
O	Isoude;
O	for
O	in
O	his

O	was
O	much

O	more

O	loved
O	none

O	in
O	the

O	but
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	never

O	,
O	and
O	knowing
O	the

O	,
O	the

O	as

O	were
O	about

O	it
O	would

O	at
O	it
O	.
O	'Sure
O	this
O	is
O	the
O	best
O	wine
O	that
O	ever
O	I
O	drank
O	,

O	said
O	he
O	,
O	and
O	smiled
O	at
O	her
O	.
O	'It
O	is
O	truly
O	a
O	most
O	sweet
O	and
O	noble
O	drink
O	,

O	said
O	Isoude
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	heart
O	was
O	glad
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	smile
O	,
O	who
O	hitherto
O	had
O	kept
O	his
O	face
O	so
O	stern
O	.
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	called
O	his
O	squire
O	.
O	'Governale
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	'what
O	wine
O	is
O	this
O	thou
O	hast
O	given
O	us
O	this
O	day

O	Let
O	us
O	have
O	another
O	flask
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	.
O	'
O	Governale
O	was
O	ever
O	ill
O	at
O	a
O	deception
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	stammer
O	.
O	'My
O	lord
O	,
O	'
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	'I
O	fear
O	me
O	there
O	is
O	none
O	other
O	.
O	'
O	'Ah
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	his
O	master
O	,
O	'and
O	where
O	got
O	you
O	that
O	?
O	'
O	'The
O	gentlewoman
O	of
O	my
O	Lady
O	Isoude
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	'brought
O	it
O	and

O	it
O	in

O	'What
O	?

O	cried
O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	,
O	rising
O	angrily
O	.
O	'What

O	'Oh

O	,
O	forgive
O	me
O	,

O	cried
O	Governale
O	.
O	'But
O	we
O	saw
O	the
O	sorrow

O	But
O	Sir

O	would
O	hear

O	further
O	,
O	and
O	fiercely
O	sent

O	.
O	'Ah

O	The
O	gentle
O	sorrow
O	in
O	her
O	voice
O	caused
O	Sir
O	Tristram's
O	heart
O	to
O	swell
O	with
O	rage
O	because
O	he
O	had

O	King
O	Mark
O	.
O	'Lady

O	he
O	said
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	face
O	was
O	full
O	pitiful
O	and
O	pale
O	,
O	'Heaven

O	Sir
O	Tristram
O	gave
O	her
O	a
O	ring
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	gave
O	him
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	quickly
O	they
O	parted
O	,
O	lest
O	they
O	should
O	repent

O	That

O	they
O	got
O	to

O	of

O	led
O	up

O	gave
O	her

O	dwelt
O	on
O	the
O	noble
O	figure
O	of
O	Sir

O	.
O	Men
O	noticed
O	how
O	pale
O	and
O	stern
O	the
O	young
O	knight
O	seemed
O	,

O	that

O	said
O	few

O	.
O	In
O	a
