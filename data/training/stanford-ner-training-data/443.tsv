O	this

O	might
O	be
O	,
O	and
O	why
O	he
O	was
O	allowed
O	to
O	wander
O	at
O	will
O	on
O	his
O	lands
O	.
O	This

O	pulling
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	Mr

O	Bertram
O	at
O	once
O	exploded
O	into
O	a
O	long
O	catalogue
O	of
O	griefs
O	.
O	According
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	the
O	man
O	was
O	undoubtedly
O	one
O	Captain
O	Dirk
O	Hatteraick
O	,
O	a
O	smuggler
O	or
O	free-trader
O	.
O	As
O	for
O	allowing
O	him
O	on
O	his
O	lands--well
O	,
O	Dirk
O	was
O	not
O	very
O	canny
O	to
O	meddle
O	with
O	.
O	Besides
O	,
O	impossible
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	believe
O	,
O	he
O	,
O	Godfrey
O	Bertram
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	,
O	was
O	not
O	upon
O	his
O	Majesty's
O	commission
O	of
O	the
O	peace
O	for
O	the
O	county
O	.
O	Jealousy
O	had
O	kept
O	him
O	off--among
O	other
O	things
O	the
O	ill-will
O	of
O	the
O	sitting
O	member
O	.
O	Besides
O	which--after
O	all
O	a
O	gentleman
O	must
O	have
O	his
O	cognac
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	lady
O	her
O	tea
O	and
O	silks
O	.
O	Only
O	smuggled
O	articles
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	pity
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	more
O	to
O	blame
O	than
O	others
O	.
O	Thus
O	the
O	Laird
O	maundered
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	Mannering
O	,
O	glad
O	to
O	escape
O	being
O	asked
O	about
O	the
O	doubtful
O	fortune
O	which
O	the
O	stars
O	had
O	predicted
O	for
O	the
O	young
O	heir
O	,
O	did
O	not
O	interrupt
O	him
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	before
O	he
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	he
O	put
O	the
O	written
O	horoscope
O	into
O	a
O	sealed
O	envelope
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	strictly
O	charged
O	Bertram
O	that
O	it
O	should
O	not
O	be
O	opened
O	till
O	his
O	son
O	reached
O	the
O	age
O	of
O	five
O	years
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	departure
O	with
O	many
O	expressions
O	of
O	regret
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	five
O	years
O	were
O	outwardly
O	prosperous
O	ones
O	for
O	Godfrey
O	Bertram
O	of
O	Ellangowan
O	.
O	As
O	the
O	result
O	of
O	an
O	election
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	of
O	much
O	service
O	to
O	the
O	winning
O	candidate
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	again
O	made
O	a
O	Justice
O	of
O	the
O	Peace
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	he
O	set
O	about
O	proving
O	to
O	his
O	brothers
O	of
O	the
O	bench
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	be
O	both
O	a
O	determined
O	and
O	an
O	active
O	magistrate
O	.
O	But
O	this
O	apparent
O	good
O	,
O	brought
O	as
O	usual
O	much
O	of
O	evil
O	with
O	it
O	.
O	Many
O	old
O	kindly
O	customs
O	and
O	courtesies
O	had
O	endeared
O	Godfrey
O	Bertram
O	to
O	his
O	poorer
O	neighbours
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	,
O	they
O	said
O	,
O	no
O	man's
O	enemy
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	the
O	gipsies
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	settlement
O	would
O	have
O	cut
O	off
O	their
O	right
O	hands
O	before
O	they
O	touched
O	a
O	pennyworth
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
O	Laird
O	,
O	their
O	patron
O	and
O	protector
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	other
O	landlords
O	twitted
O	him
O	with
O	pretending
O	to
O	be
O	an
O	active
O	magistrate
O	,
O	and
O	yet
O	harbouring
O	a
O	gang
O	of
O	gipsies
O	at
O	his
O	own
O	door-cheek
O	.
O	Whereupon
O	the
O	Laird
O	went
O	slowly
O	and
O	somewhat
O	sadly
O	home
O	,
O	revolving
O	schemes
O	for
O	getting
O	rid
O	of
O	the

O	Merrilies

O	Occasions

O	The

O	The

O	imprisoned
O	for

O	,
O	and

O	went
O	so
