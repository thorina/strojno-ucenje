O	Flying
O	Squirrel
O	and
O	Lightning
O	Bow
O	were
O	two
O	little
O	Indian
O	boys
O	.
O	They
O	lived
O	by
O	Singing
O	River
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	played
O	from
O	sunrise
O	to
O	sunset
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	as
O	happy
O	as
O	the
O	day
O	was
O	long
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	summer
O	,
O	they
O	fished
O	and
O	swam
O	in
O	Singing
O	River
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	shot
O	their
O	arrows
O	into
O	chipmunk
O	and
O	woodpecker
O	holes
O	.
O	Sometimes
O	they
O	played
O	"""Dodging"

O	,

O	a
O	game
O	their
O	mother
O	had
O	taught
O	them
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	very
O	young
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	winter
O	,
O	they
O	jumped
O	into
O	fleecy
O	snowdrifts
O	and
O	rolled
O	until
O	their
O	little
O	bronze
O	bodies
O	took
O	on
O	a
O	red-raspberry
O	tint
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	would
O	send
O	their
O	snow-snakes
O	skimming
O	over
O	the
O	hard
O	crust
O	of
O	snow
O	.
O	Snow-snakes
O	were
O	small
O	rods
O	of
O	wood
O	,
O	polished
O	smooth
O	with
O	resin
O	,
O	oil
O	,
O	or
O	wax
O	.
O	They
O	could

O	long

O	.
O	Long
O	Moose--Lightning
O	Bow
O	and

O	a
O	mile
O	and
O	a
O	half
O	,
O	over
O	the
O	crust
O	of
O	the
O	snow
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	snow-snakes
O	he
O	used
O	were
O	eight
O	feet
O	long
O	and
O	tipped
O	with

O	.
O	It
O	was

O	One
