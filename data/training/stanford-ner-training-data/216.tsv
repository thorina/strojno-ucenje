O	My
O	desire
O	of
O	seeing
O	foreign
O	countries
O	rendered
O	my
O	pleasures
O	at
O	home
O	unsatisfactory
O	.
O	I
O	therefore
O	arranged
O	my
O	affairs
O	,
O	commenced
O	a
O	voyage
O	to
O	Persia
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	bought
O	a
O	large
O	stock
O	of
O	goods
O	loaded
O	a
O	ship
O	and
O	again
O	embarked
O	.
O	The
O	ship
O	struck
O	upon
O	a
O	rock
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	cargo
O	was
O	lost
O	.
O	A
O	few
O	others
O	and
O	myself
O	were
O	borne
O	by
O	the
O	current
O	to
O	an
O	island
O	,
O	on
O	which
O	we
O	were
O	surrounded
O	by
O	black
O	savages
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	to
O	their
O	huts
O	.
O	The
O	savages
O	offered
O	us
O	herbs;
O	my
O	companions
O	eagerly
O	took
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	hungry
O	.
O	Grief
O	would
O	not
O	allow
O	me
O	to
O	eat;
O	and
O	presently
O	I
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	herbs
O	had
O	made
O	my
O	comrades
O	senseless
O	.
O	Rice
O	,
O	mixed
O	with
O	oil
O	of
O	cocoanuts
O	,
O	was
O	then
O	offered
O	to
O	us
O	,
O	which
O	my
O	companions
O	ate
O	greedily
O	and
O	grew
O	fat
O	.
O	My
O	unhappy
O	friends
O	were
O	then
O	devoured
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	,
O	having
O	become
O	appetizing
O	to
O	the
O	cannibals
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	languished
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	think
O	me
O	fit
O	to
O	eat
O	.
O	They
O	left
O	me
O	to
O	the
O	care
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	from
O	whom
O	I
O	managed
O	to
O	escape;
O	and
O	taking
O	care
O	to
O	go
O	a
O	contrary
O	way
O	from
O	that
O	which
O	the
O	savages
O	had
O	taken
O	I
O	never
O	stopped
O	till
O	night
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	seven
O	days
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	seashore
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	white
O	persons
O	gathering
O	pepper
O	.
O	They
O	asked
O	me
O	in
O	Arabic
O	who
O	I
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	whence
O	I
O	came;
O	and
O	I
O	gave
O	them
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	shipwreck
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	my
O	escape
O	.
O	They
O	treated
O	me
O	kindly
O	and
O	presented
O	me
O	to
O	their
O	King
O	,
O	who
O	treated
O	me
O	with
O	great
O	liberality
O	.
O	During
O	my
O	stay
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	I
O	observed
O	that
O	when
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	his
O	nobles
O	went
O	hunting
O	,
O	they
O	rode
O	their
O	horses
O	without
O	bridle
O	or
O	saddle
O	.
O	With
O	the
O	assistance
O	of
O	some
O	workmen
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	bridle
O	and
O	saddle
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	put
O	them
O	upon
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	King's
O	horses
O	,
O	presented
O	the
O	animal
O	,
O	thus
O	equipped
O	,
O	to
O	His
O	Majesty
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	delighted
O	that
O	he
O	instantly
O	mounted
O	and
O	rode
O	about
O	the
O	grounds
O	almost
O	the
O	whole
O	day
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	ministers
O	of
O	state
O	and
O	the
O	nobility
O	induced
O	me
O	to
O	make
O	saddles
O	and
O	bridles
O	for
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	which
O	they
O	made
O	me
O	such
O	magnificent
O	presents
O	that
O	I
O	soon
O	became
O	very
O	rich
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	at
O	last
O	requested
O	that
O	I
O	would
O	marry
O	,
O	and
O	become
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	nation
O	.
O	From
O	a
O	variety
O	of
O	circumstances
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	refuse
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	therefore
O	gave
O	me
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	ladies
O	of
O	his
O	Court
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	young
O	,
O	rich
O	,
O	beautiful
O	,
O	and
O	virtuous
O	.
O	We
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	greatest
O	harmony
O	in
O	a
O	palace
O	belonging
O	to
O	my
O	wife
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	made
O	a
O	good
O	friend
O	of
O	a
O	very
O	worthy
O	man
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	this
O	place
O	.
O	Hearing
O	one
O	day
O	that
O	his
O	wife
O	had
O	just
O	died
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	to
O	condole
O	with
O	him
O	on
O	this
O	unexpected
O	calamity
O	.
O	We
O	were
O	alone
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	in
O	the
O	deepest
O	grief
O	.
O	After
O	I
O	had
O	talked
O	with
O	him
O	some
O	time
O	on
O	the
O	uselessness
O	of
O	so
O	much
O	sorrow
O	,
O	he
O	told
O	me
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	an
O	established
O	law
O	that
O	the
O	living
O	husband
O	should
O	be
O	buried
O	with
O	the
O	deceased
O	wife
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	within
O	an
O	hour
O	he
O	must
O	submit
O	.
O	I
O	shuddered
O	at
O	the
O	dreadful
O	custom
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	the
O	woman
O	was
O	attired
O	in
O	her
O	most
O	costly
O	dress
O	and
O	jewels
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	in
O	an
O	open
O	coffin
O	.
O	The
O	procession
O	then
O	began
O	,
O	the
O	husband
O	following
O	the
O	corpse
O	.
O	They
O	ascended
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	an
O	exceedingly
O	high
O	mountain
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	was
O	removed
O	,
O	which
O	covered
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	a
O	deep
O	pit
O	.
O	The
O	corpse
O	was
O	let
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	husband
O	,
O	having
O	taken
O	leave
O	of
O	his
O	friends
O	,
O	was
O	put
O	into
O	another
O	open
O	coffin
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	pot
O	of
O	water
O	and
O	seven
O	small
O	loaves
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	let
O	down
O	.
O	The
O	stone
O	was
O	replaced
O	and
O	they
O	all
O	returned
O	.
O	The
O	horror
O	of
O	this
O	was
O	still
O	fresh
O	upon
O	my
O	mind
O	,
O	when
O	my
O	wife
O	fell
O	sick
O	and
O	died
O	.
O	The
O	King
O	and
O	the
O	whole
O	Court
O	,
O	out
O	of
O	respect
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	instantly
O	prepared
O	to
O	assist
O	at
O	a
O	similar
O	ceremony
O	with
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	restrained
O	the
O	feeling
O	of
O	despair
O	until
O	we
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	fell
O	at
O	the
O	feet
O	of
O	the
O	King
O	and
O	begged
O	him
O	to
O	spare
O	my
O	life
O	.
O	All
O	I
O	said
O	was
O	ineffectual
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	my
O	wife
O	was
O	let
O	down
O	,
O	I
O	also
O	was
O	put
O	into
O	the
O	deep
O	pit
O	,
O	everyone
O	being
O	totally
O	indifferent
O	to
O	my
O	cries
O	and
O	lamentations
O	.
O	I
O	made
O	the
O	cave
O	echo
O	with
O	my
O	vain
O	complaints
O	.
O	I
O	lived
O	some
O	days
O	on
O	the
O	bread
O	and
O	water
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	put
O	into
O	my
O	coffin
O	,
O	but
O	this
O	supply
O	was
O	at
O	length
O	exhausted
O	.
O	I
O	then
O	wandered
O	to
O	a
O	remote
O	part
O	of
O	this
O	frightful
O	cave
O	and
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	prepare
O	for
O	death
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	thus
O	wishing
O	only
O	for
O	a
O	speedy
O	termination
O	of
O	my
O	misery
O	,
O	when
O	I
O	heard
O	something
O	walking
O	and
O	panting
O	.
O	I
O	started
O	up
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	the
O	thing
O	panted
O	still
O	more
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	ran
O	away
O	.
O	I
O	pursued
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	stop
O	,
O	but
O	on
O	my
O	approach
O	continued
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	before
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	pursued
O	it
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	last
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	glimmering
O	light
O	like
O	a
O	star
O	.
O	This
O	redoubled
O	my
O	eagerness
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	last
O	I
O	discovered
O	a
O	hole
O	large
O	enough
O	to
O	allow
O	my
O	escape
O	.
O	I
O	crept
O	through
O	the
O	aperture
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	myself
O	on
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	and
O	discovered
O	that
O	the
O	creature
O	was
O	a
O	sea
O	monster
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	accustomed
O	to
O	enter
O	at
O	that
O	hole
O	to
O	feed
O	upon
O	the
O	dead
O	bodies
O	.
O	Having
O	eaten
O	some
O	shellfish
O	,
O	I
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	cave
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	collected
O	all
O	the
O	jewels
O	I
O	could
O	find
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	.
O	These
O	I
O	carried
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	and
O	tied
O	them
O	up
O	very
O	neatly
O	into
O	bales
O	with
O	the
O	cords
O	that
O	let
O	down
O	the
O	coffins
O	.
O	I
O	laid
O	them
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	,
O	waiting
O	till
O	some
O	ship
O	should
O	pass
O	.
O	In
O	two
O	days
O	a
O	ship
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	harbor
O	,
O	and
O	passed
O	by
O	that
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	coast
O	.
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	signal
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	boat
O	took
O	me
O	on
O	board
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	say
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	wrecked;
O	for
O	,
O	had
O	they
O	known
O	my
O	real
O	story
O	,
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	carried
O	back
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	captain
O	was
O	a
O	native
O	of
O	this
O	country
O	.
O	We
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	islands
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	Kela
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	ship
O	ready
O	to
O	sail
O	for
O	Balsora;
O	and
O	having
O	presented
O	some
O	jewels
O	to
O	the
O	captain
O	who
O	had
O	brought
O	me
O	to
O	Kela
O	,
O	I
O	sailed
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	arrived
O	at
O	Bagdad
O	.
