O	There
O	was
O	once
O	a
O	prince
O	who
O	wanted
O	to
O	marry
O	a
O	princess;
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	_real_
O	princess
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	travelled
O	about
O	,
O	all
O	through
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	real
O	one
O	,
O	but
O	everywhere
O	there
O	was
O	something
O	in
O	the
O	way
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	princesses
O	enough
O	,
O	but
O	whether
O	they
O	were
O	_real_
O	princesses
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	quite
O	make
O	out:
O	there
O	was
O	always
O	something
O	that
O	did
O	not
O	seem
O	quite
O	right
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	came
O	home
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	quite
O	sad:
O	for
O	he
O	wished
O	so
O	much
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	real
O	princess
O	.
O	One
O	evening
O	a
O	terrible
O	storm
O	came
O	on
O	.
O	It
O	lightened
O	and
O	thundered
O	,
O	the
O	rain
O	streamed
O	down;
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	fearful
O	!
O	Then
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	knocking
O	at
O	the
O	town
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	king
O	went
O	out
O	to
O	open
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	princess
O	who
O	stood
O	outside
O	the
O	gate
O	.
O	But
O	,
O	mercy
O	!
O	how
O	she
O	looked
O	,
O	from
O	the
O	rain
O	and
O	the
O	rough
O	weather
O	!
O	The
O	water
O	ran
O	down
O	from
O	her
O	hair
O	and
O	her
O	clothes;
O	it
O	ran
O	in
O	at
O	the
O	points
O	of
O	her
O	shoes
O	,
O	and
O	out
O	at
O	the
O	heels;
O	and
O	yet
O	she
O	declared
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	real
O	princess
O	.
O	"""Yes"
O	,
O	we
O	will
O	soon
O	find
O	that
O	out
O	,
O	""""
O	thought
O	the
O	old
O	queen
O	.
O	But
O	she
O	said
O	nothing
O	,
O	only
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	bedchamber
O	,
O	took
O	all
O	the
O	bedding
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	a
O	pea
O	on
O	the
O	flooring
O	of
O	the
O	bedstead;
O	then
O	she
O	took
O	twenty
O	mattresses
O	and
O	laid
O	them
O	upon
O	the
O	pea
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	twenty
O	eider-down
O	beds
O	upon
O	the
O	mattresses
O	.
O	On
O	this
O	the
O	princess
O	had
O	to
O	lie
O	all
O	night
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	she
O	was
O	asked
O	how
O	she
O	had
O	slept
O	.
O	"""Oh"
O	,
O	miserably
O	!
O	""""
O	said
O	the
O	princess
O	.
O	"""I"
O	scarcely
O	closed
O	my
O	eyes
O	all
O	night
O	long
O	.
O	Goodness
O	knows
O	what
O	was
O	in
O	my
O	bed
O	.
O	I
O	lay
O	upon
O	something
O	hard
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	black
O	and
O	blue
O	all
O	over
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	quite
O	dreadful
O	!
O	""""
O	Now
O	they
O	saw
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	real
O	princess
O	,
O	for
O	through
O	the
O	twenty
O	mattresses
O	and
O	the
O	twenty
O	eider-down

O	No
O	one
O	but
O	a
O	real
O	princess
O	could
O	be
O	so
O	delicate
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	prince
O	took
O	her
O	for
O	his
O	wife
O	,
O	for
O	now
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	true
O	princess;
O	and
O	the
O	pea
O	was
O	put
O	in
O	the
O	museum
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	there
O	now
O	,
O	unless
O	somebody
O	has
O	carried
O	it
O	off
