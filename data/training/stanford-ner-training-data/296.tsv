O	joust

O	which

O	at
O	Camelot
O	fifteen
O	days
O	after
O	the
O	Feast
O	of
O	the
O	Assumption
O	.
O	The
O	noise
O	of
O	it
O	went
O	forth
O	throughout
O	all
O	the
O	king
O	'

O	,
O	and
O	knights

O	,
O	made
O	haste
O	to
O	get
O	them
O	ready
O	to
O	go
O	thither
O	.
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	had
O	but
O	lately
O	been
O	sore
O	wounded
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	the
O	king
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	hope
O	to
O	be
O	at
O	the
O	joust
O	,
O	for
O	fear
O	that
O	his
O	wound
O	might
O	break
O	forth
O	afresh
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	was
O	much
O	aggrieved
O	thereat
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	fain
O	have
O	made
O	proclamation
O	to
O	put
O	off
O	the
O	joust
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	many
O	knights
O	were
O	already
O	set
O	forth
O	from
O	distant
O	places
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	would
O	be
O	the
O	disappointment
O	.
O	Therefore
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	day
O	that
O	the
O	king
O	was
O	to
O	journey
O	from
O	London
O	to
O	Camelot
O	,
O	he
O	set
O	forth
O	with
O	a
O	heavy
O	heart
O	.
O	For
O	though
O	he
O	knew
O	there
O	would
O	be
O	many
O	a
O	brave
O	onfall
O	and
O	stout
O	bickering
O	,
O	yet
O	,
O	as
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	had
O	become
O	the
O	most
O	valiant
O	knight
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	Britain
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	greatly
O	desired
O	that
O	the
O	knight
O	should
O	show
O	how
O	he
O	excelled
O	all
O	the
O	doughty
O	warriors
O	that
O	would
O	come
O	from
O	all
O	parts
O	.
O	When
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	had
O	gone
O	from
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	palace
O	in
O	London
O	,

O	chatter
O	of
O	the
O	ladies
O	and
O	the
O	tricks
O	of
O	the
O	pages
O	became
O	irksome
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	how
O	gay
O	must
O	be
O	the
O	company
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	Round

O	towards
O	Camelot
O	,
O	with

O	I
O	will

O	said
O	to
O	himself

O	give
O	me

O	.
O	For
O	I
O	cannot

O	that
O	I
O	stay
O	here
O	like

O	hound
O	,
O	while

O	'
O	So
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	betook

O	to
O	the
O	lodging
O	of
O	Morgan
O	Todd
O	,
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	physician
O	,
O	but
O	found
O	that

O	gone
O	with
O	the

O	.
O	When
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	was
O	turning
O	away
O	,
O	sore
O	aggrieved

O	angry
O	,
O	the
O	man
O	that
O	had
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	to

O	cried:

O	Sir

O	He
O	saw

O	,
O	and

O	a
O	lodging

O	which
O	was
O	freely
O	and
O	most
O	courteously
O	granted
O	unto
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	baron
O	was
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	of
O	reverend
O	aspect
O	,
O	named
O	Sir
O	Bernard

O	he
O	welcomed
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	warmly
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	knew
O	him
O	not
O	.
O	At
O	meat
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	very
O	merry
O	,

O	Elaine

O	Fair
O	,

O	she
O	was

O	Neither
O	she

O	Lancelot

O	At

O	one
O	that

O	Then
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	young
O	Sir
O	Lavaine
O	rode
O	forth
O	,
O	each
O	bearing
O	a
O	white
O	shield
O	,
O	as

O	both
O	were
O	young
O	knights
O	who
O	had
O	not
O	yet
O	done
O	some
O	deed
O	,
O	in

O	whereof
O	they
O	could
O	blazon
O	a
O	device
O	upon
O	their
O	shields
O	.
O	So
O	they
O	rode
O	to
O	Camelot
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	narrow
O	streets
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	town
O	packed
O	with
O	the
O	press
O	of
O	knights
O	,
O	dukes
O	,
O	earls
O	and
O	barons
O	come
O	to
O	take
O	part
O	in
O	the
O	jousts
O	.
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	got
O	them
O	lodgings
O	with
O	a
O	rich
O	burgess
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	privily
O	and
O	closely
O	did
O	they
O	keep
O	the
O	house
O	that
O	none
O	knew
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	there
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	day
O	of
O	the
O	jousts
O	the
O	trumpets
O	began
O	to
O	blow
O	in
O	the
O	field
O	where
O	they
O	should
O	be
O	held
O	.
O	King
O	Arthur
O	sat
O	on
O	a
O	great
O	scaffold
O	which
O	was
O	raised
O	at
O	one
O	end
O	,
O	to
O	judge
O	who
O	did
O	best
O	in
O	the
O	jousting
O	.
O	So
O	great
O	was
O	the
O	press
O	of
O	folk
O	,
O	both
O	noble
O	and
O	common
O	,
O	earls
O	and
O	chiefs
O	,
O	that
O	many
O	did
O	marvel
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	the
O	realm
O	of
O	Britain
O	held
O	so
O	many
O	people
O	.
O	The
O	knights
O	held
O	themselves
O	in
O	two
O	parties
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	either
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	lists
O	.
O	Some
O	called
O	themselves
O	the
O	band
O	of
O	Arthur
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	fight
O	all
O	comers;
O	and
O	among
O	them
O	was
O	Sir
O	Palomides
O	,
O	Sir
O	Conn
O	of
O	Ireland
O	,
O	Sir
O	Sagramore
O	,
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	the
O	seneschal
O	,
O	Sir
O	Griflet
O	,
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gallernon
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Saffre
O	,
O	all
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	were
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Northgales
O	,
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Swordlands
O	,
O	Sir
O	Galahalt
O	the
O	Proud
O	,
O	and
O	other
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	north
O	.
O	These
O	were
O	the
O	smaller
O	party
O	,
O	yet
O	were
O	they
O	very
O	valiant
O	knights
O	.
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	made
O	him
O	ready
O	with
O	the
O	others
O	,
O	and
O	fashioned
O	the
O	red
O	sleeve
O	upon
O	his
O	helm
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	his
O	mind
O	to
O	see
O	which
O	party
O	fared
O	the
O	worse
O	before
O	he
O	would
O	choose
O	his
O	part;
O	for
O	ever
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	liked
O	a
O	task
O	which
O	was
O	not
O	easy
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	rode
O	forth
O	with
O	Sir
O	Lavaine
O	into
O	a
O	little
O	wood
O	upon
O	a
O	knoll
O	,
O	whence
O	they
O	could
O	look
O	into
O	the
O	lists
O	and
O	see
O	the
O	knights
O	hurtle
O	and
O	crash
O	together
O	.
O	Soon
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	knights
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	band
O	come
O	against
O	the
O	northern
O	knights
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	latter
O	were
O	smitten
O	down
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	saw
O	how
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	the
O	Northgales
O	and
O	the
O	King
O	of
O	Swordlands
O	with
O	a
O	few
O	knights
O	made
O	a
O	bold
O	and
O	brave
O	stand
O	against
O	the
O	many
O	knights
O	of
O	King
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	Round
O	Table
O	.
O	'
O	See
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	to
O	Sir
O	Lavaine
O	,
O	'
O	how
O	that
O	company
O	of
O	knights
O	hold
O	out
O	against
O	that
O	great
O	press
O	!
O	They
O	are
O	like
O	brave
O	boars
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
O	hounds
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Ye
O	say
O	truth
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Lavaine;
O	'
O	they
O	are
O	indeed
O	brave
O	souls
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Now
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	'
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	help
O	me
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	you
O	may
O	see
O	that
O	great
O	company
O	go
O	back
O	more
O	quickly
O	than
O	they
O	came
O	forward
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Sir
O	,

O	not
O	,

O	I
O	will
O	do
O	what

O	may
O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	spurred
O	forward
O	into
O	the
O	lists
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	fierce
O	was
O	his
O	onslaught
O	and
O	so
O	hard
O	was
O	his
O	blow
O	that
O	with
O	one
O	spear
O	he
O	overthrew
O	Sir
O	Sagramore
O	,
O	Sir
O	Kay
O	,
O	Sir
O	Griflet
O	and
O	Sir
O	Saffre
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	another
O	spear
O	he
O	smote
O	down
O	five
O	others
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	the
O	northern
O	knights
O	were
O	much
O	comforted
O	,
O	and
O	greeted
O	the
O	strange
O	knight
O	full
O	courteously
O	,
O	though
O	they
O	wondered
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	but
O	a
O	white
O	shield
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	band
O	of
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	knights
O	took
O	counsel
O	and
O	gathered
O	together
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	,
O	Sir
O	Ector
O	de
O	Maris
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lionel
O	,
O	Sir
O	Blamore
O	and
O	five
O	others
O	.
O	These
O	were
O	all
O	mighty
O	knights
O	and
O	all
O	were
O	great
O	fighters
O	and
O	close
O	kin
O	to
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	.
O	They
O	resolved
O	to
O	rebuke
O	the
O	two
O	stranger
O	knights
O	with
O	white
O	shields
O	whom
O	they
O	knew
O	not;

O	him
O	with
O	the
O	lady
O	'

O	sleeve
O	upon
O	his
O	helm
O	did
O	they
O	seek
O	to

O	to
O	the
O	dust
O	.
O	Again
O	the
O	knights
O	hurtled
O	mightily
O	together

O	and
O	Sir
O	Bors

O	so
O	great
O	was
O	their
O	force
O	that
O	they
O	smote

O	pierced
O	through

O	into

O	side
O	,

O	the
O	lance
O	broke
O	off
O	and
O	remained
O	in
O	the
O	wound
O	.
O	Then
O	Sir
O	Lavaine
O	,
O	seeing
O	his
O	friend
O	prone
O	,
O	did
O	mightily
O	assault
O	Sir
O	Mordred
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side

O	Sir
O	Mordred

O	s
O	horse
O	to

O	helped

O	to

O	Sir

O	was
O	exceeding
O	wroth
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	a
O	great
O	strong
O	spear
O	,

O	depart
O	,
O	I
O	pray
O	you
O	.
O	For
O	I
O	have
O	bought
O	my
O	victory
O	with
O	my
O	life;
O	and
O	now
O	I
O	would
O	rather
O	have
O	quiet
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	wealth
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	'
O	Forthwith
O	he
O	galloped
O	away
O	with
O	Sir
O	Lavaine
O	until
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	forest;
O	and
O	then
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	groaned
O	and
O	said
O	he
O	could
O	no
O	further
O	go
O	,
O	and
O	forthwith
O	he
O	fell
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	swoon
O	.
O	Sir
O	Lavaine
O	went
O	to
O	find
O	water
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	to
O	go
O	far
O	ere
O	he
O	found
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	presently
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	clearing
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	hermitage
O	and
O	a
O	stream
O	running
O	by
O	.
O	Sir
O	Lavaine
O	called
O	the
O	hermit
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	full
O	reverend
O	and
O	noble
O	of
O	aspect
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	how
O	his
O	friend
O	lay
O	in
O	a
O	deathly
O	swoon
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	they
O	had
O	brought
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	to
O	the
O	hermitage
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	hermit
O	took
O	out
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	spear
O	and
O	bound
O	up
O	the
O	wound
O	and
O	gave
O	to
O	the
O	knight
O	a
O	strong
O	cordial
O	.
O	Anon
O	he
O	was
O	refreshed
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	senses
O	again
O	.
O	At
O	the
O	lodging
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	in
O	Camelot
O	,
O	men
O	spoke
O	of
O	the
O	jousts
O	,
O	and
O	wondered
O	who
O	might
O	be
O	the
O	knight
O	who
O	had
O	won
O	the
O	prize
O	and
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	injured
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	northern
O	knights
O	had
O	reported
O	.
O	Though
O	King
O	Arthur
O	had
O	it
O	in
O	his
O	mind
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	he
O	hoped
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	grieved
O	him
O	much
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	was
O	so
O	badly
O	wounded
O	.
O	Next
O	day
O	the
O	court
O	journeyed
O	towards
O	London
O	,
O	and
O	rested
O	for
O	the
O	night
O	at
O	Astolat;
O	and
O	the
O	town
O	being
O	full
O	,
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	manor
O	of
O	Sir
O	Bernard
O	,
O	which
O	lay
O	just
O	outside
O	the
O	city
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	dined
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	knight
O	Sir
O	Bernard
O	began
O	to
O	speak
O	to
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	ask
O	who
O	had
O	done
O	the
O	best
O	at
O	the
O	jousts
O	at
O	Camelot
O	.
O	Ever
O	since
O	he
O	had
O	arrived
O	,
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	had
O	seen
O	how
O	the
O	fair
O	girl
O	,
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	the
O	knight
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	attended
O	upon
O	him
O	,
O	was
O	pale
O	and
O	thoughtful;
O	and
O	now
O	she
O	looked
O	white
O	and
O	red
O	by
O	turns
O	as
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	speak
O	.
O	'
O	There
O	were
O	two
O	knights
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	'
O	who
O	each
O	bore
O	a
O	white
O	shield
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	had
O	a
O	red
O	sleeve
O	upon
O	his
O	helmet
O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	saw
O	how
O	the
O	damsel
O	clasped
O	her
O	hands
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	face
O	lit
O	up
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	light
O	and
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	bright
O	and
O	proud
O	.
O	'
O	And
O	I
O	swear
O	that
O	never
O	saw
O	I
O	so
O	valiant
O	and
O	stout
O	a
O	knight
O	as
O	he
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	.
O	'
O	For
O	I
O	dare
O	swear
O	that
O	he
O	beat
O	down
O	twenty
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	fellow
O	also
O	did
O	well
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Now
O	,
O	blessed
O	be
O	God
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	fair
O	maid
O	of
O	Astolat
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	cry
O	of
O	joy
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	the
O	good
O	knight
O	sped
O	so
O	well;
O	for
O	he
O	is
O	the
O	one
O	man
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	whom
O	I
O	have
O	ever
O	loved
O	,
O	and
O	truly
O	he
O	shall
O	be
O	the
O	last
O	man
O	that
O	ever
O	after
O	I
O	shall
O	love
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Then
O	do
O	ye
O	know
O	his
O	name
O	?
O	'
O	asked
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	.
O	'
O	Nay
O	,
O	I
O	know
O	it
O	not
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Elaine
O	,
O	'
O	nor
O	whence
O	he
O	came
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	know
O	that
O	I
O	love
O	him
O	and
O	none
O	other
O	.
O	'
O	Then
O	they
O	told
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	how
O	they
O	had
O	first
O	had
O	knowledge
O	of
O	the
O	strange
O	knight;
O	and
O	the
O	damsel
O	said
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	her
O	his
O	shield
O	in
O	place
O	of
O	the
O	white
O	one
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	none
O	should
O	know
O	him
O	.
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	begged
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	fetch
O	it
O	from
O	her
O	chamber
O	.
O	Elaine
O	brought
O	it
O	and
O	drew
O	it
O	from
O	the
O	case
O	of
O	leather
O	in
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	wrapped
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	said
O	,
O	'
O	See
O	,
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	spot
O	of

O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Alas
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Gawaine
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	device
O	upon
O	the
O	shield
O	,
O	'
O	now

O	cried
O	Elaine
O	,

O	stood
O	pale
O	and
O	breathless
O	.

O	asked
O	Gawaine
O	.
O	'
O	Yes

O	the
O	maiden
O	,

O	;
O	and
O	then
O	sadly
O	she
O	said
O	,
O	'

O	would
O	that

O	'
O	How

O	'
O	So
O	thought
O	me
O	ever
O	,

O	said
O	the
O	maid
O	of
O	Astolat
O	,
O	proudly
O	smiling;
O	'
O	for
O	never

O	'
O	And
O	never

O	At
O	these

O	the

O	She
O	spurred
O	her
O	horse
O	eagerly
O	,
O	and
O	rode
O	towards
O	Sir
O	Lavaine
O	,
O	crying
O	with
O	a
O	loud
O	voice:
O	'
O	Lavaine

O	Her
O	brother
O	came
O	forward
O	,
O	rejoicing
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	asked
O	how
O	she
O	had
O	learned
O	that
O	the
O	stranger
O	knight
O	was
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,

O	she
O	told
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	My

O	been
O	wandering
O	and
O	distraught
O	in

O	.
O	But
O	now
O	he
O	is
O	better
O	.

O	'
O	It
O	pleaseth
O	me
O	greatly
O	to
O	hear
O	that
O	,

O	said
O	Elaine
O	.
O	When
O	Sir
O	Lavaine
O	took
O	her
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	where
O	lay
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	so
O	sick
O	and
O	pale
O	in
O	his
O	bed
O	,
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	speak
O	,
O	but
O	suddenly
O	fell
O	in
O	a
O	swoon
O	.
O	And
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	her
O	senses
O	again
O	she
O	sighed
O	and
O	said:

O	'
O	Therewith
O	she
O	almost
O	swooned
O	again
O	.
O	But
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	prayed
O	Sir
O	Lavaine
O	to
O	take
O	her
O	up
O	and
O	bring
O	her
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	herself
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	kissed
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	said:
O	'
O	Fair

O	.

O	,

O	the

O	,

O	but
O	I
O	marvel
O	how
O	ye
O	knew
O	my

O	?
O	'
O	'
O	It
O	was
O	by
O	Sir

O	for
O	he
O	lodged
O	at
O	my

O	saw
O	your

O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	'
O	s

O	,
O	for

O	foreboded
O	sorrow
O	from

O	.
O	Afterwards
O	the
O	maid
O	Elaine
O	never
O	went
O	from
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	but
O	watched
O	him
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	,
O	and
O	gave
O	such
O	comfort
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	never
O	woman
O	did
O	more
O	kindly
O	nurse
O	a
O	wounded
O	man
O	than
O	she
O	.
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	was
O	full
O	courteous

O	turn
O	,
O	never
O	giving
O	more
O	trouble
O	than
O	he
O	could
O	avoid;
O	both
O	were
O	of
O	good
O	cheer
O	and
O	merry
O	together
O	,
O	for
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	deemed
O	not
O	as
O	yet
O	that
O	the
O	maid
O	loved
O	him
O	deeply
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	maid
O	was
O	glad

O	to
O	do

O	all
O	the
O	service
O	that

O	could
O	.
O	Then
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	came
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	,
O	the
O	knight
O	who
O	had
O	wounded
O	Sir

O	,
O	who
O	was
O	also
O	his

O	But
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	prayed
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	grieve
O	,
O	and
O	said:

O	away
O	.
O	In
O	four
O	or
O	five
O	days
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	plot

O	weary
O	of
O	being
O	here
O	,

O	said
O	Sir

O	,
O	'
O	and
O	I
O	would

O	forth
O	again
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Ah
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	the
O	hermit
O	,
O	'
O	your
O	heart

O	your
O	courage
O	will
O	never
O	be
O	done
O	till
O	your
O	last
O	day
O	.
O	But
O	now
O	ye
O	must
O	do
O	as
O	I
O	command
O	,
O	and
O	stay
O	till
O	I
O	say
O	ye
O	are
O	hale
O	again
O	.
O	'
O	Soon
O	after
O	this
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	departed
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	hermit
O	promised
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	came
O	back
O	in
O	a
O	month
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	would
O	be
O	ready
O	to
O	depart
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	Thus
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	stayed
O	in
O	the
O	hermitage
O	,
O	and
O	ever
O	did
O	the
O	fair
O	maid
O	Elaine
O	labour
O	with
O	diligence
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	to
O	heal
O	and
O	comfort
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	time
O	from
O	wearying
O	him
O	.
O	And
O	never
O	was
O	child
O	meeker
O	to
O	her
O	parent
O	,
O	nor
O	wife
O	kinder
O	to
O	her
O	husband
O	,
O	nor
O	mother
O	sweeter
O	and
O	more
O	tender
O	to
O	her
O	child
O	,
O	than
O	Elaine
O	was
O	to
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	.
O	The
O	knight
O	sorrowed
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	so;
O	and
O	he
O	ever
O	bore
O	himself
O	courteous
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	familiar
O	in
O	speech
O	,
O	for
O	it
O	grieved
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	love
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	for
O	her
O	,
O	however
O	deep
O	might
O	be
O	her
O	love
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	month
O	was
O	over
O	,
O	Sir
O	Bors
O	returned
O	and
O	found
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	walking
O	about
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	hale
O	and
O	strong
O	again
O	and
O	eager
O	to
O	be
O	riding
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	day
O	they
O	all
O	made
O	them
O	ready
O	to
O	depart
O	from
O	the
O	hermit
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	King
O	Arthur
O	'
O	s
O	court
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	then
O	in
O	London
O	.
O	The
O	Lily
O	Maid
O	went
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	sad
O	that
O	all
O	her
O	loving
O	care
O	was
O	now
O	ending
O	,
O	but
O	glad
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	noble
O	air
O	with
O	which
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	bestrode
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	thankful
O	that
O	sometimes
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	rode
O	upon
O	their
O	way
O	,
O	he
O	turned
O	to
O	her
O	smiling
O	gravely
O	,
O	and
O	spoke
O	of
O	the
O	bright
O	sunlight
O	,
O	the
O	birds
O	and
O	trees
O	they
O	saw
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	company
O	and
O	travellers
O	they
O	passed
O	.
O	Then
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	Astolat
O	,
O	and
O	Sir
O	Bernard
O	gave
O	them
O	all
O	great
O	welcome
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	well
O	feasted
O	and
O	well
O	lodged
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	morrow
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	should
O	depart
O	,
O	the
O	maid
O	Elaine
O	was
O	pale
O	and
O	very
O	quiet
O	,
O	until
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	hall
O	to
O	say
O	farewell
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	maid
O	,
O	bringing
O	her
O	father
O	and
O	her
O	two
O	brothers
O	with
O	her
O	,
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	and
O	said:
O	'
O	My
O	lord
O	,
O	now
O	I

O	But
O	oh
O	,
O	do
O	thou
O	have
O	mercy
O	upon
O	me
O	,
O	for
O	I

O	to
O	say

O	'
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	with
O	grave
O	sad
O	face
O	looked
O	at
O	her
O	and
O	knew
O	what
O	she
O	would
O	say
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	very
O	heaviness
O	of
O	spirit
O	replied:
O	'
O	Lady
O	,
O	it
O	grieves
O	me

O	cried
O	Elaine
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	most
O	piteously
O	and
O	wanly
O	upon
O	him
O	.
O	'
O	Oh

O	lay
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	slept
O	.
O	The
O	king
O	took
O	the
O	letter
O	gently
O	from
O	the
O	fair
O	hand
O	which
O	held
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	his
O	court
O	,
O	and
O	ordered
O	all
O	his
O	knights
O	to
O	assemble
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	opened
O	the
O	letter
O	and
O	read
O	what
O	was
O	written
O	.
O	The
O	words
O	were
O	these:
O	'
O	Most
O	noble
O	knight
O	,
O	my
O	lord
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	du
O	Lake

O	now
O	hath
O	death
O	come
O	to
O	me
O	,
O	seeing
O	that
O	you
O	would
O	not
O	give
O	me
O	your
O	love
O	.
O	Yet
O	do
O	thou
O	do
O	this
O	little
O	thing
O	I
O	ask
O	,
O	now
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	dead
O	,
O	for
O	I
O	ask
O	thee
O	to
O	pray
O	for
O	my
O	soul
O	and
O	to

O	me
O	,
O	and
O	think
O	of
O	me
O	sometimes
O	.
O	Pray
O	for
O	my
O	soul
O	and
O	think
O	of
O	me
O	,
O	as
O	thou
O	art
O	a
O	knight
O	peerless
O	and
O	most
O	gentle
O	.
O	'
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	heard
O	it
O	word
O	by
O	word
O	and
O	went
O	pale
O	as
O	ashes
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	men
O	marvelled
O	to
O	see
O	his
O	sorrow
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	finished
O	,
O	he
O	said:
O	'
O	My
O	lord
O	,
O	King
O	Arthur
O	,
O	wit
O	ye
O	well
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	right
O	heavy
O	for
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	this
O	fair
O	damsel
O	.
O	God
O	knoweth
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	never
O	causer
O	of
O	her
O	death
O	by
O	my
O	will
O	,
O	as
O	her
O	brother
O	Sir
O	Lavaine
O	here
O	will
O	avouch
O	for
O	me
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	both
O	fair
O	and
O	good
O	,
O	and
O	exceeding
O	kind
O	to
O	me
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	wounded;
O	but
O	she
O	loved
O	me
O	out
O	of
O	all
O	measure
O	,

O	of
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	sore
O	heavy
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Ye
O	might
O	have
O	loved
O	her
O	,

O	said
O	the
O	queen
O	,
O	weeping
O	for
O	sorrow
O	at
O	the
O	hapless
O	fate
O	of
O	one
O	so
O	fair
O	and
O	fond
O	.
O	'
O	Madam
O	,
O	'
O	said
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	,
O	'
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	constrained
O	to
O	love
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	I
O	sorrow
O	for

O	death
O	exceedingly
O	.
O	'
O	'
O	Truth
O	it

O	said
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	'
O	that
O	love
O	is
O	free
O	and
O	never
O	will
O	be
O	forced
O	,
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	prayers
O	that
O	may
O	be
O	said
O	to
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	thou
O	wilt
O	of
O	thy
O	worship
O	bury
O	this
O	fair
O	maid
O	,
O	Sir
O	Lancelot
O	?
O	'
O	'
O	That
O	will
O	I
O	do

O	,

O	and
O	in
O	all
O	richness
O	and
O	solemnity
O	.
O	'
O	Thus
O	was
O	it
O	done
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	sorrowfully
O	followed
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	fair
O	Elaine
O	to
O	the
O	grave
O	.
O	On
O	her
O	tomb
O	in
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	both
O	thick
O	and
O	deep
O	were
O	set
O	the
O	words:
