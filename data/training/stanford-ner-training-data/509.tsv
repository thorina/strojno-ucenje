O	A

O	of
O	the

O	to
O	the
O	high
O	King
O	of
O	Erin
O	,
O	set
O	out
O	from
O	Tara
O	to
O	the
O	chase
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	was
O	leaving
O	the
O	palace
O	the
O	light
O	mists
O	were
O	drifting
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	hill-tops
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	rays
O	of
O	the
O	morning
O	sun
O	were
O	falling
O	aslant
O	on
O	the
O	_grinan_
O	or
O	sunny
O	bower
O	of
O	the
O	Princess

O	.
O	Glancing
O	towards
O	it
O	the
O	prince
O	doffed
O	his
O	plumed
O	and
O	jeweled
O	hunting-cap
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	princess
O	answered
O	his
O	salute
O	by
O	a
O	wave
O	of
O	her
O	little
O	hand
O	,
O	that
O	was
O	as
O	white
O	as
O	a
O	wild
O	rose
O	in
O	the
O	hedges
O	in
O	June
O	,
O	and
O	leaning
O	from
O	her
O	bower
O	,
O	she
O	watched
O	the
O	huntsman
O	until
O	his
O	tossing
O	plumes
O	were
O	hidden
O	by
O	the
O	green
O	waving
O	branches
O	of
O	the
O	woods
O	.
O	The
O	Princess
O	Ailinn
O	was
O	over
O	head
O	and
O	ears
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	Cuglas
O	,
O	and
O	Cuglas
O	was
O	over
O	head
O	and
O	ears
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	the
O	Princess
O	Ailinn
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	believed
O	that
O	never
O	was
O	summer
O	morning
O	half
O	as
O	bright
O	,
O	or
O	as
O	sweet
O	,
O	or
O	as
O	fair
O	as
O	she
O	.
O	The
O	glimpse
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	just
O	caught
O	of
O	her
O	filled
O	his
O	heart
O	with
O	delight
O	,
O	and
O	almost
O	put
O	all
O	thought
O	of
O	hunting
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	when
O	suddenly
O	the
O	tuneful
O	cries
O	of
O	the
O	hounds
O	,
O	answered
O	by
O	a
O	hundred
O	echoes
O	from
O	the
O	groves
O	,
O	broke
O	upon
O	his
O	ear
O	.
O	The
O	dogs
O	had
O	started
O	a
O	dappled
O	deer
O	that
O	bounded
O	away
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	The
O	prince
O	,
O	spurring
O	his
O	gallant
O	steed
O	,
O	pushed
O	on
O	in
O	eager
O	pursuit
O	.
O	On
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	sped
O	the
O	deer
O	,
O	through
O	soft
O	,
O	green
O	,
O	secret
O	ways
O	and
O	flowery
O	dells
O	,
O	then
O	out
O	from
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	up
O	heathery
O	hills
O	,
O	and
O	over
O	long
O	stretches
O	of
O	moorland
O	,
O	and
O	across
O	brown
O	rushing
O	streams
O	,
O	sometimes
O	in
O	view
O	of
O	the
O	hounds
O	,
O	sometimes
O	lost
O	to
O	sight
O	,
O	but
O	always
O	ahead
O	of
O	them
O	.
O	All
O	day
O	long
O	the
O	chase
O	continued
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	sinking
O	,
O	the
O	dogs
O	were
O	close
O	upon
O	the
O	panting
O	deer
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	prince
O	believed
O	he
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	secure
O	his
O	game
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	deer
O	suddenly
O	disappeared
O	through
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	a
O	cave
O	which
O	opened
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	dogs
O	followed
O	at
O	his
O	heels
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	prince
O	endeavored
O	to
O	rein
O	in
O	his
O	steed
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	impetuous
O	animal
O	bore
O	him
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	was
O	clattering
O	over
O	the
O	stony
O	floor
O	of
O	the
O	cave
O	in
O	perfect
O	darkness
O	.
O	Cuglas
O	could
O	hear
O	ahead
O	of
O	him
O	the
O	cries
O	of
O	the
O	hounds
O	growing
O	fainter
O	and
O	fainter
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	increased
O	the
O	distance
O	between
O	them
O	and
O	him
O	.
O	Then
O	the
O	cries
O	ceased
O	altogether
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	only
O	sound
O	the
O	prince
O	heard
O	was
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	his
O	horse's
O	hoofs
O	sounding
O	in
O	the
O	hollow
O	cave
O	.
O	Once
O	more
O	he
O	endeavored
O	to
O	check
O	his
O	career
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	reins
O	broke
O	in
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	that
O	instant
O	the
O	prince
O	felt
O	the
O	horse
O	had
O	taken
O	a
O	plunge
O	into
O	a
O	gulf
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	sinking
O	down
O	and
O	down
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	stone
O	cast
O	from
O	the
O	summit
O	of
O	a
O	cliff
O	sinks
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	horse
O	struck
O	the
O	ground
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	prince
O	was
O	almost
O	thrown
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	saddle
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	succeeded
O	in
O	regaining
O	his
O	seat
O	.
O	Then
O	on
O	through
O	the
O	darkness
O	galloped
O	the
O	steed
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	light
O	the
O	prince's
O	eyes
O	were
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	unable
O	to
O	bear
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	he
O	got
O	used
O	to
O	the
O	brightness
O	he
O	saw
O	he
O	was
O	galloping
O	over
O	a
O	grassy
O	plain
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	he
O	perceived
O	the
O	hounds
O	rushing
O	towards
O	a
O	wood
O	faintly
O	visible
O	through
O	a
O	luminous
O	summer
O	haze
O	.
O	The
O	prince
O	galloped
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	approached
O	the
O	wood
O	he
O	saw
O	coming
O	towards
O	him
O	a
O	comely
O	champion
O	,
O	wearing
O	a
O	shining
O	brown

O	,
O	fastened
O	by
O	a
O	bright

O	died
O	away
O	,

O	ahead

O	a

O	the

O	The

O	In

O	pressed
O	their
O	clammy
O	hands
O	upon
O	his
O	face
O	.
O	With
O	a
O	yell
O	of
O	horror
O	he
O	drew
O	his

O	slashed
O	about

O	that

O	,

O	after
O	three

O	four

O	it
O	took

O	out
O	upon

O	.
O	He
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	set
O	foot
O	upon
O	the
O	desert
O	than
O	he
O	heard
O	behind

O	a
O	crashing
O	sound
O	louder
O	than
O	thunder
O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	around
O	,
O	and

O	saw

O	the
O	walls

O	he
O	had
O	just
O	passed

O	The

O	the

O	almost

O	cinders;
O	and
O	as
O	Cuglas
O	advanced
O	over
O	them
O	his

O	became
O	dried
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	tongue
O	clove
O	to
O	the
O	roof
O	of

O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	when

O	was
O	at

O	a

O	a
O	crystal

O	,

O	the
