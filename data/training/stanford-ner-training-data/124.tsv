O	Fourteen
O	years
O	only
O	have
O	passed
O	since
O	our
O	twentieth

O	In
O	those
O	fourteen
O	years
O	how
O	many
O	a
O	father
O	'
O	s
O	and
O	mother
O	'
O	s

O	has
O	bled
O	for
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	gallant
O	sons
O	,
O	greatly-promising
O	,
O	greatly-daring
O	,
O	who
O	have
O	sought
O	to

O	the

O	?
O	With

O	not
O	well
O	enough
O	tried
O	,
O	they
O	have
O	soared
O	dauntlessly
O	aloft
O	,
O	only
O	to

O	more

O	to
O	the
O	tragic
O	list
O	of
O	those

O	in

O	that
O	the

O	may
O	become

O	as

O	their

O	.
O	High
O	overhead
O	we
O	watch
O	the
O	monoplane
O	,
O	the
O	great
O	,
O	swooping
O	thing
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	monster
O	black-winged
O	bird
O	,
O	and
O	our
O	minds
O	travel
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	Icarus
O	,
O	who
O	died
O	so
O	many
O	years
O	ago
O	that
O	there
O	are
O	those
O	who
O	say
O	that
O	his
O	story
O	is
O	but
O	a
O	foolish
O	fable
O	,
O	an
O	idle
O	myth
O	.
O	Dædalus
O	,
O	grandson
O	of
O	a
O	king
O	of
O	Athens
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	greatest
O	artificer
O	of
O	his
O	day
O	.
O	Not
O	only
O	as
O	an
O	architect
O	was
O	he
O	great
O	,
O	but
O	as
O	a
O	sculptor
O	he
O	had
O	the
O	creative
O	power
O	,
O	not
O	only
O	to
O	make
O	men
O	and
O	women
O	and
O	animals
O	that
O	looked
O	alive
O	,
O	but
O	to
O	cause
O	them
O	to
O	move
O	and
O	to
O	be
O	,
O	to
O	all
O	appearances
O	,
O	endowed
O	with
O	life
O	.
O	To
O	him
O	the
O	artificers
O	who
O	followed
O	him
O	owed
O	the
O	invention
O	of
O	the
O	axe
O	,
O	the
O	wedge
O	,
O	the
O	wimble
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	carpenter
O	'
O	s
O	level
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	restless
O	mind
O	was
O	ever
O	busy
O	with
O	new
O	inventions
O	.
O	To
O	his
O	nephew
O	,
O	Talus
O	,
O	or
O	Perdrix
O	,
O	he
O	taught
O	all
O	that
O	he
O	himself
O	knew
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	mechanical
O	arts
O	.
O	Soon
O	it
O	seemed
O	that
O	the
O	nephew
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	might
O	not
O	excel
O	his
O	uncle
O	,
O	equalled
O	Dædalus
O	in
O	his
O	inventive
O	power
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	walked
O	by
O	the
O	seashore
O	,
O	the
O	lad
O	picked
O	up
O	the
O	spine
O	of
O	a
O	fish
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	having
O	pondered
O	its
O	possibilities
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	it
O	home
O	,
O	imitated
O	it
O	in
O	iron
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	invented
O	the
O	saw
O	.
O	A
O	still
O	greater
O	invention
O	followed
O	this
O	.
O	While
O	those
O	who
O	had
O	always
O	thought
O	that
O	there
O	could
O	be
O	none
O	greater
O	than
O	Dædalus
O	were
O	still
O	acclaiming
O	the
O	lad
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	idea
O	of
O	putting
O	two
O	pieces
O	of
O	iron
O	together
O	,
O	connecting
O	them
O	at
O	one
O	end
O	with
O	a
O	rivet
O	,
O	and
O	sharpening
O	both
O	ends
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	compasses
O	was
O	made
O	.
O	Louder
O	still
O	were
O	the
O	acclamations
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	.
O	Surely
O	greater
O	than
O	Dædalus
O	was
O	here
O	.
O	Too
O	much
O	was
O	this
O	for
O	the
O	artist
O	'
O	s
O	jealous
O	spirit
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	they
O	stood
O	together
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	Acropolis
O	,
O	and
O	Dædalus
O	,
O	murder
O	that
O	comes
O	from
O	jealousy
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	,
O	threw
O	his
O	nephew
O	down
O	.
O	Down
O	,
O	down
O	he
O	fell
O	,
O	knowing
O	well
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	meet
O	a
O	cruel
O	death
O	,
O	but
O	Pallas
O	Athené
O	,
O	protectress
O	of
O	all
O	clever
O	craftsmen
O	,
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	rescue
O	.
O	By
O	her
O	Perdrix
O	was
O	turned
O	into
O	the
O	bird
O	that
O	still
O	bears
O	his
O	name
O	,
O	and
O	Dædalus
O	beheld
O	Perdrix
O	,
O	the
O	partridge
O	,
O	rapidly
O	winging
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	far-off
O	fields
O	.
O	Since
O	then
O	,
O	no
O	partridge
O	has
O	ever
O	built
O	or
O	roosted
O	in
O	a
O	high
O	place
O	,
O	but
O	has
O	nestled
O	in
O	the
O	hedge-roots
O	and
O	amongst
O	the
O	standing
O	corn
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	we
O	mark
O	it
O	we
O	can
O	see
O	that
O	its
O	flight
O	is
O	always
O	low
O	.
O	For
O	his
O	crime
O	Dædalus
O	was
O	banished
O	from
O	Athens
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	Minos
O	,
O	king
O	of
O	Crete
O	,
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	refuge
O	.
O	He
O	put
O	all
O	his
O	mighty
O	powers
O	at
O	the
O	service
O	of
O	Minos
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	him
O	designed
O	an
O	intricate
O	labyrinth
O	which
O	,
O	like
O	the
O	river
O	Meander
O	,
O	had
O	neither
O	beginning
O	nor
O	ending
O	,
O	but
O	ever
O	returned
O	on
O	itself
O	in
O	hopeless
O	intricacy
O	.
O	Soon
O	he
O	stood
O	high
O	in
O	the
O	favour
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	,
O	but
O	,
O	ever
O	greedy
O	for
O	power
O	,
O	he
O	incurred
O	,
O	by
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	daring
O	inventions
O	,
O	the
O	wrath
O	of
O	Minos
O	.
O	The
O	angry
O	monarch
O	threw
O	him
O	into
O	prison
O	,
O	and
O	imprisoned
O	along
O	with
O	him
O	his
O	son
O	,
O	Icarus
O	.
O	But
O	prison
O	bars
O	and
O	locks
O	did
O	not
O	exist
O	that
O	were
O	strong
O	enough
O	to
O	baffle
O	this
O	master
O	craftsman
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	tower
O	in
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	shut
O	,
O	Dædalus
O	and
O	his
O	son
O	were
O	not
O	long
O	in
O	making
O	their
O	escape
O	.
O	To
O	escape
O	from
O	Crete
O	was
O	a
O	less
O	easy
O	matter
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	many
O	places
O	in
O	that
O	wild
O	island
O	where
O	it
O	was
O	easy
O	for
O	the
O	father
O	and
O	son
O	to
O	hide
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	subjects
O	of
O	Minos
O	were
O	mostly
O	mariners
O	,
O	and
O	Dædalus
O	knew
O	well
O	that
O	all
O	along
O	the
O	shore
O	they
O	kept
O	watch
O	lest
O	he
O	should
O	make
O	him
O	a
O	boat
O	,
O	hoist
O	on
O	it
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	sails
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	part
O	inventor
O	,
O	and
O	speed
O	away
O	to
O	safety
O	like
O	a
O	sea-bird
O	driven
O	before
O	the
O	gale
O	.
O	Then
O	did
O	there
O	come
O	to
O	Dædalus
O	,
O	the
O	pioneer
O	of
O	inventions
O	,
O	the
O	great
O	idea
O	that
O	by
O	his
O	skill
O	he
O	might
O	make
O	a
O	way
O	for
O	himself
O	and
O	his
O	son
O	through
O	another
O	element
O	than
O	water
O	.
O	And
O	he
O	laughed
O	aloud
O	in
O	his
O	hiding
O	place
O	amongst
O	the
O	cypresses
O	on
O	the
O	hillside
O	at
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	how
O	he
O	would
O	baffle
O	the
O	simple
O	sailormen
O	who
O	watched
O	each
O	creek
O	and
O	beach
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	.
O	Mockingly
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	did
O	he
O	think
O	of
O	King
O	Minos
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	dared
O	to
O	pit
O	his
O	power
O	against
O	the
O	wits
O	and
O	skill
O	of
O	Dædalus
O	,
O	the
O	mighty
O	craftsman
O	.
O	Many
O	a
O	Cretan
O	bird
O	was
O	sacrificed
O	before
O	the
O	task
O	which
O	the
O	inventor
O	had
O	set
O	himself
O	was
O	accomplished
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	shady
O	forest
O	on
O	the
O	mountains
O	he
O	fashioned
O	light
O	wooden
O	frames
O	and
O	decked
O	them
O	with
O	feathers
O	,
O	until
O	at
O	length
O	they
O	looked
O	like
O	the
O	pinions
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	eagle
O	,
O	or
O	of
O	a
O	swan
O	that
O	flaps
O	its
O	majestic
O	way
O	from
O	lake
O	to
O	river
O	.
O	Each
O	feather
O	was
O	bound
O	on
O	with
O	wax
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	mechanism
O	of
O	the
O	wings
O	was
O	so
O	perfect
O	a
O	reproduction
O	of
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	wings
O	from
O	which
O	the
O	feathers
O	had
O	been
O	plucked
O	,
O	that
O	on
O	the
O	first
O	day
O	that
O	he
O	fastened
O	them
O	to
O	his
O	back
O	and
O	spread
O	them
O	out
O	,
O	Dædalus
O	found
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	fly
O	even
O	as
O	the
O	bird
O	flew
O	.
O	Two
O	pairs
O	he
O	made;
O	having
O	tested
O	one
O	pair
O	,
O	a
O	second
O	pair
O	was
O	made
O	for
O	Icarus
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	circling
O	round
O	him
O	like
O	a
O	mother
O	bird
O	that
O	teaches
O	her
O	nestlings
O	how
O	to
O	fly
O	,
O	Dædalus
O	,
O	his
O	heart
O	big
O	with
O	the
O	pride
O	of
O	invention
O	,
O	showed
O	Icarus
O	how
O	he
O	might
O	best
O	soar
O	upwards
O	to
O	the
O	sun
O	or
O	dive
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	blue
O	sea
O	far
O	below
O	,
O	and
O	how
O	he
O	might
O	conquer
O	the
O	winds
O	and
O	the
O	air
O	currents
O	of
O	the
O	sky
O	and
O	make
O	them
O	his
O	servants
O	.
O	That
O	was
O	a
O	joyous
O	day
O	for
O	father
O	and
O	son
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	father
O	had
O	never
O	before
O	drunk
O	deeper
O	of
O	the
O	intoxicating
O	wine
O	of
O	the
O	gods--Success--and
O	for
O	the
O	lad
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	pure
O	joy
O	.
O	Never
O	before
O	had
O	he
O	known
O	freedom
O	and
O	power
O	so
O	utterly
O	glorious
O	.
O	As
O	a
O	little
O	child
O	he
O	had
O	watched
O	the
O	birds
O	fly
O	far
O	away
O	over
O	the
O	blue
O	hills
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	setting
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	longed
O	for
O	wings
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	follow
O	them
O	in
O	their
O	flight
O	.
O	At
O	times
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	dreams
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	known
O	the
O	power
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	dreaming
O	fancy
O	had
O	risen
O	from
O	the
O	cumbering
O	earth
O	and
O	soared
O	high
O	above
O	the
O	trees
O	and
O	fields
O	on
O	strong
O	pinions
O	that
O	bore
O	him
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	fair
O	land
O	of
O	heart
O	'
O	s
O	desire--to
O	the
O	Islands
O	of
O	the
O	Blessed
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	Sleep
O	left
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	dreams
O	silently
O	slipped
O	out
O	before
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	boy
O	sprang
O	from
O	his
O	couch
O	and
O	eagerly
O	spread
O	his
O	arms
O	as
O	,
O	in
O	his
O	dreams
O	,
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	no
O	longer
O	fly
O	.
O	Disappointment
O	and
O	unsatisfied
O	longing
O	ever
O	came
O	with
O	his
O	waking
O	hours
O	.
O	Now
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	an
O	end
O	,
O	and
O	Dædalus
O	was
O	glad
O	and
O	proud
O	as
O	well
O	to

O	As

O	,
O	the
O	warmth
O	that

O	from

O	Not

O	Like

O	Down
O	,
O	down
O	,
O	he

O	,
O	so
O	near
O	the
O	water
O	that
O	almost
O	the
O	white-tipped

O	caught
O	at
O	his
O	wings
O	as
O	he
O	skimmed
O	over
O	them
O	.
O	Then
O	up
O	,
O	up
O	,
O	up
O	he
O	soared
O	,
O	ever
O	higher
O	,
O	higher
O	still
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	radiant
O	sun-god
O	smiling
O	down
O	on
O	him
O	,
O	the
O	warning
O	of
O	Dædalus
O	was
O	forgotten
O	.
O	As
O	he
O	had
O	excelled
O	other
O	lads
O	in
O	foot
O	races
O	,
O	now
O	did
O	Icarus
O	wish
O	to

O	themselves
O	.
O	Dædalus
O	he
O	left
O	far
O	behind
O	,
O	and
O	still
O	upwards
O	he
O	mounted
O	.
O	So
O	strong
O	he
O	felt
O	,
O	so
O	fearless
O	was
O	he
O	,
O	that
O	to
O	him
O	it
O	seemed
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	storm
O	Olympus
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	call
O	to
O	Apollo
O	as
O	he
O	swept
O	past
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	flight
O	,
O	and
O	dare
O	him
O	to
O	race
O	for
O	a
O	wager
O	from
O	the
O	AEgean
O	Sea
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	sun-god
O	'
O	s
O	horses
O	took
O	their
O	nightly
O	rest
O	by
O	the
O	trackless
O	seas
O	of
O	the
O	unknown
O	West
O	.
O	In
O	terror
O	his
O	father
O	watched
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	called
O	to
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	voice
O	of
O	anguished
O	warning
O	that
O	was
O	drowned
O	by
O	the
O	whistling
O	rush
O	of
O	the
O	air
O	currents
O	through
O	the
O	wings
O	of
O	Icarus
O	and
O	the
O	moist
O	whisper
O	of
O	the
O	clouds
O	as
O	through
O	them
O	he
O	cleft
O	a
O	way
O	for
O	himself
O	,
O	there
O	befell
O	the
O	dreaded
O	thing
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	as
O	though
O	the
O	strong
O	wings
O	had
O	begun
O	to
O	lose
O	their
O	power
O	.
O	Like
O	a
O	wounded
O	bird
O	Icarus
O	fluttered
O	,
O	lunged
O	sidewise
O	from
O	the
O	straight
O	,
O	clean
O	line
O	of
O	his
O	flight
O	,
O	recovered
O	himself
O	,
O	and
O	fluttered
O	again
O	.
O	And
O	then
O	,
O	like
O	the
O	bird
O	into
O	whose
O	soft
O	breast
O	the
O	sure
O	hand
O	of
O	a
O	mighty
O	archer
O	has
O	driven
O	an
O	arrow
O	,
O	downwards
O	he
O	fell
O	,
O	turning
O	over
O	and
O	yet
O	turning
O	again
O	,
O	downwards
O	,
O	ever
O	downwards
O	,
O	until
O	he
O	fell
O	with
O	a
O	plunge
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	that
O	still
O	was
O	radiant
O	in
O	shining
O	emerald
O	and
O	translucent
O	blue
O	.
O	Then
O	did
O	the
O	car
O	of
O	Apollo
O	drive
O	on
O	.
O	His
O	rays
O	had
O	slain
O	one
O	who
O	was
O	too
O	greatly
O	daring
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	they
O	fondled
O	the
O	little
O	white
O	feathers
O	that
O	had
O	fallen
O	from
O	the
O	broken
O	wings
O	and
O	floated
O	on
O	the
O	water
O	like
O	the
O	petals
O	of
O	a
O	torn
O	flower
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	dead
O	,
O	still
O	face
O	of
O	Icarus
O	they
O	shone
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	spangled
O	as
O	if
O	with
O	diamonds
O	the
O	wet
O	plumage
O	that
O	still
O	,
O	widespread
O	,
O	bore
O	him
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	waves
O	.
O	Stricken
O	at
O	heart
O	was
O	Dædalus
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	time
O	to
O	lament
O	his
O	son

O	s
O	untimely
O	end
O	,
O	for
O	even
O	now
O	the
O	black-prowed
O	ships
O	of
O	Minos
O	might
O	be
O	in
O	pursuit
O	.
O	Onward
O	he
O	flew
O	to
O	safety
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	Sicily
O	built
O	a
O	temple
O	to
O	Apollo
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	hung
O	up
O	his
O	wings
O	as
O	a
O	propitiatory
O	offering
O	to
O	the
O	god

O	And
O	when

O	came
O	down
O	on

O	that
O	bears
O	the

O	to

O	still
O	there
O	floated
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	boy
O	whose
O	dreams
O	had
O	come
O	true
O	.
O	For

O	,
O	for

O	a

O	and
O	then

O	by

O	over-daring

O	,

O	lost
O	it
O	all
O	for

O	.
O	The
O	sorrowing
O	Nereids
O	sang
O	a
O	dirge
O	over
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	swayed
O	gently
O	hither

O	thither
O	by
O	the
O	tide
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	silver
O	stars
O	came
O	out
O	from
O	the
O	dark
O	firmament
O	of
O	heaven
O	and
O	were
O	reflected
O	in
O	the
O	blackness
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	it
O	was

O	though
O	a
O	velvet
O	pall
O	,
O	silver-decked
O	in

O	honour
O	,
O	was
O	spread
O	around
O	the
O	slim
O	white
O	body
O	with
O	its
O	outstretched
O	snowy
O	wings
O	.
O	So
O	much
O	had
O	he
O	dared--so
O	little
O	accomplished
O	.
O	Is
O	it
O	not
O	the
O	oft-told
O	tale
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	have
O	followed

O	?
O	Yet
O	who
O	can
O	say
O	that
O	gallant
O	youth
O	has
O	lived
O	in
O	vain
O	when
O	,
O	as
O	Icarus
O	did
O	,
O	he
O	has
O	breasted
O	the
O	very
O	skies
O	,
O	has
O	flown
O	with
O	fearless

O	and

O	to
O	the

O	?

O	of
