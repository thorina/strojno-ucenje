O	appeared
O	again

O	for
O	Lieutenant
O	Nolan
O	.
O	Then
O	after
O	a
O	little
O	talk
O	he
O	asked
O	Nolan
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	show
O	him
O	something
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	river

O	he

O	Then
O	the

O	.
O	Every

O	in

O	According
O	to
O	the

O	you
O	had
O	him
O	at
O	your

O	more

O	often
O	at

O	His

O	he
O	ate

O	coming
O	home--if
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	say
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	Shaw--rather
O	to
O	the

O	made

O	the

O	,

O	lay
O	off

O	a

O	The
O	boys

O	sick
O	of

O	,
O	and
O	meant
O	to
O	have
O	turtle-soup
O	before
O	they
O	came
O	home
O	.
O	But
O	after
O	several
O	days
O	the
O	_Warren_
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	same
O	rendezvous;
O	they
O	exchanged
O	signals;
O	she
O	sent
O	to
O	Phillips
O	and
O	these
O	homeward-bound
O	men
O	letters
O	and
O	papers
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	she
O	was
O	outward-bound
O	,
O	perhaps
O	to
O	the
O	Mediterranean
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	poor

O	and

O	on
O	the
O	boat
O	back
O	to
O	try

O	.
O	He
O	looked

O	when

O	was
O	told
O	to
O	get
O	ready

O	""""
O	But
O	this
O	was
O	a
O	distinct

O	of
O	something
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	thought
O	of
O	,
O	perhaps--that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	going
O	home
O	for

O	,
O	even
O	to
O	a

O	And
O	this
O	was

O	at

O	some
O	hundred
O	miles

O	time
O	in
O	the

O	of

O	,

O	in

O	English
O	fleet
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	had
O	been
O	great

O	on

O	as
O	they
O	do
O	now

O	They
O	wanted
O	to
O	use
O	Nolan's
O	state-room
O	for
O	something
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	hated

O	a

O	He

O	again;
O	but
O	from
O	one
O	and
O	another
O	officer
O	I
O	have
O	learned
O	,
O	in
O	thirty
O	years
O	,
O	what
O	I

O	Thomas

O	I

O	I

O	I
O	was
O	very

O	again
O	in
O	1830;
O	and
O	later

O	I

O	,
O	I
O	moved
O	heaven
O	and
O	earth
O	to
O	have
O	him
O	discharged
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	like
O	getting
O	a
O	ghost
O	out
O	of
O	prison
O	.
O	They
O	pretended
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	such
O	man
O	,
O	and
O	never
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	man
O	.
O	They
O	will
O	say
O	so
O	at
O	the
O	Department
O	now
O	!
O	Perhaps
O	they
O	do
O	not

O	.
O	It
O	will

O	a

O	,
O	rather
O	,

O	liked
O	to
O	be
O	"""without"
O	a

O	.
O	""""
O	But
O	it
O	is

O	life
O	,
O	that
O	nothing
O	of
O	the
O	sort
O	could
O	have
O	happened;
O	and
O	I
O	mention
O	this
O	only
O	as
O	an
O	illustration
O	of
O	the
O	stories
O	which
O	get
O	a-going
O	where
O	there
O	is
O	the
O	least
O	mystery
O	at
O	bottom
O	.
O	Philip
O	Nolan
O	,
O	poor
O	fellow
O	,
O	repented
O	of
O	his
O	folly
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	submitted
O	to
O	the
O	fate
O	he
O	had
O	asked
O	for
O	.
O	He
O	never
O	intentionally
O	added
O	to
O	the
O	difficulty
O	or
O	delicacy
O	of
O	the
O	charge
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	had
O	him
O	in
O	hold
O	.
O	Accidents
O	would
O	happen;
O	but
O	never
O	from
O	his
O	fault
O	.
O	Lieutenant
O	Truxton
O	told
O	me
O	that
O	,
O	when
O	Texas
O	was
O	annexed
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	careful
O	discussion
O	among
O	the
O	officers
O	,
O	whether
O	they
O	should
O	get
O	hold
O	of
O	Nolan's
O	handsome
O	set
O	of
O	maps
O	and
O	cut
O	Texas
O	out
O	of
O	it--from
O	the
O	map
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	and
O	the
O	map
O	of
O	Mexico
O	.
O	The
O	United
O	States
O	had
O	been
O	cut
O	out
O	when
O	the
O	atlas
O	was
O	bought
O	for
O	him
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	voted
O	,
O	rightly
O	enough
O	,
O	that
O	to
O	do
O	this
O	would
O	be
O	virtually
O	to
O	reveal
O	to
O	him
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	,
O	or
O	,
O	as
O	Harry
O	Cole
O	said
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	think
O	Old
O	Burr
O	had
O	succeeded
O	.
O	So
O	it
O	was
O	from
O	no
O	fault
O	of
O	Nolan's
O	that
O	a
O	great
O	botch
O	happened
O	at
O	my
O	own
O	table
O	,
O	when
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	,
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	command
O	of
O	the
O	_George
O	Washington_
O	corvette
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	South
O	American
O	station
O	.
O	We
O	were
O	lying
O	in
O	the
O	La
O	Plata
O	,
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	officers
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	on
O	shore
O	and
O	had
O	just
O	joined
O	again
O	,
O	were
O	entertaining
O	us
O	with
O	accounts
O	of
O	their
O	misadventures
O	in
O	riding
O	the
O	half-wild
O	horses
O	of
O	Buenos
O	Ayres
O	.
O	Nolan
O	was
O	at
O	table
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	in
O	an
O	unusually
O	bright
O	and
O	talkative
O	mood
O	.
O	Some
O	story
O	of
O	a
O	tumble
O	reminded
O	him
O	of
O	an
O	adventure
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	catching
O	wild
O	horses
O	in
O	Texas
O	with
O	his
O	adventurous
O	cousin
O	,
O	at
O	a
O	time
O	when
O	he
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	quite
O	a
O	boy
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	the
O	story
O	with
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	of
O	spirit--so
O	much
O	so
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	silence
O	which
O	often
O	follows
O	a
O	good
O	story
O	hung
O	over
O	the
O	table
O	for
O	an
O	instant
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	broken
O	by
O	Nolan
O	himself
O	.
O	For
O	he
O	asked
O	perfectly
O	unconsciously:
O	"""Pray"
O	,
O	what
O	has
O	become
O	of

O	?
O	After
O	the
O	Mexicans
O	got

O	independence
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	that
O	province
O	of
O	Texas
O	would
O	come
O	forward
O	very
O	fast
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	really
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	finest
O	regions
O	on
O	earth;
O	it
O	is
O	the
O	Italy
O	of
O	this
O	continent
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	have
O	not
O	seen
O	or
O	heard

O	for
O	nearly
O	twenty
O	years
O	.
O	""""
O	There
O	were
O	two
O	Texan
O	officers
O	at
O	the
O	table
O	.
O	The
O	reason
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	heard
O	of
O	Texas
O	was
O	that
O	Texas
O	and
O	her
O	affairs
O	had
O	been
O	painfully
O	cut
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	newspapers
O	since
O	Austin
O	began
O	his
O	settlements;
O	so
O	that
O	,
O	while
O	he
O	read
O	of
O	Honduras
O	and
O	Tamaulipas
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	till
O	quite
O	lately
O	,
O	of
O	California--this
O	virgin
O	province
O	,
O	in
O	which
O	his
O	brother
O	had
O	travelled
O	so
O	far
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	believe
O	,

O	and

O	the
O	two
O	Texas

O	tried
O	not
O	to
O	laugh

O	Edward
O	Morris
