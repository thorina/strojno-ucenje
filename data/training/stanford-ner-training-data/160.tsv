O	Years
O	ago
O	I
O	spent
O	a
O	winter
O	in
O	Africa
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	intended
O	to
O	go
O	up
O	the
O	Nile
O	only
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	Nubia
O	,
O	visiting
O	the
O	great
O	temples
O	and
O	tombs
O	of
O	Thebes
O	on
O	the
O	way;
O	but
O	when
O	I
O	had
O	done
O	all
O	this
O	,
O	and
O	passed
O	beyond
O	the
O	cataracts
O	at
O	the
O	southern
O	boundary
O	of
O	Egypt
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	the
O	journey
O	so
O	agreeable
O	,
O	so
O	full
O	of
O	interest
O	,
O	and
O	attended
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	less
O	danger
O	than
O	I
O	had
O	supposed
O	,
O	that
O	I
O	determined
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	for
O	a
O	month
O	or
O	two
O	longer
O	,
O	and
O	penetrate
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	possible
O	into
O	the
O	interior
O	.
O	Everything
O	was
O	favorable
O	to
O	my
O	plan
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	reached
O	Khartoum
O	,
O	the
O	Austrian
O	consul
O	invited
O	me
O	to
O	his
O	house;
O	and
O	there
O	I
O	spent
O	three
O	or
O	four
O	weeks
O	,
O	in
O	that
O	strange
O	town
O	,
O	making
O	acquaintance
O	with
O	the
O	Egyptian
O	officers
O	,
O	the
O	chiefs
O	of
O	the
O	desert
O	tribes
O	and
O	the
O	former
O	kings
O	of
O	the
O	different
O	countries
O	of
O	Ethiopia
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	left
O	my
O	boat
O	,
O	on
O	arriving
O	,
O	and
O	walked
O	through
O	the
O	narrow
O	streets
O	of
O	Khartoum
O	,
O	between
O	mud
O	walls
O	,
O	very
O	few
O	of
O	which
O	were
O	even
O	whitewashed
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	it
O	a
O	miserable
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	look
O	out
O	for
O	some
O	garden
O	where
O	I
O	might
O	pitch
O	my
O	tent
O	,
O	rather
O	than
O	live
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	those
O	dirty-looking
O	habitations
O	.
O	The
O	wall
O	around
O	the
O	consul's
O	house
O	was
O	of
O	mud
O	like
O	the
O	others;
O	but
O	when
O	I
O	entered
O	I
O	found
O	clean
O	,
O	handsome
O	rooms
O	,
O	which
O	furnished
O	delightful
O	shade
O	and
O	coolness
O	during
O	the
O	heat
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	.
O	The
O	roof
O	was
O	of
O	palm-logs
O	,
O	covered
O	with
O	mud
O	,
O	which
O	the
O	sun
O	baked
O	into
O	a
O	hard
O	mass
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	house
O	was
O	in
O	reality
O	as
O	good
O	as
O	a
O	brick
O	dwelling
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	more
O	comfortable
O	than
O	it
O	appeared
O	from
O	the
O	outside
O	.
O	There
O	were
O	other
O	features
O	of
O	the
O	place
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	which
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	difficult
O	to
O	find
O	anywhere
O	except
O	in
O	Central
O	Africa
O	.
O	After
O	I
O	had
O	taken
O	possession
O	of
O	my
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	eaten
O	breakfast
O	with
O	my
O	host
O	,
O	I
O	went
O	out
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	the
O	garden
O	.
O	On
O	each
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	steps
O	leading
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	door
O	sat
O	two
O	apes
O	,
O	who
O	barked
O	and
O	snapped
O	at
O	me
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	thing
O	I
O	saw
O	was
O	a
O	leopard
O	tied
O	to
O	the
O	trunk
O	of
O	an
O	orange-tree
O	.
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	dare
O	to
O	go
O	within
O	reach
O	of
O	his
O	rope
O	,
O	although
O	I
O	afterwards
O	became
O	well
O	acquainted
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	A
O	little
O	farther
O	,
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	pen
O	of
O	gazelles
O	and
O	an
O	antelope
O	with
O	immense
O	horns;
O	then
O	two
O	fierce
O	,
O	bristling
O	hyenas;
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	,
O	under
O	a
O	shed
O	beside
O	the
O	stable
O	,
O	a
O	full-grown
O	lioness
O	sleeping
O	in
O	the
O	shade
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	greatly
O	surprised
O	when
O	the
O	consul
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	lifted
O	up
O	her
O	head
O	,
O	opened
O	her
O	jaws
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	show
O	the
O	shining
O	white
O	tusks
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	sat
O	down
O	upon
O	her
O	hack
O	.
O	She
O	accepted
O	these
O	familiarities
O	so
O	good-naturedly
O	that
O	I
O	made
O	bold
O	to
O	pat
O	her
O	head
O	also
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	day
O	or
O	two
O	we
O	were
O	great
O	friends;
O	she
O	would
O	spring
O	about
O	with
O	delight
O	whenever
O	she
O	saw
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	purr
O	like
O	a
O	cat
O	whenever
O	I
O	sat
O	upon
O	her
O	back
O	.
O	I
O	spent
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	two
O	every
O	day
O	among
O	the
O	animals
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	them
O	all
O	easy
O	to
O	tame
O	except
O	the
O	hyenas
O	,
O	which
O	would
O	gladly
O	have
O	bitten
O	me
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	allowed
O	them
O	a
O	chance
O	.
O	The
O	leopard
O	,
O	one
O	day
O	,
O	bit
O	me
O	slightly
O	on
O	the
O	hand;
O	but
O	I
O	punished
O	him
O	by
O	pouring
O	several
O	buckets
O	of
O	water
O	over
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	always
O	very
O	amiable
O	after
O	that
O	.
O	The
O	beautiful
O	little
O	gazelles
O	would
O	cluster
O	around
O	me
O	,
O	thrusting
O	up
O	their
O	noses
O	into
O	my
O	hand
O	,
O	and
O	saying
O	"""Wow"
O	!
O	wow
O	!
O	""""
O	as
O	plainly
O	as
O	I
O	write
O	it
O	.
O	But
O	none
O	of
O	these
O	animals
O	attracted
O	me
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	the
O	big
O	lioness
O	.
O	She
O	was
O	always
O	good-humored
O	,
O	though
O	occasionally
O	so
O	lazy
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	not
O	even
O	open
O	her
O	eyes
O	when
O	I
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	her
O	shoulder
O	.
O	She
O	would
O	sometimes
O	catch
O	my
O	foot
O	in
O	her
O	paws
O	as
O	a
O	kitten
O	catches
O	a
O	ball
O	,
O	and
O	try
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	plaything
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	--yet
O	always
O	without
O	thrusting
O	out
O	her
O	claws
O	.
O	Once
O	she
O	opened
O	Her
O	mouth
O	,
O	and
O	gently
O	took
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	legs
O	in
O	her
O	jaws
O	for
O	a
O	moment;
O	and
O	the
O	very
O	next
O	instant
O	she
O	put
O	out
O	her
O	tongue
O	and
O	licked
O	my
O	hand
O	.
O	There
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	almost
O	as
O	much
O	of
O	the
O	dog
O	as
O	of
O	the
O	cat
O	in
O	her
O	nature
O	.
O	We
O	all
O	know
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	there
O	are
O	differences
O	of
O	character
O	among
O	animals
O	as
O	there
O	are
O	among
O	men;
O	and
O	my
O	favorite
O	probably
O	belonged
O	to
O	a
O	virtuous
O	and
O	respectable
O	family
O	of
O	lions
O	.
O	The
O	day
O	after
O	my
O	arrival
O	I
O	went
O	with
O	the
O	consul
O	to
O	visit
O	the
O	pacha
O	,
O	who
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	large
O	mud
O	palace
O	on
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	the
O	Blue
O	Nile
O	.
O	He
O	received
O	us
O	very
O	pleasantly
O	,
O	and
O	invited
O	us
O	to
O	take
O	seats
O	in
O	the
O	shady
O	court-yard
O	.
O	Here
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	huge
O	panther
O	tied
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	pillars
O	,
O	while
O	a
O	little
O	lion
O	,
O	about
O	eight
O	months
O	old
O	,
O	ran
O	about
O	perfectly
O	loose
O	.
O	The
O	pacha
O	called
O	the
O	latter
O	,
O	which
O	came
O	springing
O	and
O	frisking
O	towards
O	him
O	.
O	"""Now"
O	,
O	""""
O	said
O	he
O	,
O	"""we"
O	will
O	have
O	some
O	fun
O	.
O	""""
O	He
O	then
O	made
O	the
O	lion
O	lie
O	down
O	behind
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	pillars
O	,
O	and
O	called
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	black
O	boys
O	to
O	go
O	across
O	the
O	court-yard
O	on
O	some
O	errand
O	.
O	The
O	lion
O	lay
O	quite
O	still
O	until
O	the
O	boy
O	came
O	opposite
O	to
O	the
O	pillar
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	sprang
O	out
O	after
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	boy
O	ran
O	,
O	terribly
O	frightened;
O	but
O	the
O	lion
O	reached
O	him
O	in
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	leaps
O	,
O	sprang
O	upon
O	his
O	back
O	and
O	threw
O	him
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	pillar
O	as
O	if
O	quite
O	satisfied
O	with
O	his
O	exploit
O	.
O	Although
O	the
O	boy
O	was
O	not
O	hurt
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	,
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	me
O	like
O	a
O	cruel
O	piece
O	of
O	fun
O	.
O	The
O	pacha
O	,
O	nevertheless
O	,
O	laughed
O	very
O	heartily
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	us
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	himself
O	trained
O	the
O	lion
O	to
O	frighten
O	the
O	boys
O	.
O	Presently
O	the
O	little
O	lion
O	went
O	away
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	we
O	came
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	we
O	found
O	him
O	lying
O	on
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	tables
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	apparently
O	very
O	much
O	interested
O	in
O	watching
O	the
O	cook
O	.
O	The
O	latter
O	told
O	us
O	that
O	the
O	animal
O	sometimes
O	took
O	small
O	pieces
O	of
O	meat
O	,
O	but
O	seemed
O	to
O	know
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	permitted
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	would
O	run
O	away
O	afterwards
O	in
O	great
O	haste
O	.
O	What
O	I
O	saw
O	of
O	lions
O	during
O	my
O	residence
O	in
O	Khartoum
O	satisfied
O	me
O	that
O	they
O	are
O	not
O	very
O	difficult
O	to
O	tame
O	,
O	only
O	,
O	as
O	they
O	belong
O	to
O	the
O	cat
O	family
O	,
O	no

O	be

O	behavior
O	.

O	leave
O	that
O	wild
O	town
O	,
O	with

O	retrace
O	the

O	back
O	to
O	Egypt
O	,
O	across
O	the
O	Desert
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	Nile

O	I
O	felt
O	very
O	sorry
O	at
O	being
O	obliged
O	to
O	take
O	leave
O	forever
O	of
O	all
O	my

O	.
O	The
O	little

O	said

O	in
O	answer

O	howled
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	bite
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	ever;
O	but
O	the
O	dear
O	old
O	lioness
O	I
O	know
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	sorry
O	if
O	she
O	could
O	have
O	understood
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	going
O	.
O	She
O	frisked
O	around
O	me

O	licked
O	my

O	head
O	into
O	my

O	,
O	and
O	gave

O	I
O	have
O	never
