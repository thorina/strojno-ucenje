A man , of small stature , found himself standing alone on a prairie . He
thought to himself ,  " How came I here ? Are there no beings on this earth
but myself ? I must travel and see . I must walk till I find the abodes of
men . " 

So soon as his mind was made up , he set out , he knew not whither , in
search of habitations . He was a resolute little fellow , and no
difficulties could turn him from his purpose: neither prairies , rivers , 
woods nor storms , had the effect to daunt his courage or turn him back . 
After traveling a long time , he came to a wood , in which he saw decayed
stumps of trees , as if they had been cut in ancient times , but no other
trace of men . Pursuing his journey , he found more recent marks of the
same kind; after this , he came upon fresh traces of human beings; first
their footsteps , and then the wood they had felled , lying in heaps . 
Pushing on , he emerged toward dusk from the forest , and beheld at a
distance a large village of high lodges standing on rising ground . 

 " I am tired of this dog-trot , " he said to himself .  " I will arrive there
on a run . " 

He started off with all his speed . On coming to the first lodge , without
any especial exertion , he jumped over it , and found himself standing by
the door on the other side . Those within saw something pass over the
opening in the roof; they thought from the shadow it cast that it must
have been some huge bird--and then they heard a thump upon the ground . 
 " What is that ? " they all said and several ran out to see . 

They invited him in , and he found himself in company with an old chief
and several men who were seated in the lodge . Meat was set before him;
after which the old chief asked him whither he was going , and what was
his name . He answered that he was in search of adventures , and that his
name was  " Grasshopper . " 

They all opened their eyes upon the stranger with a broad stare . 

 " Grasshopper ! " whispered one to another; and a general titter went
round . 

They invited him to stay with them , which he was inclined to do; for it
was a pleasant village , but so small as to constantly embarrass
Grasshopper . He was in perpetual trouble; whenever he shook hands with
a stranger , to whom he might be introduced , such was the abundance of
his strength , without meaning it , he wrung his arm off at the shoulder . 
Once or twice , in mere sport , he cuffed the boys , about the lodge , by
the side of the head , and they flew out of sight as though they had been
shot from a bow; nor could they ever be found again , though they were
searched for in all the country round , far and wide . If Grasshopper
proposed to himself a short stroll in the morning , he was at once miles
out of town . When he entered a lodge , if he happened for a moment to
forget himself , he walked straight through the leathern , or wooden , or
earthen walls , as if he had been merely passing through a bush . At his
meals he broke in pieces all the dishes , set them down as lightly as he
would; and putting a leg out of bed when he rose , it was a common thing
for him to push off the top of the lodge . 

He wanted more elbow-room; and after a short stay , in which , by the
accidentally letting go of his strength , he had nearly laid waste the
whole place , and filled it with demolished lodges and broken pottery , 
and one-armed men , he made up his mind to go further , taking with him a
young man who had formed a strong attachment for him , and who might
serve him as his pipe-bearer; for Grasshopper was a huge smoker , and
vast clouds followed him wherever he went; so that people could say , 
 " Grasshopper is coming ! " by the mighty smoke he raised . 

They set out together , and when his companion was fatigued with walking , 
Grasshopper would put him forward on his journey a mile or two by giving
him a cast in the air , and lighting him in a soft place among the trees , 
or in a cool spot in a water-pond , among the sedges and water-lilies . At
other times he would lighten the way by showing off a few tricks , such
as leaping over trees , and turning round on one leg till he made the
dust fly; at which the pipe-bearer was mightily pleased , although it
sometimes happened that the character of these gambols frightened him . 
For Grasshopper would , without the least hint of such an intention , jump
into the air far ahead , and it would cost the little pipe-bearer half a
day ' s hard travel to come up with him; and then the dust Grasshopper
raised was often so thick and heavy as to completely bury the poor
little pipe-bearer , and compel Grasshopper to dig diligently and with
might and main to get him out alive . 

One day they came to a very large village , where they were well
received . After staying in it some time  ( in the course of which
Grasshopper , in a fit of abstraction , walked straight through the sides
of three lodges without stopping to look for the door ) , they were
informed of a number of wicked spirits , who lived at a distance , and who
made it a practice to kill all who came to their lodge . Attempts had
been made to destroy them , but they had always proved more than a match
for such as had come out against them . 

Grasshopper determined to pay them a visit , although he was strongly
advised not to do so . The chief of the village warned him of the great
danger he would incur , but finding Grasshopper resolved , he said:

 " Well , if you will go , being my guest , I will send twenty warriors to
serve you . " 

Grasshopper thanked him for the offer , although he suggested that he
thought he could get along without them , at which the little pipe-bearer
grinned , for his master had never shown in that village what he could
do , and the chief thought that Grasshopper , being little himself , would
be likely to need twenty warriors , at the least , to encounter the wicked
spirits with any chance of success . Twenty young men made their
appearance . They set forward , and after about a day ' s journey they
descried the lodge of the Manitoes . 

Grasshopper placed his friend , the pipe-bearer , and the warriors , near
enough to see all that passed , while he went alone to the lodge . 

As he entered , Grasshopper saw five horrid-looking Manitoes in the act
of eating . It was the father and his four sons . They were really
hideous to look upon . Their eyes were swimming low in their heads , and
they glared about as if they were half starved . They offered Grasshopper
something to eat , which he politely refused , for he had a strong
suspicion that it was the thigh-bone of a man . 

 " What have you come for ? " said the old one . 

 " Nothing , " answered Grasshopper;  " where is your uncle ? " 

They all stared at him , and answered:

 " We ate him , yesterday . What do you want ? " 

 " Nothing , " said Grasshopper;  " where is your grandfather ? " 

They all answered , with another broad stare:

 " We ate him a week ago . Do you not wish to wrestle ? " 

 " Yes , " replied Grasshopper ,  " I don ' t mind if I do take a turn; but you
must be easy with me , for you see I am very little . " 

Pipe-bearer , who stood near enough to overhear the conversation , grinned
from ear to ear when he caught this remark . The Manitoes answered:

 " Oh yes , we will be easy with you . " 

And as they said this they looked at each other , and rolled their eyes
about in a dreadful manner . A hideous smile came over their faces as
they whispered among themselves:

 " It ' s a pity he ' s so thin . You go , " they said to the eldest brother . 

The two got ready--the Manito and Grasshopper--and they were soon
clinched in each other ' s arms for a deadly throw . Grasshopper knew their
object--his death; they wanted a taste of his delicate little body , and
he was determined they should have it , perhaps in a different sense from
that they intended . 

 " Haw ! haw ! " they cried , and soon the dust and dry leaves flew about as
if driven by a strong wind . The Manito was strong , but Grasshopper
thought he could master him; and all at once giving him a sly trip , as
the wicked spirit was trying to finish his breakfast with a piece out of
his shoulder , he sent the Manito head-foremost against a stone; and , 
calling aloud to the three others , he bade them come and take the body
away . 

The brothers now stepped forth in quick succession , but Grasshopper
having got his blood up , and limbered himself by exercise , soon
dispatched the three--sending one this way , another that , and the third
straight up into the air , so high that he never came down again . 

It was time for the old Manito to be frightened , and dreadfully
frightened he got , and ran for his life , which was the very worst thing
he could have done; for Grasshopper , of all his gifts of strength , was
most noted for his speed of foot . The old Manito set off , and for mere
sport ' s sake , Grasshopper pursued him . Sometimes he was before the
wicked old spirit , sometimes he was flying over his head , and then he
would keep along at a steady trot just at his heels , till he had blown
all the breath out of the old knave ' s body . 

Meantime his friend , the pipe-bearer , and the twenty young warriors , 
cried out:

 " Ha , ha , ah ! ha , ha , ah ! Grasshopper is driving him before him ! " 

The Manito only turned his head now and then to look back . At length , 
when he was tired of the sport , to be rid of him , Grasshopper , with a
gentle application of his foot , sent the wicked old Manito whirling away
through the air , in which he made a great number of the most curious
turn-overs in the world , till he came to alight , when it so happened
that he fell astride of an old bull-buffalo , grazing in a distant
pasture , who straightway set off with him at a long gallop , and the old
Manito has not been heard of to this day . 

The warriors and the pipe-bearer and Grasshopper set to work and burned
down the lodge of the wicked spirits , and then when they came to look
about , they saw that the ground was strewn on all sides with human bones
bleaching in the sun; these were the unhappy victims of the Manitoes . 
Grasshopper then took three arrows from his girdle , and after having
performed a ceremony to the Great Spirit , he shot one into the air , 
crying ,  " You are lying down; rise up , or you will be hit ! " 

The bones all moved to one place . He shot the second arrow , repeating
the same words , when each bone drew toward its fellow-bone; the third
arrow brought forth to life the whole multitude of people who had been
killed by the Manitoes . Grasshopper conducted the crowd to the chief of
the village , who had proved his friend , and gave them into his hands . 
The chief was there with his counselors , to whom he spoke apart . 

 " Who is more worthy , " said the chief to Grasshopper ,  " to rule than you . 
_You_ alone can defend them . " 

Grasshopper thanked him , and told him that he was in search of more
adventures .  " I have done some things , " said little Grasshopper , rather
boastfully ,  " and I think I can do some more . " 

The chief still urged him , but he was eager to go , and naming
pipe-bearer to tarry and take his place , he set out again on his
travels , promising that he would some time or other come back and see
them . 

 " Ho ! ho ! ho ! " they all cried .  " Come back again and see us ! " He renewed
his promise that he would; and then set out alone . 

After traveling some time he came to a great lake , and on looking about
he discovered a very large otter on an island . He thought to himself , 
 " His skin will make me a fine pouch . " And he immediately drew up at
long shots , and drove an arrow into his side . He waded into the lake , 
and with some difficulty dragged him ashore , and up a hill overlooking
the lake . 

As soon as Grasshopper got the otter into the sunshine where it was
warm , he skinned him , and threw the carcass some distance off , thinking
the war-eagle would come , and that he should have a chance to secure his
feathers as ornaments for the head; for Grasshopper began to be proud , 
and was disposed to display himself . 

He soon heard a rushing noise as of a loud wind , but could see nothing . 
Presently a large eagle dropped , as if from the air , upon the otter ' s
carcass . Grasshopper drew his bow , and the arrow passed through under
both of his wings . The bird made a convulsive flight upward , with such
force that the cumbrous body was borne up several feet from the ground;
but with its claws deeply fixed , the heavy otter brought the eagle back
to the earth . Grasshopper possessed himself of a handful of the prime
feathers , crowned his head with the trophy , and set off in high spirits
on the look out for something new . 

After walking awhile , he came to a body of water which flooded the trees
on its banks--it was a lake made by beavers . Taking his station on the
raised dam where the stream escaped , he watched to see whether any of
the beavers would show themselves . A head presently peeped out of the
water to see who it was that disturbed them . 

 " My friend , " said Grasshopper , in his most persuasive manner ,  " could you
not oblige me by turning me into a beaver like yourself . Nothing would
please me so much as to make your acquaintance , I can assure you; " for
Grasshopper was curious to know how these watery creatures lived , and
what kind of notions they had . 

 " I do not know , " replied the beaver , who was rather short-nosed and
surly .  " I will go and ask the others . Meanwhile stay where you are , if
you please . " 

 " To be sure , " answered Grasshopper , stealing down the bank several paces
as soon as the beaver ' s back was turned . 

Presently there was a great splashing of the water , and all the beavers
showed their heads , and looked warily to where he stood , to see if he
was armed; but he had knowingly left his bow and arrows in a hollow tree
at a short distance . 

After a long conversation , which they conducted in a whisper so that
Grasshopper could not catch a word , strain his ears as he would , they
all advanced in a body toward the spot where he stood; the chief
approaching the nearest , and lifting his head highest out of the water . 

 " Can you not , " said Grasshopper , noticing that they waited for him to
speak first ,  " turn me into a beaver ? I wish to live among you . " 

 " Yes , " answered their chief;  " lie down . " And Grasshopper in a moment
found himself a beaver , and was gliding into the water , when a thought
seemed to strike him , and he paused at the edge of the lake .  " I am very
small , " he said , to the beaver , in a sorrowful tone .  " You must make me
large , " he said; for Grasshopper was terribly ambitious , and wanted
always to be the first person in every company .  " Larger than any of you;
in my present size it ' s hardly worth my while to go into the water . " 

 " Yes , yes ! " said they .  " By and by , when we get into the lodge it shall
be done . " 

They all dived into the lake , and in passing great heaps of limbs and
logs at the bottom , he asked the use of them; they answered ,  " It is for
our winter ' s provisions . " 

When they all got into the lodge their number was about one hundred . The
lodge was large and warm . 

 " Now we will make you large , " said they .  " Will _that_ do ? " 

 " Yes , " he answered; for he found that he was ten times the size of the
largest . 

 " You need not go out , " said the others;  " we will bring you food into
the lodge , and you will be our chief . " 

 " Very well , " Grasshopper answered . He thought ,  " I will stay here and
grow fat at their expense . " But , soon after , one ran into the lodge , out
of breath , crying out ,  " We are visited by the Indians ! " 

All huddled together in great fear . The water began to lower , for the
hunters had broken down the dam , and they soon heard them on the roof of
the lodge , breaking it up . Out jumped all the beavers into the water , 
and so escaped . 

Grasshopper tried to follow them; but , unfortunately , to gratify his
ambition , they had made him so large that he could not creep out at the
hole . He tried to call them back , but either they did not hear or would
not attend to him; he worried himself so much in searching for a door to
let him out , that he looked like a great bladder , swollen and blistering
in the sun , and the sweat stood out upon his forehead in knobs and huge
bubbles . 

Although he heard and understood every word that the hunters spoke--and
some of their expressions suggested terrible ideas--he could not turn
himself back into a man . He had chosen to be a beaver , and a beaver he
must be . One of the hunters , a prying little man , with a single lock
dangling over one eye--this inquisitive little fellow put his head in at
the top of the lodge .  " _Ty-au ! _ " cried he .  " _Tut ty-au ! _
Me-shau-mik--king of beavers is in . " Whereupon the whole crowd of
hunters began upon him with their clubs , and knocked his scull about
until it was no harder than a morass in the middle of summer . 
Grasshopper thought as well as ever he did , although he was a beaver;
and he felt that he was in a rather foolish scrape , inhabiting the
carcass of a beaver . 

Presently seven or eight of the hunters hoisted his body upon long
poles , and marched away home with him . As they went , he reflected in
this manner:  " What will become of me ? My ghost or shadow will not die
after they get me to their lodges . " 

Invitations were immediately sent out for a grand feast; but as soon as
his body got cold , his soul being uncomfortable in a house without heat , 
flew off . 

Having reassumed his mortal shape , Grasshopper found himself standing
near a prairie . After walking a distance , he saw a herd of elk feeding . 
He admired their apparent ease and enjoyment of life , and thought there
could be nothing more pleasant than the liberty of running about and
feeding on the prairies . He had been a water animal and now he wished to
become a land animal , to learn what passed in an elk ' s head as he roved
about . He asked them if they could not turn him into one of themselves . 

 " Yes , " they answered , after a pause .  " Get down on your hands and feet . " 

He obeyed their directions , and forthwith found himself to be an elk . 

 " I want big horns , big feet , " said he;  " I wish to be very large; " for
all the conceit and vain-glory had not been knocked out of Grasshopper , 
even by the sturdy thwacks of the hunters ' clubs . 

 " Yes , yes , " they answered .  " There , " exerting their power ,  " are you big
enough ? " 

 " That will do , " he replied; for , looking into a lake hard by , 
Grasshopper saw that he was very large . They spent their time in grazing
and running to and fro; but what astonished Grasshopper , although he
often lifted up his head and directed his eyes that way , he could never
see the stars , which he had so admired as a human being . 

Being rather cold , one day , Grasshopper went into a thick wood for
shelter , whither he was followed by most of the herd . They had not been
long there when some elks from behind passed the others like a strong
wind , calling out:

 " The hunters are after us ! " 

All took the alarm , and off they ran , Grasshopper with the rest . 

 " Keep out on the plains , " they said . But it was too late to profit by
this advice , for they had already got entangled in the thick woods . 
Grasshopper soon scented the hunters , who were closely following his
trail for they had left all the others and were making after him in
full cry . He jumped furiously , dashed through the underwood , and broke
down whole groves of saplings in his flight . But this only made it the
harder for him to get on , such a huge and lusty elk was he by his own
request . 

Presently , as he dashed past an open space , he felt an arrow in his
side . They could not well miss it , he presented so wide a mark to the
shot . He bounded over trees under the smart , but the shafts clattered
thicker and thicker at his ribs , and at last one entered his heart . He
fell to the ground , and heard the whoop of triumph sounded by the
hunters . On coming up , they looked on the carcass with astonishment , and
with their hands up to their mouths , exclaimed:  " _Ty-au ! ty-au ! _ " 

There were about sixty in the party , who had come out on a special hunt , 
as one of their number had , the day before , observed his large tracks on
the plains . When they had skinned him his flesh grew cold , and his
spirit took its flight from the dead body , and Grasshopper found himself
in human shape , with a bow and arrows . 

But his passion for adventure was not yet cooled; for on coming to a
large lake with a sandy beach , he saw a large flock of brant , and
speaking to them in the brant language , he requested them to make a
brant of him . 

 " Yes , " they replied , at once; for the brant is a bird of a very obliging
disposition . 

 " But I want to be very large , " he said . There was no end to the ambition
of little Grasshopper . 

 " Very well , " they answered; and he soon found himself a large brant , all
the others standing gazing in astonishment at his great size . 

 " You must fly as leader , " they said . 

 " No , " answered Grasshopper;  " I will fly behind . " 

 " Very well , " rejoined the brant;  " one thing more we have to say to you , 
brother Grasshopper "  ( for he had told them his name ) .  " You must be
careful , in flying , not to look down , for something may happen to you . " 

 " Well , it is so , " said he; and soon the flock rose up into the air , for
they were bound north . They flew very fast--he behind . One day , while
going with a strong wind , and as swift as their wings could flap , as
they passed over a large village the Indians raised a great shout on
seeing them , particularly on Grasshopper ' s account , for his wings were
broader than two large mats . The village people made such a frightful
noise that he forgot what had been told him about looking down . They
were now scudding along as swift as arrows; and as soon as he brought
his neck in and stretched it down to look at the shouters , his huge tail
was caught by the wind , and over and over he was blown . He tried to
right himself , but without success , for he had no sooner got out of one
heavy air-current than he fell into another , which treated him even more
rudely than that he had escaped from . Down , down he went , making more
turns than he wished for , from a height of several miles . 

The first moment he had to look about him , Grasshopper , in the shape of
a big brant , was aware that he was jammed into a large hollow tree . To
get backward or forward was out of the question , and there , in spite of
himself , was Grasshopper forced to tarry till his brant life was ended
by starvation , when , his spirit being at liberty , he was once more a
human being . 

As he journeyed on in search of further adventures , Grasshopper came to
a lodge in which were two old men , with heads white from extreme age . 
They were very fine old men to look at . There was such sweetness and
innocence in their features that Grasshopper would have enjoyed himself
very much at their lodge , if he had had no other entertainment than such
as the gazing upon the serene and happy faces of the two innocent old
men with heads white from extreme age afforded . 

They treated him well , and he made known to them that he was going back
to his village , his friends and people , whereupon the two white-headed
old men very heartily wished him a good journey and abundance of
comfort in seeing his friends once more . They even arose , old and infirm
as they were , and tottering with exceeding difficulty to the door , were
at great pains to point out to him the exact course he should take; and
they called his attention to the circumstance that it was much shorter
and more direct than he would have taken himself . Ah ! what merry
deceivers were these two old men with very white heads . 

Grasshopper , with blessings showered on him until he was fairly out of
sight , set forth with good heart . He thought he heard loud laughter
resounding after him in the direction of the lodge of the two old men;
but it could not have been the two old men , for they were , certainly , 
too old to laugh . 

He walked briskly all day , and at night he had the satisfaction of
reaching a lodge in all respects like that which he had left in the
morning . There were two fine old men , and his treatment was in every
particular the same , even down to the parting blessing and the laughter
that followed him as he went his way . 

After walking the third day , and coming to a lodge the same as before , 
he was satisfied from the bearings of the course he had taken that he
had been journeying in a circle , and by a notch which he had cut in the
door-post that these were the same two old men , all along; and that , 
despite their innocent faces and their very white heads , they had been
playing him a sorry trick . 

 " Who are you , " said Grasshopper ,  " to treat me so ? Come forth , I say . " 

They were compelled to obey his summons , lest , in his anger , he should
take their lives; and they appeared on the outside of the lodge . 

 " We must have a little trial of speed , now , " said Grasshopper . 

 " A race ? " they asked .  " We are very old; we can not run . " 

 " We will see , " said Grasshopper; whereupon he set them out upon the
road , and then he gave them a gentle push , which put them in motion . 
Then he pushed them again--harder--harder--until they got under fine
headway , when he gave each of them an astounding shock with his foot , 
and off they flew at a great rate , round and round the course; and such
was the magic virtue of the foot of Grasshopper , that no object once set
agoing by it could by any possibility stop; so that , for aught we know
to the contrary , the two innocent , white-headed , merry old men , are
trotting with all their might and main around the circle in which they
beguiled Grasshopper , to this day . 

Continuing his journey , Grasshopper , although his head was warm and
buzzing with all sorts of schemes , did not know exactly what to do until
he came to a big lake . He mounted a high hill to try and see to the
other side , but he could not . He then made a canoe , and sailed forth . 
The water was very clear--a transparent blue--and he saw that it
abounded with fish of a rare and delicate complexion . This circumstance
inspired him with a wish to return to his village , and to bring his
people to live near this beautiful lake . 

Toward evening , coming to a woody island , he encamped and ate the fish
he had speared , and they proved to be as comforting to the stomach as
they were pleasing to the eye . The next day Grasshopper returned to the
main land , and as he wandered along the shore he espied at a distance
the celebrated giant , Manabozho , who is a bitter enemy of Grasshopper , 
and loses no opportunity to stop him on his journeyings and to thwart
his plans . 

At first it occurred to Grasshopper to have a trial of wits with the
giant , but , on second thoughts , he said to himself ,  " I am in a hurry
now; I will see him another time . " 

With no further mischief than raising a great whirlwind of dust , which
caused Manabozho to rub his eyes severely , Grasshopper quietly slipped
out of the way; and he made good speed withal , for in much less time
than you could count half the stars in the sky of a winter night , he had
reached home . 

His return was welcomed with a great hubbub of feasting and songs; and
he had scarcely set foot in the village before he had invitations to
take pot-luck at different lodges , which would have lasted him the rest
of his natural life . Pipe-bearer , who had some time before given up the
cares of a ruler , and fallen back upon his native place , fairly danced
with joy at the sight of Grasshopper , who , not to be outdone , dandled
him affectionately in his arms , by casting him up and down in the air
half a mile or so , till little Pipe-bearer had no breath left in his
body to say that he was happy to see Grasshopper home again . 

Grasshopper gave the village folks a lively account of his adventures , 
and when he came to the blue lake and the abundant fish , he dwelt upon
their charms with such effect that they agreed , with one voice , that it
must be a glorious place to live in , and if he would show them the way
they would shift camp and settle there at once . 

He not only showed them the way , but bringing his wonderful strength and
speed of foot to bear , in less than half a day he had transported the
whole village , with its children , women , tents , and implements of war , 
to the new water-side . 

Here , for a time , Grasshopper appeared to be content , until one day a
message came for him in the shape of a bear , who said that their king
wished to see him immediately at his village . Grasshopper was ready in
an instant; and mounting upon the messenger ' s back , off he ran . Toward
evening they climbed a high mountain , and came to a cave where the
bear-king lived . He was a very large person; and puffing with fat and a
sense of his own importance , he made Grasshopper welcome by inviting him
in to his lodge . 

As soon as it was proper , he spoke , and said that he had sent for him on
hearing that he was the chief who was moving a large party toward his
hunting-grounds . 

 " You must know , " said the bear-king with a terrible growl ,  " that you
have no right there , and I wish you would leave the country with your
party , or else the strongest force will take possession . Take notice . " 

 " Very well , " replied Grasshopper , going toward the door , for he
suspected that the king of the bears was preparing to give him a hug . 
 " So be it . " 

He wished to gain time , and to consult his people; for he had seen as he
came along that the bears were gathering in great force on the side of
the mountain . He also made known to the bear-king that he would go back
that night that his people might be put in immediate possession of his
royal behest . 

The bear-king replied that Grasshopper might do as he pleased , but that
one of his young men was at his command; and , jumping nimbly on his
back , Grasshopper rode home . 

He assembled the people , and ordered the bear ' s head off , to be hung
outside of the village , that the bear-spies , who were lurking in the
neighborhood , might see it and carry the news to their chief . 

The next morning , by break of day , Grasshopper had all of his young
warriors under arms and ready for a fight . About the middle of the
afternoon the bear war-party came in sight , led on by the pursy king , 
and making a tremendous noise . They advanced on their hind-legs , and
made a very imposing display of their teeth and eyeballs . 

The bear-chief himself came forward , and with a majestic wave of his
right hand , said that he did not wish to shed the blood of the young
warriors; but that if Grasshopper , who appeared to be the head of the
war-party , consented , they two would have a race , and the winner should
kill the losing chief , and all his young men should be servants to the
other . 

Grasshopper agreed , of course--how little Pipe-bearer , who stood by , 
grinned as they came to terms ! --and they started to run before the whole
company of warriors who stood in a circle looking on . 

At first there was a prospect that Grasshopper would be badly beaten;
for although he kept crowding the great fat bear-king till the sweat
trickled from his shaggy ears , he never seemed to be able to push past
him . By and by , Grasshopper , going through a number of the most
extraordinary maneuvers in the world , raised about the great fat
bear-king such eddies and whirlwinds with the sand , and so danced about , 
before and after him , that he at last got fairly bewildered , and cried
out for them to come and take him off . Out of sight before him in
reaching the goal , Grasshopper only waited for the bear-king to come up , 
when he drove an arrow straight through him , and ordered them to take
the body away and make it ready for supper; as he was getting hungry . 

He then directed all of the other bears to fall to and help prepare the
feast; for in fulfillment of the agreement they had become servants . 
With many wry faces the bears , although bound to act becomingly in their
new character , according to the forfeit , served up the body of their
late royal master; and in doing this they fell , either by accident or
design , into many curious mistakes . 


When the feast came to be served up , and they were summoned to be in
attendance , one of them , a sprightly young fellow of an inquisitive turn
of mind , was found upon the roof of the lodge , with his head half way
down the smoke-hole , with a view to learn what they were to have for
dinner . Another , a middle-aged bear with very long arms , who was put in
charge of the children in the character of nurse , squeezed three or four
of the most promising young papooses to death , while the mothers were
outside to look after the preparations; and another , when he should
have been waiting at the back of his master , had climbed a shady tree
and was indulging in his afternoon nap . And when , at last , the dinner
was ready to be served , they came tumbling in with the dishes , heels
over head , one after the other , so that one half of the feast was spread
upon the ground , and the other half deposited out of doors , on the other
side of the lodge . 

After a while , however , by strict discipline , and threatening to cut off
their provisions , the bear-servants were brought into tolerable control . 

Yet Grasshopper , with his ever restless disposition , was uneasy; and , 
having done so many wonderful things , he resolved upon a strict and
thorough reform in all the affairs of the village . To prevent future
difficulty , he determined to adopt new regulations between the bears and
their masters . 

With this view , he issued an edict that henceforward the bears should
eat at the first table , and that the Indians were to wait upon them;
that in all public processions of an honorable character the bears
should go first; and that when any fighting was to be done , the Indians
should have the privilege reserved of receiving the first shots . A
special exemption was made in behalf of Grasshopper ' s favorite and
confidential adviser , the Pipe-bearer  ( who had been very busy in
private , recommending the new order of things ) , who was to be allowed to
sit at the head of the feast , and to stay at home with the old women in
the event of battle . 

Having seen his orders strictly enforced , and the rights of the bears
over the Indians fairly established , Grasshopper fixed his mind upon
further adventures . He determined to go abroad for a time , and having an
old score to settle with Manabozho , he set out with a hope of soon
falling in with that famous giant . Grasshopper was a blood relation of
Dais Imid , or He of the Little Shell , and had heard of what had passed
between that giant and his kinsman . 

After wandering a long time he came to the lodge of Manabozho , who was
absent . He thought he must play him a trick; and so he turned every
thing in the lodge upside down , and killed his birds , of which there was
an extraordinary attendance , for Manabozho is master of the fowls of the
air , and this was the appointed morning for them to call and pay their
court to him . Among the number was a raven , accounted the meanest of
birds , which Grasshopper killed and hung up by the neck , to insult him . 

He then went on till he came to a very high point of rocks running out
into the lake , from the top of which he could see the country , back as
far as the eye could reach . While sitting there , Manabozho ' s mountain
chickens flew around and past him in great numbers . Out of mere spite to
their master , Grasshopper shot them by the score , for his arrows were
very sure and the birds very plenty , and he amused himself by throwing
the birds down the rocks . At length a wary bird cried out:

 " Grasshopper is killing us; go and tell our father . " 

Away sped a delegation of the birds which were the quickest of wing , and
Manabozho soon made his appearance on the plain below . Grasshopper , who , 
when he is in the wrong , is no match for Manabozho , made his escape on
the other side . Manabozho , who had in two or three strides reached the
top of the mountain , cried out:

 " You are a rogue . The earth is not so large but I can get up to you . " 

Off ran Grasshopper and Manabozho after him . The race was sharp; and
such leaps and strides as they made ! Over hills and prairies , with all
his speed , went Grasshopper , and Manabozho hard upon him . Grasshopper
had some mischievous notions still left in his head which he thought
might befriend him . He knew that Manabozho was under a spell to restore
whatever he , Grasshopper , destroyed . Forthwith he stopped and climbed a
large pine-tree , stripped off its beautiful green foliage , threw it to
the winds , and then went on . 

When Manabozho reached the spot , the tree addressed him:  " Great chief , " 
said the tree ,  " will you give my life again ? Grasshopper has killed
me . " 

 " Yes , " replied Manabozho , who , as quickly as he could , gathered the
scattered leaves and branches , renewed its beauty with his breath , and
set off . Although Grasshopper in the same way compelled Manabozho to
lose time in repairing the hemlock , the sycamore , cedar , and many other
trees , the giant did not falter , but pushing briskly forward , was fast
overtaking him , when Grasshopper happened to see an elk . And asking him , 
for old acquaintance ' sake , to take him on his back , the elk did so , and
for some time he made good headway , but still Manabozho was in sight . 

He was fast gaining upon him , when Grasshopper threw himself off the
elk ' s back; and striking a great sandstone rock near the path , he broke
it into pieces , and scattered the grains in a thousand directions; for
this was nearly his last hope of escape . Manabozho was so close upon him
at this place that he had almost caught him; but the foundation of the
rock cried out , 

 " Haye ! Ne-me-sho , Grasshopper has spoiled me . Will you not restore me to
life ? " 

 " Yes , " replied Manabozho . He re-established the rock in all its
strength . 

He then pushed on in pursuit , and had got so near to Grasshopper as to
put out his arm to seize him; but Grasshopper dodged him , and , as his
last chance , he immediately raised such a dust and commotion by
whirlwinds , as made the trees break and the sand and leaves dance in the
air . Again and again Manabozho stretched his arm , but he escaped him at
every turn , and kept up such a tumult of dust that he dashed into a
hollow tree which had been blown down , changed himself into a snake , and
crept out at the roots just in time to save his life; for at that moment
Manabozho , who had the power of lightning , struck it , and it was strewn
about in little pieces . 

Again Grasshopper was in human shape , and Manabozho was pressing him
hard . At a distance he saw a very high bluff of rocks jutting out into a
lake , and he ran for the foot of the precipice which was abrupt and
elevated . As he came near , to his surprise and great relief , the Manito
of the rock opened his door and told Grasshopper to come in . The door
was no sooner closed than Manabozho knocked . 

 " Open it ! " he cried , with a loud voice . The Manito was afraid of him;
but he said to Grasshopper ,  " Since I have taken you as my guest , I would
sooner die with you than open the door . " 

 " Open it ! " Manabozho again cried , in a louder voice than before . 

The Manito kept silent . Manabozho , however , made no attempt to open it
by force . He waited a few moments . 

 " Very well , " he said;  " I give you till morning to live . " 

Grasshopper trembled , for he thought his last hour had come; but the
Manito bade him to be of good cheer . 

When the night came on the clouds were thick and black , and as they were
torn open by the lightning , such discharges of thunder were never heard
as bellowed forth . The clouds advanced slowly and wrapped the earth
about with their vast shadows as in a huge cloak . All night long the
clouds gathered , and the lightning flashed , and the thunder roared , and
above all could be heard Manabozho muttering vengeance upon poor little
Grasshopper . 

 " You have led a very foolish kind of life , Grasshopper , " said his friend
the Manito . 

 " I know it--I know it ! " Grasshopper answered . 

 " You had great gifts of strength awarded to you , " said the Manito . 

 " I am aware of it , " replied Grasshopper . 

 " Instead of employing it for useful purposes , and for the good of your
fellow-creatures , you have done nothing since you became a man but raise
whirlwinds on the highways , leap over trees , break whatever you met in
pieces , and perform a thousand idle pranks . " 

Grasshopper , with great penitence , confessed that his friend the Manito
spoke but too truly; and at last his entertainer , with a still more
serious manner , said:

 " Grasshopper , you still have your gift of strength . Dedicate it to the
good of mankind . Lay all of these wanton and vain-glorious notions out
of your head . In a word , be as good as you are strong . " 

 " I will , " answered Grasshopper .  " My heart is changed; I see the error of
my ways . " 

Black and stormy as it had been all night , when morning came the sun was
shining , the air was soft and sweet as the summer down and the blown
rose; and afar off upon the side of a mountain sat Manabozho , his head
upon his knees , languid and cast down in spirit . His power was gone , for
now Grasshopper was in the right , and he could touch him no more . 

With many thanks , Grasshopper left the good Manito , taking the nearest
way home to his own people . 

As he passed on , he fell in with an old man who was wandering about the
country in search of some place which he could not find . As soon as he
learned his difficulty , Grasshopper , placing the old man upon his back , 
hurried away , and in a short hour ' s dispatch of foot set him down among
his own kindred , of whom he had been in quest . 

Loosing no time , Grasshopper next came to an open plain , where a small
number of men stood at bay , and on the very point of being borne down
by great odds , in a force of armed warriors , fierce of aspect and of
prodigious strength . When Grasshopper saw this unequal struggle , rushing
forward he seized a long bare pole , and , wielding it with his whole
force , he drove the fierce warriors back; and , laying about him on every
hand , he soon sent them a thousand ways in great haste , and in a very
sore plight . 

Without tarrying to receive the thanks of those to whom he had brought
this timely relief , he made his utmost speed , and by the close of the
afternoon he had come in sight of his own village . What were his
surprise and horror , as he approached nearer , to discover the bears in
excellent case and flesh , seated at lazy leisure in the trees , looking
idly on while his brother Indians , for their pastime , were dancing a
fantastic and wearisome dance , in the course of which they were
frequently compelled to go upon all fours and bow their heads in
profound obeisance to their bear-masters in the trees . 

As he drew nearer , his heart sunk within him to see how starved , and
hollow-eyed , and woe-begone they were; and his horror was at its height
when , as he entered his own lodge , he beheld his favorite and friend , 
the Pipe-bearer , also on all fours , smoothing the floor with the palms
of his hands to make it a comfortable sitting-place for the bears on
their return from the dance . 

It did not take Grasshopper a long time to resolve what he should do . He
immediately resumed power in the village , bestowed a sound cudgeling
upon the bears , and sent them off to live in the mountains , among their
own people , as bears should; restored to the people all their rights;
gave them plenty to eat and drink; exerting his great strength in
hunting , in rebuilding their lodges , keeping in check their enemies , and
doing all the good he could to every body . 

Peace and plenty soon shone and showered upon the spot; and , never once
thinking of all his wild and wanton frolics , the people blessed
Grasshopper for all his kindness , and sincerely prayed that his name
might be held in honor for a thousand years to come , as no doubt it
will . 

Little Pipe-bearer stood by Grasshopper in all his course , and admired
his ways as much now that he had taken to being orderly and useful , as
in the old times , when he was walking a mile a minute , and in mere
wantonness bringing home whole forests in his arms for fire-wood , in
midsummer . 

It was a great old age to which Grasshopper lived , and when at last he
came to die , there was not a dry eye in all that part of the world where
he spent his latter days .
