It was bluebird time, many moons ago. Little brooks laughed and danced,
and all the forest was glad.

An Indian boy came running through the forest. He, too, was glad, for it
was spring!

As he ran down the trail, he saw something hanging from a bush. The bush
was but a few rabbit jumps from the trail, so he stopped to see what new
flower the spring had brought. He found the new flower to be a tiny
papoose cradle.

The boy picked the cradle from the bush, and held it in the palm of his
hand. As he looked closer, he saw that there was a tiny papoose in the
little cradle. The wee papoose laughed in his face, as he spoke to it.

The boy had never seen so tiny a papoose, and he thought he would take
it home to his mother, it was so cunning. She had but nine of her own.
He was sure she would like one more, and that there would be a place for
the tiny stranger in their wigwam.

He started to run on down the trail, but something seemed to hold him
fast. He could not get away. Three times he tried to run, but each time
he only circled round that bush. Something held him to the spot.

Just then there came a sharp cry from up the trail. The boy thought some
animal must be hurt or in pain. He turned to look and saw a little woman
coming. She was less than a foot high, but she ran like a deer to the
boy, and cried and begged him to give back her baby.

Then the boy knew it was the love of that little mother that had held
him fast. He could not break the love cord between that mother and her
baby.

Now the boy had a heart that was soft and kind. He liked to see
everything happy. When he saw the little mother crying and begging for
her baby, he felt sorry for her.

Many times he had heard his mother tell how every mother bird loves her
young; every mother bear, her cub; every mother deer, her fawn; every
Indian mother, her papoose. And he knew this little fairy mother must
also love her fairy baby, so he put it on the little mother's back, and
told her she should have her papoose.

The little mother gave a glad cry, as she felt the baby on her back once
more. Then she drew a stone from a bag which she carried, and slipped it
on a string of beads that hung from the boy's neck.

The stone shone on his breast like a dewdrop.

"Because you are good, and kind, and unselfish, and because you make
everything happy," she said, "you shall wear this good-luck stone. It
will bring you whatever you want.

"We Little People give this stone to those earth children only, who are
strong and yet protect the weak. Wear it always on your breast. Never
take it off, and you will become a mighty chief."

Then the little mother gave another glad cry, and with her baby on her
back she disappeared into an oak.

The boy ran on. His heart grew lighter and the stone brighter, as he
ran. Before he reached his mother's wigwam, his arrows had brought back
game for their evening meal.

From the day when the boy met the little _Jo gah oh_ mother in the wood,
and was given the stone, he had good luck. Whatever he did, all went
well with him. If he went on the chase, he brought back deer. If he
planted corn, it grew tall and fine. No boy could throw a ball as far,
or could run as fast as he. He could shoot his arrows to the sky, and
could send his snow-snakes skimming far beyond the rest.

So lucky was this Indian boy, that his tribe called him
"Luck-in-all-moons." "He wears the good-luck stone," the old people said
as they sat around the fire, and they nodded their heads knowingly. But
they never knew how he came by it, or why he won the stone.

And when "Luck-in-all-moons" grew to be a man, his tribe made him a
great chief. Just as the little _Jo gah oh_ mother had said, he became a
chief, though not in the chieftain line.

Because he stood so strong and straight, serving the people, protecting
the weak, and doing great deeds, he was called the Pine-tree Chief.

"His feet are planted deep in wisdom and strength," they said, "and his
head is not far from the sky. He sees far and points us the way. As the
topmost branch of the pine points always to the east, so
Luck-in-all-moons shall guide us to the sun rising. He shall be our
Pine-tree Chief."
