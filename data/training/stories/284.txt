Once upon a time , ages and ages ago , the toad had a smooth skin . In
those days he was a great gad about . He never could be found in his
own house . If any one had a party he was sure to go , no matter how far
away from home it was held , or how long it took to get there . 

One day the toad received an invitation to attend a party in the sky . 
"You never can get to this party , " said his friend , the armadillo . 
"You know how slowly you travel here upon earth . "

"Wait and see whether or not I go to the party , " said the toad . 

Not far from the toad's house there lived a big black buzzard . No one
liked the buzzard . He was very unpopular with all the birds and
beasts . The toad hopped over to the buzzard's house . The buzzard was
outside the door making music on his violin . 

"Good morning , Friend Buzzard , " said the toad . "Are you going to
attend the party in the sky ? "

The buzzard replied that he was planning to go . 

"That is good , " said the toad . "May I have the pleasure of your
company for the trip ? "

The buzzard was delighted to have the toad seek his company . It was a
new experience . 

"I'll be charmed to go to the party with you , " replied the buzzard . 
"What time shall we start ? "

"We'll start at four o'clock , " said the toad . "Come to my house and
we'll go on from there . Be sure to bring your violin with you . "

Promptly at four o'clock the buzzard arrived at the toad's house . He
had his violin with him , of course , because the toad had asked him to
bring it . 

"I'm not quite ready to go , " the toad called out . "Just leave your
violin there by the door and step inside . It will take me only a
minute to finish my toilet . "

The buzzard laid his violin carefully outside the door and went inside
the toad's house . The toad jumped through the window and hid himself
inside the violin . 

The buzzard waited and waited for the toad to get ready but he did not
hear a word from the toad . Finally he got tired of waiting . He picked
up his violin and started . 

When he arrived at the party he was a trifle late but he explained how
he had waited for the toad . 

"How foolish to wait a minute for the toad , " said his hosts . "How
could the toad ever get to a party in the sky ? We just asked him as a
joke because he is such a great gad about . Lay down your violin and
come to the feast . "

The buzzard laid down his violin . As soon as there was no one looking , 
out hopped the toad . He was laughing from ear to ear . "So they
thought I would not come to the party ! What a joke ! How surprised they
will be to see me here ! " he said . 

There was nobody at the feast who was as gay as the toad . When the
buzzard asked how he arrived he said: "I'll tell you some other day . "
Then he went on eating and dancing . 

The buzzard did not have a very good time at the party . He decided
that he would go home early . He went away without saying good-bye to
his hosts and without taking his violin with him . 

At the end of the party the toad hopped inside the violin and waited
and waited for the buzzard to take him home . Nobody picked up the
violin and the toad began to be very much worried . He almost wished
he had not come . 

After a while the falcon noticed the violin . "That violin belongs to
the buzzard . He must have forgotten to take it home . I'll carry it
back for him , " he said . 

The falcon flew towards earth with the violin . The toad shook about
terribly inside of the violin . He got very tired . The falcon got
tired , too . 

"I'm not going to carry this heavy old violin of the buzzard's another
minute , " said the falcon . "I was foolish to offer to carry it in the
first place . The buzzard is no friend of mine . "

He let the violin fall . Down , down toward earth it fell . 

"O , little stones , O , little stones , get out of my way , " called the
toad as he fell . The little stones had deaf ears . They did not get
out of the way . 

When the toad crawled out of the wrecked violin he was so covered with
bruises that he could hardly hop home . 

The buzzard never knew what became of his violin or why the toad had
lost his good looks . To this very day the toad shows his bruises . And
he is entirely cured of being a gad about .
