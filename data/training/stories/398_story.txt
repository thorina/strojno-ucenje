This masterpiece of humor was first published in 1605, and is, of
course, a work of fiction. It is unsurpassed as a picture of Spanish
life.

Millions have laughed over the adventures of that upright,
unconquered, unafraid Don Quixote, the wisest of madmen.

Cervantes set out to make fun of the romances of chivalry, which had
become ridiculous because of their extravagance, but while writing the
book he fell in love with Don Quixote for wanting to be a chivalrous
knight, and with Sancho Panza for wanting to be a loyal squire, and it
is this love for them that he makes us see on every page.

The condensed version of the stories, by Judge Parry, well preserves
the flavor of the best translation, Thomas Shelton's.
