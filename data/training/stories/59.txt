As I walk'd through the wilderness of this world , I lighted on a
certain place where was a Den , and I laid me down in that place to
sleep; and as I slept , I dreamed a Dream . I dreamed , and behold I
saw a Man cloathed with Rags , standing in a certain place , with
his face from his own house , a Book in his hand , and a great
Burden upon his back . 

I looked , and saw him open the Book , and read therein; and as he
read , he wept and trembled; and not being able longer to contain , 
he brake out with a lamentable cry , saying , What shall I do ? 

I saw also that he looked this way and that way , as if he would
run; yet he stood still , because , as I perceived , he could not
tell which way to go . I looked then , and saw a man named
Evangelist , coming to him , and asked , Wherefore dost thou cry ? 

He answered , Sir , I perceive by the Book in my hand , that I am
condemned to die , and after that to come to Judgment , and I find
that I am not willing to do the first , nor able to do the second . 

Then said Evangelist , If this be thy condition , why standest thou
still ? He answered , Because I know not whither to go . Then he gave
him a _Parchment-roll_ , and there was written within , _Fly
from the wrath to come_ . 

The Man therefore read it , and looking upon _Evangelist_ very
carefully , said , Whither must I fly ? 

Then said _Evangelist_ , pointing with his finger over a very
wide field , Do you see yonder _Wicket-gate ? The Man said , No . 
Then sad the other , Do you see yonder shining Light ? He said , I
think I do . then said _Evangelist_ , Keep that Light in your
eye , and go up directly thereto: so shalt thou see the Gate; at
which , when thou knockest , it shall be told thee what thou shalt
do . 

So I saw in my Dream that the Man began to run . 

Now he had not run far from his own door , but his Wife and
Children , perceiving it , began to cry after him to return; but the
Man put his fingers in his ears , and ran on , crying , _Life ! 
Life ! Eternal Life ! _ So he looked not behind him , but fled
towards the middle of the Plain . 

The Neighbors also came out to see him run; and as he ran , some
mocked , others threatened , and some cried after him to return; and
among those that did so , there were two that resolved to fetch him
back by force . The name of the one was _Obstinate_ , and the
name of the other was _Pliable_ . Now by this time the Man was
got a good distance from them; but however they were resolved to
pursue him , which they did , and in a little time they overtook
him . Then said the Man , Neighbors , wherefore are you come ? They
said , To persuade you to go back with us . But he said , That can by
no means be; be content , good Neighbors , and go along with me . 

OBST . What , said _Obstinate_ , and leave our friends and our
comforts behind us ! 

CHR . Yes , said _Christian_ , for that was his name , because
that _all_ which you shall forsake is not worthy to be compared
with a _little_ of that that I am seeking to enjoy; and if
you will go along with me and hold it , you shall fare as I
myself; for there where I go , is enough and to spare: Come away , 
and prove my words . Read it so , if you will , in my Book . 

OBST . Tush , said _Obstinate_ , away with your Book; will you
go back with us or no ? 

CHR . No , not I , said the other , because I have laid my hand to the
Plow . 

OBST . Come then , Neighbor _Pliable_ , let us turn again , and
go home without him . 

PLI . Well , Neighbor _Obstinate_ , said _Pliable_ , I
intend to go along with this good man , and to cast in my lot with
him . 

Now I saw in my Dream , that when _Obstinate_ was gone back , 
_Christian_ and _Pliable_ went talking over the Plain . 

They drew near to a very miry _Slough_ , that was in the midst
of the plain; and they , being heedless , did both fall suddenly
into the bog . The name of the slough was _Dispond_ . Here they
wallowed for a time , being grievously bedaubed with the dirt; and
_Christian_ , because of the Burden that was on his back , 
began to sink in the mire . 

PLI . Then said _Pliable_ , Ah Neighbor _Christian_ , where
are you now ? 

CHR . Truly , said Christian , I do not know . 

PLI . At that Pliable began to be offended , and angerly said to his
fellow , Is this the happiness you have told me all this while of ? 
If we have such ill luck at our first setting out , what may we
expect 'twixt this and our Journey's end ? May I get out again with
my life , you shall possess the Country alone . And with that he
gave a desperate struggle or two , and got out of the mire on that
side of the Slough which was next to his own house: so away he
went , and Christian saw him no more . 

Wherefore Christian was left to tumble in the Slough of Dispond
alone; he endeavoured to struggle to the side of the Slough , but
could not get out , because of the Burden that was upon his back:
But I beheld in my Dream , that a man came to him , whose name was
Help , who said , Give me thy hand: so he gave him his hand , and he
drew him out , and set him upon sound ground , and bid him go on his
way . 

EVAN . What doest thou here , Christian ? Art not thou the man that I
found crying without the walls of the City of Destruction ? 

CHR . Yes , dear Sir , I am the man . 

EVAN . Did not I direct thee the way to the little Wicket-gate ? 

CHR . Yes , dear Sir , said Christian . 

EVAN . How is it then that thou art so quickly turned aside ? for
thou art now out of the way . 

CHR . I met with a Gentleman so soon as I had got over the Slough
of Dispond , who persuaded me that I might , in the village before
me , find a man that could take off my Burden . 

EVAN . What was he ? 

CHR . He looked like a Gentleman , and talked much to me , and got me
at last to yield; so I came hither: but when I beheld this Hill , 
and how it hangs over the way , I suddenly made a stand , lest it
should fall on my head . 

EVAN . From this little Wicket-gate , and from the way thereto , hath
this wicked man turned thee , to the bringing of thee almost to
destruction; hate therefore his turning thee out of the way , and
abhor thyself for hearkening to him . 

CHR . Sir , what think you ? Is there hopes ? May I now go back and go
up to the Wicket-gate ? Shall I not be abandoned for this , and sent
back from thence ashamed ? I am sorry I have hearkened to this
man's counsel: But may my sin be forgiven ? 

EVAN . Then said _Evangelist_ to him , Thy sin is very great , 
yet will the man at the Gate receive thee , for he has good-will
for men . So _Christian_ went on with haste , neither spake he
to any man by the way; and in process of time he got up to the
Gate . Now over the Gate there was written , _Knock and it shall
be opened unto you . _

He knocked therefore more than once or twice , and at last there
came a grave person to the gate named _Good-will_ , who asked
Who was there ? and whence he came ? and what he would have ? 

CHR . I come from the City of _Destruction_ , but am going to
Mount _Zion_ , that I may be delivered from the wrath to come . 
I would therefore , Sir , since I am informed that by this Gate is
the way thither , know if you are willing to let me in . 

GOOD-WILL . I am willing with all my heart , said he; and with that
he opened the Gate . But how is it that you came alone ? 

CHR . Because none of my Neighbors saw their danger , as I saw mine . 

GOOD-WILL . Did any of them know of your coming ? 

CHR . Yes , my Wife and Children saw me at the first , and called
after me to turn again; also some of my Neighbors stood crying and
calling after me to return; but I put my fingers in my ears , and
so came on my way . 

GOOD-WILL . But did none of them follow you , to persuade you to go
back ? 

CHR . Yes , both _Obstinate_ and _Pliable_; but when they
saw that they could not prevail , _Obstinate_ went railing
back , but _Pliable_ came with me a little way . 

GOOD-WILL . But why did he not come through ? 

CHR . We indeed came both together , until we came to the Slough of
_Dispond_ , into the which we also suddenly fell . And then was
my Neighbor Pliable discouraged , and would not adventure further . 
Wherefore getting out again on that side next to his own house , he
told me I should possess the brave country alone for him; so he
went _his_ way , and I came _mine_: he after _Obstinate_ , 
and I to this Gate . 

_Christian_ began to gird up his loins , and to address
himself to his Journey . So the other told him , that some distance
from the Gate , he would come to the house of the _Interpreter_ , 
at whose door he should knock , and he would shew him excellent
things . Then _Christian_ took his leave of his Friend , and he
again bid him God speed . 

THE INTERPRETER SHOWS CHRISTIAN MANY EXCELLENT THINGS

By John Bunyan

Christian went on till he came to the house of the
_Interpreter_ , where he knocked over and over; at last one
came to the door , and asked Who was there ? 

CHR . Sir , here is a Traveller , who was bid by an acquaintance of
the good man of this house to call here for my profit; I would
therefore speak with the Master of the house . So he called for the
Master of the house , who after a little time came to _Christian_ , 
and asked him what he would have ? 

CHR . Sir , said Christian , I am a man that am come from the City of
_Destruction_ , and am going to the Mount _Zion_; and I was
told by the Man that stands at the Gate at the head of this
way , that if I called here , you would shew me excellent things , 
such as would be a help to me in my Journey . 

INTER . Then said the Interpreter , Come in , I will shew thee that
which will be profitable to thee . 

I saw moreover in my Dream , that the _Interpreter_ took him
by the hand , and had him into a little room , where sat two little
Children , each one in his chair . The name of the eldest was
_Passion_ , and the name of the other _Patience_ . _Passion_
seemed to be much discontent; but _Patience_ was very quiet . 
Then _Christian_ asked , What is the reason of the discontent
of _Passion_ ? The _Interpreter_ answered , The Governor
of them would have him stay for his best things till the
beginning of the next year; but he will have all now; but _Patience_
is willing to wait . 

Then I saw that one came to _Passion_ , and brought him a bag
of treasure , and poured it down at his feet , the which he took up
and rejoiced therein; and withal , laughed _Patience_ to
scorn . But I beheld but a while , and he had lavished all away , and
had nothing left but Rags . 

CHR . Then said _Christian_ to the _Interpreter_ , Expound
this matter more fully to me . 

INTER . So he said , These two Lads are figures: _Passion_ , of
the men of _this_ world; and _Patience_ , of the men of _that_
which is to come; for as here thou seest , _Passion_ will
have all now this year , that is to say , in this world; so
are the men of this world: they must have all their good
things now , they cannot stay till next year , that is , until
the next world , for their portion of good . That proverb , _A Bird
in the Hand is worth two in the Bush_ , is of more authority
with them than are all the Divine testimonies of the good of the
world to come . But as thou sawest that he had quickly lavished all
away , and had presently left him nothing but Rags; so will it be
with all such men at the end of this world . 

CHR . Then said _Christian_ , Now I see that _Patience_
has the best wisdom , and that upon many accounts . 1 . Because he
stays for the best things . 2 . And also because he will have the
Glory of his , when the other has nothing but Rags . 

INTER . Nay , you may add another , to wit , the glory of the
_next_ world will never wear out; but _these_ are suddenly
gone , Therefore _Passion_ had not so much reason to laugh
at _Patience_ , because he had his good things first , as _Patience_
will have to laugh at _Passion_ , because he had his best
things last; for _first_ must give place to _last_ , because
_last_ must have his time to come; but last gives place to
nothing; for there is not another to succeed , He therefore
that hath his portion _first_ , must needs have a time to
spend it; but he that hath his portion _last_ , must have
it lastingly; therefore it is said of Dives , _In thy lifetime
thou receivedst thy good things , and likewise_ Lazartis
_evil things; but now he is comforted , and thou art tormented_ . 

CHR . Then I perceive 'tis not best to covet things that are now , 
but to wait for things to come . 

INTER . You say truth: _For the things which are seen are_
Temporal; _but the things that are not seen are_ Eternal . But
though this be so , yet since things present and our fleshly
appetite are such near neighbors one to another; and , again , 
because things to come and carnal sense are such strangers one to
another; therefore it is that the first of these so suddenly fell
into _amity_ , and that _distance_ is so continued between the second . 

Then I saw in my Dream that the _Interpreter_ took
_Christian_ by the hand , and led him into a place where was a
Fire burning against a wall , and one standing by it , always
casting much Water upon it , to quench it; yet did the Fire burn
higher and hotter . 

Then said _Christian , _ What means this ? 

The _Interpreter answered , _ This Fire is the work of Grace
that is wrought in the heart; he that casts Water upon it , to
extinguish and put it out , is the _Devil;_ but in that thou
seest the Fire notwithstanding burn higher and hotter , thou shalt
also see the reason of that . So he had him about to the backside
of the wall , where he saw a man with a Vessel of Oil in his hand , 
of the which he did also continually cast ( but secretly ) into the
Fire . 

Then said _Christian , _ What means this ? 

The _Interpreter answered , _ This is Christ , who continually , 
with the Oil of his Grace , maintains the work already begun in the
heart: by the means of which notwithstanding what the Devil can
do , the souls of his people prove gracious still . And in that thou
sawest that the man stood behind the wall to maintain the Fire , 
that is to teach thee that it is hard for the tempted to see how
this work of Grace is maintained in the soul . 

I saw also that the _Interpreter_ took him again by the hand , 
and led him into a pleasant place , where was builded a stately
Palace , beautiful to behold; at the sight of which _Christian_
was greatly delighted: He saw also upon the top thereof , 
certain persons walking , who were cloathed all in gold . 

Then said _Christian , _ May we go in thither ? 

Then the _Interpreter_ took him , and led him up toward the
door of the Palace; and behold , at the door stood a great company
of men , as desirous to go in , but durst not . There also sat a man
at a little distance from the door , at a table-side , with a Book
and his Inkhorn before him , to take the name of him that should
enter therein; He saw also , that in the door-way stood many men in
armour to keep it , being resolved to do the men that would enter
what hurt and mischief they could . Now was _Christian_ somewhat
in a maze . At last , when every man started back for fear of
the armed men , _Christian_ saw a man of a very stout countenance
come up to the man that sat there to write , saying , _Set down
my name , Sir_: the which when he had done , he saw the man
draw his Sword , and put an Helmet upon his head , and rush
toward the door upon the armed men , who laid upon him with deadly
force; but the man , not at all discouraged , fell to cutting and
hacking most fiercely . So after , he had received and given many
wounds to those that attempted to keep him out , he cut his way
through them all , and pressed forward into the Palace , at which
there was a pleasant voice heard from those that were within , even
of those that walked upon the top of the Palace , saying , 

 Come in , Come in;
 Eternal Glory thou shalt win . 

So he went in , and was cloathed with such garments as they . Then
_Christian_ smiled , and said , I think verily I know the
meaning of this . 

Now , said _Christian_ , let me go hence . Nay , stay , said the
_Interpreter_ , till I have shewed thee a little more , and
after that thou shalt go on thy way . So he took him by the hand
again , and led him into a very dark room , where there sat a man
in an Iron Cage . 

Now the Man , to look on , seemed very sad; he sat with his eyes
looking down to the ground , his hands folded together; and he
sighed as if he would break his heart . Then said _Christian_ , 
_What means this ? _ At which the _Interpreter_ bid him talk
with the Man . 

Then said _Christian_ to the Man , _What art thou ? _ The
Man answered , _I am what I was not once . _

CHR . What wast thou once ? 

MAN . The Man said , I was once a fair and flourishing Professor , 
both in mine own eyes , and also in the eyes of others; I once was , 
as I thought , fair for the Coelestial City , and had then even joy
at the thoughts that I should get thither . 

CHR . Well , but what art thou now ? 

MAN . I am now a man of _Despair_ , and am shut up in it , as in
this Iron Cage . I cannot get out; O _now_ I cannot . 

CHR . But how camest thou in this condition ? 

MAN . I left off to watch and be sober; I laid the reins upon the
neck of my lusts; I sinned against the light of the Word and the
goodness of God; I have grieved the Spirit , and he is gone; I
tempted the Devil , and he is come to me; I have provoked God to
anger , and he has left me; I have so hardened my heart , that I
_cannot_ repent . 

Then said _Christian_ to the _Interpreter_ , But are
there no hopes for such a man as this ? Ask him , said the
_Interpreter_ . 

CHR . Then said _Christian_ , Is there no hope , but you must be
kept in the Iron Cage of Despair ? 

MAN . No , none at all . 

CHR . Why ? The Son of the Blessed is very pitiful . 

MAN . I have crucified him to myself afresh , I have despised his
Person , I have despised his Righteousness , I have counted his
Blood an unholy thing; I have done despite to the Spirit of Grace:
Therefore I have shut myself out of all the Promises , and there
now remains to me nothing but threatnings , dreadful threatnings , 
fearful threatnings of certain Judgment and fiery Indignation , 
which shall devour me as an Adversary . 

CHR . For what did you bring yourself into this condition ? 

MAN . For the Lusts , Pleasures , and Profits of this World; in the
enjoyment of which I did then promise myself much delight; but now
every one of those things also bite me , and gnaw me like a burning
worm . 

CHR . But canst thou not now repent and turn ? 

MAN . God hath denied me repentance: his Word gives me no
encouragement to believe; yea , himself hath shut me up in this
Iron Cage; nor can all the men in the world let me out . O
Eternity ! Eternity ! how shall I grapple with the misery that I
must meet with in Eternity ! 

INTER . Then said the _Interpreter_ to _Christian_ , Let
this man's misery be remembered by thee , and be an everlasting
caution to thee . 

CHR . Well , said _Christian_ , this is fearful; God help me to
watch and be sober , and to pray that I may shun the cause of this
man's misery . Sir , is it not time for me to go on my way now ? 

INTER . Tarry till I shall shew thee one thing more , and then thou
shalt go thy way . 

So he took _Christian_ by the hand again , and led him into a
Chamber , where there was one rising out of bed; and as he put on
his raiment , he shook and trembled . Then said _Christian_ , 
Why doth this man thus tremble ? The _Interpreter_ then bid
him tell to _Christian_ the reason of his so doing . So he
began and said , This night , as I was in my sleep , I dreamed , and
behold the Heavens grew exceeding black; also it thundred and
lightned in most fearful wise , that it put me into an agony; so I
looked up in my Dream , and saw the Clouds rack at an unusual rate , 
upon which I heard a great sound of a Trumpet , and saw also a Man
sit upon a Cloud , attended with the thousands of Heaven; they were
all in flaming fire , also the Heavens were in a burning flame . I
heard then a Voice saying , _Arise ye dead , and come to Judgment_;
and with that the Rocks rent , the Graves opened , and the
Dead that were therein came forth . Some of them were exceeding
glad , and looked upward; and some sought to hide themselves under
the Mountains . Then I saw the Man that sat upon the Cloud open the
Book , and bid the World draw near . Yet there was , by reason of a
fierce flame which issued out and came from before him , a
convenient distance betwixt him and them , as betwixt the Judge and
the Prisoners at the bar . I heard it also proclaimed to them that
attended on the Man that sat on the Cloud , _Gather together the
Tares , the Chaff , and Stubble , and cast them into the burning
Lake_ . And with that , the bottomless pit opened , just whereabout
I stood; out of the mouth of which there came in an abundant
manner , smoke and coals of fire , with hideous noises . It
was also said to the same persons , _Gather my Wheat into the
Garner_ . And with that I saw many catch'd up and carried away
into the Clouds , but I was left behind . I also sought to hide
myselfs but I could not , for the Man that sat upon the Cloud still
kept his eye upon me: my sins also came into my mind; and my
Conscience did accuse me on every side . Upon this I awaked from my
sleep . 

CHR . But what was it that made you so afraid of this sight ? 

MAN . Why , I thought that the day of Judgment was come , and that I
was not ready for it: but this frighted me most , that the Angels
gathered up several , and left me behind; also the pit of Hell
opened her mouth just where I stood: my Conscience too afflicted
me; and as I thought , the Judge had always his eye upon me , 
shewing indignation in his countenance . 

Then said the _Interpreter_ to _Christian , Hast thou
considered all these things_ ? 

CHR . Yes , and they put me in _hope_ and _fear_ . 

INTER . Well , keep all things so in thy mind that they may be as a
Goad in thy sides , to prick thee forward in the way thou must go . 
Then _Christian_ began to gird up his loins , and address
himself to his Journey . Then said the _Interpreter_ , The
Comforter be always with thee , good _Christian_ , to guide
thee in the way that leads to the City . So _Christian_ went
on his way .
