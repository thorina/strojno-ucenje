 Chip had plenty of nuts on Thanksgiving Day. The little lady
 called Heart's Delight saw to that. Can you guess who Chip
 was?


They had got "way through," as Terry said, to the nuts. It had been a
beautiful Thanksgiving dinner "so far." Grandmother's sweet face
beamed down the length of the great table, over all the little crinkly
grandheads, at grandfather's face. Everybody felt very thankful.
