I yearn to breathe the airs of heaven
 That often meet me here.

I muse on joy that will not cease,
 Pure spaces clothed in living beams,

Pure lilies of eternal peace,
 Whose odours haunt my dreams;

And, stricken by an angel's hand,
 This mortal armour that I wear,

This weight and size, this heart and eyes,
 Are touch'd, are turn'd to finest air.
