King Horn, in the version here given, is a fine old English story,
evidently very popular with the common people. Earlier versions were
probably familiar to the Norse in the tenth century, at which time
Dublin was the capital of a Norse kingdom. Suddenne was possibly the
Isle of Man.

There seems to be some historical basis for the story of Havelok,
since the seal of the city of Grimsby today represents Grim with
"Habloc," or Havelok, on his right hand, and Goldborough on his left.

The Fair Unknown is one of the King Arthur stories that is not
included in Sir Thomas Malory's Morte d'Arthur.
