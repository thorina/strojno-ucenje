Geoffrey Chaucer, born about 1340, was the first great English poet.
The immense popularity of the Canterbury Tales is shown by the number
of manuscript copies still in existence. It was one of the first books
printed in England.

The vividness with which the author describes scenes and events and
people, as if he had them before his eyes, is one of his greatest
charms as a writer. Those who know him best place him second only to
Shakespeare as a writer of delightful English.

The spelling of Chaucer's time differs so much from ours that the
difficulty of reading it discourages a great many people. The few
stories here given are retold in the language of to-day.
