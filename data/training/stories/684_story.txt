For them I battle till the end,
 To save from shame and thrall:

But all my heart is drawn above,
 My knees are bow'd in crypt and shrine:

I never felt the kiss of love,
 Nor maiden's hand in mine.

More bounteous aspects on me beam,
 Me mightier transports move and thrill;

So keep I fair thro' faith and prayer
 A virgin heart in work and will.
