It came to pass , in the days when the judges ruled , that there was a
famine in the land . And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah went to
sojourn in the country of Moab--he and his wife and his two sons . And
the name of the man was Elimelech , and the name of his wife Naomi , and
the names of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion , Ephrathites of
Bethlehem-judah . And they came into the country of Moab , and continued
there . 

And Elimelech , Naomi's husband , died; and she was left and her two
sons . And they took them wives of the women of Moab: the name of the
one was Orpah , and the name of the other was Ruth . And they dwelled
there about ten years . 

And Mahlon and Chilion died also , both of them; and the woman was left
of her two sons and her husband . Then she arose with her
daughters-in-law , that she might return from the country of Moab; for
she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his
people in giving them bread . Wherefore she went forth out of the place
where she was , and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on
the way to return unto the land of Judah . 

And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law , "Go , return each to her
mother's house . The Lord deal kindly with you , as ye have dealt with
the dead and with me . The Lord grant you that ye may find rest , each
of you in this house of her husband . " Then she kissed them . 

And they lifted up their voice and wept; and they said unto her , 
"Surely , we will return with thee unto thy people . "

And Naomi said , "Turn again , my daughters; why will ye go with me ? 
Turn again , my daughters , go your way . "

And they lifted up their voice and wept again . And Orpah kissed her
mother-in-law; but Ruth clave unto her . 

And she said , "Behold , thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people
and unto her gods ! Return thou after thy sister-in-law . "

And Ruth said , "Intreat me not to leave thee , or to return from
following after thee . For whither thou goest I will go , and where thou
lodgest I will lodge: thy people shall be my people , and thy God my
God: where thou diest will I die , and there will I be buried . The Lord
do so to me , and more also , if aught but death part thee and me . "

When Naomi saw that Ruth was steadfastly minded to go with her , then
she left speaking unto her . So they two went until they came to
Bethlehem . 

And it came to pass , when they were come to Bethlehem , that all the
city was moved about them , and they said , "Is this Naomi ? "

And she said unto them , "Call me not Naomi [pleasant] , call me Mara
[bitter]; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me . I went
out full , and the Lord hath brought me home again empty . Why then call
ye me Naomi , seeing that the Lord hath testified against me , and the
Almighty hath afflicted me ? "

So Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter-in-law , with
her , which returned out of the country of Moab; and they came to
Bethlehem in the beginning of barley-harvest . 

And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's , a mighty man of wealth , of
the family of Elimelech , and his name was Boaz . 

And Ruth said unto Naomi: "Let me now go to the field and glean ears
of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace . "

And Naomi said unto her , "Go , my daughter . "

And she went , and came , and gleaned in the field after the reapers;
and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz , 
who was of the kindred of Elimelech . 

And , behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem and said unto the reapers , "The
Lord be with you ! "

And they answered him , "The Lord bless thee ! "

Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers , "Whose
damsel is this ? "

And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said , "It
is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country
of Moab . And she said , 'I pray you , let me glean and gather after the
reapers among the sheaves . ' So she came , and hath continued even from
the morning until now , that she tarried a little in the house . "

Then said Boaz unto Ruth , "Hearest thou not , my daughter ? Go not to
glean in another field , neither go from hence , but abide here fast by
my maidens; let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap , and go
thou after them . Have I not charged the young men that they shall not
touch thee ? And when thou art a thirst , go unto the vessels , and drink
of that which the young men have drawn . "

Then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said
unto him , "Why have I found grace in thine eyes , that thou shouldest
take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ? "

And Boaz answered and said unto her , "It hath fully been showed me , 
all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law , since the death of
thine husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and
the land of thy nativity , and art come unto a people which thou
knewest not heretofore . The Lord recompense thy work , and a full
reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel , under whose wings thou
art come to trust . "

Then she said , "Let me find favour in thy sight , my lord; for that
thou hast comforted me , and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto
thine handmaid , though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens . "

And Boaz said unto her at meal-time , "Come thou hither , and eat of the
bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar . "

And she sat beside the reapers , and he reached her parched corn; and
she did eat , and was sufficed , and left . 

And when she was risen up to glean , Boaz commanded his young men , 
saying , "Let her glean even among the sheaves , and reproach her not;
and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her , and leave
them that she may glean them , and rebuke her not . "

So she gleaned in the field until even , and beat out that she had
gleaned , and it was about an ephah of barley . And she took it up and
went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned , 
and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved after she
was sufficed . 

And her mother-in-law said unto her , "Where hast thou gleaned to-day , 
and where wroughtest thou ? Blessed be he that did take knowledge of
thee ! "

And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought , and said , 
"The man's name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz . "

And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law , "Blessed be he of the Lord , 
who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead . The
man is near of kin unto us; one of our next kinsmen . "

And Ruth the Moabitess said , "He said unto me also , 'Thou shalt keep
fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest . '"

And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law , "It is good , my
daughter , that thou go out with his maidens , that they meet thee not
in any other field . "

So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of
barley-harvest and of wheat-harvest , and dwelt with her mother-in-law . 

Then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her , "My daughter , shall I not
seek rest for thee , that it may be well with thee ? And now is not Boaz
of our kindred , with whose maidens thou wast ? Behold , he winnoweth
barley to-night in the threshing-floor . Wash thyself , therefore , and
anoint thee , and put thy raiment upon thee , and get thee down to the
floor; but make not thyself known unto the man , until he shall have
done eating and drinking . And it shall be , when he lieth down , that
thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie; and thou shalt go in and
uncover his feet and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou
shalt do . "

And Ruth said unto her , "All that thou sayest unto me I will do . " And
she went down unto the floor , and did according to all that her
mother-in-law bade her . 

And when Boaz had eaten and drunk , and his heart was merry , he went to
lie down at the end of the heap of corn . And she came softly and
uncovered his feet , and laid her down . 

And it came to pass at midnight , that the man was afraid , and turned
himself; and behold ! a woman lay at his feet . And he said , "Who art
thou ? "

And she answered , "I am Ruth , thine handmaid . Spread therefore thy
skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman . "

And he said , "Blessed be thou of the Lord , my daughter; for thou hast
showed more kindness in the latter end than in the beginning; inasmuch
as thou followedst not young men , whether poor or rich . And now , my
daughter , fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest; for all
the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman . And
now it is true that I am thy near kinsman; howbeit , there is a kinsman
nearer than I . Tarry this night , and it shall be , in the morning , that
if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman , well; let him do
the kinsman's part; but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to
thee , then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee , as the Lord
liveth . Lie down until the morning . "

And she lay at his feet until the morning . And she rose up before one
could know another . 

And he said , "Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor . "
Also he said , "Bring the veil that thou hast upon thee and hold it . "

And when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on
her . 

And she went into the city , and when she came to her mother-in-law she
said , "Who art thou , my daughter ? "

And she told her all that the man had done to her; and she said , 
"These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me , 'Go not
empty unto thy mother-in-law . '"

Then Naomi said , "Sit still , my daughter , until thou know how the
matter will fall; for the man will not be in rest until he have
finished the thing this day . "

Then went Boaz up to the gate , and sat him down there . And , behold , 
the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by , unto whom he said , "Ho , such a
one ! turn aside , sit down here . "

And he turned aside , and sat down . 

And Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city , and said , "Sit ye
down here . "

And they sat down . 

And he said unto the kinsman , "Naomi , that is come again out of the
country of Moab , selleth a parcel of land which was our brother
Elimelech's; and I thought to advertise thee , saying , 'Buy it before
the inhabitants , and before the elders of my people . If thou wilt
redeem it , redeem it; but if thou wilt not redeem it , then tell me , 
that I may know; for there is none to redeem it beside thee , and I am
after thee . '"

And he said , "I will redeem it . "

Then said Boaz , "What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi , 
thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of the dead , to
raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance . "

And the kinsman said , "I cannot redeem it for myself , lest I mar mine
own inheritance . Redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem
it . "

Now this was the manner in former time in Israel , concerning redeeming
and concerning changing , for to confirm all things: a man plucked off
his shoe , and gave it to his neighbour; and this was a testimony in
Israel . Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz:

"Buy it for thee . " So he drew off his shoe . 

And Boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people , "Ye are
witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Elimelech's , and
all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's at the hand of Naomi . Moreover , 
Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of Mahlon , have I purchased to be my
wife , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance , that the
name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren , and from the
gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day . "

And all the people that were in the gate , and the elders , said: "We
are witnesses . The Lord make the woman that is come into thine house
like Rachel and like Leah , which two did build the house of Israel;
and do thou worthily in Ephratah , and be famous in Bethlehem; and let
thy house be like the house of Pharez , whom Tamar bare unto Judah , of
the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman . "

So Boaz took Ruth , and she was his wife . 

And Ruth bare a son . And the women said unto Naomi , "Blessed be the
Lord , which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman , that his
name may be famous in Israel . And he shall be unto thee a restorer of
thy life , and a nourisher of thine old age; for thy daughter-in-law , 
which loveth thee , which is better to thee than seven sons , hath borne
him . "

And Naomi took the child , and laid it in her bosom , and became nurse
unto it . And the women , her neighbours , gave it a name , saying , "There
is a son born to Naomi" ! and they called his name Obed .
