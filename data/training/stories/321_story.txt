 A story of the time long ago when the Pilgrims of Plymouth
 invited the Indian chief Massasoit and his followers to
 share their feast.


All through the first summer and the early part of autumn the Pilgrims
were busy and happy. They had planted and cared for their first fields
of corn. They had found wild strawberries in the meadows, raspberries
on the hillsides, and wild grapes in the woods.
