Mabinogion means Tales, and it is the name given to the collection of
popular tales belonging to the people of Wales. The Welsh is a very
old language, one of the oldest in Europe, with poems dating from the
sixth century. It is so much a spoken language, and so little a
printed language, that it was only in recent years that the tales were
translated into English by Lady Charlotte Guest. The following stories
have been retold from her text.
