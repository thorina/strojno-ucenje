Once upon a time Luck met Intelligence on a garden-seat . "Make room for
me ! " said Luck . Intelligence was then as yet inexperienced , and didn't
know who ought to make room for whom . He said: "Why should I make room
for you ? you're no better than I . " "He's the better man , " answered Luck , 
"who performs most . See you there yon peasant's son who's ploughing in
the field ? Enter into him , and if he gets on better through you than
through me , I'll always submissively make way for you , whensoever and
wheresoever we meet . " Intelligence agreed , and entered at once into the
ploughboy's head . As soon as the ploughboy felt that he had intelligence
in his head , he began to think: "Why must I follow the plough to the day
of my death ? I can go somewhere else and make my fortune more easily . "
He left off ploughing , put up the plough , and drove home . "Daddy , " says
he , "I don't like this peasant's life; I'd rather learn to be a
gardener . " His father said: "What ails you , Vanek ? have you lost your
wits ? " However , he bethought himself and said: "Well , if you will , 
learn , and God be with you ! Your brother will be heir to the cottage
after me . " Vanek lost the cottage , but he didn't care for that , but went
and put himself apprentice to the king's gardener . For every little that
the gardener showed him , Vanek comprehended ever so much more . Ere long
he didn't even obey the gardener's orders as to how he ought to do
anything , but did everything his own way . At first the gardener was
angry , but , seeing everything thus getting on better , he was content . "I
see that you've more intelligence than I , " said he , and henceforth let
Vanek garden as he thought fit . In no long space of time Vanek made the
garden so beautiful that the king took great delight in it , and
frequently walked in it with the queen and with his only daughter . 

The princess was a very beautiful damsel , but ever since she was twelve
years old she had ceased speaking , and no one ever heard a single word
from her . The king was much grieved , and caused a proclamation to be
made that whoever should bring it to pass that she should speak again , 
should be her husband . Many young kings , princes , and other great lords
announced themselves one after the other , but all went away as they had
come; no one succeeded in causing her to speak . "Why shouldn't I try my
luck ? " thought Vanek; "who knows whether I mayn't succeed in bringing
her to answer when I ask her a question ? " He at once caused himself to
be announced at the palace , and the king and his councillors conducted
him into the room where the princess was . The king's daughter had a
pretty little dog , and was very fond of him , because he was so clever , 
understanding everything that she wanted . When Vanek went into the room
with the king and his councillors , he made as if he didn't even see the
princess , but turned to the dog and said: "I have heard , doggie , that
you are very clever , and I come to you for advice . We are three
companions in travel , a sculptor , a tailor , and myself . Once upon a time
we were going through a forest and were obliged to pass the night in it . 
To be safe from wolves , we made a fire , and agreed to keep watch one
after the other . The sculptor kept watch first , and for amusement to
kill time took a log and carved a damsel out of it . When it was
finished , he woke the tailor to keep watch in his turn . The tailor , 
seeing the wooden damsel , asked what it meant . 'As you see , ' said the
sculptor , 'I was weary , and didn't know what to do with myself , so I
carved a damsel out of a log; if you find time hang heavy on your hands , 
you can dress her . ' The tailor at once took out his scissors , needle and
thread , cut out the clothes , stitched away , and , when they were ready , 
dressed the damsel in them . He then called me to come and keep watch . I , 
too , asked him what the meaning of all this was . 'As you see , ' said the
tailor , 'the sculptor found time hang heavy on his hands and carved a
damsel out of a log , and I for the same reason clothed her; and if you
find time hanging on your hands , you can teach her to speak . ' And by
morning dawn I had actually taught her to speak . But in the morning when
my companions woke up , each wanted to possess the damsel . The sculptor
said , 'I made her;' the tailor , 'I clothed her . ' I , too , maintained my
right . Tell me , therefore , doggie , to which of us the damsel belongs . "
The dog said nothing , but instead of the dog the princess replied: "To
whom can she belong but to yourself ? What's the good of the sculptor's
damsel without life ? What's the good of the tailor's dressing without
speech ? You gave her the best gift , life and speech , and therefore she
by right belongs to you . " "You have passed your own sentence , " said
Vanek; "I have given you speech again and a new life , and you therefore
by right belong to me . " Then said one of the king's councillors: "His
Royal Grace will give you a plenteous reward for succeeding in unloosing
his daughter's tongue; but you cannot have her to wife , as you are of
mean lineage . " The king said: "You are of mean lineage; I will give you
a plenteous reward instead of our daughter . " But Vanek wouldn't hear of
any other reward , and said: "The king promised without any exception , 
that whoever caused his daughter to speak again should be her husband . A
king's word is law; and if the king wants others to observe his laws , he
must first keep them himself . Therefore the king _must_ give me his
daughter . " "Seize and bind him ! " shouted the councillor . "Whoever says
the king _must_ do anything , offers an insult to his Majesty , and is
worthy of death . May it please your Majesty to order this malefactor to
be executed with the sword ? " The king said: "Let him be executed . " Vanek
was immediately bound and led to execution . When they came to the place
of execution Luck was there waiting for him , and said secretly to
Intelligence: "See how this man has got on through you , till he has to
lose his head ! Make way , and let me take your place ! " As soon as Luck
entered Vanek , the executioners sword broke against the scaffold , just
as if some one had snapped it; and before they brought him another , up
rode a trumpeter on horseback from the city , galloping as swift as a
bird , trumpeted merrily , and waved a white flag , and after him came the
royal carriage for Vanek . This is what had happened: The princess had
told her father at home that Vanek had but spoken the truth , and the
king's word ought not to be broken . If Vanek were of mean lineage the
king could easily make him a prince . The king said: "You're right; let
him be a prince ! " The royal carriage was immediately sent for Vanek , and
the councillor who had irritated the king against him was executed in
his stead . Afterward , when Vanek and the princess were going together in
a carriage from the wedding , Intelligence happened to be somewhere on
the road , and seeing that he couldn't help meeting Luck , bent his head
and slipped on one side , just as if cold water had been thrown upon him . 
And from that time forth it is said that Intelligence has always given a
wide berth to Luck whenever he has had to meet him .
