A long , long time ago , Prince Cuglas , [4] master of the hounds to the
high King of Erin , set out from Tara to the chase . As he was leaving the
palace the light mists were drifting away from the hill-tops , and the
rays of the morning sun were falling aslant on the _grinan_ or sunny
bower of the Princess Ailinn . Glancing towards it the prince doffed his
plumed and jeweled hunting-cap , and the princess answered his salute
by a wave of her little hand , that was as white as a wild rose in the
hedges in June , and leaning from her bower , she watched the huntsman
until his tossing plumes were hidden by the green waving branches of
the woods . 

The Princess Ailinn was over head and ears in love with Cuglas , and
Cuglas was over head and ears in love with the Princess Ailinn , and he
believed that never was summer morning half as bright , or as sweet , or
as fair as she . The glimpse which he had just caught of her filled his
heart with delight , and almost put all thought of hunting out of his
head , when suddenly the tuneful cries of the hounds , answered by a
hundred echoes from the groves , broke upon his ear . 

The dogs had started a dappled deer that bounded away through the
forest . The prince , spurring his gallant steed , pushed on in eager
pursuit . 

On through the forest sped the deer , through soft , green , secret ways
and flowery dells , then out from the forest , up heathery hills , and over
long stretches of moorland , and across brown rushing streams , sometimes
in view of the hounds , sometimes lost to sight , but always ahead of
them . 

All day long the chase continued , and at last , when the sun was sinking , 
the dogs were close upon the panting deer , and the prince believed he
was about to secure his game , when the deer suddenly disappeared through
the mouth of a cave which opened before him . The dogs followed at his
heels , and the prince endeavored to rein in his steed , but the impetuous
animal bore him on , and soon was clattering over the stony floor of the
cave in perfect darkness . Cuglas could hear ahead of him the cries of
the hounds growing fainter and fainter , as they increased the distance
between them and him . Then the cries ceased altogether , and the only
sound the prince heard was the noise of his horse's hoofs sounding in
the hollow cave . Once more he endeavored to check his career , but the
reins broke in his hands , and in that instant the prince felt the horse
had taken a plunge into a gulf , and was sinking down and down , as a
stone cast from the summit of a cliff sinks down to the sea . At last the
horse struck the ground again , and the prince was almost thrown out of
his saddle , but he succeeded in regaining his seat . Then on through
the darkness galloped the steed , and when he came into the light the
prince's eyes were for some time unable to bear it . But when he got used
to the brightness he saw he was galloping over a grassy plain , and in
the distance he perceived the hounds rushing towards a wood faintly
visible through a luminous summer haze . The prince galloped on , and as
he approached the wood he saw coming towards him a comely champion , 
wearing a shining brown cloak , fastened by a bright bronze spear-like
brooch , and bearing a white hazel wand in one hand , and a single-edged
sword with a hilt made from the tooth of a sea-horse in the other;[5]
and the prince knew by the dress of the champion , and by his wand and
sword , that he was a royal herald . As the herald came close to him the
prince's steed stopped of his own accord . 

"You are welcome , Cuglas , " said the herald , "and I have been sent by the
Princess Crede to greet you and to lead you to her court , where you have
been so long expected . "

"I know not how this may be , " said Cuglas . 

"How it has come about I shall tell you as we go along , " said the
herald . "The Princess Crede is the Queen of the Floating Island . And it
chanced , once upon a day , when she was visiting her fairy kinsmen , who
dwell in one of the pleasant hills that lie near Tara , she saw you with
the high king and princes and nobles of Erin following the chase . And
seeing you her heart went out to you , and wishing to bring you to her
court , she sent one of her nymphs , in the form of a deer , to lure you
on through the cave , which is the entrance to this land . "

"I am deeply honored by the preference shown me by the princess , " said
Cuglas , "but I may not tarry in her court; for above in Erin there is
the Lady Ailinn , the loveliest of all the ladies who grace the royal
palace , and before the princes and chiefs of Erin she has promised to
be my bride . "

"Of that I know not , " said the herald; "but a true champion , like you , 
cannot , I know , refuse to come with me to the court of the Princess
Crede . "

As the herald had said these words the prince and he were on the verge
of the wood , and they entered upon a mossy pathway that broadened out as
they advanced until it was as wide as one of the great roads of Erin . 
Before they had gone very far the prince heard the tinkling of silver
bells in the distance , and almost as soon as he heard them he saw
coming up towards him a troop of warriors on coal black steeds . All the
warriors wore helmets of shining silver , and cloaks of blue silk . And
on the horses' breasts were crescents of silver , on which were hung tiny
silver bells , shaking out music with the motion of the horses . As the
prince approached the champions they lowered their spears , and dividing
in two lines the prince and the herald passed between the ranks , and the
champions , forming again , followed on behind the prince . 

At last they passed through the wood , and they found themselves on a
green plain , speckled with flowers , and they had not gone far when the
prince saw coming towards him a hundred champions on snow-white steeds , 
and around the breast of the steeds were crescents of gold , from which
were hanging little golden bells . [6] The warriors all wore golden
helmets , and the shafts of their shining spears were of gold , and golden
sandals on their feet , and yellow silken mantles fell down over their
shoulders . And when the prince came near them they lowered their lances , 
and then they turned their horses' heads around and marched before him . 
And it was not long until above the pleasant jingle of the bells the
prince heard the measured strains of music , and he saw coming towards
him a band of harpers , dressed in green and gold , and when the harpers
had saluted the prince they marched in front of the cavalcade , playing
all the time , and it was not long until they came to a stream that ran
like a blue riband around the foot of a green hill , on the top of which
was a sparkling palace; the stream was crossed by a golden bridge , so
narrow that the horsemen had to go two-by-two . The herald asked the
prince to halt and to allow all the champions to go before him; and the
cavalcade ascended the hill , the sunlight brightly glancing on helmet
and on lance , and when it reached the palace the horsemen filed around
the walls . 

When at length the prince and herald crossed the bridge and began
to climb the hill , the prince thought he felt the ground moving under
them , and on looking back he could see no sign of the golden bridge , 
and the blue stream had already become as wide as a great river , and
was becoming wider every second . 

"You are on the floating island now , " said the herald , "and before you
is the palace of the Princess Crede . "

At that moment the queen came out through the palace door , and the
prince was so dazzled by her beauty , that only for the golden bracelet
he wore upon his right arm , under the sleeve of his silken tunic , he
might almost have forgotten the Princess Ailinn . This bracelet was made
by the dwarfs who dwell in the heart of the Scandinavian Mountains , and
was sent with other costly presents by the King of Scandinavia to the
King of Erin , and he gave it to the princess , and it was the virtue of
this bracelet , that whoever was wearing it could not forget the person
who gave it to him , and it could never be loosened from the arm by any
art or magic spell; but if the wearer , even for a single moment , liked
anyone better than the person who gave it to him , that very moment the
bracelet fell off from the arm and could never again be fastened on . And
when the princess promised her hand in marriage to the Prince Cuglas , 
she closed the bracelet on his arm . 

The fairy queen knew nothing about the bracelet , and she hoped that
before the prince was long in the floating island he would forget all
about the princess . 

"You are welcome , Cuglas , " said the queen , as she held out her hand , and
Cuglas , having thanked her for her welcome , they entered the palace
together . 

"You must be weary after your long journey , " said the queen . "My page
will lead you to your apartments , where a bath of the cool blue waters
of the lake has been made ready for you , and when you have taken your
bath the pages will lead you to the banquet hall , where the feast is
spread . "

At the feast the prince was seated beside the queen , and she talked to
him of all the pleasures that were in store for him in fairyland , where
pain , and sickness , and sorrow , and old age , are unknown , and where
every rosy hour that flies is brighter than the one that has fled before
it . And when the feast was ended the queen opened the dance with the
prince , and it was not until the moon was high above the floating island
that the prince retired to rest . 

He was so tired after his journey and the dancing that he fell into
a sound sleep . When he awoke the next morning the sun was shining
brightly , and he heard outside the palace the jingle of bells and the
music of baying hounds , and his heart was stirred by memories of the
many pleasant days on which he had led the chase over the plains and
through the green woods of Tara . 

He looked out through the window , and he saw all the fairy champions
mounted on their steeds ready for the chase , and at their head the fairy
queen . And at that moment the pages came to say the queen wished to know
if he would join them , and the prince went out and found his steed ready
saddled and bridled , and they spent the day hunting in the forest that
stretched away for miles behind the palace , and the night in feasting
and dancing . 

When the prince awoke the following morning he was summoned by the pages
to the presence of the queen . The prince found the queen on the lawn
outside the palace surrounded by her court . 

"We shall go on the lake to-day , Cuglas , " said the queen , and taking his
arm she led him along the water's edge , all the courtiers following . 


When she was close to the water she waved her wand , and in a second a
thousand boats , shining like glass , shot up from beneath the lake and
set their bows against the bank . The queen and Cuglas stepped into one , 
and when they were seated two fairy harpers took their places in the
prow . All the other boats were soon thronged by fairies , and then the
queen waved her wand again , and an awning of purple silk rose over the
boat , and silken awnings of various colors over the others , and the
royal boat moved off from the bank followed by all the rest , and in
every boat sat a harper with a golden harp , and when the queen waved her
wand for the third time , the harpers struck the trembling chords , and to
the sound of the delightful music the boats glided over the sunlit lake . 
And on they went until they approached the mouth of a gentle river
sliding down between banks clad with trees . Up the river , close to the
bank and under the drooping trees , they sailed , and when they came to
a bend in the river , from which the lake could be no longer seen , they
pushed their prows in against the bank , and the queen and Cuglas , and
all the party , left the boats and went on under the trees until they
came to a mossy glade . 

Then the queen waved her wand , and silken couches were spread under the
trees , and she and Cuglas sat on one apart from the others , and the
courtiers took their places in proper order . 

And the queen waved her wand again , and wind shook the trees above them , 
and the most luscious fruit that was ever tasted fell down into their
hands; and when the feast was over there was dancing in the glades to
the music of the harps , and when they were tired dancing they set out
for the boats , and the moon was rising above the trees as they sailed
away over the lake , and it was not long until they reached the bank
below the fairy palace . 

Well , between hunting in the forest , and sailing over the lake , and
dancing in the greenwood glade and in the banquet hall , the days passed , 
but all the time the prince was thinking of the Princess Ailinn , and one
moonlit night , when he was lying awake on his couch thinking of her , a
shadow was suddenly cast on the floor . 

The prince looked towards the window , and what should he see sitting
on the sill outside but a little woman tapping the pane with a golden
bodkin . 

The prince jumped from his couch and opened the window , and the little
woman floated on the moonbeams into the room and sat down on the floor . 

"You are thinking of the Princess Ailinn , " said the little woman . 

"I never think of anyone else , " said the prince . 

"I know that , " said the little woman , "and it's because of your love for
each other , and because her mother was a friend to me in the days gone
by , that I have come here to try and help you; but there is not much
time for talking , the night advances . At the bank below a boat awaits
you . Step into it and it will lead you to the mainland , and when you
reach it you will find before you a path that will take you to the green
fields of Erin and the plains of Tara . I know you will have to face
danger . I know not what kind of danger; but whatever it may be do not
draw your sword before you tread upon the mainland , for if you do you
shall never reach it , and the boat will come back again to the floating
island; and now go and may luck go with you;" and saying this the little
woman climbed up the moonbeams and disappeared . 

The prince left the palace and descended to the lake , and there before
him he saw a glistening boat; he stepped into it , and the boat went on
and on beneath the moon , and at last he saw the mainland , and he could
trace a winding pathway going away from the shore . The sight filled his
heart with joy , but suddenly the milk-white moonshine died away , and
looking up to the sky he saw the moon turning fiery red , and the waters
of the lake , shining like silver a moment before , took a blood-red hue , 
and a wind arose that stirred the waters , and they leaped up against the
little boat , tossing it from side to side . While Cuglas was wondering
at the change , he heard a strange , unearthly noise ahead of him , and
a bristling monster , lifting its claws above the water , in a moment
was beside the boat and stuck one of his claws in the left arm of the
prince , and pierced the flesh to the bone . Maddened by the pain the
prince drew his sword and chopped off the monster's claw . The monster
disappeared beneath the lake , and , as it did so , the color of the water
changed , and the silver moonlight shone down from the sky again , but the
boat no longer went on towards the mainland , but sped back towards the
floating island , while forth from the island came a fleet of fairy boats
to meet it , led by the shallop of the fairy queen . The queen greeted the
prince as if she knew not of his attempted flight , and to the music of
the harps the fleet returned to the palace . 

The next day passed and the night came , and again the prince was lying
on the couch , thinking of the Princess Ailinn , and again he saw the
shadow on the floor and heard the tapping against the window . 

And when he opened it the little woman slid into the room . 

"You failed last night , " she said , "but I come to give you another
chance . To-morrow the queen must set out on a visit to her fairy
kinsmen , who dwell in the green hill near the plain of Tara; she cannot
take you with her , for if your feet once touched the green grass that
grows in the fruitful fields of Erin , she could never bring you back
again . And so , when you find she has left the palace , go at once into
the banquet hall and look behind the throne , and you will see a small
door let down into the ground . Pull this up and descend the steps which
you will see . Where they lead to I cannot tell . What dangers may be
before you I do not know; but this I know , if you accept anything , no
matter what it is , from anyone you may meet on your way , you shall not
set foot on the soil of Erin . "

And having said this the little woman , rising from the floor , floated
out through the window . 

The prince returned to his couch , and the next morning , as soon as he
heard the queen had left the palace , he hastened to the banquet hall . 
He discovered the door and descended the steps , and he found himself
in a gloomy and lonesome valley . Jagged mountains , black as night , rose
on either side , and huge rocks seemed ready to topple down upon him at
every step . Through broken clouds a watery moon shed a faint , fitful
light , that came and went as the clouds , driven by a moaning wind , 
passed over the valley . 

Cuglas , nothing daunted , pushed on boldly until a bank of cloud shut out
completely the struggling moon , and closing over the valley covered it
like a pall , leaving him in perfect darkness . At the same moment the
moaning wind died away , and with it died away all sound . The darkness
and the deathlike silence sent an icy chill to the heart of Cuglas . He
held his hand close to his eyes , but he saw it not . He shouted that he
might hear the sound of his own voice , but he heard it not . He stamped
his foot on the rocky ground , but no sound was returned to him . He
rattled his sword in its brazen scabbard , but it gave no answer back
to him . His heart grew colder and colder , when suddenly the cloud above
him was rent in a dozen places , and lightning flashed through the
valley , and the thunder rolled over the echoing mountains . In the lurid
glare of the lightning Cuglas saw a hundred ghostly forms sweeping
towards him , uttering as they came nearer and nearer shrieks so terrible
that the silence of death could more easily be borne . Cuglas turned to
escape , but they hemmed him round , and pressed their clammy hands upon
his face . 

With a yell of horror he drew his sword and slashed about him , and that
very moment the forms vanished , the thunder ceased , the dark cloud
passed , and the sun shone out as bright as on a summer day , and then
Cuglas knew the forms he had seen were those of the wild people of the
glen . [7]

With renewed courage he pursued his way through the valley , and after
three or four windings it took him out upon a sandy desert . He had no
sooner set foot upon the desert than he heard behind him a crashing
sound louder than thunder . He looked around , and he saw that the walls
of mountain through which he had just passed had fallen into the valley , 
and filled it up so that he could no longer tell where it had been . 

The sun was beating fiercely on the desert , and the sands were almost as
hot as burning cinders; and as Cuglas advanced over them his body became
dried up , and his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth , and when his
thirst was at its height a fountain of sparkling water sprang up in the
burning plain a few paces in front of him; but when he came up quite
close to it and stretched out his parched hands to cool them in the
limpid waters , the fountain vanished as suddenly as it appeared . With
great pain , and almost choking with heat and thirst , he struggled on , 
and again the fountain sprang up in front of him and moved before him , 
almost within his reach . At last he came to the end of the desert , and
he saw a green hill up which a pathway climbed; but as he came to the
foot of the hill , there , sitting right in his way , was a beautiful fairy
holding out towards him a crystal cup , over the rim of which flowed
water as clear as crystal . Unable to resist the temptation , the prince
seized the cold , bright goblet , and drank the water . When he did so his
thirst vanished , but the fairy , and the green hill , and the burning
desert disappeared , and he was standing in the forest behind the palace
of the fairy queen . 

That evening the queen returned , and at the feast she talked as gaily
to the prince as if she knew not of his attempt to leave the Floating
Island , and the prince spoke as gaily as he could to her , although in
his heart there was sadness when he remembered that if he had only
dashed away the crystal cup , he would be at that moment in the royal
banquet hall of Tara , sitting beside the Princess Ailinn . 

And he thought the feast would never end; but it was over at last , and
the prince returned to his apartments . And that night , as he lay on his
couch , he kept his eyes fixed upon the window; but hours passed , and
there was no sign of anyone . At long last , and when he had given up all
hope of seeing her , he heard a tapping at the window , and he got up and
opened it , and the little woman came in . 

"You failed again to-day , " said she--"failed just at the very moment
when you were about to step on the green hills of Erin . I can give you
only one chance more . It will be your last . The queen will go hunting
in the morning . Join the hunt , and when you are separated from the rest
of the party in the wood throw your reins upon your horse's neck and he
will lead you to the edge of the lake . Then cast this golden bodkin into
the lake in the direction of the mainland , and a golden bridge will be
thrown across , over which you can pass safely to the fields of Erin;
but take care and do not draw your sword , for if you do your steed will
bear you back again to the Floating Island , and here you must remain
forever . " Then handing the bodkin to the prince , and saying good-by , 
the little woman disappeared . 

The next morning the queen and the prince and all the court went out
to hunt , and a fleet white deer started out before them , and the royal
party pressed after him in pursuit . The prince's steed outstripped the
others , and when he was alone the prince flung the reins upon his
horse's neck , and before long he came to the edge of the lake . 

Then the prince cast the bodkin on to the water , and a golden bridge was
thrown across to the mainland , and the horse galloped on to it , and when
the prince was more than halfway he saw riding towards him a champion
wearing a silver helmet , and carrying on his left arm a silver shield , 
and holding in his right hand a gleaming sword . As he came nearer he
struck his shield with his sword and challenged the prince to battle . 
The prince's sword almost leaped out of its scabbard at the martial
sound , and , like a true knight of Tara , he dashed against his foe , and
swinging his sword above his head , with one blow he clove the silver
helmet , and the strange warrior reeled from his horse and fell upon the
golden bridge . The prince , content with this achievement , spurred his
horse to pass the fallen champion , but the horse refused to stir , and
the bridge broke in two almost at his feet , and the part of it between
him and the mainland disappeared beneath the lake , carrying with it the
horse and the body of the champion , and before the prince could recover
from his surprise , his steed wheeled round and was galloping back , and
when he reached the land he rushed through the forest , and the prince
was not able to pull him up until he came to the palace door . 

All that night the prince lay awake on his couch with his eyes fixed
upon the window , but no shadow fell upon the floor , and there was no
tapping at the pane , and with a heavy heart he joined the hunting party
in the morning . And day followed day , and his heart was sadder and
sadder , and found no pleasure in the joys and delights of fairyland . And
when all in the palace were at rest he used to roam through the forest , 
always thinking of the Princess Ailinn , and hoping against hope that the
little woman would come again to him , but at last he began to despair of
ever seeing her . It chanced one night he rambled so far that he found
himself on the verge of the lake , at the very spot from which the golden
bridge had been thrown across the waters , and as he gazed wistfully upon
them a boat shot up and came swiftly to the bank , and who should he see
sitting in the stern but the little woman . 

"Ah , Cuglas , Cuglas , " she said , "I gave you three chances , and you
failed in all of them . "

"I should have borne the pain inflicted by the monster's claw , " said
Cuglas . "I should have borne the thirst on the sandy desert , and dashed
the crystal cup untasted from the fairy's hand; but I could never have
faced the nobles and chiefs of Erin if I had refused to meet the
challenge of the battle champion on the golden bridge . "

"And you would have been no true knight of Erin , and you would not have
been worthy of the wee girl who loves you , the bonny Princess Ailinn , if
you had refused to meet it , " said the little woman; "but for all that
you can never return to the fair hills of Erin . But cheer up , Cuglas , 
there are mossy ways and forest paths and nestling bowers in fairyland . 
Lonely they are , I know , in your eyes now , " said the little woman; "but
maybe , " she added , with a laugh as musical as the ripple on a streamlet
when summer is in the air , "maybe you won't always think them so
lonely . "

"You think I'll forget Ailinn for the fairy queen , " said Cuglas , with a
sigh . 

"I don't think anything of the kind , " said she . 

"Then what do you mean ? " said the prince . 

"Oh , I mean what I mean , " said the little woman . "But I can't stop here
all night talking to you: and , indeed , it is in your bed you ought to
be yourself . So now good-night; and I have no more to say , except that
perhaps , if you happen to be here this night week at this very hour , 
when the moon will be on the waters , you will see---- But no matter what
you will see , " said she; "I must be off . "

And before the prince could say another word the boat sped away from the
bank , and he was alone . He went back to the palace , and he fell asleep
that night only to dream of the Princess Ailinn . 

As for the princess , she was pining away in the palace of Tara , the
color had fled from her cheeks , and her eyes , which had been once so
bright they would have lighted darkness like a star , lost nearly all
their luster , and the king's leeches could do nothing for her , and at
last they gave up all hope , and the king and queen of Erin and the
ladies of the court watched her couch by night and by day sadly waiting
for her last hour . 

At length one day , when the sun was shining brightly over Tara's plain , 
and its light , softened by the intervening curtains , was falling in the
sick chamber , the royal watchers noticed a sweet change coming over the
face of the princess; the bloom of love and youth were flushing on her
cheeks , and from her eyes shone out the old , soft , tender light , and
they began to hope she was about to be restored to them , when suddenly
the room was in darkness as if the night had swept across the sky , and
blotted out the sun . Then they heard the sound of fairy music , and over
the couch where the princess lay they beheld a gleam of golden light , 
but only for a moment; and again there was perfect darkness , and the
fairy music ceased . Then , as suddenly as it came the darkness vanished , 
the softened sunlight once more filled the chamber , and rested upon the
couch; but the couch was empty , and the royal watchers , looking at each
other , said in whispers: "The fairies have carried away the Princess
Ailinn to fairyland . "

Well , that very day the prince roamed by himself through the forest , 
counting the hours until the day would fade in the sky and the moon come
climbing up , and at last , when it was shining full above the waters , he
went down to the verge of the lake , and he looked out over the gleaming
surface watching for the vision promised by the little woman . But he
could see nothing , and was about to turn away when he heard the faint
sound of fairy music . He listened and listened , and the sound came
nearer and clearer , and away in the distance , like drops of glistening
water breaking the level of the lake , he saw a fleet of fairy boats , and
he thought it was the fairy queen sailing in the moonlight . And it was
the fairy queen , and soon he was able to recognize the royal shallop
leading the others , and as it came close to the bank he saw the little
woman sitting in the prow between the little harpers , and at the stern
was the fairy queen , and by her side the lady of his heart , the Princess
Ailinn . In a second the boat was against the bank , and the princess in
his arms . And he kissed her again and again . 

"And have you never a kiss for me ? " said the little woman , tapping his
hand with the little gold bodkin . 

"A kiss and a dozen , " said Cuglas , as he caught the little fairy up in
his arms . 

"Oh , fie , Cuglas , " said the queen . 

"Oh , the princess isn't one bit jealous , " said the little woman . "Are
you , Ailinn ? "

"Indeed I am not , " said Ailinn . 

"And you should not be , " said the fairy queen , "for never lady yet had
truer knight than Cuglas . I loved him , and I love him dearly . I lured
him here hoping that in the delights of fairyland he might forget you . 
It was all in vain . I know now that there is one thing no fairy power
above or below the stars , or beneath the waters , can ever subdue , and
that is love . And here together forever shall you and Cuglas dwell , 
where old age shall never come upon you , and where pain or sorrow or
sickness is unknown . "

And Cuglas never returned to the fair hills of Erin , and ages passed
away since the morning he followed the hounds into the fatal cave , but
his story was remembered by the firesides , and sometimes , even yet , 
the herdboy watching his cattle in the fields hears the tuneful cry of
hounds , and follows it till it leads him to a darksome cave , and as
fearfully he listens to the sound becoming fainter and fainter he hears
the clatter of hoofs over the stony floor , and to this day the cave
bears the name of the prince who entered it never to return . [A]

Cuglas--now Baltinglass--in the County Wicklow . ]
