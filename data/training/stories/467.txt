 I know not whence it rises , 
 This thought so full of woe:
 But a tale of the times departed
 Haunts me--and will not go . 

 The air is cool , and it darkens , 
 And calmly flows the Rhine;
 The mountain peaks are sparkling
 In the sunny evening-shine . 

 And yonder sits a maiden , 
 The fairest of the fair;
 With gold is her garment glittering , 
 And she combs her golden hair . 

 With a golden comb she combs it , 
 And a wild song singeth she , 
 That melts the heart with a wondrous
 And powerful melody . 

 The boatman feels his bosom
 With a nameless longing move;
 He sees not the gulfs before him , 
 His gaze is fixed above . 

 Till over boat and boatman
 The Rhine's deep waters run;
 And this with her magic singing
 The Lorelei hath done !
