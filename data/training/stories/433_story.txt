I. THE CATTLE-LIFTING

NEXT morning (I continued, looking up for inspiration to the pinnacles
of Melrose, cut against the clear sky of evening, as sharply as when
"John Morow, master mason," looked upon his finished work and found it
very good)--next morning, as Captain Edward Waverley was setting out for
his morning walk, he found the castle of Bradwardine by no means the
enchanted palace of silence he had first discovered. Milkmaids,
bare-legged and wild-haired, ran about distractedly with pails and
three-legged stools in their hands, crying, "Lord, guide us!" and "Eh,
sirs!"

Bailie Macwheeble, mounted on his dumpy, round-barrelled pony, rode
hither and thither with half the ragged rascals of the neighbourhood
clattering after him. The Baron paced the terrace, every moment glancing
angrily up at the Highland hills from under his bushy grey eyebrows.

From the byre-lasses and the Bailie, Edward could obtain no satisfactory
explanation of the disturbance. He judged it wiser not to seek it from
the angry Baron.

Within-doors, however, he found Rose, who, though troubled and anxious,
replied to his questions readily enough.

"There has been a 'creach,' that is, a raid of cattle-stealers from out
of the Highland hills," she told him, hardly able to keep back her
tears--not, she explained, because of the lost cattle, but because she
feared that the anger of her father might end in the slaying of some of
the Caterans, and in a blood-feud which would last as long as they or
any of their family lived.

"And all because my father is too proud to pay blackmail to Vich Ian
Vohr!" she added.

"Is the gentleman with that curious name," said Edward, "a local robber
or a thief-taker?"

"Oh, no," Rose laughed outright at his southern ignorance, "he is a
great Highland chief and a very handsome man. Ah, if only my father
would be friends with Fergus Mac-Ivor, then Tully-Veolan would once
again be a safe and happy home. He and my father quarrelled at a county
meeting about who should take the first place. In his heat he told my
father that he was under his banner and paid him tribute. But it was
Bailie Macwheeble who had paid the money without my father's knowledge.
And since then he and Vich Ian Vohr have not been friends."

"But what is blackmail?" Edward asked in astonishment. For he thought
that such things had been done away with long ago. All this was just
like reading an old black-letter book in his uncle's library.

"It is money," Rose explained, "which, if you live near the Highland
border, you must pay to the nearest powerful chief--such as Vich Ian
Vohr. And then, if your cattle are driven away, all you have to do is
just to send him word and he will have them sent back, or others as good
in their places. Oh, you do not know how dreadful to be at feud with a
man like Fergus Mac-Ivor. I was only a girl of ten when my father and
his servants had a skirmish with a party of them, near our home-farm--so
near, indeed, that some of the windows of the house were broken by the
bullets, and three of the Highland raiders were killed. I remember
seeing them brought in and laid on the floor in the hall, each wrapped
in his plaid. And next morning their wives and daughters came, clapping
their hands and crying the _coronach_ and shrieking--and they carried
away the dead bodies, with the pipes playing before them. Oh, I could
not sleep for weeks afterward, without starting up, thinking that I
heard again these terrible cries."

All this seemed like a dream to Waverley--to hear this young gentle girl
of seventeen talk familiarly of dark and bloody deeds, such as even he,
a grown man and a soldier, had only imagined--yet which she had seen
with her own eyes!

By dinner-time the Baron's mood had grown somewhat less stormy. He
seemed for the moment to forget his wounded honour, and was even
offering, as soon as the quarrel was made up, to provide Edward with
introductions to many powerful northern chiefs, when the door opened,
and a Highlander in full costume was shown in by the butler.

"Welcome, Evan Dhu Maccombich!" said the Baron, without rising, and
speaking in the manner of a prince receiving an embassy; "what news from
Fergus Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr?"

The ambassador delivered a courteous greeting from the Highland chief.
"Fergus Mac-Ivor (he said) was sorry for the cloud that hung between him
and his ancient friend. He hoped that the Baron would be sorry too--and
that he should say so. More than this he did not ask."

This the Baron readily did, drinking to the health of the chief of the
Mac-Ivors, while Evan Maccombich in turn drank prosperity to the house
of Bradwardine.


II. THE ROBBER'S CAVE

Then these high matters being finished, the Highlander retired with
Bailie Macwheeble, doubtless to arrange with him concerning the arrears
of blackmail. But of that the Baron was supposed to know nothing. This
done, the Highlander began to ask all about the party which had driven
off the cattle, their appearance, whence they had come, and in what
place they had last been seen. Edward was much interested by the man's
shrewd questions and the quickness with which he arrived at his
conclusions. While on his part Evan Dhu was so flattered by the evident
interest of the young Englishman, that he invited him to "take a walk
with him into the mountains in search of the cattle," promising him that
if the matter turned out as he expected, he would take Edward to such a
place as he had never seen before and might never have a chance of
seeing again.

Waverley accepted with eager joy, and though Rose Bradwardine turned
pale at the idea, the Baron, who loved boldness in the young, encouraged
the adventure. He gave Edward a young gamekeeper to carry his pack and
to be his attendant, so that he might make the journey with fitting
dignity.

Through a great pass, full of rugged rocks and seamed with roaring
torrents--indeed, the very pass of Bally-Brough in which the reivers had
last been spied--across weary and dangerous morasses, where Edward had
perforce to spring from tuft to tussock of coarse grass, Evan Dhu led
our hero into the depths of the wild Highland country,--where no Saxon
foot trod or dared to tread without the leave of Vich Ian Vohr, as the
chief's foster-brother took occasion to inform Edward more than once.

By this time night was coming on, and Edward's attendant was sent off
with one of Evan Dhu's men, that they might find a place to sleep in,
while Evan himself pushed forward to warn the supposed cattle-stealer,
one Donald Bean Lean, of the party's near approach. For, as Evan Dhu
said, the Cateran might very naturally be startled by the sudden
appearance of a _sidier roy_--or red soldier--in the very place of his
most secret retreat.

Edward was thus left alone with the single remaining Highlander, from
whom, however, he could obtain no further information as to his
journey's end--save that, as the Sassenach was somewhat tired, Donald
Bean might possibly send the _currach_ for him.

Edward wished much to know whether the _currach_ was a horse, a cart, or
a chaise. But in spite of all his efforts, he could get no more out of
the man with the Lochaber axe than the words repeated over and over
again, "_Aich aye, ta currach! Aich aye, ta currach!_"

However, after stumbling on a little farther, they came out on the
shores of a loch, and the guide, pointing through the darkness in the
direction of a little spark of light far away across the water, said,
"Yon's ta cove!" Almost at the same moment the dash of oars was heard,
and a shrill whistle came to their ears out of the darkness. This the
Highlander answered, and a boat appeared in which Edward was soon
seated, and on his way to the robber's cave.

The light, which at first had been no bigger than a rush-light, grew
rapidly larger, glowing red (as it seemed) upon the very bosom of the
lake. Cliffs began to rise above their heads, hiding the moon. And, as
the boat rapidly advanced, Edward could make out a great fire kindled on
the shore, into which dark mysterious figures were busily flinging pine
branches. The fire had been built on a narrow ledge at the opening of a
great black cavern, into which an inlet of the loch seemed to advance.
The men rowed straight for this black entrance. Then, letting the boat
run on with shipped oars, the fire was soon passed and left behind, and
the cavern entered through a great rocky arch. At the foot of some
natural steps the boat stopped. The beacon brands which had served to
guide them were thrown hissing into the water, and Edward found himself
lifted out of the boat by brawny arms and carried almost bodily into the
depths of the cavern. Presently, however, he was allowed to walk, though
still guided on either side, when suddenly at a turn of the rock
passage, the cave opened out, and Edward found the famous Cateran,
Donald Bean Lean, and his whole establishment plain before his eyes.

The cavern was lit with pine torches, and about a charcoal fire five or
six Highlanders were seated, while in the dusk behind several others
slumbered, wrapped in their plaids. In a large recess to one side were
seen the carcasses of both sheep and cattle, hung by the heels as in a
butcher's shop, some of them all too evidently the spoils of the Baron
of Bradwardine's flocks and herds.

The master of this strange dwelling came forward to welcome Edward,
while Evan Dhu stood by his side to make the necessary introductions.
Edward had expected to meet with a huge savage warrior in the captain of
such banditti, but to his surprise he found Donald Bean Lean to be a
little man, pale and insignificant in appearance, and not even Highland
in dress. For at one time Donald had served in the French army. So now,
instead of receiving Edward in his national costume, he had put on an
old blue-and-red foreign uniform, in which he made so strange a figure
that, though it was donned in his honour, his visitor had hard work to
keep from laughing. Nor was the freebooter's conversation more in accord
with his surroundings. He talked much of Edward's family and
connections, and especially of his uncle's Jacobite politics--on which
last account, he seemed inclined to welcome the young man with more
cordiality than, as a soldier of King George, Edward felt to be his due.
The scene which followed was, however, better fitted to the time and
place.

At a half-savage feast Edward had the opportunity of tasting steaks
fresh cut from some of the Baron's cattle, broiled on the coals before
his eyes, and washed down with draughts of Highland whiskey.

Yet in spite of the warmth of his welcome, there was something very
secret and unpleasant about the shifty cunning glance of this little
robber-chief, who seemed to know so much about the royal garrisons, and
even about the men of Edward's own troop whom he had brought with him
from Waverley-Honour.

When at last they were left alone together, Evan Dhu having lain down in
his plaid, the little captain of cattle-lifters asked Captain Waverley
in a very significant manner, "if he had nothing particular to say to
him."

Edward, a little startled at the tone in which the question was put,
answered that he had no other reason for coming to the cave but a desire
to see so strange a dwelling-place.

For a moment Donald Bean Lean looked him full in the face, as if waiting
for something more, and then, with a nod full of meaning, he muttered:
"You might as well have confided in me. I am as worthy of trust as
either the Baron of Bradwardine or Vich Ian Vohr! But you are equally
welcome to my house!"

His heather bed, the flickering of the fire, the smoking torches, and
the movement of the wild outlaws going and coming about the cave, soon,
however, diverted Waverley's thoughts from the mysterious words of his
host. His eyelids drew together, nor did he reopen them till the morning
sun, reflected from the lake, was filling all the cave with a glimmering
twilight.


THE SECOND INTERLUDE

 As soon as this part of the tale was finished, the
 audience showed much greater eagerness to enter
 immediately upon the acting of Donald Bean Lean's
 cattle-raid, and its consequences, than it had
 previously displayed as to the doings of Edward
 Waverley.

 As Hugh John admitted, this was "something like!"
 The Abbey precincts were instantly filled with the
 mingled sounds characteristic of all well-conducted
 forays, and it was well indeed that the place was
 wholly deserted. For the lowings of the driven
 cattle, the shouts of the triumphant Highlanders,
 the deep rage of the Baron, stalking to and fro
 wrapped in his cloak on the Castle terrace, might
 well have astonished the crowd which in these
 summer days comes from the four corners of the
 world "to view fair Melrose aright."

 It was not till the edge had worn off their first
 enthusiasm, that it became possible to collect them
 again in order to read "The Hold of a Highland
 Robber," which makes Chapter Seventeenth of
 _Waverley_ itself. And the reading so fired the
 enthusiasm of Sweetheart that she asked for the
 book to take to bed with her. The boys were more
 practical, though equally enthusiastic.

 "Wait till we get home," cried Hugh John, cracking
 his fingers and thumbs. "I know a proper place for
 Donald Bean Lean's cave."

 "And I," said Sir Toady Lion, "will light a fire by
 the pond and toss the embers into the water. It
 will be jolly to hear 'em hiss, I tell you!"

 "But what," asked Maid Margaret, "shall we do for
 the cattle and sheep that were hanging by the
 heels, when Edward went into Donald Bean Lean's
 cave?"

 "Why, we will hang _you_ up by the heels and cut
 slices off you!" said Sir Toady, with frowning
 truculence.

 Whereat the little girl, a little solemnised, began
 to edge away from the dangerous neighbourhood of
 such a pair of young cannibals. Sweetheart
 reproached her brothers for inventing calumnies
 against their countrymen.

 "Even the Highlanders were never so wicked," she
 objected; "they did not eat one another."

 "Well, anyway," retorted Sir Toady Lion, unabashed,
 "Sawney Bean did. Perhaps he was a cousin of
 Donald's, though in the history it says that he
 came from East Lothian."

 "Yes," cried Hugh John, "and in an old book written
 in Latin it says (father read it to us) that one of
 his little girls was too young to be executed with
 the rest on the sands of Leith. So the King sent
 her to be brought up by kind people, where she was
 brought up without knowing anything of her father,
 the cannibal, and her mother, the cannibaless--"

 "Oh," cried Sweetheart, who knew what was coming,
 putting up her hands over her ears, "please don't
 tell that dreadful story all over again."

 "Father read it out of a book--so there!" cried Sir
 Toady, implacably, "go on, Hugh John!"

 "And so when this girl was about as big as
 Sweetheart, and, of course, could not remember her
 grandfather's nice cave or the larder where the
 arms and legs were hung up to dry in the smoke--"

 "Oh, you horrid boy!" cried Sweetheart, not,
 however, removing herself out of ear-shot--because,
 after all, it was nice to shiver just a little.

 "Oh, yes, and I have seen the cave," cried Sir
 Toady, "it is on the shore near Ballantrae--a
 horrid place. Go on, Hugh John, tell about Sawney
 Bean's grandchild!"

 "Well, she grew up and up, playing with dolls just
 like other girls, till she was old enough to be
 sent out to service. And after she had been a while
 about the house to which she went, it was noticed
 that some of the babies in the neighbourhood began
 to go a-missing, and they found--"

 "I think she was a nursemaid!" interrupted Sir
 Toady, dispassionately. "That must have been it.
 The little wretches cried--_so she ate them!_"

 "Oh," cried Sweetheart, stopping her ears with her
 fingers, "don't tell us what they found--I believe
 you made it all up, anyway."

 "No, I didn't," cried Hugh John, shouting in her
 ear as if to a very deaf person, "it was father who
 read it to us, out of a big book with fat black
 letters. So it must be true!"

 Sir Toady was trying to drag away his sister's arms
 that she might have the benefit of details, when I
 appeared in the distance. Whereupon Hugh John, who
 felt his time growing limited, concluded thus, "And
 when they were taking the girl away to hang her,
 the minister asked her why she had killed the
 babies, and she answered him, 'If people only knew
 how good babies were--especially little
 girls--_there would not be one left between Forth
 and Solway!_'"

 Then quite unexpectedly Maid Margaret began to sob
 bitterly.

 "They _shan't_ hang me up and eat me," she cried,
 running as hard as she could and flinging herself
 into my arms; "Hugh John and Sir Toady say they
 will, as soon as we get home."

 Happily I had a light cane of a good vintage in my
 hand, and it did not take long to convince the pair
 of young scamps of the inconvenience of frightening
 their little sister. Sweetheart looked on
 approvingly as two forlorn young men were walked
 off to a supper, healthfully composed of plain
 bread and butter, and washed down by some nice cool
 water from the pump.

 "I told you!" she said, "you wouldn't believe me."

 All the same she was tender-hearted enough to
 convey a platter of broken meats secretly up to
 their "condemned cell," as I knew from finding the
 empty plate under their washstand in the morning.
 And as Maid Margaret was being carried off to be
 bathed and comforted, a Voice, passing their door,
 threatened additional pains and penalties to little
 boys who frightened their sisters.

 "It was all in a book," said Hugh John, defending
 himself from under the bedclothes, "father read it
 to us!"

 "We did it for her good," suggested Sir Toady.

 "If I hear another word out of you--" broke in the
 Voice; and then added, "go to sleep this instant!"

 The incident of the cave had long been forgotten
 and forgiven, before I could continue the story of
 Waverley in the cave of Donald Bean Lean. We sat
 once more "in oor ain hoose at hame," or rather
 outside it, near a certain pleasant chalet in a
 wood, from which place you can see a brown and
 turbulent river running downward to the sea.
