A rolling organ-harmony
 Swells up, and shakes and falls.

Then move the trees, the copses nod,
 Wings flutter, voices hover clear:

"O just and faithful knight of God!
 Ride on! the prize is near.
So pass I hostel, hall, and grange;
 By bridge and ford, by park and pale,

All-arm'd I ride, whate'er betide,
 Until I find the Holy Grail.
