Robin Hood is said to have been born at Locksley in the County of
Nottingham, in the reign of Henry II, about 1160. Some claim that he
came of good family, and was in reality the Earl of Huntingdon.

Public performances of plays based on the tales became so common by
1550 that they had to be forbidden, "but the people would not be
forbidden," said John Knox, the preacher. Bishop Latimer complained
bitterly how, when he was one day ready to preach in a country church,
he was told it was Robin Hood's day, a busy day with them, and they
could not hear him.
