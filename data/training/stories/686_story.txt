Between dark stems the forest glows,
 I hear a noise of hymns:

Then by some secret shrine I ride;
 I hear a voice, but none are there;

The stalls are void, the doors are wide,
 The tapers burning fair.

Fair gleams the snowy altar-cloth,
 The silver vessels sparkle clean,

The shrill bell rings, the censer swings,
 And solemn chaunts resound between.


 Sometimes on lonely mountain-meres
 I find a magic bark;

I leap on board: no helmsman steers
 I float till all is dark.

A gentle sound, an awful light!
 Three angels bear the Holy Grail:

With folded feet, in stoles of white,
 On sleeping wings they sail.

Ah, blessed vision! blood of God!
 My spirit beats her mortal bars,

As down dark tides the glory slides,
 And star-like mingles with the stars.
