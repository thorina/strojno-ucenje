I designed , after my first voyage , to spend the rest of my days at
Bagdad , but it was not long ere I grew weary of an indolent life , 
and I put to sea a second time , with merchants of known probity . 
We embarked on board a good ship , and , after recommending
ourselves to God , set sail . We traded from island to island , and
exchanged commodities with great profit . One day we landed on an
island covered with several sorts of fruit-trees , but we could see
neither man nor animal We walked in the meadows , along the streams
that watered them . While some diverted themselves with gathering
flowers , and others fruits , I took my wine and provisions , and sat
down near a stream between two high trees , which formed a thick
shade . I made a good meal , and afterward fell asleep . I cannot
tell how long I slept , but when I awoke the ship was gone . 

In this sad condition , I was ready to die with grief . 

I cried out in agony , beat my head and breast , and threw myself
upon the ground , where I lay some time in despair . I upbraided
myself a hundred times for not being content with the produce of
my first voyage , that might have sufficed me all my life . But all
this was in vain , and my repentance came too late . At last I
resigned myself to the will of God . Not knowing what to do , I
climbed up to the top of a lofty tree , from which I looked about
on all sides , to see if I could discover anything that could give
me hopes . When I gazed toward the sea I could see nothing but sky
and water; but looking over the land I beheld something white; and
coming down , I took what provision I had left , and went toward it , 
the distance being so great that I could not distinguish what it
was . 

As I approached , I thought it to be a white dome , of a prodigious
height and extent; and when I came up to it , I touched it , and
found it to be very smooth . I went round to see if it was open on
any side , but saw it was not , and that there was no climbing up to
the top , as it was so smooth . It was at least fifty paces round . 

By this time the sun was about to set , and all of a sudden the sky
became as dark as if it had been covered with a thick cloud . I was
much astonished at this sudden darkness , but much more when I
found it occasioned by a bird of a monstrous size , that came
flying toward me . I remembered that I had often heard mariners
speak of a miraculous bird called the roc , and conceived that the
great dome which I so much admired must be its egg . In short , the
bird alighted , and sat over the egg . As I perceived her coming , I
crept close to the egg , so that I had before me one of the legs of
the bird , which was as big as the trunk of a tree . I tied myself
strongly to it with my turban , in hopes that the roc next morning
would carry me with her out of this desert island . After having
passed the night in this condition , the bird flew away as soon as
it was daylight , and carried me so high that I could not discern
the earth; she afterward descended with so much rapidity that I
lost my senses . But when I found myself on the ground , I speedily
untied the knot , and had scarcely done so , when the roc , having
taken up a serpent of monstrous length in her bill , flew away . 

The spot where it left me was encompassed on all sides by
mountains , that seemed to reach above the clouds , and so steep
that there was no possibility of getting out of the valley . This
was a new perplexity; so that when I compared this place with the
desert island from which the roc had brought me , I found that I
had gained nothing by the change . 

As I walked through this valley , I perceived it was strewn with
diamonds , some of which were of a surprising bigness . I took
pleasure in looking upon them; but shortly saw at a distance such
objects as greatly diminished my satisfaction , and which I could
not view without terror , namely , a great number of serpents , so
monstrous that the least of them was capable of swallowing an
elephant . They retired in the daytime to their dens , where they
hid themselves from the roc , their enemy , and came out only in the
night . 

I spent the day in walking about in the valley , resting myself at
times in such places as I thought most convenient . When night came
on I went into a cave , where I thought I might repose in safety . I
secured the entrance , which was low and narrow , with a great
stone , to preserve me from the serpents , but not so far as to
exclude the light . I supped on part of my provisions , but the
serpents , which began hissing round me , put me into such extreme
fear that I did not sleep . When day appeared the serpents retired , 
and I came out of the cave trembling . I can justly say that I
walked upon diamonds , without feeling any inclination to touch
them . At last I sat down , and notwithstanding my apprehensions , 
not having closed my eyes during the night , fell asleep , after
having eaten a little more of my provisions . But I had scarcely
shut my eyes when something that fell by me with a great noise
awaked me . This was a large piece of raw meat; and at the same
time I saw several others fall down from the rocks in different
places . I had always regarded as fabulous what I had heard sailors
and others relate of the valley of diamonds , and of the stratagems
employed by merchants to obtain jewels from thence; but now I
found that they had stated nothing but the truth . For the fact is , 
that the merchants come to the neighborhood of this valley , when
the eagles have young ones , and throwing great joints of meat into
the valley , the diamonds , upon whose points they fall , stick to
them; the eagles , which are stronger in this country than anywhere
else , pounce with great force upon those pieces of meat and carry
them to their nests on the precipices of the rocks to feed their
young: the merchants at this time run to their nests , disturb and
drive off the eagles by their shouts , and take away the diamonds
that stick to the meat . 

I perceived in this device the means of my deliverance . 

Having collected together the largest diamonds I could find , and
put them into the leather bag in which I used to carry my
provisions , I took the largest of the pieces of meat , tied it
close round me with the cloth of my turban , and then laid myself
upon the ground , with my face downward , the bag of diamonds being
made fast to my girdle . 

I had scarcely placed myself in this posture when one of the
eagles , having taken me up with the piece of meat to which I was
fastened , carried me to his nest on the top of the mountain . The
merchants immediately began their shouting to frighten the eagles;
and when they had obliged them to quit their prey , one of them
came to the nest where I was . He was much alarmed when he saw me;
but recovering himself , instead of inquiring how I came thither , 
began to quarrel with me , and asked why I stole his goods .  " You
will treat me , " replied I ,  " with more civility , when you know me
better . Do not be uneasy; I have diamonds enough for you and
myself , more than all the other merchants together . Whatever they
have they owe to chance; but I selected for myself , in the bottom
of the valley , those which you see in this bag . " I had scarcely
done speaking , when the other merchants came crowding about us , 
much astonished to see me; but they were much more surprised when
I told them my story . 

They conducted me to their encampment; and there , having opened my
bag , they were surprised at the largeness of my diamonds , and
confessed that they had never seen any of such size and
perfection . I prayed the merchant who owned the nest to which I
had been carried  ( for every merchant had his own ) , to take as many
for his share as he pleased . He contented himself with one , and
that , too , the least of them; and when I pressed him to take more , 
without fear of doing me any injury ,  " No , " said he ,  " I am very
well satisfied with this , which is valuable enough to save me the
trouble of making any more voyages , and will raise as great a
fortune as I desire . " 

I spent the night with the merchants , to whom I related my story a
second time , for the satisfaction of those who had not heard it . I
could not moderate my joy when I found myself delivered from the
danger I have mentioned . I thought myself in a dream , and could
scarcely believe myself out of danger . 

The merchants had thrown their pieces of meat into the valley for
several days; and each of them being satisfied with the diamonds
that had fallen to his lot , we left the place the next morning , 
and travelled near high mountains , where there were serpents of a
prodigious length , which we had the good-fortune to escape . We
took shipping at the first port we reached , and touched at the
isle of Roha , where the trees grow that yield camphire . This tree
is so large , and its branches so thick , that one hundred men may
easily sit under its shade . The juice of which the camphire is
made exudes from a hole bored in the upper part of the tree , is
received in a vessel , where it thickens to a consistency , and
becomes what we call camphire . After the juice is thus drawn out
the tree withers and dies . 

In this island is also found the rhinoceros , an animal less than
the elephant , but larger than the buffalo . 

It has a horn upon its nose , about a cubit in length; this horn is
solid , and cleft through the middle . The rhinoceros fights with
the elephant , runs his horn into his belly , and carries him off
upon his head; but the blood and the fat of the elephant running
into his eyes and making him blind , he falls to the ground; and
then , strange to relate , the roc comes and carries them both away
in her claws for food for her young ones . 

I pass over many other things peculiar to this island , lest I
should weary you . Here I exchanged some of my diamonds for
merchandise . 

From hence we went to other islands , and at last , having touched
at several trading towns of the continent , we landed at Bussorah , 
from whence I proceeded to Bagdad . There I immediately gave large
presents to the poor , and lived honorably upon the vast riches I
had bought and gained with so much fatigue . 

Thus Sindbad ended the relation of the second voyage , gave Hindbad
another hundred sequins , and invited him to come the next day to
hear the account of the third .
