O	Most
O	terribly
O	cold
O	it
O	was
O	;
O	it
O	snowed
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	nearly
O	quite
O	dark
O	,
O	and
O	evening—the
O	last
O	evening
O	of
O	the
O	year
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	cold
O	and
O	darkness
O	there
O	went
O	along
O	the
O	street
O	a
O	poor
O	little
O	girl
O	,
O	bareheaded
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	naked
O	feet
O	.
O	When
O	she
O	left
O	home
O	she
O	had
O	slippers
O	on
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	true
O	;
O	but
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	good
O	of
O	that
O	?
O	They
O	were
O	very
O	large
O	slippers
O	,
O	which
O	her
O	mother
O	had
O	hitherto
O	worn
O	;
O	so
O	large
O	were
O	they
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	poor
O	little
O	thing
O	lost
O	them
O	as
O	she
O	scuffled
O	away
O	across
O	the
O	street
O	,
O	because
O	of
O	two
O	carriages
O	that
O	rolled
O	by
O	dreadfully
O	fast
O	.
O	One
O	slipper
O	was
O	nowhere
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	;
O	the
O	other
O	had
O	been
O	laid
O	hold
O	of
O	by
O	an
O	urchin
O	,
O	and
O	off
O	he
O	ran
O	with
O	it
O	;
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	would
O	do
O	capitally
O	for
O	a
O	cradle
O	when
O	he
O	some
O	day
O	or
O	other
O	should
O	have
O	children
O	himself
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	little
O	maiden
O	walked
O	on
O	with
O	her
O	tiny
O	naked
O	feet
O	,
O	that
O	were
O	quite
O	red
O	and
O	blue
O	from
O	cold
O	.
O	She
O	carried
O	a
O	quantity
O	of
O	matches
O	in
O	an
O	old
O	apron
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	held
O	a
O	bundle
O	of
O	them
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	.
O	Nobody
O	had
O	bought
O	anything
O	of
O	her
O	the
O	whole
O	livelong
O	day
O	;
O	no
O	one
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	a
O	single
O	farthing
O	.
O	She
O	crept
O	along
O	trembling
O	with
O	cold
O	and
O	hunger—a
O	very
O	picture
O	of
O	sorrow
O	,
O	the
O	poor
O	little
O	thing
O	!
O	The
O	flakes
O	of
O	snow
O	covered
O	her
O	long
O	fair
O	hair
O	,
O	which
O	fell
O	in
O	beautiful
O	curls
O	around
O	her
O	neck
O	;
O	but
O	of
O	that
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	she
O	never
O	once
O	now
O	thought
O	.
O	From
O	all
O	the
O	windows
O	the
O	candles
O	were
O	gleaming
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	smelt
O	so
O	deliciously
O	of
O	roast
O	goose
O	,
O	for
O	you
O	know
O	it
O	was
O	New
O	Year
O	'
O	s
O	Eve
O	;
O	yes
O	,
O	of
O	that
O	she
O	thought
O	.
O	In
O	a
O	corner
O	formed
O	by
O	two
O	houses
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	one
O	advanced
O	more
O	than
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	she
O	seated
O	herself
O	down
O	and
O	cowered
O	together
O	.
O	Her
O	little
O	feet
O	she
O	had
O	drawn
O	close
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	she
O	grew
O	colder
O	and
O	colder
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	go
O	home
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	venture
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	sold
O	any
O	matches
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	bring
O	a
O	farthing
O	of
O	money
O	:
O	from
O	her
O	father
O	she
O	would
O	certainly
O	get
O	blows
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	home
O	it
O	was
O	cold
O	too
O	,
O	for
O	above
O	her
O	she
O	had
O	only
O	the
O	roof
O	,
O	through
O	which
O	the
O	wind
O	whistled
O	,
O	even
O	though
O	the
O	largest
O	cracks
O	were
O	stopped
O	up
O	with
O	straw
O	and
O	rags
O	.
O	Her
O	little
O	hands
O	were
O	almost
O	numbed
O	with
O	cold
O	.
O	Oh
O	!
O	a
O	match
O	might
O	afford
O	her
O	a
O	world
O	of
O	comfort
O	,
O	if
O	she
O	only
O	dared
O	take
O	a
O	single
O	one
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	bundle
O	,
O	draw
O	it
O	against
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	and
O	warm
O	her
O	fingers
O	by
O	it
O	.
O	She
O	drew
O	one
O	out
O	.
O	``
O	Rischt
O	!
O	``
O	how
O	it
O	blazed
O	,
O	how
O	it
O	burnt
O	!
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	warm
O	,
O	bright
O	flame
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	candle
O	,
O	as
O	she
O	held
O	her
O	hands
O	over
O	it
O	:
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	wonderful
O	light
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	really
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	maiden
O	as
O	though
O	she
O	were
O	sitting
O	before
O	a
O	large
O	iron
O	stove
O	,
O	with
O	burnished
O	brass
O	feet
O	and
O	a
O	brass
O	ornament
O	at
O	top
O	.
O	The
O	fire
O	burned
O	with
O	such
O	blessed
O	influence
O	;
O	it
O	warmed
O	so
O	delightfully
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	girl
O	had
O	already
O	stretched
O	out
O	her
O	feet
O	to
O	warm
O	them
O	too
O	;
O	but—the
O	small
O	flame
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	the
O	stove
O	vanished
O	:
O	she
O	had
O	only
O	the
O	remains
O	of
O	the
O	burnt-out
O	match
O	in
O	her
O	hand
O	.
O	She
O	rubbed
O	another
O	against
O	the
O	wall
O	:
O	it
O	burned
O	brightly
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	the
O	light
O	fell
O	on
O	the
O	wall
O	,
O	there
O	the
O	wall
O	became
O	transparent
O	like
O	a
O	veil
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	see
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	On
O	the
O	table
O	was
O	spread
O	a
O	snow-white
O	tablecloth
O	;
O	upon
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	splendid
O	porcelain
O	service
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	roast
O	goose
O	was
O	steaming
O	famously
O	with
O	its
O	stuffing
O	of
O	apple
O	and
O	dried
O	plums
O	.
O	And
O	what
O	was
O	still
O	more
O	capital
O	to
O	behold
O	was
O	,
O	the
O	goose
O	hopped
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	dish
O	,
O	reeled
O	about
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	with
O	knife
O	and
O	fork
O	in
O	its
O	breast
O	,
O	till
O	it
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	poor
O	little
O	girl
O	;
O	when—the
O	match
O	went
O	out
O	and
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	thick
O	,
O	cold
O	,
O	damp
O	wall
O	was
O	left
O	behind
O	.
O	She
O	lighted
O	another
O	match
O	.
O	Now
O	there
O	she
O	was
O	sitting
O	under
O	the
O	most
O	magnificent
O	Christmas
O	tree
O	:
O	it
O	was
O	still
O	larger
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	decorated
O	than
O	the
O	one
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	seen
O	through
O	the
O	glass
O	door
O	in
O	the
O	rich
C	merchant
O	'
O	s
O	house
O	.
O	Thousands
O	of
O	lights
O	were
O	burning
O	on
O	the
O	green
O	branches
O	,
O	and
O	gaily-colored
O	pictures
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	seen
O	in
O	the
O	shop-windows
O	,
O	looked
O	down
O	upon
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	little
O	maiden
O	stretched
O	out
O	her
O	hands
O	towards
O	them
O	when—the
O	match
O	went
O	out
O	.
O	The
O	lights
O	of
O	the
O	Christmas
O	tree
O	rose
O	higher
O	and
O	higher
O	,
O	she
O	saw
O	them
O	now
O	as
O	stars
O	in
O	heaven
O	;
O	one
O	fell
O	down
O	and
O	formed
O	a
O	long
O	trail
O	of
O	fire
O	.
O	``
O	Someone
O	is
O	just
O	dead
O	!
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	;
O	for
O	her
O	old
O	grandmother
O	,
O	the
O	only
O	person
O	who
O	had
O	loved
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	was
O	now
O	no
O	more
O	,
O	had
O	told
O	her
O	,
O	that
O	when
O	a
O	star
O	falls
O	,
O	a
O	soul
O	ascends
O	to
O	God
O	.
O	She
O	drew
O	another
O	match
O	against
O	the
O	wall
O	:
O	it
O	was
O	again
O	light
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	lustre
O	there
O	stood
O	the
O	old
O	grandmother
O	,
O	so
O	bright
O	and
O	radiant
O	,
O	so
O	mild
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	such
O	an
O	expression
O	of
O	love
O	.
O	``
C	Grandmother

O	cried
O	the

O	you
O	vanish
O	like

O	And
O	the
O	matches
O	gave
O	such
O	a
O	brilliant
O	light
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	brighter
O	than
O	at

O	and
O	in

O	so
O	high
O	,
O	so
O	very
O	high

O	then
