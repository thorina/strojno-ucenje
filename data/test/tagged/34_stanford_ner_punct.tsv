O	green

O	the

O	stand

O	This

O	as

O	And
O	she
O	scratched
O	the
O	Duckling
O	'
O	s
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	stroked
O	his
O	whole
O	body
O	.
O	``
O	Besides
O	,
O	``
O	added
O	she
O	,
O	``
O	he
O	is
O	a
O	Drake
O	.
O	I
O	think
O	he
O	will
O	be
O	very
O	strong
O	,
O	so
O	it
O	does
O	not
O	matter
O	so
O	much
O	.
O	He
O	will
O	fight
O	his
O	way
O	through
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	The
O	other
O	Ducks
O	are
O	very

O	.
O	``

O	So
O	they

O	the
O	poor

C	Duckling
O	,

O	out
O	of
O	its
O	egg-shell
O	,
O	and
O	who
O	was
O	so
O	ugly
O	,
O	was
O	bitten
O	,
O	pecked
O	,
O	and
O	teased
O	by
O	both
O	Ducks

O	Hens

O	``
O	It

O	so
O	large

O	said
O	they
O	all

O	And
O	the
O	Turkey-cock
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	come
O	into
O	the
O	world
O	with
O	spurs
O	on
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	fancied
O	he
O	was
O	an
O	emperor
O	,
O	puffed
O	himself
O	up
O	like
O	a
O	ship
O	in
O	full
O	sail
O	,
O	and
O	marched
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	Duckling
O	quite
O	red
O	with
O	passion
O	.
O	The
O	poor
O	little
O	thing
O	scarcely
O	knew
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	quite
O	distressed
O	,
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	ugly
O	,
O	and
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	jest
O	of
O	the
O	poultry-yard
O	.
O	So
O	passed
O	the
O	first
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	afterwards
O	matters
O	grew
O	worse
O	and
O	worse
O	--
O	the
O	poor
C	Duckling
O	was
O	scorned
O	by
O	all
O	.
O	Even
O	his
O	brothers
O	and

O	behaved
O	unkindly

O	constantly

O	the
O	girl
O	who
O	fed
O	the
O	poultry
O	kicked
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	ran
O	through
O	the
O	hedge
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	birds
O	in
O	the

O	ran
O	on

O	.
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	the
O	Wild
O	Ducks
O	flew
O	up
O	,

O	.
O	``
O	Pray
O	who

O	asked

O	Poor

O	followed
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	grand

O	The

O	branches
O	stretched
O	far
O	over

O	The
O	blue

O	rose
O	through
O	the
O	thick
O	trees
O	like
O	a
O	mist
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	dispersed
O	as
O	it

O	The

O	.
O	How
O	frightened
O	the
O	poor
O	little
C	Duck
O	was
O	!
O	He
O	turned
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	thinking
O	to
O	hide
O	it
O	under
O	his

O	in
O	a

O	close
O	to

O	his
O	tongue

O	out
O	of
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	his

O	sparkling
O	fearfully

O	He
O	opened
O	wide
O	his
O	jaws
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	our
O	Duckling
O	,
O	showing
O	him
O	his
O	sharp
O	white

O	,
O	splash
O	,
O	splash
O	!
O	he

O	.
O	``
O	I

O	``
O	And
O	now
O	he

O	still
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	shooting
O	continued
O	among
O	the
O	reeds
O	,
O	shot
O	following
O	shot
O	.
O	The
O	noise
O	did
O	not
O	cease
O	till
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	then
O	the
O	poor
O	little
O	thing
O	dared
O	not
O	stir
O	.
O	He
O	waited
O	several
O	hours
O	before
O	he
O	looked
O	around
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	hurried
O	away
O	from
O	the
O	moor
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	.
O	He
O	ran
O	over
O	fields
O	and
O	meadows
O	,
O	though
O	the
O	wind
O	was
O	so
O	high
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	some
O	difficulty
O	in
O	moving
O	.
O	Towards
O	evening
O	he
O	reached
O	a
O	wretched
O	little
O	hut
O	,
O	so
O	wretched
O	that
O	it
O	knew
O	not
O	on
O	which
O	side
O	to
O	fall
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	remained
O	standing
O	.
O	The
O	wind
O	blew
O	violently
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	our
O	poor
O	little
C	Duckling
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	support
O	himself
O	on
O	his
O	tail
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	stand
O	against
O	it
O	;
O	but
O	it
O	became
O	worse
O	and
O	worse
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	noticed
O	that
O	the
O	door
O	had
O	lost
O	one
O	of
O	its
O	hinges
O	,
O	and
O	hung
O	so
O	much
O	awry
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	creep
O	through
O	the
O	crack
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	So
O	he
O	went
O	in
O	.
O	In
O	this
O	room
O	lived
O	an
C	old
C	woman
O	,
O	with
O	her
O	Tom-cat
O	and
O	her
O	Hen
O	.
O	The
O	Cat
O	,
O	whom
O	she
O	called
O	her
O	little
O	son
O	,
O	knew
O	how
O	to
O	set
O	up
O	his
O	back
O	and
O	purr
O	;
O	indeed
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	even
O	throw
O	out
O	sparks
O	when
O	stroked
O	the
O	wrong
O	way
O	.
O	The
O	Hen
O	had
O	very
O	short
O	legs
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	therefore
O	called
O	``
O	Chickie
O	Short-legs
O	.
O	``
O	She
O	laid
O	very
O	good
O	eggs

O	and
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	loved
O	her
O	as
O	her
O	own
O	child
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	the
O	new
O	guest
O	was
O	discovered
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Cat
O	began
O	to
O	mew
O	and
O	the
O	Hen
O	to
O	cackle
O	.
O	``
O	What
O	is
O	the
O	matter
O	?

O	asked
O	the

O	,
O	looking
O	round
O	.
O	But
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	not
O	good
O	,
O	so
O	she
O	took
O	the
O	young
C	Duckling
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	fat
O	Duck
O	who
O	had
O	lost

O	way
O	.
O	``
O	This

O	she
O	,
O	``
O	I
O	shall
O	now
O	have

O	be
O	not
O	a
O	Drake
O	.
O	We
O	shall
O	see
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	so
O	the
C	Duckling
O	was
O	kept
O	on
O	trial
O	for
O	three
O	weeks
O	,
O	but
O	no
O	eggs
O	made
O	their
O	appearance
O	.
O	Now
O	the
O	Cat
O	was
O	the
O	master
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Hen
O	was
O	the
O	mistress
O	,
O	and
O	always
O	used
O	to
O	say
O	,
O	``
O	We
O	and
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	``
O	for
O	they
O	imagined
O	themselves

O	of
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	but
O	also
O	by
O	far
O	the
O	better
O	half
O	.
O	The
C	Duckling
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	possible
O	to
O	be
O	of
O	a
O	different
O	opinion
O	,
O	but
O	that
O	the
O	Hen
O	would
O	not
O	allow
O	.
O	``
O	Can
O	you
O	lay
O	eggs
O	?

O	asked
O	she
O	.
O	``
O	No
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Well
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	hold
O	your
O	tongue
O	.
O	``
O	And
O	the
O	Cat
O	said
O	,
O	``
O	Can

O	``
O	No
O	.
O	``
O	``
O	Well
O	,
O	then

O	you
O	should
O	have
O	no

O	people
O	are
O	speaking
O	.
O	``
O	So
O	the
C	Duckling
O	sat
O	alone
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	,
O	and
O	felt
O	very
O	miserable
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	he
O	happened
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	the
O	fresh
O	air
O	and
O	bright
O	sunshine
O	,
O	and
O	these
O	thoughts
O	gave
O	him
O	such
O	a
O	strong
O	desire
O	to
O	swim
O	again
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	telling
O	it

O	``
O	What

O	the

O	.
O	``
O	You

O	``
O	But
O	it
O	is
O	so
O	delicious
O	to

O	said
O	the
O	Duckling
O	.
O	``
O	So

O	I

O	What

O	Are
O	you
O	not
O	lodged
O	in
O	a

O	,
O	and
O	have
O	you

O	something
O	?
O	But
O	you
O	are
O	a

O	,

O	it
O	is
O	wearisome
O	to
O	have
O	anything

O	.
O	Believe
O	me
O	,

O	,
O	but
O	it
O	is
O	thus
O	that

O	.
O	Come
O	,
O	for
O	once
O	give

O	.
O	``
O	``
O	I

O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	Duckling
O	.
O	``
O	Well
O	,
O	go
O	,
O	``
O	answered
O	the
O	Hen
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	Duckling
O	went
O	.
O	He
O	swam
O	on
O	the
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	he
O	plunged
O	beneath
O	,
O	but
O	all
O	animals
O	passed
O	him
O	by
O	,
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	ugliness
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	autumn
O	came
O	,
O	the
O	leaves
O	turned
O	yellow
O	and
O	brown
O	,
O	the
O	wind
O	caught
O	them
O	and
O	danced
O	them
O	about
O	,
O	the
O	air
O	was
O	very
O	cold
O	,
O	the
O	clouds
O	were
O	heavy
O	with
O	hail
O	or
O	snow
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	Raven
O	sat
O	on
O	the
O	hedge
O	and
O	croaked
O	.
O	The
O	poor
C	Duckling
O	was
O	certainly
O	not
O	very
O	comfortable
O	.
O	One
O	evening
O	,
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	setting
O	with
O	unusual
O	brilliancy
O	,
O	a
O	flock
O	of
O	large
O	,
O	beautiful
O	birds
O	rose
O	from
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	brushwood
O	.
O	The
C	Duckling
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	anything
O	so
O	beautiful
O	before
O	;
O	their
O	plumage
O	was
O	of
O	a
O	dazzling
O	white
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	long
O	,
O	slender
O	necks
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	Swans
O	.
O	They
O	uttered
O	a
O	singular
O	cry
O	,
O	spread
O	out
O	their
O	long
O	splendid
O	wings
O	,
O	and
O	flew
O	away
O	from
O	these
O	cold
O	regions
O	to
O	warmer
O	countries
O	,
O	across
O	the
O	open
O	sea
O	.
O	They
O	flew
O	so
O	high
O	,
O	so
O	very
O	high
O	!
O	And
O	the
O	little
O	Ugly
O	Duckling
O	'
O	s
O	feelings
O	were
O	so
O	strange
O	.
O	He
O	turned
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	like
O	a
O	mill-wheel
O	,
O	strained
O	his
O	neck
O	to
O	look
O	after
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	forth
O	such
O	a
O	loud
O	and
O	strange
O	cry
O	that
O	it
O	almost
O	frightened
O	himself
O	.
O	Ah
O	!
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	forget
O	them
O	,
O	those
O	noble
O	birds
O	,
O	those
O	happy
O	birds
O	!
O	When
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	them
O	no
O	longer
O	he
O	plunged
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	rose
O	again
O	was
O	almost
O	beside
O	himself
O	.
O	The
C	Duckling
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	the
O	birds
O	were
O	called
O	,
O	knew
O	not
O	whither
O	they
O	were
O	flying
O	;
O	yet
O	he
O	loved
O	them
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	before
O	loved
O	anything
O	.
O	He
O	envied
O	them
O	not
O	;
O	it
O	would
O	never
O	have
O	occurred
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	wish
O	such
O	beauty
O	for
O	himself
O	.
O	He
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	quite
O	contented
O	if
O	the
O	Ducks
O	in
O	the
O	duck-yard
O	had
O	but
O	endured
O	his
O	company
O	--
O	the
O	poor
O	,
O	ugly
O	creature
O	.
O	And
O	the
O	winter
O	was
O	so
O	cold
O	,
O	so
O	cold
O	,
O	the
O	Duckling
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	swim
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	to
O	keep
O	it
O	from
O	freezing
O	.
O	But
O	every
O	night
O	the
O	opening
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	swam
O	became
O	smaller
O	and
O	smaller
O	.
O	It
O	froze
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	crust
O	of
O	ice
O	crackled
O	and
O	the
O	Duckling
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	make
O	good
O	use
O	of
O	his
O	legs
O	to
O	prevent
O	the
O	water
O	from
O	freezing
O	entirely
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
O	wearied
O	out
O	,
O	he
O	lay
O	stiff
O	and
O	cold
O	in
O	the
O	ice
O	.
O	Early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	there
O	passed
O	by
O	a
O	peasant
O	who
O	saw
O	him
O	,
O	broke
O	the
O	ice
O	in
O	pieces
O	with
O	his
O	wooden
O	shoe
O	,
O	and
O	brought
O	him
O	home
O	to
O	his
O	wife
O	.
O	The
O	poor
C	Duckling
O	soon
O	revived
O	.
O	The
O	children
O	would
O	have
O	played
O	with
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	thought
O	they
O	wished
O	to
O	tease
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	terror
O	jumped
O	into
O	the
O	milk-pail
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	milk
O	was
O	spilled
O	about
O	the
O	room
O	.
O	The
O	good
O	woman
O	screamed
O	and
O	clapped
O	her
O	hands
O	.
O	He
O	flew
O	from
O	there
O	into
O	the
O	pan
O	where
O	the
O	butter
O	was
O	kept
O	,
O	and
O	thence
O	into
O	the
O	meal-barrel
O	,
O	and
O	out
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	how
O	strange
O	he
O	looked
O	!
O	The
O	woman
O	screamed
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	tongs
O	,
O	the
O	children
O	ran
O	races
O	with
O	each
O	other
O	trying
O	to
O	catch
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	laughed
O	and
O	screamed
O	likewise
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	well
O	for
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	door
O	stood
O	open
O	.
O	He
O	jumped
O	out
O	among
O	the
O	bushes
O	into
O	the
O	new-fallen
O	snow
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	lay
O	as
O	in
O	a
O	dream
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	too
O	sad
O	to
O	tell
O	all
O	the
O	trouble
O	and
O	misery
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	suffer
O	from
O	the
O	frost
O	,
O	and
O	snow
O	and
O	storms
O	of
O	the
O	winter
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	lying
O	on
O	a
O	moor
O	among
O	the
O	reeds
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	sun
O	began
O	to
O	shine
O	warmly
O	again
O	;
O	the
O	larks
O	sang
O	,
O	and
O	beautiful
O	spring
O	had
O	returned
O	.
O	Once
O	more
O	he
O	shook
O	his
O	wings
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	stronger
O	than
O	formerly
O	and
O	bore
O	him
O	forward
O	quickly
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	he
O	was
O	well
O	aware
O	of
O	it
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	large
O	garden
O	where
O	the
O	apple-trees
O	stood
O	in
O	full
O	bloom
O	,
O	where
O	the
O	syringas
O	sent
O	forth
O	their
O	fragrance
O	and
O	hung
O	their
O	long
O	green
O	branches
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	winding
O	canal
O	.
O	Oh
O	!
O	everything
O	was
O	so
O	lovely
O	,
O	so
O	full
O	of
O	the
O	freshness
O	of
O	spring
O	!
O	And
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	thicket
O	came
O	three
O	beautiful
O	white
O	Swans
O	.
O	They
O	displayed
O	their
O	feathers
O	so
O	proudly
O	and
O	swam
O	so
O	lightly
O	,
O	so
O	lightly
O	!
O	The
C	Duckling
O	knew
O	the
O	glorious
O	creatures
O	,
O	and
O	was
O	seized
O	with
O	a
O	strange
O	sadness
O	.
O	``
O	I
O	will
O	fly
O	to
O	them
O	,
O	those
O	kingly
O	birds
O	!
O	``
O	said
O	he
O	.
O	``
O	They
O	will
O	kill
O	me
O	,
O	because
O	I
O	,
O	ugly
O	as
O	I
O	am
O	,
O	have
O	dared
O	to
O	approach
O	them
O	.
O	But
O	it
O	matters
O	not
O	.
O	Better
O	to
O	be
O	killed
O	by
O	them
O	than
O	to
O	be
O	bitten
O	by
O	the
O	Ducks
O	,
O	pecked
O	by
O	the
O	Hens
O	,
O	kicked
O	by
O	the
O	girl
O	who
O	feeds
O	the
O	poultry
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	have
O	so
O	much
O	to
O	suffer
O	during
O	the
O	winter
O	!
O	``
O	He
O	flew
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	and
O	swam
O	towards
O	the
O	beautiful
O	creatures
O	.
O	They
O	saw
O	him
O	and
O	shot
O	forward
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	.
O	``
O	Only
O	kill
O	me
O	,
O	``
O	said
O	the
O	poor
O	creature
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	bowed
O	his
O	head
O	low
O	,
O	expecting
O	death
O	.
O	But
O	what
O	did
O	he
O	see
O	in
O	the
O	water
O	?
O	He
O	saw
O	beneath
O	him
O	his
O	own
O	form
O	,
O	no
O	longer
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	plump
O	,
O	ugly
O	grey
O	bird
O	--
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	Swan
O	.
O	It
O	matters
O	not
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	born
O	in
O	a
O	duck-yard
O	,
O	if
O	one
O	has
O	been
O	hatched
O	from
O	a
O	Swan
O	'
O	s
O	egg
O	.
O	And
O	now
O	the
O	Swan
O	began
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	good
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	trouble
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	through
O	.
O	He
O	would

O	he
O	was
O	if
O	he
O	had

O	first
O	had
O	all
O	his
O	sorrow
O	and
O	unhappiness
O	to
O	bear
O	.
O	The
O	larger
O	Swans
O	swam
O	round
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	stroked
O	him
O	with

O	beaks
O	.
O	Some
O	little
O	children
O	were
O	running
O	about
O	in

O	and
O	bread
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	youngest
O	exclaimed
O	:
O	``
O	There
O	is
O	a
O	new
O	one
O	!
O	``
O	The
O	others
O	also
O	cried
O	out
O	:
O	``
O	Yes
O	,
O	a
O	new
O	Swan
O	has
O	come
O	!
O	``
O	and
O	they
O	clapped
O	their
O	hands
O	,
O	and
O	danced
O	around
O	.
O	They
O	ran
O	to
O	their
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	,
O	bread
O	and
O	cake
O	were
O	thrown
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	every
O	one
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	The
O	new
O	one
O	is
O	best
O	,
O	so
O	young
O	and
O	so
O	beautiful
O	!
O	``
O	And
O	the
O	old
O	Swans
O	bowed
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	young
O	Swan
O	felt
O	quite
O	ashamed
O	,
O	and
O	hid
O	his
O	head
O	under
O	his
O	wings
O	.
O	He
O	scarcely
O	knew
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	too
O	happy
O	,
O	but
O	still
O	not
O	proud
O	,
O	for
O	a
O	good
O	heart
O	is
O	never
O	proud
O	.
O	He
O	remembered
O	how
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	persecuted
O	and
O	laughed
O	at
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	now
O	heard
O	everyone
O	say
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	of
O	all
O	beautiful
O	birds
O	.
O	The
O	syringas
O	bent
O	down
O	their
O	branches
O	toward
O	him
O	low
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	sun
O	shone
O	warmly
O	and
O	brightly
O	.
O	He
O	shook
O	his
O	feathers
O	,
O	stretched
O	his
O	slender
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	joy
O	of
O	his
O	heart
O	said
O	:
O	``
O	How
O	little
O	did
O	I
O	dream
O	of
O	so
O	much
O	happiness
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	the
O	despised
O	Ugly
O	Duckling
O	!
O	``
