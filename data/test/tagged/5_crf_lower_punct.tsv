O	thrace
O	.
O	not
O	his
O	lute
O	alone
O	,

O	he
O	himself
O	played
O	on
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	fair
O	eurydice
O	and
O	held
O	it

O	afterwards
O	,

O	and
O	no
O	sooner

O	her
O	than
O	he
O	loved

O	.
O	he
O	ran
O	after

O	to

O	his
O	love
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	,
O	afraid
O	of
O	his
O	wild
O	uncouthness
O	,
O	fled
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	she
O	ran
O	,
O	in
O	her
O	terror
O	,
O	too
O	swiftly
O	to
O	watch
O	whither
O	she
O	went
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	poisonous
O	snake
O	that
O	lurked
O	amongst
O	the
O	fern
O	bit
O	the
O	fair
O	white
O	foot
O	that
O	flitted

O	,
O	across

O	.
O	in
O	agonised
O	suffering
O	eurydice
O	died
O	.
O	her
O	spirit
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	shades
O	,
O	and
C	orpheus
O	was
O	left
O	broken-hearted
O	.
O	the
O	sad
O	winds
O	that
O	blow
O	at
O	night
O	across

O	that

O	the

O	in

O	the
O	heavy
O	clad
O	blue-black

O	,
O	all

O	than
O	any
O	,
O	arose
O	the
O	music
O	of
C	orpheus
O	,
O	a
O	long-drawn
O	sob
O	from
O	a
O	broken
O	heart
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	of
O	the
O	shadow
O	of

O	came
O	alike
O	to

O	and
O	to
O	men
O	as
O	they
O	listened
O	,
O	but
O	no

O	came
O	to
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	expression

O	sorrow
O	.
O	at
O	length
O	,
O	when
O	to

O	longer
O	was
O	impossible
O	for

O	,
C	orpheus
O	wandered
O	to

O	,
O	and
O	there
O	besought

O	to

O	to
O	seek
O	his
O	wife
O	in
O	the

O	.
C	zeus
O	,
O	moved
O	by
O	his
O	anguish
O	,
O	granted
O	the
O	permission
O	he
O	sought
O	,
O	but
O	solemnly
O	warned
O	him
O	of
O	the
O	terrible
O	perils
O	of
O	his
O	undertaking
O	.
O	but
O	the
O	love
O	of
C	orpheus
O	was
O	too
O	perfect
O	to
O	know
O	any
O	fear
O	;
O	thankfully
O	he
O	hastened
O	to
O	the
O	dark
O	cave
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	promontory
O	of

O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	entrance
O	of
O	hades
O	.
O	stark
O	and
O	grim
O	was
O	the
O	three-headed
O	watchdog
O	,
O	cerberus
O	,
O	which
O	guarded
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	growls
O	and
O	the
O	furious
O	roaring
O	of
O	a
O	wild
C	beast
O	athirst
O	for
O	its

O	it
O	greeted
C	orpheus
O	.
O	but
C	orpheus
O	touched
O	his
O	lute
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	brute
O	,
O	amazed
O	,
O	sank
O	into
O	silence
O	.
O	and
O	still
O	he
O	played
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dog
O	would
O	gently
O	have
O	licked
O	the
O	player
O	'
O	s
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	up
O	in
O	his
O	face
O	with
O	its
O	savage
O	eyes
O	full
O	of
O	the
O	light
O	that
O	we
O	see
O	in
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	the
O	dogs
O	of
O	this

O	on
O	,
O	then
O	,
O	strode
C	orpheus
O	,
O	playing
O	still
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	melody
O	he
O	drew
O	from
O	his
O	lute
O	passed
O	before
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	realms
O	of
O	pluto
O	.
O	surely
O	never
O	were
O	heard
O	such
O	strains
O	.
O	they
O	told
O	of
O	perfect
O	,

O	love
O	,
O	of
O	unending

O	,
O	of

O	ever
O	,
O	through
O	the
O	song
O	that
O	the

O	sang
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	thread
O	of
O	silver
O	that
O	is
O	woven
O	in
O	a
O	black
O	velvet

O	,
O	a

O	.
O	it
O	was
O	as

O	a
O	bird
O	sang
O	in
O	the
O	mirk
O	night
O	,
O	and

O	into

O	the

O	,
O	to
O	this

O	many

O	the

O	more
O	powerful
O	to
O	work
O	magic
O	on
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	men
O	were
O	his
O	melodies
O	than
O	were
O	the
O	songs
O	of
O	the
O	sirens
O	when
O	they
O	tried
O	to
O	capture
O	the
O	argonauts

O	mountains
O	.
O	when
O	the
O	quest
O	of
O	the
O	argonauts
O	was
O	ended
O	,
C	orpheus
O	returned
O	to

O	as
O	a

O	endured
O	hardship
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	wounded
O	soul
O	remained
O	unhealed
O	.
O	again
O	the
O	trees
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	songs
O	of
O	longing
O	.
O	again
O	they
O	echoed
O	,
O	``

O	as

O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	there
O	came
O	from
O	afar
O	an
O	ugly
O	clamour
O	of

O	it
O	struck
O	against
O	the

O	and
O	slew
O	it
