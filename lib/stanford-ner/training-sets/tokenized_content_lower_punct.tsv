C	i

O	people
O	in
O	the

O	those
O	who

O	,
O	which

O	province
O	,
O	commencing
O	about
O	two
O	hundred
O	miles
O	north
O	of
O	stockholm
O	.
O	they
O	are
O	a
O	hale
O	,
O	strong
O	race
O	,
O	with
O	yellow
O	hair
O	and
O	bright
O	blue
O	eyes
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	handsomest
O	teeth
C	i
O	ever
O	saw
O	.
O	they
O	live
O	plainly
O	,
O	but
O	very
O	comfortably
O	,
O	in
O	snug
O	wooden
O	houses
O	,
O	with
O	double
O	windows
O	and
O	doors
O	to
O	keep
O	out
O	the
O	cold
O	;
O	and
O	since
O	they
O	cannot
O	do
O	much
O	out-door
O	work
O	,
O	they
O	spin
O	and
O	weave
O	and
O	mend
O	their
O	farming
O	implements
O	in
O	the
O	large
O	family
O	room
O	,
O	thus
O	enjoying
O	the
O	winter
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	its
O	severity
O	.
O	they
O	are
O	very
O	happy
O	and
O	contented
O	,
O	and
O	few
O	of
O	them
O	would
O	be
O	willing
O	to
O	leave
O	that
O	cold
O	country
O	and
O	make
O	their
O	homes
O	in
O	a
O	warmer
O	climate
O	.
O	here
O	there
O	are
O	neither
O	railroads
O	nor
O	stages
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	government
O	has
O	established
O	post-stations
O	at
O	distances
O	varying
O	from
O	ten
O	to
O	twenty
O	miles
O	.
O	at
O	each
O	station
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	horses
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	vehicles
O	,
O	are
O	kept
O	,
O	but
O	generally
O	the
O	traveler
O	has
O	his
O	own
O	sled
O	,
O	and
O	simply
O	hires
O	the
O	horses
O	from
O	one
O	station
O	to
O	another
O	.
O	these
O	horses
O	are
O	either
O	furnished
O	by
O	the
O	keeper
O	of
O	the
O	station
O	or
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	neighboring
O	farmers
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	are
O	wanted
O	a
O	man
O	or
O	boy
O	goes
O	along
O	with
O	the
O	traveler
O	to
O	bring
O	them
O	back
O	.
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	quite
O	an
O	independent
O	and
O	convenient
O	way
O	of
O	traveling
O	,
O	if
O	the

O	were
O	always
O	ready
O	;
O	but
O	sometimes
O	you
O	must
O	wait
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	more
O	before
O	they
O	can
O	be
O	furnished
O	.
C	i
C	had
O	my

O	warm
O	.
O	so

O	as
O	the
O	weather
O	was
O	not
O	too
O	cold

O	it
O	was
