O	few
O	of

O	cold
O	country
O	and
O	make
O	their
O	homes
O	in
O	a
O	warmer
O	climate
O	.
O	Here
O	there
O	are
O	neither
O	railroads
O	nor
O	stages
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	government
O	has
O	established
O	post-stations
O	at
O	distances
O	varying
O	from
O	ten
O	to
O	twenty
O	miles
O	.
O	At
O	each
O	station
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	horses
O	,
O	and
O	sometimes
O	vehicles
O	,
O	are
O	kept
O	,
O	but
O	generally
O	the
O	traveler
O	has
O	his
O	own
O	sled
O	,
O	and
O	simply
O	hires
O	the
O	horses
O	from
O	one
O	station
O	to
O	another
O	.
O	These
O	horses
O	are
O	either
O	furnished
O	by
O	the
O	keeper
O	of
O	the
O	station
O	or
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	neighboring
O	farmers
O	,
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	are
O	wanted
O	a
O	man
O	or
O	boy
O	goes
O	along
O	with
O	the
O	traveler
O	to
O	bring
O	them
O	back
O	.
O	It
O	would
O	be
O	quite
O	an
O	independent
O	and
O	convenient
O	way
O	of
O	traveling
O	,
O	if
O	the
O	horses
O	were
O	always
O	ready
O	;
O	but
O	sometimes
O	you
O	must
O	wait
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	more
O	before
O	they
O	can
O	be
O	furnished
O	.
C	I
C	had
O	my
O	own
O	little
O	sled
O	,
O	filled

O	and
O	covered
O	with
O	reindeer-skins
O	to
O	keep

O	warm
O	.
O	So
O	long
O	as
O	the
O	weather
O	was
O	not
O	too
O	cold
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	pleasant
O	to

O	along
O	through

O	The

O	increased
O	a

C	I

O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	fancy
O	that
O	the
O	Arctic
O	climate
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	difficult
O	to
O	endure
O	as
C	I
C	had
O	supposed
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	the
O	thermometer
O	fell
O	to
O	zero
O	;
O	then
O	it
O	went
O	down
O	ten
O	degrees
O	below
O	;
O	then
O	twenty
O	,
O	and
O	finally
O	thirty
O	.
O	Being
O	dressed
O	in
O	thick
O	furs
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
O	,
C	I
O	did
O	not
O	suffer
O	greatly
O	;
O	but
C	I
O	was
O	very
O	glad
O	when
O	the
O	people
O	assured
O	me
O	that
O	such
O	extreme
O	cold
O	never
O	lasted
O	more
O	than
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	days
O	.
C	Boys
O	of
O	twelve
O	or
O	fourteen
O	very
O	often
O	went
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	bring
O	back
O	their
O	father
O	'
O	s

O	,

O	so

O	as
O	those
O	lively
O	,

O	could

O	One

O	and
O	heavy
O	coat
O	.
C	I
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	time
O	we
O	were
O	ready
O	we
O	heard
O	shouts
O	and
O	the
O	crack
O	of
O	whips
O	.
O	We
O	harnessed
O	Axel
O	to
O	the
O	sled
O	,
O	and
O	proceeded
O	slowly
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	of
O	the
O	sound
O	,
O	which
O	came
O	,
O	as
O	we
O	presently
O	saw
O	,
O	from
O	a
O	company
O	of
O	farmers
O	,
O	out
O	thus
O	early
O	to
O	plough
O	the
O	road
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	six
O	pairs
O	of
O	horses
O	geared
O	to
O	a
O	wooden
O	frame
O	,
O	something
O	like
O	the
O	bow
O	of
O	a
O	ship
O	,
O	pointed
O	in
O	front
O	and
O	spreading
O	out
O	to
O	a
O	breadth
O	of
O	ten
O	or
O	twelve
O	feet
O	.
O	This
O	machine
O	not
O	only
O	cut
O	through
O	the
O	drifts
O	but
O	packed
O	the
O	snow
O	,
O	leaving
O	a
O	good
O	,
O	solid
O	road
O	behind
O	it
O	.
O	After
O	it
O	had
O	passed
O	,
O	we
O	sped
O	along
O	merrily
O	in
O	the
O	cold
O	morning
O	twilight
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	than
O	an
O	hour
O	reached
O	the
O	post-house
O	at
O	Umeae
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	found
C	Lars
C	'
C	father
O	prepared
O	to
O	return
O	home
O	.
O	He
O	waited
O	,
O	nevertheless
O	,
O	until
C	Lars
O	had
O	eaten
O	a
O	good
O	warm
O	breakfast
O	,
O	when
C	I
O	said
O	good-bye
O	to
O	both
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	towards
O	Lapland
O	.
O	Some
O	weeks
O	afterwards
O	,
O	on
O	my
O	return
O	to
O	Stockholm
O	,
C	I
O	stopped
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	little
O	station
O	.
O	This
O	time
O	the
O	weather
O	was
O	mild
O	and
O	bright
O	,
O	and
O	the
C	father
O	would
O	have
O	gone
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	the
O	next
O	post-house
O	;
O	but
C	I
O	preferred
O	to
O	take
O	my
O	little
O	bed-fellow
O	and
O	sled-fellow
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	quiet
O	and
O	cheerful
O	and
O	fearless
O	,
O	that
O	although
C	I
O	had
O	been
O	nearly
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	world
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	away
O	from
O	home
O	,
O	although
C	I
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	and
O	he
O	a
O	young
O	boy
O	,
C	I
O	felt
O	that
C	I
O	had
O	learned
O	a
O	lesson
O	from
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	might
O	probably
O	learn
O	many
O	more
O	if
C	I
O	should
O	know
O	him
O	better
O	.
O	We
O	had
O	a
O	merry
O	trip
O	of
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	hours
O	,
O	and
O	then
C	I
O	took
O	leave
O	of
C	Lars
O	forever
O	.
O	It
O	is
O	the
O	custom
O	nowadays
O	for
O	scientists
O	and
O	for
O	other
O	scholarly
O	people
O	to
O	take
O	hold
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	myths
O	,
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	to
O	pieces
O	,

O	meaning
O	in
O	each
O	part

O	the

O	.
O	So
O	you
O	will

C	Orpheus
O	was

C	Apollo

O	,
O	and
O	himself

O	.
O	He
O	played
O	a

O	,
O	and

O	in

O	of
O	the
O	lilt
O	he
O	played
O	.
O	He
O	played
O	a
O	war-march
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	afar
O	off
O	,
O	the
O	sleeping
O	tyrants
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	sprang
O	up
O	,
O	wide
O	awake
O	,
O	and
O	bared
O	their
O	angry
O	teeth
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	untried
O	youths
O	of
O	Thrace
O	ran
O	to
O	beg

O	to
O	let
O	them
O	taste
O	battle
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	scarred

O	felt
O	on
O	their
O	thumbs
O	the
O	sharpness

O	,
O	and
O	smiled
O	,
O	well
O	content
O	.
O	While
O	he
O	played
O	it
O	would
O	seem
O	as
O	though
O	the
O	very
O	stones
O	and
O	rocks
O	gained
O	hearts
O	.
O	Nay
O	,
O	the
O	whole
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	universe
O	became
O	one
O	great
O	,
O	palpitating
O	,
O	beautiful
O	thing
O	,
O	an
O	instrument
O	from
O	whose
O	trembling
O	strings
O	was
O	drawn
O	out
O	the
O	music
O	of
C	Orpheus
O	.
O	He
O	rose
O	to
O	great
O	power
O	,
O	and
O	became
O	a
O	mighty
O	prince
O	of
O	Thrace
O	.
O	Not
O	his
O	lute
O	alone
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	himself
O	played
O	on
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	fair
C	Eurydice
O	and
O	held
O	it
O	captive
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	as
O	though
O	,
O	when
O	they
O	became
O	man
O	and
O	wife
O	,
O	all
O	happiness
O	must
O	be
O	theirs
O	.
O	But
O	although
C	Hymen
O	,
O	the
O	god
O	of
O	marriage
O	,
O	himself
O	came
O	to
O	bless
O	them
O	on
O	the
O	day
O	they
O	wed
O	,
O	the
O	omens
O	on

O	day
O	were
O	against
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	torch
O	that
C	Hymen
O	carried
O	had
O	no
O	golden
O	flame
O	,
O	but
O	sent
O	out
O	pungent
O	black
O	smoke
O	that
O	made
O	their
O	eyes
O	water
O	.
O	They
O	feared
O	they
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	,
O	soon
O	afterwards
O	,
O	as
C	Eurydice
O	wandered
O	with
O	the
O	nymphs

O	her
O	companions

O	through
O	the
O	blue-shadowed
O	woods
O	of
O	Thrace
O	,
O	the
O	reason
O	was
O	discovered
O	.
O	A
O	bold
O	shepherd
O	,
O	who
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	her
O	for
O	a
O	princess
O	,
O	saw
C	Eurydice
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	sooner
O	saw
O	her
O	than
O	he
O	loved
O	her
O	.
O	He
O	ran
O	after
O	her
O	to
O	proclaim
O	to
O	her
O	his
O	love
O	,
O	and
O	she
O	,
O	afraid
O	of
O	his
O	wild
O	uncouthness
O	,
O	fled
O	before
O	him
O	.
O	She
O	ran
O	,
O	in
O	her
O	terror
O	,
O	too
O	swiftly
O	to
O	watch
O	whither
O	she
O	went
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	poisonous
O	snake
O	that
O	lurked
O	amongst
O	the
O	fern
O	bit
O	the
O	fair
O	white
O	foot
O	that
O	flitted
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	butterfly
O	,
O	across
O	it
O	.
O	In
O	agonised
O	suffering
C	Eurydice
O	died
O	.
O	Her
O	spirit
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	Shades
O	,
O	and
C	Orpheus
O	was
O	left
O	broken-hearted
O	.
O	The
O	sad
O	winds
O	that
O	blow
O	at

O	across

O	,
O	the

O	gales
O	that
O	tell
O	of

O	and

O	,
O	the

O	that
O	wail
O	in
O	the

O	and
O	the
O	leaves
O	of
O	the
O	heavy
O	clad
O	blue-black
O	cypresses
O	,
O	all
O	now
O	were
O	hushed
O	,
O	for
O	greater
O	than
O	all
O	,
O	more
O	full
O	of

O	sorrow
O	than
O	any
O	,
O	arose
O	the

O	of
C	Orpheus
O	,
O	a
O	long-drawn
O	sob
O	from
O	a
O	broken
O	heart
O	in
O	the

O	of

O	to

O	as

O	But
O	the

O	was
O	too

O	to
O	know
O	any
O	fear
O	;
O	thankfully
O	he
O	hastened
O	to
O	the

O	cave
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	promontory
O	of
O	Taenarus
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	entrance
O	of
O	Hades
O	.
O	Stark
O	and
O	grim
O	was
O	the
O	three-headed
O	watchdog
O	,
O	Cerberus
O	,
O	which
O	guarded
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	with
O	the
O	growls
O	and
O	the
O	furious
O	roaring
O	of
O	a
O	wild
O	beast
O	athirst
O	for
O	its
O	prey
O	it
O	greeted
C	Orpheus
O	.
O	But
C	Orpheus
O	touched
O	his
O	lute
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	brute
O	,
O	amazed
O	,
O	sank
O	into
O	silence
O	.
O	And
O	still
O	he
O	played
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	dog
O	would
O	gently
O	have
O	licked
O	the
O	player
O	'
O	s
O	feet
O	,
O	and
O	looked
O	up
O	in
O	his
O	face
O	with
O	its
O	savage
O	eyes
O	full
O	of
O	the
O	light
O	that
O	we
O	see
O	in
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	the

O	of
O	this

O	as
O	they
O	gaze
O	with

O	On
O	,
O	then

O	strode
C	Orpheus
O	,

O	still
O	,
O	and
O	the

O	into

O	.
O	Surely
O	never
O	were
O	heard
O	such
O	strains
O	.
O	They
O	told
O	of
O	perfect
O	,
O	tender
O	love
O	,
O	of
O	unending
O	longing
O	,
O	of
O	pain
O	too

O	Of
