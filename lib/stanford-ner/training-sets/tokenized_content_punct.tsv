O	cupboard
O	in

O	wooden
O	shoes

O	a

O	simply
O	,
O	--
O	PUT

O	So
C	Bobo
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	a
O	stone
O	by
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	on
O	the
O	wooden
O	shoes
O	,
O	which
O	fitted
O	him
O	very
O	nicely
O	.
O	Now
O	these
O	shoes
O	were
O	magic
O	shoes
O	,
O	and
C	Bobo
O	had
O	hardly
O	stepped
O	into
O	them
O	before

O	turned
O	his
O	feet
O	inland
O	.
O	So
C	Bobo
O	obediently
O	let
O	the
O	shoes
O	guide
O	him
O	.
O	At
O	corners
O	the
O	shoes
O	always
O	turned
O	in
O	the
O	right

O	,
O	and
O	if

O	and
O	blundered
O	on

O	,
O	the

O	swiftly
O	began
O	to
O	pinch
O	his
O	toes
O	.
O	For
O	two
O	days
C	Bobo
O	walked
O	inland
O	toward

O	.

C	Bobo
O	arrived

O	and
O	Buinne
O	,
O	treacherous

O	His
O	brother
O	,
C	Illann
O	the
O	Fair
O	,
O	filled
O	with
O	shame
O	,
O	did
O	what
O	he
O	could
O	to
O	make
O	amends
O	.
O	He
O	went
O	forth
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	hundreds
O	of
O	the
O	besieging
O	army
O	fell
O	before
O	him
O	,
O	ere
O	death
O	stayed
O	his
O	loyal
O	hand
O	.
O	At
O	his
O	death
O	the
O	Ultonians
O	again
O	fired
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	first
C	Ardan
O	and
O	then
C	Ainle
O	left
O	their
O	chess
O	for
O	a
O	fiercer
O	game
O	,
O	and
O	glutted
O	their
O	sword
O	blades
O	with
O	the
O	blood
O	of
O	their
O	enemies
O	.
O	Last
O	came
O	the
O	turn
O	of
C	Naoise
O	.
O	He
O	kissed
C	Deirdrê
O	,
O	and
O	drank
O	a
O	drink
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	against
O	the
O	men
O	of
C	Conor
O	,
O	and
O	where
O	his
O	brothers
O	had
O	slain
O	hundreds
O	,
O	a
O	thousand
O	fell
O	before
O	his
O	sword
O	.
O	Then
O	fear
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	heart
O	of
C	Conor
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	foresaw
O	that
O	against
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	no
O	man
O	could
O	prevail
O	,
O	save
O	by
O	magic
O	.
O	Thus
O	he
O	sent
O	for
C	Cathbad
O	the
O	Druid
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	even
O	then
O	very
O	near
O	death
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	was
O	carried
O	on
O	a
O	litter
O	to
O	the
O	House
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Branch
O	,
O	from
O	which
O	the
O	flames
O	were
O	leaping
O	,
O	and
O	before
O	which
O	the
O	dead
O	lay
O	in
O	heaps
O	.
O	And
C	Conor
O	besought
O	him
O	to
O	help
O	him
O	to
O	subdue
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	ere
O	they
O	should
O	have
O	slain
O	every
O	Ultonian
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	.
O	So
O	by
O	his
O	magic
C	Cathbad
O	raised
O	a
O	hedge
O	of
O	spears
O	round
O	the
O	house
O	.
O	But
C	Naoise
O	,
C	Ardan
O	,
O	and
C	Ainle
O	,
O	with
C	Deirdrê
O	in
O	their
O	centre
O	,
O	sheltered
O	by
O	their
O	shields
O	,
O	burst
O	suddenly
O	forth
O	from
O	the
O	blazing
O	house
O	,
O	and
O	cut
O	a
O	way
O	for
O	themselves
O	through
O	the
O	hedge
O	as
O	though
O	they
O	sheared
O	green
O	wheat
O	.
O	And
O	,
O	laughing
O	aloud
O	,
O	they
O	took
O	a
O	terrible
O	toll
O	of
O	lives
O	from
O	the
O	Ultonians
O	who
O	would
O	have
O	withstood
O	them
O	.
O	Then
O	again
O	the
O	Druid
O	put
O	forth
O	his
O	power
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	noise
O	like
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	many
O	waters
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	ears
O	of
O	all
O	who
O	were
O	there
O	.
O	So
O	suddenly
O	the
O	magic
O	flood
O	arose
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	chance
O	of
O	escape
O	for
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	.
O	Higher
O	it
O	mounted
O	,
O	ever
O	higher
O	,
O	and
C	Naoise
O	held
C	Deirdrê
O	on
O	his
O	shoulder
O	,
O	and
O	smiled
O	up
O	in
O	her
O	eyes
O	as
O	the
O	water
O	rose
O	past
O	his
O	middle
O	.
O	Then
O	suddenly
O	as
O	it

O	,
O	the

O	abated

O	on

O	.
O	But
O	the

O	;
O	and
O	,
O	by

O	,
O	often
O	amused
O	the
C	queen
O	and
O	the
O	knights
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	.
O	The
C	king
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	rode
O	on
O	horseback
O	,
O	frequently
O	took
C	Tom
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	;
O	and
O	if
O	a
O	shower
O	of
O	rain
O	came
O	on

O	he
O	used

O	waist-coat-pocket
O	,
O	and

O	till

O	The
C	king
O	also
O	sometimes
O	questioned
C	Tom
O	concerning
O	his
O	parents
O	;
O	and
O	when
C	Tom
O	informed
O	his
O	majesty
O	they
O	were
O	very
O	poor
O	people
O	,
O	the
C	king
O	led
O	him
O	into
O	his
O	treasury
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	he
O	should
O	pay
O	his
O	friends
O	a
O	visit
O	,
O	and
O	take
O	with
O	him
O	as
O	much
O	money
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	carry
O	.
C	Tom
O	procured
O	a
O	little
O	purse
O	,
O	and
O	putting
O	a
O	threepenny

O	and
O	after

O	His
C	mother
O	met
O	him
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	almost
O	tired
O	to
O	death
O	,
O	having
O	in
O	forty-eight
O	hours
O	travelled
O	almost
O	half
O	a
O	mile
O	with
O	a
O	huge
O	silver
O	threepence
O	upon
O	his
O	back
O	.
O	Both
O	his
O	parents
O	were
O	glad
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	,
O	especially
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	such
O	an
O	amazing
O	sum
O	of
O	money
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	They
O	placed
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	walnut-shell
O	by
O	the
O	fireside
O	,
O	and
O	feasted
O	him
O	for
O	three
O	days
O	upon
O	a
O	hazel-nut
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	sick

O	for
O	a
O	whole

O	usually
O	served
O	him
O	for
O	a

O	.
C	Tom
O	got
O	well
O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	travel
O	because
O	it
O	had
O	rained:
O	therefore
O	his

O	took
O	him
O	in

O	which
O	he

O	himself
O	so
O	much

O	brought
O	on
O	a

O	our
O	ship
O	.
O	They
O	chattered
O	as

O	came
O	near
O	,
O	but
O	we
O	understood
O	not
O	their
O	language
O	.
O	They
O	climbed
O	up
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	ship

O	,

O	into
O	another

O	had

O	.

O	,
O	which

O	opened

O	We
O	saw
O	before

O	a
O	large
O	apartment
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	porch
O	,
O	having
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	a
O	heap
O	of

O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	other

O	vast
O	number
O	of
O	roasting-spits
O	.
O	We
O	trembled
O	at

O	were
O	seized

O	deadly
O	apprehension
O	,
O	when
O	suddenly
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	apartment
O	opened
O	with
O	a
O	loud
O	crash
O	,
O	and
O	there
O	came
O	out
O	the
O	horrible
O	figure
O	of
O	a
O	black
O	man
O	,
O	as
O	tall
O	as

O	lofty
O	palm-

O	He
O	had
O	but
O	one
O	eye
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	his
O	forehead
O	,
O	where
O	it
O	blazed
O	bright
O	as
O	a
O	burning
O	coal
O	.
O	His
O	fore
O	teeth
O	were
O	very
O	long
O	and
O	sharp
O	,
O	and
O	stood
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	mouth
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	as
O	deep

O	.
O	His
O	upper
O	lip
O	hung
O	down
O	upon
O	his
O	breast
O	.
O	His
O	ears
O	resembled
O	those
O	of
O	an
O	elephant
O	,
O	and
O	covered
O	his
O	shoulders
O	;
O	and
O	his
O	nails
O	were
O	as

O	and
O	crooked

O	At

O	so

O	genie
O	,
O	we
O	became
O	insensible

O	and
O	lay
O	like
O	dead
O	men
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	we
O	came
O	to
O	ourselves

O	and
O	saw
O	him
O	sitting
O	in

O	porch
O	looking

O	.
O	When
O	he
O	had

O	well

O	advanced
O	toward

O	and
O	laying
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	me
O	,
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	nape
O	of
O	my
O	neck
O	,
O	and
O	turned

O	perceiving
O	me
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	lean
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	nothing
O	but
O	skin
O	and
O	bone
O	,
O	he
O	let
O	me
O	go
O	.
O	He
O	took
O	up
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	viewed
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	.
O	The
C	captain
O	being
O	the
O	fattest
O	,
O	he
O	held
O	him
O	with

O	hand
O	,

O	would
O	do

O	sparrow
O	,
O	and
O	thrust
O	a
O	spit
O	through
O	him
O	;
O	he
O	then
O	kindled
O	a
O	great
O	fire
O	,
O	roasted
O	,
O	and
O	ate
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	apartment
O	for
O	his
O	supper
O	.
O	Having
O	finished
O	his
O	repast
O	,
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	porch
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	,
O	snoring
O	louder
O	than
O	thunder
O	.
O	He
O	slept
O	thus
O	till
O	morning
O	.
O	As
O	to
O	ourselves
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	possible
O	for
O	us
O	to
O	enjoy
O	any
O	rest
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	we
O	passed
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	painful
O	apprehension
O	that
O	can
O	be
O	imagined
O	.
O	When
O	day
O	appeared
O	the
C	giant
O	awoke
O	,
O	got
O	up
O	,
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	left
O	us
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	.
O	The
O	next
O	night
O	we
O	determined
O	to
O	revenge
O	ourselves
O	on
O	the
O	brutish
C	giant
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	so
O	in

O	following
O	manner
O	.
O	After
O	he
O	had
O	again
O	finished
O	his
O	inhuman
O	supper
O	on
O	another
O	of
O	our
O	seamen
O	,
O	he
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	we
O	heard
O	him
O	snore
O	according
O	to
O	his
O	custom
O	,
O	nine
O	of
O	the
O	boldest
O	among
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	myself
O	,
O	took
O	each
O	of
O	us
O	a
O	spit
O	,
O	and
O	putting
O	the
O	points
O	of
O	them
O	into
O	his
O	fire
O	till

O	pain
O	made
O	him
O	break
O	out
O	into
O	a
O	frightful
O	yell
O	:

O	started
O	up

O	out
O	his
O	hands
O	,
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	sacrifice
O	I
O	some
O	of
O	us
O	to
O	his
O	rage
O	;
O	but
O	we
O	ran
O	to
O	such
O	places
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	reach
O	;
O	and
O	after
O	having
O	sought
O	for
O	us
O	in
O	vain
O	,
O	he
O	groped
O	for
O	the
O	gate
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	howling
O	in
O	agony
O	.
O	We
O	immediately
O	left
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	made
O	some
O	rafts
O	,
O	each
O	large
O	enough
O	to
O	carry
O	three
O	men
O	,
O	with
O	some
O	timber
O	that
O	lay
O	about
O	in
O	great
O	quantities
O	.
O	We
O	waited
O	till
O	day
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	get
O	upon
O	them
O	,
O	for
O	we
O	hoped
O	if
O	the
C	giant
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	by
O	sunrising
O	,
O	and
O	give
O	over
O	his
O	howling
O	,
O	which
O	we
O	still
O	heard
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	prove
O	to
O	be
O	dead
O	;
O	and
O	if
O	that
O	happened
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	case
O	,
O	we
O	resolved
O	to
O	stay
O	in
O	that
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	not
O	to
O	risk
O	our
O	lives
O	upon
O	the
O	rafts
O	.
O	But
O	day
O	had
O	scarcely
O	appeared
O	when
O	we
O	perceived
O	our
O	cruel
O	enemy
O	,
O	accompanied
O	by
O	two
O	others
O	,
O	almost
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	size
O	,
O	leading
O	him
O	;
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	more
O	coming
O	before
O	him
O	at
O	a
O	quick
O	pace
O	.
O	We
O	did
O	not
O	hesitate
O	to
O	take
O	to
O	our
O	rafts
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	to
O	sea
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	speed
O	we
O	could
O	.
O	The
C	giants
O	,
O	who
O	perceived
O	this
O	,
O	took
O	up
O	great
O	stones
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	running
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	entered
O	the
O	water
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	middle
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	so
O	exactly
O	that
O	they
O	sunk
O	all
O	the
O	rafts
O	but
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	upon
O	;
O	and
O	all
O	my
O	companions
O	except
O	the
O	two
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	were
O	drowned
O	.
O	We
O	rowed
O	with
O	all
O	our
O	might
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	reach
O	of
O	the
C	giants
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	we
O	got
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	,
O	we
O	were
O	exposed
O	to
O	the
O	mercy
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	and
O	winds
O	,
O	and
O	spent
O	that
O	day
O	and
O	the
O	following
O	night
O	under
O	the
O	most
O	painful
O	uncertainty
O	as
O	to
O	our
O	fate
O	;
O	but
O	next
O	morning
O	we
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	fortune
O	to
O	be
O	thrown
O	upon
O	an
O	island
O	,
O	where
O	we
O	landed
O	with
O	much
O	joy
O	.
O	We
O	found
O	excellent
O	fruit
O	,
O	which
O	afforded
O	us
O	great
O	relief
O	,
O	and
O	recruited
O	our
O	strength
O	.
O	At
O	night
O	we
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	on
O	the
O	sea-shore
O	;
O	but
O	were
O	awakened
O	by
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	a
C	serpent
O	of
O	surprising
O	length
O	and
O	thickness
O	,
O	whose
O	scales
O	made
O	a
O	rustling
O	noise
O	as
O	he
O	wound
O	himself
O	along
O	.
O	It
O	swallowed
O	up
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	comrades
O	,
O	notwithstanding
O	his
O	loud
O	cries
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	efforts
O	he
O	made
O	to
O	extricate
O	himself
O	from
O	it
O	;
O	dashing
O	him
O	several
O	times
O	against
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	it
O	crushed
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	could
O	hear
O	it
O	gnaw
O	and
O	tear
O	the
O	poor
O	fellow
O	'
O	s
O	bones
O	,
O	though
O	we
O	had
O	fled
O	to
O	a

O	.
O	The
O	following
O	day
O	,
O	to
O	our
O	great
O	terror
O	,
O	we
O	saw
O	the

O	""""
O	As
O	we
O	walked
O	about
O	we
O	saw
O	a
O	large
O	,
O	tall
O	tree
O	,
O	upon
O	which
O	we
O	designed
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	following
O	night
O	for
O	our
O	security
O	;
O	and
O	having
O	satisfied
O	our
O	hunger
O	with
O	fruit
O	,
O	we
O	mounted
O	it
O	accordingly
O	.
O	Shortly
O	after
O	the
C	serpent
O	came
O	hissing
O	to
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	;
O	raised
O	itself
O	up
O	against
O	the
O	trunk
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	meeting
O	with
O	my
O	comrade
O	,
O	who
O	sat
O	lower
O	than
O	I
O	,
O	swallowed
O	him
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	off
O	.
O	I
O	remained
O	upon
O	the
O	tree
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	came
O	down
O	,
O	more
O	like
O	a
O	dead
O	man
O	than
O	one
O	alive
O	,
O	expecting
O	the
O	same
O	fate
O	with
O	my
O	two
O	companions
O	.
O	This
O	filled
O	me
O	with
O	horror
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	advanced
O	some
O	steps
O	to
O	throw
O	myself
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	;
O	but
O	I
O	withstood
O	this
O	dictate
O	of
O	despair
O	,
O	and
O	submitted
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	God
O	,
O	who
O	disposes
O	of
O	our
O	lives
O	at
O	His
O	pleasure
O	.
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	I
O	collected
O	together
O	a
O	great
O	quantity
O	of
O	small
O	wood
O	,
O	brambles
O	,
O	and
O	dry
O	thorns
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	them
O	up
O	into
O	fagots
O	,
O	made
O	a
O	wide
O	circle
O	with
O	them
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	tied
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	branches

O	.
O	Having
O	done
O	this
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	evening
O	came
O	,
O	I
O	shut
O	myself
O	up
O	within
O	this
O	circle
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	melancholy
O	satisfaction
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	neglected
O	nothing
O	which
O	could
O	preserve
O	me
O	from
O	the
O	cruel
O	destiny
O	with
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	threatened
O	.
O	The
C	serpent
O	failed
O	not
O	to
O	come
O	at
O	the
O	usual
O	hour
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	seeking
O	for
O	an
O	opportunity
O	to
O	devour
O	me
O	,
O	but
O	was
O	prevented
O	by
O	the
O	rampart
O	I
O	had
O	made
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	lay
O	till
O	day
O	,
O	like
O	a
O	cat
O	watching
O	in
O	vain

O	mouse

O	fortunately
O	reached
O	a
O	place
O	of
O	safety
O	.
O	When
O	day
O	appeared

O	retired
O	,

O	dared
O	not
O	leave
O	my
O	fort
O	until
O	the
O	sun
O	arose
O	.
O	God
O	took
O	compassion

O	;

O	was
O	going
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	fit
O	of
O	desperation
O	,
O	to
O	throw
O	myself
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	,
O	I
O	perceived
O	a
O	ship
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	.
O	I
O	called
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	unfolding
O	the
O	linen
O	of
O	my
O	turban
O	,
O	displayed
O	it
O	that

O	darkness
O	of
O	her
C	father
O	'
O	s
O	countenance
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	his
O	angry
O	words
O	,
O	she
O	turned
O	pale
O	as
O	death
O	,
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	his
O	temper
O	,
O	and
O	doubted
O	not
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	put
O	his
O	threats
O	into
O	execution
O	.
O	Without
O	uttering
O	a
O	word
O	in
O	reply
O	,
O	she
O	retired
O	to
O	her
O	chamber
O	,
O	and
O	pondered
O	vainly
O	how
O	to
O	escape
O	the
O	storm
O	that
O	hung
O	over
O	her
O	.
O	The
O	great
O	festival
O	approached
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	,
O	and
O	her
O	anguish
O	increased
O	every
O	day
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	lovers
O	resolved
O	on
O	flight
O	.
C	Orm
O	knew
O	a
O	secure
O	place
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	could
O	hide
O	until
O	they
O	found
O	an
O	opportunity
O	of
O	quitting
O	the
O	country
O	.
O	So
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	when
O	all
O	were
O	asleep
O	,
O	he
O	led
O	the
O	trembling
C	Aslog
O	over
O	the
O	snow
O	and
O	ice-fields
O	away
O	to
O	the
O	mountains
O	.
O	The
O	moon
O	and
O	the
O	stars
O	lighted
O	them
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	.
O	They
O	had
O	under
O	their
O	arms
O	a
O	few
O	articles
O	of
O	dress
O	and
O	some
O	skins
O	of
O	animals
O	,
O	which
O	were
O	all
O	they
O	could
O	carry
O	.
O	They
O	ascended
O	the
O	mountains
O	the
O	whole
O	night
O	long
O	,
O	till
O	they
O	reached
O	a
O	lonely
O	spot
O	inclosed
O	with
O	lofty
O	rocks
O	.
O	Here
C	Orm
O	conducted
O	the
O	weary
C	Aslog
O	into
O	a
O	cave
O	,
O	the
O	low
O	and
O	narrow
O	entrance
O	to
O	which
O	was
O	hardly
O	perceptible
O	,
O	but
O	it
O	soon
O	enlarged
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	hall
O	,
O	reaching
O	deep
O	into
O	the
O	mountain
O	.
O	He
O	kindled
O	a
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	now
O	,
O	reposing
O	on
O	their
O	skins
O	,
O	sat
O	in
O	the
O	deepest
O	solitude
O	far
O	away
O	from
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	.
C	Orm
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	who
O	had
O	discovered
O	this
O	cave
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	shown
O	to
O	this
O	very
O	day
O	.
O	But
O	as
O	no
O	one
O	then
O	knew
O	anything
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	they
O	were
O	safe
O	from
O	the
O	pursuit
O	of
C	Aslog
O	'
O	s
C	father
O	.
O	They
O	passed
O	the
O	whole
O	winter
O	in
O	this
O	retirement
O	,
O	contented
O	and
O	even
O	happy
O	;
O	for
O	they
O	knew
O	they
O	were
O	married
O	,
O	and
O	belonged
O	to
O	one
O	another
O	,
O	and
O	no
O	cruel
C	father
O	could
O	separate
O	them
O	more
O	.
C	Orm
O	used
O	to
O	go
O	a-hunting
O	,
O	and
C	Aslog
O	stayed
O	at
O	home
O	in
O	the
O	cave
O	,
O	minded
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	prepared
O	the
O	necessary
O	food
O	.
O	Frequently
O	did
O	she
O	mount
O	the
O	points
O	of
O	the
O	rocks
O	,
O	but
O	her
O	eyes
O	,
O	did
O	they
O	wander
O	ever
O	so
O	far
O	,
O	saw
O	only
O	glittering
O	snow-fields
O	.
O	The
O	spring
O	now
O	came
O	on
O	--
O	the
O	woods
O	were
O	green
O	--
O	the
O	meadows
O	put
O	on
O	their
O	various
O	colors
O	,
O	people
O	began
O	to
O	wander
O	out
O	for
O	summer
O	pleasuring
O	,
O	and
C	Aslog
O	could
O	but
O	rarely
O	and
O	with
O	circumspection
O	venture
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	cave
O	.
O	One
O	evening
C	Orm
O	came
O	in
O	with
O	the
O	intelligence
O	that

O	,
O	and

O	drove
O	into
O	the
O	open

O	Nothing

O	.
O	At
O	break
O	of
O	day
O	the

O	and
O	thirst

O	began
O	now

O	Three

O	on
O	the
O	evening
O	of
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	,

O	magnitude
O	,

O	surrounded

O	;
O	some
O	mussels

O	so
O	that

O	was
O	soon
O	able

O	The

C	Orm

C	Orm

O	When
O	the

O	had
O	thus
O	spoken
O	she
O	vanished
O	,
O	and
C	Aslog
O	and
C	Orm
O	lived
O	without
O	any
O	disturbance
O	,
O	contented
O	and
O	happy
O	.
C	Orm
O	never

O	net
O	without
O	getting
O	a

O	never

O	arrow
O	from

O	,

O	it
O	ever
O	so
O	trifling
O	,
O	evidently
O	prospered
O	.
O	When
O	Christmas
O	came
O	,
O	they
O	cleaned
O	up
O	the
O	house
O	in
O	the
O	best
O	manner
O	,
O	set
O	everything
O	in
O	order
O	,
O	kindled
O	a
O	fire
O	on
O	the
O	hearth
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	twilight
O	approached
O	they
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	loft
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	remained
O	quite
O	still
O	and
O	quiet
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	it
O	grew
O	dark
O	;
O	they
O	thought
O	they
O	heard
O	a
O	sound
O	of
O	whizzing
O	and
O	snorting
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	the
O	swans
O	used
O	to
O	make
O	in
O	the
O	winter
O	time
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	roof
O	over
O	the
O	fireplace
O	,
O	which
O	might
O	be
O	opened
O	and
O	shut
O	either
O	to
O	let
O	in
O	the
O	light
O	from
O	above
O	,
O	or
O	to
O	afford
O	a
O	free
O	passage
O	for
O	the
O	smoke
O	.
C	Orm
O	lifted
O	up
O	the
O	lid
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	a
O	skin
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	out
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	But
O	what
O	a
O	wonderful
O	sight
O	then
O	presented
O	itself
O	to
O	his
O	eyes
O	!
O	The
O	little
O	islands
O	around
O	were
O	all
O	lit
O	up
O	with
O	countless
O	blue
O	lights
O	,
O	which
O	moved
O	about
O	without
O	ceasing
O	,
O	jumped
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	,
O	then
O	skipped
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	assembled
O	together
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	to
O	the
O	large
O	island
O	where
C	Orm
O	and
C	Aslog
O	lived
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	they
O	reached
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	arranged
O	themselves
O	in
O	a
O	circle
O	around
O	a
O	large
O	stone
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	,
O	and
O	which
C	Orm
O	well
O	knew
O	.
O	But
O	what
O	was
O	his
O	surprise
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	stone
O	had
O	now
O	completely
O	assumed
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	though
O	a
O	monstrous
O	and
O	gigantic
O	one
O	!
O	He
O	could
O	clearly
O	perceive
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	blue
O	lights
O	were
O	borne
O	by
C	Dwarfs
O	whose
O	pale
O	clay-coloured
O	faces
O	,
O	with
O	their
O	huge
O	noses
O	and
O	red
O	eyes
O	,
O	disfigured
O	too
O	by
O	birds
O	'
O	bills
O	and
O	owls
O	'
O	eyes
O	,
O	were
O	supported
O	by
O	misshapen
O	bodies
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	tottered
O	and
O	wabbled
O	about
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	merry
O	and
O	in
O	pain
O	.
O	Suddenly
O	,
O	the
O	circle
O	opened
O	;
O	the
O	little
O	ones
O	retired
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	,
O	and
C	Guru
O	was
O	the
O	woman
C	Guru
O	,
O	whom
C	Orm
O	recognised
O	immediately
O	,
O	though
O	she
O	had
O	risen
O	in
O	stature
O	and
O	size
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	be
O	almost
O	as
O	gigantic
O	as
O	the
O	stone
O	man
O	--
O	advanced
O	towards
O	it
O	.
O	She
O	threw
O	both
O	her
O	arms
O	round
O	the
O	image
O	,
O	which
O	immediately
O	seemed
O	to
O	receive
O	life
O	and
O	motion
O	.
O	Then
O	the
C	Dwarfs
O	,
O	with
O	wonderful
O	capers
O	and
O	grimaces
O	,
O	began
O	a
O	song
O	,
O	or
O	,
O	to
O	speak
O	more
O	properly
O	,
O	a
O	howl
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	the
O	whole
O	island
O	resounded
O	and
O	almost
O	trembled
O	at
O	the
O	noise
O	.
C	Orm
O	,
O	quite
O	terrified
O	,
O	drew
O	in
O	his
O	head
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	and
C	Aslog
O	remained
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	,
O	so
O	still
O	that
O	they
O	hardly
O	ventured
O	to
O	draw
O	their
O	breath
O	.
O	The
O	procession
O	moved
O	on
O	towards
O	the
O	house
O	,
O	as
O	might
O	be
O	clearly
O	perceived
O	by
O	the
O	nearer
O	approach
O	of
O	the
O	shouting
O	and
O	crying
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	now
O	all
O	come
O	in
O	,
O	light
O	and
O	active
O	;
O	the
C	Dwarfs
O	were
O	heard
O	jumping
O	about
O	on
O	the
O	benches
O	,
O	and
O	heavy
O	and
O	loud
O	sounded
O	at
O	intervals
O	the
O	steps
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	.
C	Orm
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	clattering
O	of
O	the
O	plates
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	shouts
O	of
O	joy
O	with
O	which
O	they
O	celebrated
O	their
O	banquet
O	.
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	over
O	and
O	midnight
O	drew
O	near
O	,
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	dance
O	to
O	that
O	ravishing
O	fairy-tune
O	,
O	which
O	some
O	have
O	heard
O	in
O	the
O	rocky
O	glens
O	,
O	and
O	learned
O	by
O	listening
O	to
O	the
O	underground
O	musicians
O	.
O	As
O	soon
O	as
C	Aslog
O	caught
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	this
O	air
O	,
O	she
O	felt
O	an
O	irresistible
O	longing
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	dance
O	.
O	Nor

O	in

O	before

O	Into

O	the
C	Queen
O	,
O	holding
O	her

O	.
O	It
O	was
O	winter

O	heavy

O	Presently

O	All

O	she

O	bravely
O	on
O	through

O	silence

O	the
O	cold
O	,
O	her
O	heart
O	sinking
O	as
O	mile

O	mile
O	revealed
O	no

O	But
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	,
O	when
O	the

O	shield
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	could
O	scarcely
O	be
O	seen
O	through
O	the
O	tangle
O	of
O	the
O	wild
O	wood-branches
O	,

O	The

O	thatched
O	hut
O	in
O	the
O	silent
O	wood
O	;
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	.
O	The
C	dwarf
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	the
C	Queen
O	,
O	but
O	his
O	efforts
O	were
O	vain
O	,
O	for
O	the
O	poor
O	woman
O	was
O	so
O	weak
O	and
O	exhausted
O	that
O	she
O	died
O	without
O	telling
O	the
C	dwarf
O	anything
O	about
O	herself
O	or
O	the
O	child
O	she
O	carried
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	little
C	dwarf
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	,
O	kind
O	old
O	fellow
O	,
O	brought
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	up
O	as

O	.
O	His
O	brother
O	,
O	the
O	dwarf
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	,
O	made
O	her
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	his
O	cousins
O	,
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	of
O	the
O	pines
O	,
O	made
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	dresses
O	from
O	cloth
O	woven
O	on
O	fairy
O	looms
O	.
O	Now
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	night
O	her
O	mother
O	brought
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	hut
O	,
O	the
O	little

O	wearing

O	and
O	the

O	So
O	the
C	dwarf
O	called
O	the

O	,
O	and
O	her
O	skin
O	was

O	One

O	,

O	,
O	after
O	recommending
O	ourselves

O	,
O	set
O	sail
O	.
O	We

O	island
O	to
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	exchanged
O	commodities
O	with

O	One

O	I

O	I

O	,
O	I
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	die
O	with
O	grief
O	.
O	I
O	cried
O	out
O	in
O	agony
O	,
O	beat
O	my
O	head
O	and
O	breast
O	,
O	and
O	threw
O	myself
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	lay
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	despair
O	.
O	I
O	upbraided
O	myself
O	a
O	hundred
O	times
O	for
O	not
O	being
O	content
O	with
O	the
O	produce
O	of
O	my

O	,
O	that
O	might

O	sufficed
O	me
O	all
O	my
O	life
O	.
O	But
O	all
O	this
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	,
O	and
O	my
O	repentance
O	came
O	too
O	late
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	I
O	resigned
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	God
O	.
O	Not
O	knowing
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	I
O	climbed
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	lofty
O	tree
O	,
O	from
O	which
O	I
O	looked
O	about
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	,
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	I
O	could
O	discover
O	anything
O	that
O	could
O	give
O	me
O	hopes
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	gazed
O	toward
O	the
O	sea
O	I
O	could
O	see
O	nothing
O	but
O	sky
O	and
O	water
O	;
O	but
O	looking
O	over
O	the
O	land
O	I
O	beheld
O	something
O	white
O	;
O	and
O	coming
O	down
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	what
O	provision
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	,
O	and
O	went
O	toward
O	it
O	,
O	the
O	distance
O	being
O	so
O	great
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	distinguish
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	approached
O	,
O	I
O	thought
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	white
O	dome
O	,
O	of
O	a
O	prodigious
O	height
O	and
O	extent
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	it
O	,
O	I
O	touched
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	smooth
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	round
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	open
O	on
O	any
O	side
O	,
O	but
O	saw
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	climbing
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	smooth
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	at
O	least
O	fifty
O	paces
O	round
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	set
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	of
O	a
O	sudden
O	the
O	sky
O	became
O	as
O	dark
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	covered
O	with
O	a
O	thick
O	cloud
O	.
O	I
O	was
O	much
O	astonished
O	at
O	this
O	sudden
O	darkness
O	,
O	but
O	much
O	more
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	it
O	occasioned
O	by
O	a
O	bird
O	of
O	a
O	monstrous
O	size
O	,
O	that
O	came
O	flying
O	toward
O	me
O	.
O	I
O	remembered
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	often
O	heard
O	mariners
O	speak
O	of
O	a
O	miraculous
O	bird
O	called
O	the
C	roc
O	,
O	and
O	conceived
O	that
O	the
O	great
O	dome
O	which
O	I
O	so
O	much
O	admired
O	must
O	be
O	its
O	egg
O	.
O	In
O	short
O	,
O	the
O	bird
O	alighted
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	over
O	the
O	egg
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	perceived
O	her
O	coming
O	,
O	I
O	crept
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	egg
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	before
O	me
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	legs
O	of
O	the
O	bird
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	as
O	big
O	as
O	the
O	trunk
O	of
O	a
O	tree
O	.
O	I
O	tied
O	myself
O	strongly
O	to
O	it
O	with
O	my
O	turban
O	,
O	in
O	hopes
O	that
O	the
C	roc
O	next
O	morning
O	would
O	carry
O	me
O	with
O	her
O	out
O	of
O	this
O	desert
O	island
O	.
O	After
O	having
O	passed
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	this
O	condition
O	,
O	the
O	bird
O	flew
O	away
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	daylight
O	,
O	and
O	carried
O	me
O	so
O	high
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	discern
O	the
O	earth
O	;
O	she
O	afterward
O	descended
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	rapidity
O	that
O	I
O	lost
O	my
O	senses
O	.
O	But
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	I
O	speedily
O	untied
O	the
O	knot
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	scarcely
O	done
O	so
O	,
O	when
O	the
C	roc
O	,
O	having
O	taken
O	up
O	a
O	serpent
O	of
O	monstrous
O	length
O	in
O	her
O	bill
O	,
O	flew
O	away
O	.
O	The
O	spot
O	where
O	it
O	left
O	me
O	was
O	encompassed
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	by
O	mountains
O	,
O	that
O	seemed
O	to
O	reach
O	above
O	the
O	clouds
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	steep
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	possibility
O	of
O	getting
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	new
O	perplexity
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	I
O	compared
O	this
O	place
O	with
O	the
O	desert
O	island
O	from
O	which
O	the
C	roc
O	had
O	brought
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	gained
O	nothing
O	by
O	the
O	change
O	.
O	As
O	I
O	walked
O	through
O	this
O	valley
O	,
O	I
O	perceived
O	it
O	was
O	strewn
O	with
O	diamonds
O	,
O	some
O	of
O	which
O	were
O	of
O	a
O	surprising
O	bigness
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	pleasure
O	in
O	looking
O	upon
O	them
O	;
O	but
O	shortly
O	saw
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	such
O	objects
O	as
O	greatly
O	diminished
O	my
O	satisfaction
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	view
O	without
O	terror
O	,
O	namely
O	,
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	serpents
O	,
O	so
O	monstrous
O	that
O	the
O	least
O	of
O	them
O	was
O	capable
O	of
O	swallowing
O	an
O	elephant
O	.
O	They
O	retired
O	in
O	the
O	daytime
O	to
O	their
O	dens
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	hid
O	themselves
O	from
O	the
C	roc
O	,
O	their
O	enemy
O	,
O	and
O	came
O	out
O	only
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	.
O	I
O	spent
O	the
O	day
O	in
O	walking
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	resting
O	myself
O	at
O	times
O	in
O	such
O	places
O	as
O	I
O	thought
O	most
O	convenient
O	.
O	When
O	night
O	came
O	on
O	I
O	went
O	into
O	a
O	cave
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	thought
O	I
O	might
O	repose
O	in
O	safety
O	.
O	I
O	secured
O	the
O	entrance
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	low
O	and
O	narrow
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	,
O	to
O	preserve
O	me
O	from
O	the
O	serpents
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	to
O	exclude
O	the
O	light
O	.
O	I
O	supped
O	on
O	part
O	of
O	my
O	provisions
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	serpents
O	,
O	which
O	began
O	hissing
O	round
O	me
O	,
O	put
O	me
O	into
O	such
O	extreme
O	fear
O	that
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	sleep
O	.
O	When
O	day
O	appeared
O	the
O	serpents
O	retired
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	cave
O	trembling
O	.
O	I
O	can
O	justly
O	say
O	that
O	I
O	walked
O	upon
O	diamonds
O	,
O	without
O	feeling
O	any
O	inclination
O	to
O	touch
O	them
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	I
O	sat
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	notwithstanding
O	my
O	apprehensions
O	,
O	not
O	having
O	closed
O	my
O	eyes
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	fell
O	asleep
O	,
O	after
O	having
O	eaten
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	of
O	my
O	provisions
O	.
O	But
O	I
O	had
O	scarcely
O	shut
O	my
O	eyes
O	when
O	something
O	that
O	fell
O	by
O	me
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	awaked
O	me
O	.
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	large
O	piece
O	of
O	raw
O	meat
O	;
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	I
O	saw
O	several
O	others
O	fall
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	rocks
O	in
O	different
O	places
O	.
O	I
O	had
O	always
O	regarded
O	as
O	fabulous
O	what
O	I
O	had
O	heard
O	sailors
O	and
O	others
O	relate
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	of
O	diamonds
O	,
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	stratagems
O	employed
O	by
C	merchants
O	to
O	obtain
O	jewels
O	from
O	thence
O	;
O	but
O	now
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	stated
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	truth
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	fact
O	is
O	,
O	that
O	the
C	merchants
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	neighborhood
O	of
O	this
O	valley
O	,
O	when
O	the
C	eagles
O	have
O	young
O	ones
O	,
O	and
O	throwing
O	great
O	joints
O	of
O	meat
O	into
O	the
O	valley
O	,
O	the
O	diamonds
O	,
O	upon
O	whose
O	points
O	they
O	fall
O	,
O	stick
O	to
O	them
O	;
O	the
C	eagles
O	,
O	which
O	are
O	stronger
O	in
O	this
O	country
O	than
O	anywhere
O	else
O	,
O	pounce
O	with
O	great
O	force
O	upon
O	those
O	pieces
O	of
O	meat
O	and
O	carry
O	them
O	to
O	their
O	nests
O	on
O	the
O	precipices
O	of

O	When
C	Fortunatus
O	had

O	he
O	took
O	his
O	hat
O	and
O	walked
O	to
O	the
O	sea-side
O	,
O	thinking
O	of
O	what

O	could

O	as
O	to
O	be
O	no

O	Just
O	as
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	sea-shore
O	,
O	the
C	Earl
O	of
O	Flanders
O	,
O	who

O	,
O	to

C	Fortunatus

O	When
O	the
C	Earl
O	saw
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	smart-looking
O	lad
O	,
O	and
O	heard
O	the
O	quick
O	replies
O	which
O	he
O	made
O	to
O	his
O	questions
O	,
O	he
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	his
O	service
O	;
O	so
O	at
O	once
O	they
O	all
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	.
O	On
O	their
O	way
O	the
O	ship
O	stopped
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	at
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	Venice
O	,
O	where
C	Fortunatus
O	saw
O	many
O	strange
O	things
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	wish
O	still
O	more
O	to
O	travel
O	,
O	and
O	taught
O	him
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	before
O	.
O	Soon
O	after
O	this
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	Flanders
O	;
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	not

O	on
O	shore
O	,
O	before
O	the
C	Earl
O	,
O	his
O	master
O	,
O	was
O	married
O	to
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Cleves
O	.
O	The
O	wedding
O	was
O	kept
O	with
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	public
O	feasting
O	,
O	and
O	games
O	on
O	horseback
O	,
O	called
O	tilts

O	many
O	days
O	;

O	,
O	among
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	the
C	Earl
O	'
O	s
O	lady
O	gave
O	two
O	jewels
O	as
O	prizes
O	to
O	be
O	played
O	for
O	,
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	a
O	hundred
O	crowns
O	.
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	was
O	won
O	by

O	the
O	other
O	by
C	Timothy
O	,
O	a
O	servant
O	of
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Burgundy
O	;
O	who
O	afterwards
O	ran
O	another
O	tilt
O	with
C	Fortunatus
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	winner
O	was
O	to
O	have
O	both
O	the
O	jewels

O	So
O	they
O	tilted
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	fourth

O	,
C	Fortunatus
O	hoisted
C	Timothy
O	a
O	full
O	spear
O	'

O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	,
O	and
O	thus
O	won
O	both
O	the
O	jewels
O	,
O	which
O	pleased
O	the
C	Earl
O	and
C	Countess
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	they
O	praised
C	Fortunatus
O	,
O	and
O	thought
O	better
O	of
O	him
O	than
O	ever
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	time
O	,
O	also
O	,
C	Fortunatus
O	had
O	many
O	rich
O	presents
O	given
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	lords
O	and
O	ladies
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	high
O	favour
O	shown
O	him
O	made
O	his
O	fellow-servants
O	jealous
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	,
O	named
C	Robert
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	always
O	pretended
O	a
O	great

O	the
C	Earl

O	in

O	,
O	envied
O	him
O	his
O	great
O	skill
O	in
O	tilting

C	Robert
O	said
O	,
O	too

O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	the
C	Earl

O	next
O	day
O	,
O	while
O	they
O	should
O	all

O	out
O	hunting
O	.
C	Fortunatus
O	thanked
O	the
O	wicked
C	Robert
O	for
O	what
O	he
O	thought
O	a

O	took

O	the
C	Earl

O	When
O	the
C	Earl
O	heard
O	that
C	Fortunatus
O	had
O	gone
O	away
O	in
O	a
O	hurry
O	,
O	he

O	much

O	then

O	landed
O	in

O	finding
O	no

O	heartily
O	;

O	had
O	nothing

O	came
O	on

O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	growling
O	of
O	wild
O	beasts
O	,
O	so
O	he
O	climbed
O	up
O	a
O	high
O	tree
O	for
O	safety
O	,

O	looked

O	to
O	climb
O	up
O	the
O	tree
O	to
O	get
O	at

O	.
C	Fortunatus
O	drew
O	his

O	then
O	he
O	ran

O	through

O	body
O	.
O	This
O	drove
O	the
O	bear
O	so
O	very
O	savage
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	great
O	spring
O	to
O	get
O	at
O	him
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	bough
O	broke
O	,

O	down

O	fell
O	,
O	and
O	lay
O	sprawling
O	and
O	howling
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	.
C	Fortunatus
O	now
O	looked
O	around
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	no
O	more
O	wild
O	beasts
O	near
O	,

O	thought

O	be
O	a
O	good
O	time
O	to
O	get
O	rid
O	of
O	the
O	bear
O	at
O	once
O	;
O	so
O	down
O	he
O	came
O	,
O	and
O	killed
O	him
O	at
O	a
O	single
O	blow
O	.
O	Being

O	starved
O	for
O	want

O	,
O	the

O	stooped
O	down
O	,

O	was
O	going
O	to
O	suck
O	the
O	blood
O	of
O	the
O	bear
O	;

O	looking

O	port
O	of

O	.
O	There
O	,
O	however
O	,
C	Fortunatus
O	found
O	,

O	grief
O	and
O	self-reproach
O	,
O	that
O	his
O	father
O	and

O	were
O	both
O	dead
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	an
O	easy-tempered
O	gentleman
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	his
O	betrothed
C	Cassandra
O	and
O	her
O	whole
O	family
O	to
O	reconcile
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	grief
O	,
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	last
O	very
O	long
O	;
O	the
O	wedding
O	took
O	place
O	almost
O	immediately
O	;
O	so
O	they
O	lived
O	all
O	together
O	in
O	Famagosta
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	very
O	great
O	style
O	.
O	By
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	year
O	,
O	the
O	Lady
C	Cassandra
O	had
O	a
O	little
O	son
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	christened
C	Ampedo
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	year
O	another
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	christened
O	Andolucia
O	.
O	For
O	twelve
O	years
C	Fortunatus
O	lived
O	a
O	very
O	happy
O	life
O	with
O	his

O	and
O	children
O	,

O	'
O	s
O	kindred
O	;
O	and
O	as
O	each
O	of
O	her

O	had
O	a
O	fortune
O	given

O	from
O	the
O	purse
O	of
C	Fortunatus
O	,
O	they
O	soon
O	married
O	very
O	well
O	.
O	But
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	long
O	to
O	travel
O	again
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	thought
O	,
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	now
O	so
O	much
O	older
O	and
O	wiser
O	than
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	at
O	Paris
O	,
O	he
O	might

O	.
O	After

O	got
O	the
O	consent
O	of
O	the
O	Lady
C	Cassandra
O	,
O	and
O	made
O	her
O	a
O	promise
O	to
O	stay
O	away
O	only
O	two
O	years
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	all
O	things
O	ready
O	for
O	his
O	journey
O	;
O	and
O	taking
O	his
O	lady
O	into
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	private
O	rooms
O	,
O	he
O	showed
O	her
O	three
O	chests
O	of
O	gold
O	.
O	He
O	told
O	her
O	to
O	keep
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	for
O	herself
O	,
O	and
O	take
O	charge
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	for
O	their
O	sons
O	,
O	in
O	case
O	any
O	evil
O	should
O	happen
O	to
O	him
O	.
O	He
O	then
O	led
O	her
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	room
O	where
O	the
O	whole
O	family
O	were
O	sitting
O	,
O	embraced
O	them
O	all
O	tenderly
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	set
O	sail
O	with
O	a
O	fair
O	wind
O	for
O	Alexandria
O	.
O	When
C	Fortunatus
O	came
O	to
O	this
O	place
O	,
O	he
O	was
O	told
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	custom
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	handsome
O	present
O	to
O	the
O	sultan
O	;
O	so
O	he
O	sent
O	him
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	plate
O	that
O	cost
O	five
O	thousand
O	pounds
O	.
O	The
O	sultan
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	pleased
O	with
O	this
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	ordered
O	a
O	hundred
O	casks
O	of
O	spices
O	to
O	be
O	given
O	to
C	Fortunatus
O	in
O	return
O	.
C	Fortunatus
O	sent
O	these
O	straight
O	to
O	the
O	Lady
C	Cassandra
O	,
O	with
O	the
O	most
O	tender
O	letters
O	,
O	by

O	wished
O	to

O	He
O	then
O	bought
O	a

O	and
O	set
O	off

O	went
O	through
O	Turkey
O	,
O	Persia
O	,
O	and
O	from
O	thence
O	to

O	never

O	grow
O	as

O	as
O	that
O	of
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	was
O	old
O	enough
O	his
O	tutor
O	taught
O	him
O	history
O	;
O	and
O	whenever
O	any
O	great
C	king
O	or
O	lovely
C	princess
O	was
O	referred
O	to
O	,
O	the
O	tutor
O	always
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	mention
O	that
O	he
O	or
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	long
O	nose
O	.
O	All
O	the
O	royal
O	apartments
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	pictures
O	and
O	portraits
O	having
O	this
O	peculiarity
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	at
O	last
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	began
O	to
O	regard
O	the
O	length
O	of
O	his
O	nose
O	as
O	his
O	greatest
O	perfection
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	had
O	it
O	an
O	inch
O	less
O	even
O	to
O	save
O	his
O	crown
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	was
O	twenty
O	years
O	old
O	his
O	mother
O	and
O	his
O	people
O	wished
O	him
O	to
O	marry
O	.
O	They
O	procured
O	for
O	him
O	the
O	likenesses
O	of
O	many
O	princesses
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	one
O	he
O	preferred
O	was
C	princess
C	Darling
O	,
O	daughter
O	of
O	a
O	powerful
O	monarch
O	and
O	heiress
O	to
O	several
O	kingdoms
O	.
O	Alas
O	!
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	beauty
O	,
O	this
C	princess
O	had
O	one
O	great
O	misfortune
O	,
O	a
O	little
O	turned-up
O	nose
O	,
O	which
O	,
O	every
O	one
O	else
O	said
O	,
O	made
O	her
O	only
O	the
O	more
O	bewitching
O	.
O	But
O	here
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	,
O	the
O	courtiers
O	were
O	thrown
O	by
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	utmost
O	perplexity
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	laughing
O	at
O	all
O	small
O	noses
O	;
O	but
O	how
O	dared
O	they
O	make
O	fun
O	of
O	the
O	nose
O	of
C	princess
C	Darling
O	?
O	Two
O	unfortunate
O	gentlemen
O	,
O	whom
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	had
O	overheard
O	doing
O	so
O	,
O	were
O	ignominiously
O	banished
O	from
O	the
O	court
O	and
O	capital
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	courtiers
O	became
O	alarmed
O	,
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	correct
O	their
O	habit
O	of
O	speech
O	;
O	but
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	found
O	themselves
O	in
O	constant
O	difficulties
O	,
O	had
O	not
O	one
O	clever
O	person
O	struck
O	out
O	a
O	bright
O	idea
O	.
O	He
O	said
O	that
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	indispensably
O	necessary
O	for
O	a
O	man
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	great
O	nose
O	,
O	women
O	were
O	different
O	;
O	and
O	that
O	a
O	learned
O	man
O	had
O	discovered
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	old
O	manuscript
O	that
O	the
O	celebrated
O	Cleopatra
O	,
O	Queen
O	of
O	Egypt
O	,
O	the
O	beauty
O	of
O	the
O	ancient
O	world
O	,
O	had
O	a
O	turned-up
O	nose
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	information
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	was
O	so
O	delighted
O	that
O	he
O	made
O	the
O	courtier
O	a
O	very
O	handsome
O	present
O	,
O	and
O	immediately
O	sent
O	off
O	ambassadors
O	to
O	demand
C	princess
C	Darling
O	in
O	marriage
O	.
O	She
O	accepted
O	his
O	offer
O	at
O	once
O	,
O	and
O	returned
O	with
O	the
O	ambassadors
O	.
O	He
O	made
O	all
O	haste
O	to
O	meet
O	and
O	welcome
O	her
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	only
O	three
O	leagues
O	distant
O	from
O	his
O	capital
O	,
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	time
O	even
O	to
O	kiss
O	her
O	hand
O	,
O	the

O	the

O	carried
O	her
O	off
O	before

O	.
C	Prince
C	Wish

O	him
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	his
O	throne
O	and

O	till
O	he

O	.
O	He
O	would
O	suffer
O	none
O	of
O	his
O	courtiers
O	or
O	attendants
O	to
O	follow
O	him
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	bidding
O	them
O	all
O	adieu
O	,
O	mounted
O	a

O	,
O	and
O	let
O	him
O	take
O	him
O	wherever
O	he
O	would
O	.
O	The
O	horse
O	entered
O	a
O	wide-extended
O	plain
O	,
O	and
O	trotted
O	on
O	steadily
O	the

O	without

O	Master

O	approved

O	being
O	a
C	fairy
O	of
O	great
O	common
O	sense
O	and
O	foresight
O	,

O	awakening
O	after
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	in
O	this
O	ancient
O	castle

O	might

C	prince
O	by

O	to

O	.
O	Accordingly
O	,
O	without
O	asking
O	any
O	one
O	'
O	s
O	leave
O	,
O	she
O	touched
O	with
O	her
O	magic
O	wand
O	the
O	entire
O	population
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	--

O	kind
O	consideration
O	for
O	the
O	feelings
O	of

O	even

O	little
O	fat
O	lap-dog
O	,
C	Puffy
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	laid

O	splendid
O	bed
O	.
O	He
O	,
O	like
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	,
O	fell
O	fast
O	asleep
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	.
O	The
O	very
O	spits
O	that
O	were
O	before
O	the
O	kitchen-fire
O	ceased
O	turning
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	fire
O	itself
O	went
O	out
O	,
O	and
O	everything
O	became
O	as
O	silent
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	,
O	or
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	palace
O	were
O	a
O	palace
O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	.
O	The
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	kissed
O	their
O	daughter
O	and
O	wept
O	over
O	her
O	a
O	little
O	,
O	but
O	not
O	much
O	,
O	she
O	looked
O	so
O	sweet
O	and
O	content
O	--
O	departed
O	from
O	the
O	castle
O	,
O	giving
O	orders
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	approached
O	no
O	more
O	.
O	The
O	command
O	was
O	unnecessary
O	;
O	for
O	in
O	one
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	there
O	sprung
O	up
O	around
O	it
O	a
O	wood
O	so
O	thick
O	and
O	thorny
O	that
O	neither
O	beasts
O	nor
O	men
O	could
O	attempt
O	to
O	penetrate
O	there
O	.
O	Above
O	this
O	dense
O	mass
O	of
O	forest
O	could
O	only
O	be
O	perceived
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	high
O	tower
O	where
O	the
O	lovely
C	princess
O	slept
O	.
O	A
O	great
O	many
O	changes
O	happen
O	in
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	.
O	The
C	king
O	,
O	who
O	never
O	had
O	a
O	second
O	child
O	,
O	died
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	throne
O	passed
O	into
O	another
O	royal
O	family
O	.
O	So
O	entirely
O	was
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	the
O	poor
C	princess
O	forgotten
O	,
O	that
O	when
O	the
O	reigning
C	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	being
O	one
O	day
O	out
O	hunting
O	and
O	stopped
O	in
O	the
O	chase
O	by
O	this
O	formidable
O	wood
O	,
O	inquired
O	what
O	wood
O	it
O	was
O	and
O	what
O	were
O	those
O	towers
O	which
O	he
O	saw
O	appearing
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	could
O	answer
O	him
O	.
O	At
O	length
O	an
O	old
O	peasant
O	was
O	found
O	who
O	remembered
O	having
O	heard
O	his
O	grandfather
O	say
O	to
O	his
O	father
O	,
O	that
O	in
O	this
O	tower
O	was
O	a
C	princess
O	,
O	beautiful
O	as
O	the
O	day
O	,
O	who
O	was
O	doomed
O	to
O	sleep
O	there
O	for
O	one
O	hundred
O	years
O	,
O	until
O	awakened
O	by
O	a
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	son
O	,
O	her
O	destined
O	bridegroom
O	.
O	At
O	this
O	,
O	the
O	young
C	prince
O	,
O	who
O	had
O	the
O	spirit
O	of
O	a
O	hero
O	,
O	determined
O	to
O	find
O	out
O	the
O	truth
O	for
O	himself
O	.
O	Spurred
O	on
O	by
O	both
O	generosity
O	and
O	curiosity
O	,
O	he
O	leaped
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	force
O	his
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	thick
O	wood
O	.
O	To
O	his
O	amazement
O	the
O	stiff
O	branches
O	all
O	gave
O	way
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	ugly
O	thorns
O	sheathed
O	themselves
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	accord
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	brambles
O	buried
O	themselves
O	in
O	the
O	earth
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	pass
O	.
O	This
O	done
O	,
O	they
O	closed
O	behind
O	him
O	,
O	allowing
O	none
O	of
O	his
O	suite
O	to
O	follow:
O	but
O	,
O	ardent
O	and
O	young
O	,
O	he
O	went
O	boldly
O	on
O	alone
O	.
O	The
O	first
O	thing
O	he
O	saw
O	was
O	enough
O	to
O	smite
O	him
O	with
O	fear
O	.
O	Bodies
O	of
O	men
O	and
O	horses
O	lay
O	extended
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	men
O	had
O	faces
O	,
O	not
O	death-white
O	,
O	but
O	red
O	as
O	peonies
O	,
O	and
O	beside
O	them
O	were
O	glasses
O	half
O	filled
O	with
O	wine
O	,
O	showing
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	sleep
O	drinking
O	.
O	Next
O	he
O	entered
O	a
O	large
O	court
O	,
O	paved
O	with
O	marble
O	,
O	where
O	stood
O	rows
O	of
O	guards
O	presenting
O	arms
O	,
O	but
O	motionless
O	as
O	if
O	cut
O	out
O	of
O	stone
O	;
O	then
O	he
O	passed
O	through
O	many
O	chambers
O	where
O	gentlemen
O	and
O	ladies
O	,
O	all
O	in
O	the
O	costume
O	of
O	the
O	past
O	century
O	,
O	slept
O	at
O	their
O	ease
O	,
O	some
O	standing
O	,
O	some
O	sitting
O	.
O	The
O	pages
O	were
O	lurking
O	in
O	corners
O	,
O	the
O	ladies
O	of
O	honour
O	were
O	stooping
O	over
O	their
O	embroidery
O	frames
O	,
O	or
O	listening
O	apparently
O	with
O	polite
O	attention
O	to
O	the
O	gentlemen
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	,
O	but
O	all

O	A

O	Seeing
O	that
O	their
O	father
O	had
O	touched
O	but
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	purses
O	,

O	easily

O	,
O	and
O	rising
O	with

O	The
O	two
O	rocs
O	approached
O	with
O	a
O	frightful
O	noise
O	,
O	which
O	they
O	redoubled
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	egg
O	broken
O	and
O	their
O	young
O	one
O	gone
O	.
O	They
O	flew
O	back
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	,
O	and
O	disappeared
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	,
O	while
O	we
O	made
O	all
O	the
O	sail
O	we
O	could
O	to
O	endeavor
O	to
O	prevent
O	that
O	which
O	unhappily
O	befell
O	us
O	.
O	They
O	soon
O	returned
O	,
O	and
O	we
O	observed
O	that
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	carried
O	between
O	its
O	talons
O	an
O	enormous
O	rock
O	.
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	directly
O	over
O	my
O	ship
O	,
O	they
O	hovered
O	,
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	let
O	go
O	his
O	rock
O	;
O	but
O	by
O	the
O	dexterity
O	of
O	the
O	steersman
O	it
O	missed
O	us
O	,
O	and
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	so
O	exactly
O	hit
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	as
O	to
O	split
O	it
O	into
O	pieces
O	.
O	The
O	mariners
O	and
O	passengers
O	were
O	all
O	crushed
O	to
O	death
O	,
O	or
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	.
O	I
O	myself
O	was
O	of
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	the
O	latter
O	;
O	but
O	,
O	as
O	I
O	came
O	up
O	again
O	,
O	I
O	fortunately
O	caught
O	hold
O	of
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	the
O	wreck
O	,
O	and
O	swimming
O	,
O	sometimes
O	with
O	one
O	hand
O	and
O	sometimes
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	but
O	always
O	holding
O	fast
O	the
O	plank
O	,
O	the
O	wind
O	and
O	the
O	tide
O	favoring
O	me
O	,
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	an
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	got
O	safely
O	ashore
O	.
O	I
O	sat
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	grass
O	,
O	to
O	recover
O	myself
O	from
O	my
O	fatigue
O	,
O	after
O	which
O	I
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	island
O	to
O	explore
O	it
O	.
O	It
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	delicious
O	garden
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	trees
O	everywhere
O	,
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	bearing
O	green
O	and
O	others
O	ripe
O	fruits
O	,
O	and
O	streams
O	of
O	fresh
O	pure
O	water
O	.
O	I
O	ate
O	of
O	the
O	fruits
O	,
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	excellent
O	;
O	and
O	drank
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	very
O	light
O	and
O	good
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	advanced
O	into
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	I
O	saw
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	appeared
O	very
O	weak
O	and
O	infirm
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	sitting
O	on
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	a
O	stream
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	first
O	I
O	took
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	one
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	shipwrecked
O	like
O	myself
O	.
O	I
O	went
O	toward
O	him
O	and
O	saluted
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	only
O	slightly
O	bowed
O	his
O	head
O	.
O	I
O	asked
O	him
O	why
O	he
O	sat
O	so
O	still
O	;
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	answering
O	me
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	upon
O	my
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	carry
O	him
O	over
O	the
O	brook
O	.
O	I
O	believed
O	him
O	really
O	to
O	stand
O	in
O	need
O	of
O	my
O	assistance
O	,
O	took
O	him
O	upon
O	my
O	back
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	carried
O	him
O	over
O	,
O	bade
O	him
O	get
O	down
O	,
O	and
O	for
O	that
O	end
O	stooped
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	get
O	off
O	with
O	ease
O	;
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	doing
O	so
O	(
O	which
O	I
O	laugh
O	at
O	every
O	time
O	I
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	)
O	,
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	to
O	me
O	appeared
O	quite
O	decrepit
O	,
O	threw
O	his
O	legs
O	nimbly
O	about
O	my
O	neck
O	.
O	He
O	sat
O	astride
O	upon
O	my
O	shoulders
O	,
O	and
O	held
O	my
O	throat
O	so
O	tight
O	that
O	I
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	strangled
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	I
O	fainted
O	away
O	.
O	Notwithstanding
O	my
O	fainting
O	,
O	the
O	ill-natured
O	old
O	fellow
O	still
O	kept
O	his
O	seat
O	upon
O	my
O	neck
O	.
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	recovered
O	my
O	breath
O	,
O	he
O	thrust
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	feet
O	against
O	my
O	side
O	,
O	and
O	struck
O	me
O	so
O	rudely
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	that
O	he
O	forced
O	me
O	to
O	rise
O	up
O	against
O	my
O	will
O	.
O	Having
O	arisen
O	,
O	he
O	made
O	me
O	carry
O	him
O	under
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	and
O	forced
O	me
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	stop
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	gather
O	and
O	eat
O	fruit
O	.
O	He
O	never
O	left
O	his
O	seat
O	all
O	day
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	rest
O	at
O	night
O	,
O	he
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	with
O	me
O	,
O	holding
O	still
O	fast
O	about
O	my
O	neck
O	.
O	Every
O	morning
O	he
O	pinched
O	me
O	to
O	make
O	me
O	awake
O	,
O	and
O	afterward
O	obliged
O	me
O	to
O	get
O	up
O	and
O	walk
O	,
O	and
O	spurred
O	me
O	with
O	his
O	feet
O	.
O	One
O	day
O	I
O	found
O	several
O	dry
O	calabashes
O	that
O	had
O	fallen
O	from
O	a
O	tree
O	.
O	I
O	took
O	a
O	large
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	after
O	cleaning
O	it
O	,
O	pressed
O	into
O	it
O	some
O	juice
O	of
O	grapes
O	,
O	which
O	abounded
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	;
O	having
O	filled
O	the
O	calabash
O	,
O	I
O	put
O	it
O	by
O	in
O	a
O	convenient
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	going
O	thither
O	again
O	some
O	days
O	after
O	,
O	I
O	tasted
O	it
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	wine
O	so
O	good
O	that
O	it
O	gave
O	me
O	new
O	vigor
O	,
O	and
O	so
O	exhilarated
O	my
O	spirits
O	that
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	and
O	dance
O	as
O	I
O	carried
O	my
O	burden
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	man
O	,
O	perceiving
O	the
O	effect
O	which
O	this
O	had
O	upon
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	carried
O	him
O	with
O	more
O	ease
O	than
O	before
O	,
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	sign
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	some
O	of
O	it
O	.
O	I
O	handed
O	him
O	the
O	calabash
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	liquor
O	pleasing
O	his
O	palate
O	,
O	he
O	drank
O	it
O	off
O	.
O	There
O	being
O	a
O	considerable
O	quantity
O	of
O	it
O	,
O	he
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	,
O	and
O	to
O	move
O	about
O	from
O	side
O	to
O	side
O	in
O	his
O	seat
O	upon
O	my
O	shoulders

O	and
O	by
O	degrees
O	to
O	loosen
O	his
O	legs
O	from
O	about
O	me
O	.
O	Finding
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	press
O	me
O	as
O	before
O	,
O	I
O	threw
O	him
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	without
O	motion
O	;
O	I
O	then
O	took
O	up
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	and
O	slew

O	thus
O	freed

O	had
O	just
O	risen
O	,
O	and
O	,
O	hoisting
O	his
O	sails
O	,
O	pursued
O	his
O	voyage
O	.
O	Thus
O	was
O	I
O	exposed
O	to
O	the
O	mercy
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	that
O	day
O	and
O	the
O	following
O	night
O	.
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	I
O	found
O	my
O	strength
O	gone
O	,
O	and
O	despaired
O	of
O	saving
O	my
O	life
O	,
O	when
O	happily
O	a
O	wave
O	threw
O	me
O	on
O	an
O	island
O	.
O	The
O	bank
O	was
O	high
O	and
O	rugged
O	,
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	scarcely
O	have
O	got
O	up
O	had
O	it
O	not
O	been
O	for
O	some
O	roots
O	of
O	trees
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	within
O	reach
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	sun
O	arose
O	I
O	was
O	very
O	feeble
O	.
O	I
O	found
O	some
O	herbs
O	fit
O	to
O	eat
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	luck
O	to
O	discover
O	a
O	spring
O	of
O	excellent
O	water
O	.
O	After
O	this
O	I
O	advanced
O	further
O	into
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	reached
O	a
O	fine
O	plain
O	,
O	where
O	I
O	perceived
O	some
O	horses
O	feeding
O	.
O	On
O	my
O	way
O	toward
O	them
O	I
O	heard
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	asked
O	me
O	who
O	I
O	was
O	.
O	I
O	related
O	to
O	him
O	my
O	adventure
O	,
O	after
O	which
O	,
O	taking
O	me
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	,
O	he
O	led
O	me
O	into
O	a
O	cave
O	,
O	where
O	there
O	were
O	several
O	other
O	people
O	,
O	no
O	less
O	amazed
O	to
O	see
O	me
O	than
O	I
O	was
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	.
O	I
O	partook
O	of
O	some
O	provisions
O	which
O	they
O	offered
O	me
O	,
O	and
O	asked
O	them
O	what
O	they
O	did
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	desert
O	place
O	;
O	to
O	which
O	they
O	answered
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	grooms
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
O	sovereign
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	every
O	year
O	they
O	brought
O	thither
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	horses
O	for
O	pasturage
O	.
O	They
O	were
O	to
O	return
O	home
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	,
O	and
O	had
O	I
O	been
O	one
O	day
O	later
O	I
O	must
O	have
O	perished
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	inhabited
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	distance
O	off
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	impossible
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	have
O	reached
O	it
O	without
O	a
O	guide
O	.
O	Next
O	morning
O	they
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	capital
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	,
O	took
O	me
O	with
O	them
O	,
O	and
O	presented
O	me
O	to
O	their
C	king
O	.
O	He
O	asked
O	me
O	who
O	I
O	was
O	,
O	and
O	by
O	what
O	adventure
O	I
O	had
O	come
O	into
O	his
O	dominions
O	.
O	After
O	I
O	had
O	satisfied
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	ordered
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	want
O	for
O	nothing
O	.
O	Being
O	a
O	merchant
O	,
O	I
O	frequented
O	men
O	of
O	my
O	own
O	profession
O	,
O	and
O	particularly
O	inquired
O	for
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	strangers
O	,
O	that
O	perchance
O	I
O	might
O	hear
O	news
O	from
O	Bagdad
O	,
O	or
O	find
O	an
O	opportunity
O	to
O	return
O	.
O	For
O	the
O	Maharaja
O	'
O	s
O	capital
O	is
O	situated
O	on
O	the
O	sea-coast
O	,
O	and
O	has
O	a
O	fine
O	harbor
O	,
O	where
O	ships
O	arrive
O	daily
O	from
O	the
O	different
O	quarters
O	of
O	the

O	.
O	I
O	frequented
O	also
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	learned
O	Indians
O	,
O	and
O	took
O	delight
O	to

O	converse
O	;
O	but
O	withal
O	,
O	I
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	make
O	my
O	court
O	regularly
O	to
O	the
O	Maharaja
O	,
O	and
O	conversed
O	with
O	the
O	governors
O	and
O	petty
O	kings
O	,
O	his
O	tributaries
O	,
O	that
O	were
O	about
O	him
O	.
O	They
O	put
O	a
O	thousand
O	questions
O	respecting
O	my
O	country
O	;
O	and
O	I
O	,
O	being
O	willing
O	to
O	inform
O	myself
O	as
O	to
O	their
O	laws
O	and
O	customs
O	,
O	asked
O	them
O	concerning
O	everything
O	which
O	I
O	thought
O	worth
O	knowing
O	.
O	There
O	belongs
O	to
O	this
C	king
O	an
O	island
O	named
O	Cassel
O	.
O	They
O	assured
O	me
O	that
O	every
O	night
O	a
O	noise
O	of
O	drums
O	was
O	heard
O	there
O	,
O	whence
O	the
O	mariners
O	fancied
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	residence
O	of
O	Degial
O	.
O	I
O	determined
O	to
O	visit
O	this
O	wonderful
O	place
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	my
O	way
O	thither
O	saw
O	fishes

O	will
O	fly
O	upon
O	the
O	rattling

O	of

O	;
O	and
O	so

O	they
O	in
O	these
O	undertakings
O	that
O	,
O	on
O	a
O	pinch
O	,
O	respectable
O	people
O	'
O	s
O	slippers
O	would
O	have
O	served
O	for
O	panniers
O	.
O	Stumpinghame
O	had
O	a
C	king
O	of
O	its
O	own
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	name
O	was
O	Stiffstep
O	;
O	his
O	family
O	was
O	very
O	ancient
O	and
O	large-footed
O	.
O	His
O	subjects
O	called
O	him
O	Lord
O	of
O	the
O	World
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	speech
O	to
O	them
O	every
O	year
O	concerning
O	the
O	grandeur
O	of
O	his
O	mighty
O	empire
O	.
O	His
C	queen
O	,
C	Hammerheel
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	greatest
O	beauty
O	in
O	Stumpinghame
O	.
O	Her
O	majesty
O	'
O	s
O	shoe
O	was
O	not
O	much
O	less
O	than
O	a
O	fishing-boat
O	;
O	their
O	six
O	children
O	promised
O	to
O	be
O	quite
O	as
O	handsome
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	went
O	well
O	till
O	the
O	birth
O	of
O	their
O	seventh
O	son
O	.
O	For
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	nobody
O	about
O	the
O	palace
O	could
O	understand
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	matter--the
O	ladies-in-waiting
O	looked
O	so
O	astonished
O	,
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	so
O	vexed
O	;
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	it
O	was
O	whispered
O	through
O	the
O	city
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	'
O	s
O	seventh
O	child
O	had
O	been
O	born
O	with
O	such
O	miserably
O	small
O	feet
O	that
O	they
O	resembled
O	nothing
O	ever
O	seen
O	or
O	heard
O	of
O	in
O	Stumpinghame
O	,
O	except
O	the
O	feet
O	of
O	the
O	fairies
O	.
O	The
O	chronicles
O	furnished
O	no
O	example
O	of
O	such
O	an
O	affliction
O	ever
O	before
O	happening
O	in
O	the
O	royal
O	family
O	.
O	The
O	common
O	people
O	thought
O	it
O	portended
O	some
O	great
O	calamity
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	;
O	the
O	learned
O	men
O	began
O	to
O	write
O	books
O	about
O	it
O	;
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	relations
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	assembled
O	at
O	the
O	palace
O	to
O	mourn
O	with
O	them
O	over
O	their
O	singular
O	misfortune
O	.
O	The
O	whole
O	court
O	and
O	most
O	of
O	the
O	citizens
O	helped
O	in
O	this
O	mourning
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	it
O	had
O	lasted
O	seven
O	days
O	they
O	all
O	found
O	out
O	it
O	was
O	of
O	no
O	use
O	.
O	So
O	the
O	relations
O	went
O	to
O	their
O	homes
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	took
O	to
O	their
O	work
O	.
O	If
O	the
O	learned
O	men
O	'
O	s
O	books
O	were
O	written
O	,
O	nobody
O	ever
O	read
O	them
O	;
O	and
O	to
O	cheer
O	up
O	the
O	queen
O	'
O	s
O	spirits
O	,
O	the
O	young
O	prince
O	was
O	sent
O	privately
O	out
O	to
O	the
O	pasture
O	lands
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	nursed
O	among
O	the
O	shepherds
O	.
O	The
O	chief
O	man
O	there
O	was
O	called
C	Fleecefold
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	'
O	s
O	name
O	was
C	Rough
C	Ruddy
O	.
O	They
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	snug
O	cottage
O	with
O	their
O	son
C	Blackthorn
O	and
O	their
O	daughter
C	Brownberry
O	,
O	and
O	were
O	thought
O	great
O	people
O	,
O	because
O	they
O	kept
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	sheep
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
C	Fleecefold
O	'
O	s
O	family
O	were
O	known
O	to
O	be
O	ancient
O	;
O	and
C	Rough
C	Ruddy
O	boasted
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	the
O	largest
O	feet
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	pastures
O	.
O	The
O	shepherds
O	held
O	them
O	in
O	high
O	respect
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	grew
O	still
O	higher
O	when
O	the
O	news
O	spread
O	that
O	the
C	king
C	'
C	s
C	seventh
C	son
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	to
O	their
O	cottage
O	.
O	People
O	came
O	from
O	all
O	quarters
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	young
O	prince
O	,
O	and
O	great
O	were
O	the
O	lamentations
O	over
O	his
O	misfortune
O	in
O	having
O	such
O	small
O	feet
O	.
O	The
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	fourteen
O	names
O	,
O	beginning
O	with
O	Augustus--such
O	being
O	the
O	fashion
O	in
O	that
O	royal
O	family
O	;
O	but
O	the
O	honest
O	country
O	people
O	could
O	not
O	remember
O	so
O	many
O	;
O	besides
O	,
O	his
O	feet
O	were
O	the
O	most
O	remarkable
O	thing
O	about
O	the
O	child
O	,
O	so
O	with
O	one
O	accord
O	they
O	called
O	him
C	Fairyfoot
O	.
O	At
O	first
O	it
O	was
O	feared
O	this
O	might
O	be
O	high
O	treason
O	,
O	but
O	when
O	no
O	notice
O	was
O	taken
O	by
O	the
C	king
O	or
O	his
O	ministers
O	,
O	the
O	shepherds
O	concluded
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	harm
O	,
O	and
O	the
C	boy
O	never
O	had
O	another
O	name
O	throughout
O	the
O	pastures
O	.
O	At
O	court
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	thought
O	polite
O	to
O	speak
O	of
O	him
O	at
O	all
O	.
O	They
O	did
O	not
O	keep
O	his
O	birthday
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	never
O	sent
O	for
O	at
O	Christmas
O	,
O	because
O	the
C	queen
O	and
O	her
O	ladies
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	the
O	sight
O	.
O	Once
O	a
O	year
O	the
O	undermost
O	scullion
O	was
O	sent
O	to
O	see
O	how
O	he
O	did
O	,
O	with
O	a
O	bundle
O	of
O	his
O	next
O	brother
O	'
O	s
O	cast-off
O	clothes
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	the
C	king
O	grew
O	old
O	and
O	cross
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	said
O	he
O	had
O	thoughts
O	of
O	disowning
O	him
O	.
O	So
C	Fairyfoot
O	grew
O	in
C	Fleecefold
O	'
O	s
O	cottage
O	.
O	Perhaps
O	the
O	country
O	air
O	made
O	him
O	fair
O	and
O	rosy--for
O	all
O	agreed
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	handsome
C	boy
O	but
O	for
O	his
O	small
O	feet
O	,
O	with
O	which
O	nevertheless
O	he
O	learned
O	to
O	walk
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	time
O	to
O	run
O	and
O	to
O	jump
O	,
O	thereby
O	amazing
O	everybody
O	,
O	for
O	such
O	doings
O	were
O	not
O	known
O	among
O	the
O	children
O	of
O	Stumpinghame
O	.
O	The
O	news
O	of
O	court
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	travelled
O	to
O	the
O	shepherds
O	,
O	and
C	Fairyfoot
O	was
O	despised
O	among
O	them
O	.
O	The
O	old
O	people
O	thought
O	him
O	unlucky
O	;
O	the
O	children
O	refused
O	to
O	play
O	with
O	him
O	.
C	Fleecefold
O	was
O	ashamed
O	to
O	have
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	cottage
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	durst
O	not
O	disobey
O	the
O	king
O	'
O	s
O	orders
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
C	Blackthorn
O	wore
O	most
O	of
O	the
O	clothes
O	brought
O	by
O	the
O	scullion
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	,
C	Rough
C	Ruddy
O	found
O	out
O	that
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	such
O	horrid
O	jumping
O	would
O	make
O	her
O	children
O	vulgar
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	old
O	enough
O	,
O	she
O	sent
C	Fairyfoot
O	every
O	day
O	to
O	watch
O	some
O	sickly
O	sheep

O	a
O	wild

O	weedy
O	pasture
O	,
O	hard
O	by
O	the
O	forest

O	Poor
C	Fairyfoot
O	was
O	often
O	lonely
O	and
O	sorrowful
O	;
O	many
O	a
O	time
O	he
O	wished
O	his

O	that

O	them
O	so
O	much
O	;
O	and
O	all
O	the

O	he
O	had
O	was
O	running
O	and
O	jumping
O	by
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	wild
O	pasture
O	,
O	and
O	thinking

O	set
O	in

O	hanging
O	to

O	;

O	,
O	to

O	young
O	man
O	,
O	who
O	exactly
O	resembled

O	He
O	thought
O	there
O	was
O	something
O	most
O	extraordinary
O	in
O	all
O	this
O	:
O	yet
O	,
O	as

O	,
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	venture
O	to
O	ask
O	any
O	questions
O	.
O	He
O	conversed
O	with
O	her
O	on

O	subjects
O	,
O	and
O	found
O	her
O	extremely
O	well
O	versed
O	in
O	everything
O	that
O	was
O	passing
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	.
O	When
O	night
O	was
O	far
O	advanced
O	,
O	his
O	hostess
O	wished
O	him
O	a
O	good

O	,
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	conducted
O	by
O	the
O	hands
O	to
O	his
O	bedchamber
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	different
O	still
O	from
O	anything
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	,
O	being
O	hung
O	with
O	the
O	wings
O	of
O	butterflies
O	mixed
O	with
O	the
O	most
O	curious
O	feathers
O	.
O	His
O	bed
O	was
O	of
O	gauze
O	,
O	festooned
O	with
O	bunches
O	of
O	the
O	gayest
O	ribands
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	looking-glasses
O	reached
O	from
O	the
O	floor
O	to
O	the
O	ceiling
O	.
O	The
C	prince
O	was
O	undressed
O	and
O	put
O	into
O	bed
O	by
O	the
O	hands
O	,
O	without
O	speaking
O	a
O	word
O	.
O	He
O	,

O	,
O	slept

O	,
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	was
O	awakened
O	by
O	a
O	confused
O	noise
O	.
O	The
O	hands
O	took
O	him
O	out
O	of
O	bed
O	,
O	and
O	put
O	on
O	him
O	a
O	handsome
O	hunting-jacket
O	.
O	He
O	looked
O	into
O	the
O	courtyard
O	,
O	and
O	perceived
O	more
O	than
O	five
O	hundred
O	cats
O	,
O	busily
O	employed
O	in
O	preparing
O	for
O	the
O	field
O	--
O	for
O	this
O	was
O	a
O	day
O	of
O	festival
O	.
O	Presently
O	the
C	white
C	cat
O	came
O	to
O	his
O	apartment
O	;
O	and
O	having
O	politely
O	inquired
O	after
O	his
O	health
O	,
O	she
O	invited
O	him
O	to
O	partake
O	of
O	their
O	amusement
O	.
O	The
C	prince
O	willingly
O	acceded
O	,
O	and
O	mounted
O	a
O	wooden
O	horse
O	,
O	richly
O	caparisoned
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	prepared
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	assured
O	would
O	gallop
O	to
O	admiration
O	.
O	The
O	beautiful
C	white
C	cat
O	mounted
O	a
O	monkey
O	;
O	she
O	wore
O	a
O	dragoon
O	'
O	s
O	cap
O	,
O	which
O	made
O	her
O	look
O	so
O	fierce
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	rats
O	and
O	mice
O	ran
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	utmost
O	terror
O	.
O	Everything
O	being
O	ready
O	,
O	the
O	horns
O	sounded
O	,
O	and
O	away
O	they
O	went
O	:
O	no
O	hunting
O	was
O	ever
O	more
O	agreeable
O	.
O	The
O	cats
O	ran
O	faster
O	than
O	the
O	hares
O	and
O	rabbits
O	;
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	caught
O	any
O	,
O	they
O	turned
O	them
O	out
O	to
O	be
O	hunted
O	in
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	the
C	white
C	cat
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	thousand
O	cunning
O	tricks
O	were
O	played
O	.
O	Nor
O	were
O	the
O	birds
O	in
O	safety
O	;
O	for
O	the
O	monkey
O	made
O	nothing
O	of
O	climbing
O	up
O	the
O	trees
O	,
O	with
O	the
C	white
C	cat

O	to
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	young
O	eagles
O	.
O	When
O	the
O	chase
O	was
O	over
O	,
O	the
O	whole
O	retinue
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	;
O	the
C	white
C	cat
O	immediately
O	exchanged
O	her
O	dragoon
O	'
O	s
O	cap
O	for
O	the
O	veil
O	,
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	supper

O	,

O	Pierceforest
O	--
O	both
O	very
O	spruce
O	and
O	well
O	educated
O	.
O	He
O	dressed
O	Briscambril
O	like
O	a
C	king
O	,
O	and
O	placed
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	coach
O	;
O	Pierceforest
O	he
O	made
O	the

O	;
O	the

O	dressed
O	like

O	which
O	he
O	put
O	into

O	,
O	coach

O	all

O	The
C	Princess
O	not
O	being
O	gone
O	to
O	bed
O	,
O	heard
O	a
O	rumbling
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	coach
O	in
O	the
O	long
O	gallery
O	;
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	,
O	her
O	ladies
O	came
O	to
O	tell
O	her
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	of
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	was
O	arrived
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	chariot
O	immediately
O	entered
O	her
O	chamber
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	monkey
O	train
O	.
O	The
O	country
O	monkeys
O	began
O	to
O	show
O	a
O	thousand
O	tricks
O	,
O	which
O	far
O	surpassed
O	those
O	of
O	Briscambril
O	and
O	Pierceforest
O	.
O	To
O	say
O	the
O	truth
O	,
C	Leander
O	conducted
O	the
O	whole
O	machine
O	.
O	He
O	drew
O	the
O	chariot
O	where
O	Briscambril
O	sat
O	arrayed
O	as
O	a
C	king
O	,
O	and
O	making
O	him
O	hold
O	a
O	box
O	of
O	diamonds
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	,
O	he
O	presented
O	it
O	with
O	a
O	becoming
O	grace
O	to
O	the
C	Princess
O	.
O	The
C	Princess
O	'
O	s
O	surprise
O	may
O	be
O	easily
O	imagined
O	.
O	Moreover
O	,
O	Briscambril
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	for
O	Pierceforest
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	dance
O	with
O	him
O	.
O	The
O	most
O	celebrated
O	dancers
O	were
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	compared
O	with
O	them
O	in
O	activity
O	.
O	But
O	the
C	Princess
O	,
O	troubled
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	guess
O	from
O	whence
O	this
O	curious
O	present
O	came
O	,
O	dismissed
O	the
O	dancers
O	sooner
O	than
O	she
O	would
O	otherwise
O	have
O	done
O	,
O	though
O	she
O	was
O	extremely
O	pleased
O	with

O	.
C	Leander
O	,
O	satisfied
O	with
O	having
O	seen
O	the
O	delight
O	the
C	Princess
O	had
O	taken
O	in
O	beholding
O	the
O	monkeys
O	,
O	thought
O	of
O	nothing
O	now
O	but
O	to
O	get
O	a
O	little
O	repose
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	greatly
O	wanted
O	.
O	He
O	stayed
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	gallery
O	;
O	afterwards
O	,
O	going
O	down
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	stairs
O	,
O	and
O	finding
O	a
O	door
O	open
O	,
O	he
O	entered
O	into
O	an
O	apartment
O	the
O	most
O	delightful
O	that
O	ever
O	was
O	seen
O	.
O	There
O	was
O	in
O	it
O	a
O	bed
O	of
O	cloth
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	enriched
O	with
O	pearls
O	,
O	intermixed
O	with
O	rubies
O	and
O	emeralds
O	;
O	for
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	there
O	appeared
O	daylight
O	sufficient
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	view
O	and
O	admire
O	the
O	magnificence
O	of
O	this
O	sumptuous
O	furniture
O	.
O	Having
O	made
O	fast
O	the
O	door
O	,
O	he
O	composed
O	himself
O	to
O	sleep
O	.
O	Next
O	day
O	he
O	rose
O	very
O	early
O	,
O	and
O	looking
O	about
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	,
O	he
O	spied
O	a

O	,
O	with

O	ready
O	prepared
O	and

O	,
O	in
O	an

O	prevail
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	retire
O	.
O	Thereupon
O	,
O	he
O	dressed
O	himself
O	like
O	an
O	Amazon
O	,
O	and
O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	,
O	to
O	catch
O	his
O	horse
O	.
O	He
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	called
O	him
O	than
O	Gris-de-line
O	came
O	leaping
O	,
O	prancing
O	,
O	and
O	neighing
O	for
O	joy
O	,
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	grown
O	quite
O	weary
O	of
O	being
O	so
O	long
O	absent
O	from
O	his
O	dear
O	master
O	;
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	beheld
O	him
O	dressed
O	as
O	a
O	woman
O	he
O	hardly
O	knew
O	him
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	his
O	voice
O	,
O	he
O	suffered
O	the
C	prince
O	to
O	mount
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	soon
O	arrived
O	in
O	the
O	camp
O	of
C	Furibon
O	,
O	where
O	they
O	gave
O	notice
O	that
O	a
O	lady
O	was
O	come
O	to
O	speak
O	with
O	him
O	from
O	the
C	Princess
O	of
O	Calm
O	Delights
O	.
O	Immediately
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	royal
O	robes
O	,
O	and
O	having
O	placed
O	himself
O	upon
O	his
O	throne
O	,
O	he
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	great
O	toad
O	counterfeiting
O	a
C	king
O	.
C	Leander
O	harangued
O	him
O	,
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	the
C	Princess
O	,
O	preferring
O	a
O	quiet
O	and
O	peaceable
O	life
O	to
O	the
O	fatigues
O	of
O	war
O	,
O	had
O	sent
O	to
O	offer
O	his
O	majesty
O	as
O	much
O	money
O	as
O	he
O	pleased
O	to
O	demand
O	,
O	provided
O	he
O	would
O	suffer
O	her
O	to
O	continue
O	in
O	peace
O	;
O	but
O	if
O	he
O	refused
O	her
O	proposal
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	omit
O	no
O	means
O	that
O	might
O	serve
O	for
O	her
O	defence
O	.
C	Furibon
O	replied
O	that
O	he
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	grant
O	her
O	the
O	honour
O	of
O	his
O	protection
O	;
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	demanded
O	a
O	hundred
O	thousand
O	thousand
O	millions
O	of
O	pounds
O	,
O	and
O	without
O	which
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	return
O	to
O	his
O	kingdom
O	.
C	Leander
O	answered
O	that
O	such
O	a
O	vast
O	sum
O	would
O	be
O	too
O	long
O	a-counting
O	,
O	and
O	therefore
O	,
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	say
O	how
O	many
O	rooms
O	full
O	he
O	desired
O	to
O	have
O	,
O	the
C	Princess
O	was
O	generous
O	and
O	rich
O	enough
O	to
O	satisfy
O	him
O	.
C	Furibon
O	was
O	astonished
O	to
O	hear
O	that
O	,
O	instead
O	of
O	entreating
O	,
O	she
O	would
O	rather
O	offer
O	more
O	;
O	and
O	it
O	came
O	into
O	his
O	wicked
O	mind
O	to
O	take
O	all
O	the
O	money
O	he
O	could
O	get
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	seize
O	the
O	Amazon
O	and
O	kill
O	her
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	never
O	return
O	to
O	her
O	mistress
O	.
O	He
O	told
C	Leander
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	thirty
O	chambers
O	of
O	gold
O	,
O	all
O	full
O	to
O	the
O	ceiling
O	.
C	Leander
O	,
O	being
O	conducted
O	into
O	the
O	chambers
O	,
O	took
O	his
O	rose
O	and
O	shook
O	it
O	,
O	till
O	every
O	room
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	coin
O	.
C	Furibon
O	was
O	in
O	an
O	ecstasy
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	more
O	gold
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	greater
O	was
O	his
O	desire
O	to
O	get
O	hold
O	of
O	the
O	Amazon
O	;
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	all
O	the
O	rooms
O	were
O	full
O	,
O	he
O	commanded
O	his
O	guards
O	to
O	seize
O	her
O	,
O	alleging
O	she
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	counterfeit
O	money
O	.
O	Immediately
C	Leander
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	little
O	red
O	cap
O	and
O	disappeared
O	.
O	The
O	guards
O	,
O	believing
O	that
O	the
O	lady
O	had
O	escaped
O	,
O	ran
O	out
O	and
O	left
C	Furibon
O	alone
O	;
O	when
C	Leander
O	,
O	availing
O	himself
O	of
O	the
O	opportunity
O	,
O	took
O	the
O	tyrant
O	by
O	the
O	hair
O	,
O	and
O	twisted
O	his
O	head
O	off
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	ease
O	he
O	would
O	a
O	pullet
O	'
O	s
O	;
O	nor
O	did
O	the
O	little
O	wretch
O	of
O	a
C	king
O	see
O	the
O	hand
O	that
O	killed
O	him
O	.
C	Leander
O	having
O	got
O	his
O	enemy
O	'
O	s
O	head
O	,
O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	Palace
O	of
O	Calm
O	Delights
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	found
O	the
C	Princess
O	walking
O	,
O	and
O	with
O	grief
O	considering
O	the
O	message
O	which
O	her
O	mother
O	had
O	sent
O	her
O	,
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	means
O	to

O	Suddenly
O	she
O	beheld
O	a

O	hanging
O	in
O	the

O	,
O	with
O	nobody
O	to

O	This

O	astonished

O	so
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	tell

O	bean-stalk
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	greatly
O	fatigued
O	when
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	top
O	,
O	and
O	very
O	hungry
O	.
O	Having
O	rested
O	some
O	time
O	on
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	stones
O	,
O	he
O	pursued
O	his
O	journey
O	to
O	the
C	giant
O	'
O	s
O	mansion
O	,
O	which
O	he
O	reached
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	:
O	the
O	woman
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	as
O	before
O	.
C	Jack
O	addressed
O	her
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	telling
O	her
O	a
O	pitiful
O	tale
O	,
O	and
O	requesting
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	some
O	victuals
O	and
O	drink
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	a
O	night
O	'
O	s
O	lodging
O	.
O	She
O	told
O	him
O	(
O	what
O	he
O	knew
O	before
O	very
O	well
O	)
O	about
O	her
O	husband
O	'
O	s
O	being
O	a
O	powerful
O	and
O	cruel
C	giant
O	,
O	and
O	also
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	one
O	night
O	admitted
O	a
O	poor
O	,
O	hungry
O	,
O	friendless
O	boy
O	;
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	ungrateful
O	fellow
O	had
O	stolen
O	one
O	of
O	the
C	giant
O	'
O	s
O	treasures
O	;
O	and
O	ever
O	since
O	that
O	her
O	husband
O	had
O	been
O	worse
O	than
O	before
O	,
O	using
O	her
O	very
O	cruelly
O	,
O	and
O	continually
O	upbraiding
O	her
O	with
O	being
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	his
O	misfortune
O	.
C	Jack
O	felt
O	sorry
O	for
O	her
O	,
O	but
O	confessed
O	nothing
O	,
O	and
O	did
O	his
O	best
O	to
O	persuade
O	her
O	to
O	admit
O	him
O	,
O	but
O	found
O	it
O	a
O	very
O	hard
O	task
O	.
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	consented
O	,
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	led
O	the
O	way
O	,
C	Jack
O	observed
O	that
O	everything
O	was
O	just
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	found
O	it
O	before
O	:
O	she
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	kitchen
O	,
O	and
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	eating
O	and
O	drinking
O	,
O	she
O	hid
O	him
O	in
O	an
O	old
O	lumber-closet
O	.
O	The
C	giant
O	returned
O	at
O	the
O	usual
O	time
O	,
O	and
O	walked
O	in
O	so
O	heavily
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	house
O	was
O	shaken
O	to
O	its
O	foundation
O	.
O	He
O	seated
O	himself
O	by
O	the
O	fire
O	,
O	and
O	soon
O	after
O	exclaimed
O	:

O	While

O	was
O	preparing

O	the
C	giant

O	snored
O	so

O	that
C	Jack

O	So
C	Jack
O	carried
O	off
O	the
O	bags
O	,
O	one
O	on
O	each
O	shoulder
O	,
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	so
O	heavy

O	it
O	took
O	him
O	two
O	whole
O	days
O	to
O	descend
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	and
O	get
O	back
O	to
O	his
C	mother
O	'
O	s
O	door
O	.
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	he
O	found
O	the

O	He
O	ran
O	from

O	to
O	another
O	,
O	without
O	being
O	able
O	to
O	find
O	any
O	one
O	;
O	he
O	then
O	hastened
O	into
O	the
O	village
O	,
O	hoping
O	to
O	see
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	neighbours
O	,
O	who
O	could
O	inform
O	him
O	where
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	his
C	mother
O	.
O	An
O	old
O	woman
O	at
O	last
O	directed
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	house
O	,
O	where
O	she
O	was
O	ill
O	of
O	a
O	fever
O	.
O	He
O	was
O	greatly
O	shocked
O	at
O	finding
O	her
O	apparently
O	dying
O	,
O	and
O	blamed
O	himself
O	bitterly
O	as
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	it
O	all
O	.
O	However
O	,
O	at
O	sight
O	of
O	her
O	dear
O	son
O	,
O	the
O	poor
O	woman
O	revived
O	,
O	and
O	slowly
O	recovered
O	health
O	.
C	Jack
O	gave
O	her
O	his
O	two
O	money-bags
O	;
O	they
O	had
O	the
O	cottage
O	rebuilt
O	and
O	well
O	furnished
O	,
O	and
O	lived
O	happier
O	than
O	they
O	had
O	ever
O	done
O	before
O	.
O	For
O	three
O	years
C	Jack
O	heard
O	no
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	,
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	forget
O	it
O	,
O	though
O	he
O	feared
O	making
O	his
C	mother
O	unhappy
O	.
O	It
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	endeavouring
O	to
O	amuse
O	himself
O	;
O	he
O	became
O	thoughtful
O	,
O	and
O	would
O	arise
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	dawn
O	of
O	day
O	,
O	and
O	sit
O	looking
O	at
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	for
O	hours
O	together
O	.
O	His
C	mother
O	saw
O	that
O	something
O	preyed
O	upon
O	his
O	mind
O	,
O	and
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	discover
O	the
O	cause
O	;
O	but
C	Jack
O	knew
O	too
O	well
O	what
O	the
O	consequence
O	would
O	be
O	should
O	she
O	succeed
O	.
O	He
O	did
O	his
O	utmost
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	to
O	conquer
O	the
O	great
O	desire
O	he
O	had
O	for
O	another
O	journey
O	up
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	.
O	Finding
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	that
O	his
O	inclination
O	grew
O	too
O	powerful
O	for
O	him
O	,
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	make
O	secret
O	preparations
O	for
O	his
O	journey
O	.
O	He
O	got
O	ready
O	a
O	new
O	disguise
O	,
O	better
O	and
O	more
O	complete
O	than
O	the

O	;
O	and
O	when
O	summer
O	came
O	,
O	on
O	the
O	longest
O	day
O	he
O	awoke
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	light
O	,
O	and
O	without
O	telling
O	his
C	mother
O	,
O	ascended
O	the
O	bean-stalk
O	.
O	He
O	found
O	the

O	,
O	much
O	as
O	it

O	arrived
O	at

C	giant

O	s
O	mansion
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	,

C	wife
O	standing
O	,
O	as
O	usual
O	,
O	at
O	the
O	door

C	Jack
O	had
O	disguised
O	himself
O	so
O	completely
O	,
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	not

O	the
O	least
O	recollection
O	of

O	down

O	and
O	late
O	in

O	was

O	A

O	,
O	the
O	carefully

O	English
O	of

O	So
C	Ray
O	telegraphed
O	his
O	acceptance
O	,
O	and
O	four
O	days

O	arrived
O	at
O	Fredericton
O	,

O	secured

O	The

O	reached
O	Two

C	Jacques
O	met

O	with
O	a
O	span
O	of

O	attached
O	to
O	a
O	queer
O	spring
O	vehicle
O	,
O	mounted
O	on

O	that

O	out
O	of
O	all
O	proportion
O	to
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the

O	.
C	Ray
O	wondered
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	a

O	of
O	Acadia
O	,
O	but
O	did
O	not

C	Jacques
O	was
O	quite

O	at

O	He
O	promised
C	Ray
O	at

O	one
O	deer
O	within
O	a
O	couple
O	of
O	days
O	,
O	and
O	another
O	within
O	a
O	week
O	.
O	The
C	Pourbiere
O	home
O	resembled
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	better
O	class
O	of
O	habitants
O	but
O	with
O	a
O	difference
O	due
O	to
O	the
O	greater
O	prosperity
O	of
O	the
O	family
O	in
O	preceding
O	generations
O	.
O	The
O	main
O	room
O	had
O	a
O	huge
O	fireplace
O	,
O	used
O	only
O	occasionally
O	,
O	for
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	air-tight
O	stove
O	connected
O	with
O	the
O	chimney
O	just
O	above
O	it
O	,
O	to
O	afford
O	greater
O	warmth
O	in
O	winter
O	.
O	The
O	other
O	rooms
O	Were
O	chiefly
O	detached
O	,
O	although
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	entry-like
O	porch
O	on
O	the
O	south
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	living-room
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	huge
O	door
O	opening
O	at
O	the
O	east
O	end
O	,
O	both
O	connecting
O	with
O	the
O	yard
O	outside
O	.
O	But
O	the
O	wood-shed
O	,
O	milk-house
O	and
O	summer
O	kitchen
O	were
O	in
O	the

O	of
O	heavy

O	The
O	homestead
O	was
O	,
O	in
O	fact
O	,
O	a
O	cluster
O	of
O	houses
O	rather

O	What
O	most
O	attracted

O	were
O	the
O	huge
O	bedsteads
O	in
O	the

O	were
O	tall

O	had
O	seen
O	elsewhere
O	,
O	but
O	with
O	the
O	difference
O	that
O	a
O	canopy
O	covered
O	them
O	.
O	Each
O	had
O	a
O	carved
O	wooden
O	frame
O	,
O	surmounting
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	posts
O	like
O	a
O	roof
O	.
O	The
O	wood
O	was
O	black
O	with
O	age
O	,
O	its
O	surface
O	being
O	covered
O	with
O	elaborate
O	foliage
O	and
O	armorial
O	devices
O	,
O	representing
O	the
O	toil
O	of
O	some
O	old
O	French
O	artisan
O	of
O	the
O	seventeenth
O	century
O	.
O	They
O	probably

O	been
O	brought
O	across
O	the
O	Atlantic
O	by
O	the
O	original
O	emigrant
O	,
O	and
O	carefully
O	preserved
O	ever
O	since
O	.
O	They
O	stood
O	in
O	diagonally
O	opposite
O	corners
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	upheld
O	the
O	hugest

O	feather
O	beds
O	,
O	with
O	gay
O	,
O	home-made
O	worsted

O	valances
O	that
O	shamed
O	the
O	hues
O	of
O	the

O	to
O	rest

O	,
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	both
O	were
O	asleep
O	.
O	Several
O	hours
O	passed
O	.
O	Had
O	either
O	young
O	man
O	been
O	awake
O	,
O	he
O	might
O	have
O	heard
O	soft
O	footfalls
O	about
O	the

O	.
O	A
O	squatty

O	heavily
O	built
O	animal
O	,
O	with
O	huge
O	feet
O	,
O	bob
O	tail
O	,
O	and
O	pointed
O	ears
O	adorned
O	with
O	tufts
O	of
O	hair
O	,
O	had
O	traced
O	the
O	slaughtered
O	deer
O	to
O	the
O	farmhouse
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	drops
O	of
O	blood
O	,
O	and
O	now
O	was
O	searching
O	eagerly
O	for
O	the
O	meat
O	.
O	He
O	sought
O	the
O	milk-room
O	again
O	and
O	again
O	,
O	and
O	even
O	sprang
O	to
O	the

O	,
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	inside
O	.
O	Then
O	he
O	came
O	back
O	and
O	sniffed
O	at
O	the
O	partly
O	open
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	living-room
O	.
O	The
O	human
O	smell
O	was
O	there
O	,
O	and
O	he
O	hesitated
O	.
O	But
O	so
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	odor
O	of
O	fresh
O	venison
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	mouth
O	watered
O	.
O	A
O	round
O	head
O	was
O	thrust
O	inside
O	the
O	door
O	.
O	The
O	moon
O	,
O	peering
O	above
O	the
O	hemlocks
O	to
O	the
O	southeastward
O	,
O	cast
O	its
O	rays
O	through
O	a
O	window
O	directly
O	upon
O	the
O	fresh
O	meat
O	.
O	The
O	temptation
O	was
O	greater
O	than
O	the
O	intruder
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	withstand
O	.
O	Inch
O	by
O	inch
O	he
O	crowded
O	past
O	the
O	swaying
O	door
O	,
O	and
O	silently
O	crept
O	toward
O	the
O	venison
O	.
O	The
O	two
O	men
O	were
O	breathing
O	very
O	loudly
O	,
O	but
O	neither
O	stirred
O	;
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	gathered
O	supreme
O	courage
O	,
O	and
O	leaped
O	upon
O	the
O	meat
O	.
O	It
O	fell
O	with
O	a
O	crash
O	against
O	the
O	stove
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	were
O	awakened
O	simultaneously
O	.
O	As
C	Jacques
O	sprang
O	from

O	now
O	it

O	.
O	He
O	felt

O	from
O	whom
O	the
O	city
O	sacred
O	to
O	Aphrodite
O	received
O	its

O	.
O	Perhaps
O	Aphrodite
O	may
O	have
O	smiled
O	sometimes
O	to
O	watch
C	Pygmalion
O	,
O	once

O	ones
O	and

O	the

O	came

O	never

O	had
O	feared
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	perished
O	.
O	In
O	their
O	honor
O	there
O	was
O	high
O	festival
O	for
O	many
O	days
O	in
O	London
O	,
O	where
C	Arthur
O	then
O	had
O	his
O	court
O	;
O	and
O	the
C	King
O	made
O	proclamation
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	tournament
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	hold
O	at
O	Camelot
O	,
O	when
O	he
O	and
O	the
C	King
O	of
O	Nortgalis
O	would
O	keep
O	the
O	lists
O	against
O	all

O	.
O	So
O	,
O	one
O	fair
O	morning
O	of
O	spring
O	,
C	King
C	Arthur
O	made
O	ready

O	and
O	all
O	his
O	knights
O	with
O	him

O	,
O	saying

O	where

O	.
O	I
O	made
O	a

O	as
O	I
O	could
O	.
O	They
O	heard

O	,
O	and
O	sent
O	a
O	boat
O	to
O	bring
O	me

O	It

O	without

O	me
O	on

O	Out

O	Now

O	was
O	a

O	When

O	was
O	very

O	the
