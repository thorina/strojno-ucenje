O	she
O	came
O	to
O	be
O	pictured
O	crowned
O	with

O	plumes
O	the

O	of

O	the
O	silence
O	of

O	where
O	the

O	a

O	wholly
O	beautiful
O	woman
O	with
O	a

O	at

O	sometimes
O	in

O	of

O	weary
O	housewife
O	for

O	it
O	is
O	very
O	easy
O	to
O	see
C	Freya
O	as
O	her
O	worshippers
O	saw
O	her
O	an
O	ideal
O	of
O	perfect
O	womanhood
O	But
O	the
O	gods
O	of
O	the
O	Norsemen
O	were
O	never
O	wholly
O	gods
O	Always
O	they
O	like
O	the
O	gods
O	of
O	Greece
O	endeared
O	themselves
O	to
O	humanity
O	by
O	possessing
O	some
O	little
O	or
O	big
O	human
O	weakness
O	And
C	Freya
O	is
O	none
O	the
O	less
O	lovable
O	to
O	the
O	descendants
O	of
O	her
O	worshippers
O	because
O	she
O	possessed
O	the
O	feminine
O	weakness
O	of
O	love
O	of
O	dress
O	Jewels
O	too
O	she
O	loved
O	and
O	knowing
O	the
O	wondrous
O	skill
O	of
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	in
O	fashioning
O	exquisite
O	ornaments
O	she
O	broke
O	off
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	gold
O	from
O	the
O	statue
O	of
C	Odin
O	her
O	husband
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	to
O	them
O	to
O	make
O	into
O	a
O	necklace
O	the
O	marvellous
O	jewelled
O	necklace
O	Brisingamen
O	that
O	in
O	time
O	to
O	come
O	was
O	possessed
O	by
O	Beowulf
O	It
O	was
O	so
O	exquisite
O	a
O	thing
O	that
O	it
O	made
O	her
O	beauty
O	twice
O	more
O	perfect
O	and
C	Odin
O	loved
O	her
O	doubly
O	much
O	because
O	of
O	it
O	But
O	when
O	he
O	discovered
O	that
O	his
O	statue
O	had
O	been
O	tampered
O	with
O	his
O	wrath
O	was
O	very
O	great
O	and
O	furiously
O	he
O	summoned
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	they
O	who
O	dealt
O	always
O	with
O	fine
O	metal
O	and
O	demanded
O	of
O	them
O	which
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	done
O	him
O	this
O	grievous
O	wrong
O	But
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	loved
C	Freya
O	and
O	from
O	them
O	he
O	got
O	no
O	answer
O	Then
O	he
O	placed
O	the
O	statue
O	above
O	the
O	temple
O	gate
O	and
O	laboured
O	with
O	guile
O	to
O	devise
O	runes
O	that
O	might
O	give
O	it
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	speech
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	might
O	shout
O	aloud
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	impious
O	robber
O	as
O	the
O	robber
O	went
O	by
C	Freya
O	no
O	longer
O	an
O	omnipotent
O	goddess
O	but
O	a
O	frightened
O	wife
O	trembled
O	before
O	his
O	wrath
O	and
O	begged
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	to
O	help
O	her
O	And
O	when
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	the
O	most
O	hideous
O	of
O	all
O	promised
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	prevent
O	the
O	statue
O	from
O	speaking
O	if
C	Freya
O	would
O	but
O	deign
O	to
O	smile
O	upon
O	him
O	the
O	queen
O	of
O	the
O	gods
O	who
O	had
O	no
O	dread
O	of
O	ugly
O	things
O	and
O	whose
O	heart
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	love
O	and
O	of
O	pity
O	smiled
O	her
O	gentle
O	smile
O	on
O	the
O	piteous
O	little
O	creature
O	who
O	had
O	never
O	known
O	looks
O	of
O	anything
O	but
O	horror
O	and
O	disgust
O	from
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	deathless
O	gods
O	It
O	was
O	for
O	him
O	a
O	wondrous
O	moment
O	and
O	the
O	payment
O	was
O	worth
O	Death
O	itself
O	That
O	night
O	a
O	deep
O	sleep
O	fell
O	on
O	the
O	guards
O	of
C	Odin
O	s
O	statue
O	and
O	while
O	they
O	slept
O	the
O	statue
O	was
O	pulled
O	down
O	from
O	its
O	pedestal
O	and
O	smashed
O	into
O	pieces
O	The
O	dwarf
O	had
O	fulfilled
O	his
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	bargain
O	When
C	Odin
O	next
O	morning
O	discovered
O	the
O	sacrilege
O	great
O	was
O	his
O	anger
O	and
O	when
O	no
O	inquiry
O	could
O	find
O	for
O	him
O	the
O	criminal
O	he
O	quitted
O	Asgard
O	in
O	furious
O	wrath
O	For
O	seven
O	months
O	he
O	stayed
O	away
O	and
O	in
O	that
O	time
O	the
O	Ice
O	Giants
O	invaded
O	his
O	realm
O	and
O	all
O	the

O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	a
O	pall
O	of
O	snow
O	viciously

O	by
O	black

O	chilled
O	by

O	But
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	seven
O	dreary
O	months
C	Odin
O	returned
O	and
O	with

O	came
O	the
O	blessings
O	of
O	light
O	and
O	of
O	sunshine
O	and
O	the
O	Ice
O	Giants
O	in

O	fled
O	away
O	Well

O	for

O	to
O	gain

O	Ah
O	said
O	the
C	fairy
O	this
C	butterfly
O	is
O	not
O	what
O	you
O	imagine
O	It
O	is
O	a

O	which
O	generally
O	leads

O	I

O	news
O	and
O	the

O	Accordingly
O	the

O	She

O	The

O	widow
O	and
O	insisted

O	respected

O	ordered
O	twenty

O	of

O	we

O	Sire
O	replied
O	the

O	calm
O	your

O	Our

O	in
O	all

O	let

O	but
O	those
O	truly
O	worthy
O	of
O	her
O	affections
O	Such
O	is
O	my
O	wish
O	replied
O	the
C	king
O	and
O	I
O	begin
O	to
O	turn
O	my
O	views
O	upon
C	Prince
C	Patipata
O	he
O	has
O	seen
O	the
O	portrait
O	of
C	Papillette
O	and
O	is
O	satisfied
O	but
O	though
O	a
O	wise
O	and
O	noble
O	monarch
O	his
O	personal
O	qualifications
O	are
O	little
O	in
O	his
O	favor
O	How
O	so
O	rejoined
O	the
C	queen
O	Because
O	he
O	is
O	stiff
O	tall
O	and
O	spare
O	his
O	eyes
O	bleared
O	and
O	filmy
O	his
O	hair
O	red
O	and
O	so
O	scanty
O	withal
O	that
O	it
O	seems
O	like
O	a
O	few
O	stripes
O	of
O	blasted
O	flax
O	hung
O	around
O	a
O	distaff
O	A
O	few
O	days
O	after
O	this
O	conversation
C	Prince
C	Patipata
O	arrived
O	at
O	court
O	and
O	the
C	queen
O	did
O	not
O	conceal
O	from
C	Papillette
O	that
O	notwithstanding
O	his
O	personal
O	disadvantages
O	he
O	was
O	intended
O	for
O	her
O	spouse
O	The
C	princess
O	laughed
O	immoderately
O	yet
O	just
O	for
O	amusement
O	she
O	displayed
O	towards
O	him
O	all
O	the
O	arts
O	and
O	graces
O	of
O	coquetry
O	to
O	perfection
C	Prince
C	Patipata
O	having
O	been
O	informed
O	of
O	the
O	deplorable
O	end
O	of
O	his
O	predecessors
O	concealed
O	his
O	love
O	as
O	carefully
O	as
O	the
O	others
O	had
O	proclaimed
O	theirs
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	reserved
O	and
O	cold
O	that
O	the
C	princess
O	longed
O	exceedingly
O	to
O	discover
O	the
O	state
O	of
O	his
O	feelings
O	Accordingly
O	one
O	day
O	while
C	Patipata
O	was
O	walking
O	with
C	Salmoé
O	his
O	intimate
O	confidant
O	she
O	hid
O	herself
O	in
O	the
O	trunk
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	tree
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	hollowed
O	out
O	by
O	lightning
O	and
O	afforded
O	apparently
O	a
O	secure
O	retreat
O	The
C	prince
O	seated
O	himself
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	it
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	observed
O	the
C	princess
O	and
O	making
O	a
O	sign
O	of
O	intelligence
O	to
O	his
O	companion
O	feigned
O	to
O	continue
O	a
O	conversation
O	of
O	which
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	subject
O	Assuredly
O	said
O	he
O	the
C	princess
O	is
O	very
O	handsome
O	but
O	flatterers
O	poets
O	and
O	painters
O	always
O	overstep
O	the
O	truth
O	Her
O	portrait
O	has
O	deceived
O	me
O	its
O	large
O	blue
O	eyes
O	bear
O	assuredly
O	some
O	resemblance
O	to
O	those
O	of
C	Papillette
O	but
O	they
O	bespeak
O	an
O	ardent
O	and
O	feeling
O	heart
O	while
O	hers
O	is
O	frivolous
O	volatile
O	and
O	incapable
O	of
O	love
O	Her
O	smile
O	would
O	be
O	charming
O	but
O	for
O	its
O	satirical
O	irony
O	And
O	what
O	is
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	the
O	loveliest
O	lips
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	if
O	they
O	open
O	but
O	to
O	deceive
O	and
O	betray
O	I
O	am
O	much
O	surprised
O	replied
C	Salmoé
O	I
O	believed
O	that
O	your
O	royal
O	highness
O	was
O	equally
O	loving
O	and
O	beloved
O	Far
O	from
O	it
O	returned
C	Patipata
O	it
O	would
O	ill
O	become
O	me
O	plain
O	as
O	I
O	am
O	to
O	be
O	confident
O	of
O	pleasing
O	and
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	dupe
O	enough
O	to
O	yield
O	my
O	heart
O	without
O	return
O	Do
O	not
O	you
O	approve
O	of
O	this
O	No
O	answered
C	Salmoé
O	your
O	royal
O	highness
O	is
O	too
O	modest
O	I
O	cannot
O	sufficiently
O	appreciate
O	your
O	humility
O	The
C	prince
O	affected
O	to
O	be
O	dissatisfied
O	with
O	this
O	praise
O	and
O	then
O	moved
O	onwards
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	liberate
C	Papillette
O	who
O	was
O	very
O	inconveniently
O	cramped
O	and
O	almost
O	suffocated
O	with
O	anger
O	Disagreeable
O	truths
O	seldom
O	reach
O	the
O	ear
O	of
O	princesses
O	her
O	resentment
O	therefore
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	expected
O	Meanwhile
O	her
O	heart
O	being
O	equally
O	capricious
O	as
O	her
O	understanding
O	she
O	felt
O	ready
O	to
O	pardon
O	and
O	even
O	on
O	reflection
O	to
O	justify
C	Patipata
O	But
O	pride
O	soon
O	combated
O	this
O	weakness
O	and
O	she
O	determined
O	to
O	send
O	him
O	away
O	She
O	complained
O	to
O	her
O	father
O	assured
O	him
O	that
O	by
O	mere
O	chance
O	she
O	had
O	heard
O	the
O	most
O	odious
O	calumnies
O	uttered
O	by
O	a
C	prince
O	who
O	sported
O	with
O	their
O	dignity
O	by
O	falsely
O	pretending
O	to
O	the
O	hand
O	of
O	her
O	whom
O	he
O	slighted
O	and
O	despised
O	The
C	king
O	was
O	surprised
O	but
O	not
O	having
O	entered
O	into
O	any
O	positive
O	engagements
O	with
C	Patipata
O	he
O	readily
O	entered
O	into
O	her
O	feelings
O	and
O	intimated
O	to
O	the
C	prince
O	that
O	his
O	adieus
O	would
O	be
O	well
O	received
O	This
C	Patipata
O	expected
O	but
O	although
O	not
O	naturally
O	presumptuous
O	he
O	had
O	read
O	sufficiently
O	into
O	the
O	heart
O	of
C	Papillette
O	to
O	feel
O	some
O	degree
O	of
O	consolation
O	As
O	no
O	decisive
O	explanation
O	of
O	any
O	kind
O	occurred
O	he
O	was
O	permitted
O	to
O	take
O	leave
O	of
O	the
C	princess
O	This
O	he
O	did
O	with
O	much
O	firmness
O	while
O	she
O	appeared
O	so
O	much
O	agitated
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	remarked
O	by
O	all
O	the
O	court
O	The
O	men
O	attributed
O	this
O	to
O	hatred
O	but
O	the
O	ladies
O	who
O	knew
O	better
O	pronounced
O	it
O	love
O	They
O	were
O	convinced
O	of
O	the
O	fact
O	when
O	day
O	by
O	day
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	pine
O	and
O	refused
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	had
O	not
O	the
O	chief
O	cook
O	every
O	day
O	invented
O	some
O	new
O	ragout
O	she
O	would
O	inevitably
O	have
O	died
O	of
O	hunger
O	The
C	queen
O	was
O	in
O	despair
O	and
O	dispatched
O	a
O	billet
O	to
O	the
C	fairy
C	of
C	the
C	Fountain
O	fastening
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	tail
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	white
O	mouse
O	which
O	served
O	as
O	a
O	messenger
O	on
O	this
O	occasion
O	it
O	was
O	perfectly
O	acquainted
O	with
O	the
O	way
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	the
C	fairy
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	palace
O	The
O	late
O	events
O	were
O	mentioned
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	the
O	melancholy
O	situation
O	of
O	the
C	princess
O	I
O	understand
O	this
O	case
O	said
O	the
C	fairy
O	but
O	it
O	is
O	necessary
O	that
C	Papillette
O	should
O	give
O	me
O	her
O	confidence
O	The
C	fairy
O	was
O	so
O	amiable
O	and
O	so
O	much
O	beloved
O	by
O	the
C	princess
O	that
O	she
O	easily
O	yielded
O	and
O	casting
O	down
O	her
O	eyes
O	confessed
O	that
O	she
O	loved
O	one
O	who
O	regarded
O	her
O	with
O	contemptuous
O	indifference
O	and
O	what
O	rendered
O	her
O	choice
O	still
O	more
O	degrading
O	was
O	its
O	object
O	being
O	equally
O	ugly
O	as
O	insensible
O	I
O	am
O	then
O	to
O	understand
O	replied
O	the
C	fairy
O	that
O	you
O	wish
O	to
O	be
O	cured
O	of
O	this
O	unfortunate
O	passion
O	Alas
O	no
O	rejoined
C	Papillette
O	for
O	my
O	only
O	pleasure
O	is
O	in
O	thinking
O	of
O	him
O	speaking
O	to
O	him
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	hear
O	and
O	persuading
O	myself
O	that
O	notwithstanding
O	appearances
O	he
O	could
O	have
O	loved
O	me
O	had
O	he
O	believed
O	my
O	heart
O	capable
O	of
O	steady
O	affections
O	I
O	shall
O	therefore
O	die
O	leaving
O	him
O	alike
O	ignorant
O	of
O	my
O	regrets
O	and
O	my
O	repentance
O	I
O	would
O	not
O	advise
O	you
O	to
O	die
O	said
O	the
C	fairy
O	that
O	is
O	the
O	only
O	evil
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	without
O	a
O	remedy
O	But
O	my
O	dear
C	Papillette
O	what
O	can
O	I
O	do
O	to
O	console
O	you
O	Let
O	me
O	see
O	the
C	prince
O	once
O	more
O	under
O	some
O	metamorphose
O	in
O	which
O	it
O	is
O	impossible
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	recognise
O	me
O	Very
O	well
O	replied
O	the
C	fairy
O	But
O	since
O	you
O	wish
O	to
O	risk
O	it
O	and
O	that
O	a
O	simple
C	butterfly
O	can
O	scarcely
O	compromise
O	her
O	dignity
O	in
O	following
O	a
C	king
O	under
O	this
O	form
O	I
O	shall
O	transport
O	you
O	to
O	his
O	court
O	So
O	saying
O	the
C	fairy
C	of
C	the
C	Fountain
O	placed
O	on
O	her
O	finger
O	a
O	little
O	emerald
O	ring
O	and
O	the
C	princess
O	distinctly
O	felt
O	her
O	arms
O	change
O	their
O	shape
O	expand
O	become
O	flexible
O	and
O	form
O	two
O	light
O	wings
O	clothed
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	brilliant
O	colours
O	Her
O	little
O	feet
O	quitted
O	the
O	earth
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	window
O	was
O	open
O	she
O	flew
O	out
O	traversing
O	the
O	air
O	with
O	a
O	degree
O	of
O	rapidity
O	which
O	at
O	first
O	caused
O	some
O	sensations
O	of
O	fear

O	But
O	the

O	so

O	You

O	poor

O	left
O	the
O	castle
C	Bobo
O	went
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	kitchen
O	to
O	say
O	to
C	Tilda
O	What

O	a
O	and
O	I
O	am
O	going
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	it
O	said
C	Bobo
O	proudly
O	And
O	he

O	herself
O	had
O	commanded
O	him
O	to
O	seek
O	the
O	through

O	world
O	and
O	promised
O	to
O	bring
C	Tilda
O	a
O	splendid
O	present
O	when
O	he
O	returned
O	The
O	good
O	said
O	little
O	for
O	she
O	feared
O	lest
O	some
O	misadventure
O	overtake
O	the

O	simpleton
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	chief
O	cook
O	was
O	not
O	looking
O	she
O	tucked
O	a
O	fresh

O	s
O	pocket
O	and
O	wished
O	him
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	good
O	fortune
O	So
C	Bobo
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	gate
O	and
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	which
O	stumbled
O	and
O	was
O	blind
O	in
O	one
O	eye
C	Bobo
O	cried
O	the
O	assembled
O	courtiers
O	who
O	were
O	almost
O	beside
O	themselves
O	with
O	laughter

O	rode
O	over
O	the
O	hills
O	and
O	far
O	away
O	Every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	would
O	stop
O	a
O	and
O	ask
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	a
O	lost
O	The
O	first
O	person
O	whom
O	he
O	thus
O	questioned
O	was
O	an
C	old
C	man
O	who
O	was
O	wandering
O	down
O	the
O	high
O	road
O	that

O	East
O	to
O	the

O	West
O	A

O	the
C	old
C	man
O	I
O	ve
O	lost

C	Bobo
O	had
O	to
O	answer
O	No
O	and
O	the
C	old
C	man
O	wandered
O	on
O	again
O	Another
O	day
O	the
O	simpleton
O	encountered
O	a
O	tall
O	dark
O	fierce
O	kind
O	of
C	fellow
O	who
O	answered
O	his
O	polite
O	question
O	with
O	a
O	scream
O	of
O	rage
O	A

O	I
O	lost
O	it
O	two
O	years
O	ago
O	at
O	home
O	and
O	have

O	anywhere
O	It
O	s
O	about
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	a
O	large
O	melon
O	and
O	has
O	sharp
O	little
O	points
O	On
C	Bobo
O	s
O	answering
O	No
O	this
O	dreadful
O	person
O	uttered
O	so
O	perfectly
O	awful
O	a
O	screech
O	of
O	rage
O	that
C	Bobo
O	s
O	horse
O	took
O	fright
O	and
O	ran
O	away
O	with
O	him
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	that
C	Bobo
O	could
O	do
O	to
O	rein
O	him
O	in
O	three
O	miles
O	farther
O	down
O	the
O	road
O	Still
O	farther
O	along
C	Bobo
O	came
O	to
O	Zizz
O	the
O	capital
O	city
O	of
O	the
O	Kingdom
O	of
O	the
O	Seven
O	Brooks
O	and
O	was
O	taken
O	before
O	the
C	King
O	himself
O	A
O	lost
O	said
O	the
C	King
O	No
O	I
O	am
O	quite
O	sure
O	it
O	has
O	not
O	been
O	seen
O	in
O	my
O	dominions
O	Would
O	you
O	mind
O	asking
O	as
O	you
O	go
O	through
O	the
O	world
O	for
O	news
O	of
O	my
O	little
O	daughter
O	Here
O	the
O	poor
O	old
C	King
O	took
O	out
O	a
O	great
O	green
O	handkerchief
O	and
O	wiped
O	his
O	eyes
O	She
O	was
O	stolen
O	by
O	the
O	fairies
O	on
O	midsummer
O	eve
O	fifteen
O	years
O	ago
O	Find
O	her
O	worthy
C	Bobo
O	and
O	an
O	immense
O	reward
O	will
O	be
O	yours
O	So
C	Bobo
O	left
O	the
O	proud
O	city
O	of
O	Zizz
O	and
O	once
O	again
O	rode
O	over
O	the
O	hills
O	and
O	far
O	away
O	But
O	never
O	a
O	sign
O	of
O	the
O	lost
O	did
O	he
O	find
O	although
O	he
O	asked
O	thousands
O	of
O	people
O	His
O	faithful
O	white
O	horse
O	died
O	and
O	he
O	continued
O	his
O	way
O	on
O	foot
O	Three
O	long
O	years
O	passed
O	and
C	Bobo
O	grew
O	into
O	a
O	handsome
O	lad
O	but
O	remained
O	a
O	simpleton
O	still
O	Finally
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	wandered
O	all
O	about
O	Fairyland
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	Finding
O	a
O	ship
O	moored
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	harbor
C	Bobo
O	asked
O	the
O	sailors
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	seen
O	a
O	lost
O	No
O	said
O	the
O	sailors
O	but
O	we
O	are
O	going
O	to
O	the
O	Isles
O	of
O	Iron
O	suppose
O	you
O	go
O	with
O	us
O	The
O	lost
O	may
O	be
O	there
O	So
C	Bobo
O	went
O	aboard
O	the
O	ship
O	and
O	sailed
O	out
O	upon
O	the
O	dark
O	sea
O	For
O	two
O	days
O	the
O	weather
O	was
O	warm
O	and
O	clear
O	but
O	on
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	dreadful
O	storm
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	third
O	night
O	the
O	vessel
O	was
O	driven
O	far
O	off
O	her
O	course
O	into
O	the
O	unknown
O	ocean
O	and
O	was
O	wrecked
O	upon
O	a
O	mysterious
O	island
O	of
O	rocks
O	that
O	shone
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	like
O	wet
O	matches
O	A
O	great
O	wave
O	swept
O	the
O	decks
O	and
C	Bobo
O	was
O	borne
O	away
O	from
O	his
O	companions
O	and
O	carried
O	toward
O	the
O	shining
O	land
O	Though
O	pounded
O	and
O	battered
O	by
O	the
O	foaming
O	waves
O	the
O	simpleton
O	at
O	length
O	managed
O	to
O	reach
O	the
O	beach
O	and
O	took
O	refuge
O	in
O	a
O	crevice
O	of
O	the
O	cliff
O	during
O	the
O	stormy
O	night
O	When
O	the
O	dawn
O	broke
O	all
O	sign
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	had
O	disappeared
O	Looking
O	about
C	Bobo
O	found
O	himself
O	on
O	a
O	lovely
O	island
O	whose
O	heart
O	was
O	a
O	high
O	mountain
O	mass
O	hidden
O	in
O	the
O	fog
O	still
O	sweeping
O	in
O	from
O	the
O	sea
O	There
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	house
O	a
O	road
O	or
O	a
O	path
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	Suddenly
C	Bobo
O	noticed
O	a
O	strange
O	little
O	door
O	in
O	the
O	bark
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	lonely
O	tree
O	and
O	opening
O	this
O	door
O	he
O	discovered
O	a
O	little
O	cupboard
O	in
O	which
O	were
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	wooden
O	shoes
O	Above
O	the
O	shoes
O	was
O	a
O	card
O	saying
O	simply
O	PUT
O	US
O	ON
O	So
C	Bobo
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	a
O	stone
O	by
O	the

O	of

O	and
O	put
O	on
O	the
O	wooden
O	shoes
O	which
O	fitted
O	him
O	very
O	nicely
O	Now
O	these
O	shoes
O	were
O	magic
O	shoes
O	and
C	Bobo
O	had
O	hardly
O	stepped
O	into
O	them
O	before
O	they
O	turned
O	his
O	feet
O	inland
O	So
C	Bobo
O	obediently
O	let
O	the
O	shoes
O	guide
O	him
O	At
O	corners
O	the
O	shoes
O	always
O	turned
O	in
O	the
O	right
O	direction
O	and
O	if
C	Bobo
O	forgot
O	and
O	blundered
O	on
O	the
O	wrong
O	way
O	the
O	shoes
O	swiftly
O	began
O	to
O	pinch
O	his
O	toes
O	For
O	two
O	days
C	Bobo
O	walked
O	inland
O	toward
O	the

O	A
O	warm
O	wind
O	blew
O	the

O	and

O	away
O	the

O	shone
O	sweet

O	On
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	the
O	simpleton
O	entered
O	a
O	wood
O	of
O	tall
O	silent
O	trees
O	and
O	as
O	that
O	day
O	was
O	drawing
O	to
O	a
O	close
O	turrets
O	of
O	a
O	magnificent
O	castle
O	rose
O	far
O	away
O	over
O	the

O	of
O	the

C	Bobo
O	arrived
O	at
O	twilight
O	He
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	beautiful
O	garden
O	lying
O	between
O	the
O	castle
O	walls
O	and
O	the
O	rising
O	slopes
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	mountain
O	Strange
O	to
O	say
O	not
O	a
O	living
O	creature
O	was
O	to

O	seen
O	and

O	Suddenly
O	a
O	great
O	booming
O	bell
O	struck
O	seven
O	o
O	clock
C	Bobo
O	began
O	to

O	and
O	then
O	before

O	away
O	a

O	on
O	a

O	dashed
O	at

O	speed
O	out
O	of

O	in
O	the

O	An
C	old

O	accompanied

C	Bobo
O	judged
O	from

O	Plucking
O	up

C	Bobo
O	came
O	forward
O	fell
O	on

O	before
O	the
C	old
C	man
O	and

C	Twelve
C	O
C	Clock
O	who

C	Bobo
O	said
O	kind
O	young
O	Twelve
O	O
O	Clock
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	simpleton
O	s

O	Drink
O	this

O	silver
O	cup
O	full
O	to
O	the
O	brim
O	of

O	shining
O	water
O	Now
O	this
O	water
O	was
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	wisdom
O	and
O	when
C	Bobo
O	had
O	drunk
O	it
O	he
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	a
O	simpleton
O	And
O	being
O	no
O	longer
O	a
O	simpleton
O	he
O	remembered
O	the

O	lost
O	his
O	reputation
O	the
O	man
O	who
O	had

O	the

O	by

O	So
C	Bobo
O	made
O	so
O	bold
O	as
O	to
O	ask
C	Father
C	Time
O	about

O	which
O	have
O	been
O	picked
O	up
O	by
O	his
O	neighbors
O	and
O	carried
O	home
O	If
O	he
O	can
O	persuade
O	his
O	neighbors
O	to
O	give
O	them
O	up
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	piece
O	together
O	a
O	pretty
O	good

O	again
O	As

O	tell
O	him
O	that
O	it
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	in
O	the

C	O
C	Clock
O	placed

O	who
O	was
O	holding
O	the
O	ebony
O	casket
O	close
O	against
O	his
O	heart
O	was
O	in
O	great
O	danger
O	of

O	off
O	When
O	they
O	got
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	the
O	white

O	hesitated
O	not

O	but
O	set
O	foot
O	upon
O	the
O	water
O	which
O	bore
O	him
O	up
O	as
O	if
O	it

O	wished
C	Bobo
O	and
O	rising
O	in
O	the

O	disappeared
O	into
O	the
O	glare
O	of
O	the
O	sun
C	Bobo
O	with
O	the
O	precious
O	ebony
O	casket
O	in

O	continued
O	on

O	On
O	the
O	second

O	of

O	he
O	happened
O	to

O	who
O	had
O	lost
O	his

O	therefore
C	Bobo
O	repeated
O	the
O	counsel
O	of
C	Father
C	Time
O	and
O	sent
O	him
O	hurrying

O	found
O	no
O	sign
O	In
O	the
O	grass
O	by
O	the
O	roadside
O	however
O	he
O	did
O	find
O	the
O	lost
O	temper
O	a
O	queer
O	sort
O	of
O	affair
O	like
O	a
O	melon
O	of
O	fiery
O	red

O	two
O	now
O	Alas
O	Alas
O	Hardly
O	were
O	the
O	words
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	mouth
O	when
O	the
O	town
O	bell
O	struck
O	twice
O	solemnly
O	and
O	sadly
O	Quick
O	quick
O	cried
O	the
C	King
O	and
C	Bobo
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	breath
O	Let
O	us
O	hurry
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	We
O	may
O	save
O	her
O	yet
O	But
O	they
O	knew
O	in
O	their
O	hearts
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	too
O	late
O	and
O	that
O	poor
C	Tilda
O	had
O	given
O	herself
O	to
O	the
C	dragon
O	And
O	so
O	it
O	proved
O	In
O	spite
O	of
O	his
O	mad
O	dash
C	Bobo
O	who
O	had
O	spurred
O	on
O	ahead
O	arrived
O	exactly
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	late
O	The
O	monstrous
C	dragon
O	with
C	Tilda
O	in
O	his
O	claws
O	was
O	just
O	a
O	little
O	smoky
O	speck
O	far
O	down
O	the
O	southern
O	sky
C	Princess
C	Zenza
O	and
O	her
O	court
O	stood
O	by
O	wringing
O	their
O	jeweled
O	hands
O	Suddenly
C	Bobo
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	He
O	had
O	arrived
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	late
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	have
O	that
O	back
O	again
O	Things
O	should
O	be
O	exactly
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	before
O	He
O	opened
O	the
O	cover
O	of
O	the
O	ebony
O	box
O	Something
O	like
O	a
O	winged
O	white
O	flame
O	escaped
O	from
O	it
O	and
O	flew
O	hissing
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	to
O	the
O	sun
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	sun
O	itself
O	turning
O	round
O	like
O	a
O	cartwheel
O	and
O	hissing
O	like
O	ten
O	thousand
O	rockets
O	it
O	rolled
O	back
O	along
O	the
O	sky
O	to
O	the
O	east
O	The
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	clocks
O	which
O	marked
O	two
O	whirred
O	back
O	to
O	two
O	o
O	clock
O	in
O	a
O	twinkling
O	And
O	sure
O	enough
O	there
O	was
O	brave
O	little
C	Tilda
O	standing
O	alone
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	field
O	waiting
O	for
O	the
C	dragon
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	take
O	her
O	away
O	Lumbering
O	heavily
O	along
O	like
O	a
O	monstrous
O	turtle
O	and
O	snorting
O	blue
O	smoke
O	the
C	dragon
O	was
O	advancing
O	toward
O	her
C	Bobo
O	ran
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	field
O	and
O	stood
O	beside
C	Tilda
O	ready
O	to
O	defend
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	end
O	The
C	dragon
O	came
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	Suddenly
O	angered
O	by
O	the
O	sight
O	of
C	Bobo
O	and
O	his
O	drawn
O	sword
O	he
O	roared
O	angrily
O	but
O	continued
O	to
O	approach
C	Bobo
O	struck
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	The
O	blade
O	broke
O	upon
O	his
O	steely
O	scales
O	The
C	dragon
O	roared
O	again
O	Now
O	just
O	as
O	the
C	dragon
O	s
O	mouth
O	was
O	its
O	widest
C	Bobo
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	searching
O	his
O	pockets
O	desperately
O	hurled
O	into
O	it
O	the
O	lost
O	temper
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	perfectly
O	terrific
O	bang
O	as
O	if
O	a
O	million
O	balloons
O	had
O	blown
O	up
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	For
O	the
C	dragon
O	had
O	blown
O	up
O	The
O	lost
O	temper
O	had
O	finished
O	him
O	Only
O	one
O	fragment
O	of
O	him
O	a
O	tiny
O	bit
O	of
O	a
O	claw
O	was
O	ever
O	found
O	Everybody
O	you
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	began
O	to
O	cry
O	Hurrah
O	and
O	Hooray
O	and
O	soon
O	they
O	were
O	firing
O	off
O	cannon
O	and
O	ringing
O	all
O	the
O	bells
O	Then
C	Tilda
O	s
O	father
O	took
O	her
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	real
O	Princess
O	The
O	Grand
O	Cross
O	of
O	the
O	Order
O	of
O	the
O	Black
O	Cat
O	was
O	conferred
O	upon
C	Bobo
O	by
C	Princess
C	Zenza
O	who
O	also
O	asked
O	his
O	pardon
O	for
O	having
O	treated
O	him
O	so
O	shabbily
O	This
C	Bobo
O	gave
O	readily
O	A
O	wonderful
O	fete
O	was
O	held
O	When
O	the
O	rejoicings
O	were
O	over
C	Bobo
O	and
C	Tilda
O	were
O	married
O	and
O	lived
O	happily
O	together
O	all
O	their
O	days
O	After
O	he
O	had
O	rescued
C	Sir
C	Percivale
O	from
O	the
O	twenty
O	knights
O	who
O	beset
O	him
C	Sir
C	Galahad
O	rode
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	till
O	nightfall
O	when
O	he
O	sought
O	shelter
O	at
O	a
O	little
O	hermitage
O	Thither
O	there
O	came
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	a
O	damsel
O	who
O	desired
O	to
O	speak
O	with
C	Sir
C	Galahad
O	so
O	he
O	arose
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	her
C	Galahad
O	said
O	she
O	arm
O	you
O	and
O	mount
O	your
O	horse
O	and
O	follow
O	me
O	for
O	I
O	am
O	come
O	to
O	guide
O	you
O	in
O	your
O	quest
O	So
O	they
O	rode
O	together
O	until
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	and
O	there
O	the
O	damsel
O	showed
C	Galahad
O	a
O	great
O	ship
O	into
O	which
O	he
O	must
O	enter
O	Then
O	she
O	bade
O	him
O	farewell
O	and
O	he
O	going
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	ship
O	found
O	there
O	already
O	the
O	good
O	knights
C	Sir
C	Bors
O	and
C	Sir
C	Percivale
O	who
O	made
O	much
O	joy
O	of
O	the
O	meeting
O	They
O	abode
O	in
O	that
O	ship
O	until
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	of
C	king
C	Pelles
O	who
O	welcomed
O	them
O	right
O	gladly
O	Then
O	as
O	they
O	all
O	sat
O	at
O	supper
O	that
O	night
O	suddenly
O	the
O	hall
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	light
O	and
O	the
O	holy
O	vessel
O	appeared
O	in
O	their
O	midst
O	covered
O	all
O	in
O	white
O	samite
O	While
O	they
O	all
O	rejoiced
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	voice
O	saying
O	My
O	knights
O	whom
O	I
O	have
O	chosen
O	ye
O	have
O	seen
O	the
O	holy
O	vessel
O	dimly
O	Continue
O	your
O	journey
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Sarras
O	and
O	there
O	the
O	perfect
O	Vision
O	shall
O	be
O	yours
O	Now
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Sarras
O	had
O	dwelt
O	long
O	time
C	Joseph
O	of
O	Arimathea
O	teaching
O	its
O	people
O	the
O	true
O	faith
O	before
O	ever
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	Britain
O	but
O	when
C	Sir
C	Galahad
O	and
O	his
O	fellows
O	came
O	there
O	after
O	long
O	voyage
O	they
O	found
O	it
O	ruled
O	by
O	a
O	heathen
C	king
O	named
C	Estorause
O	who
O	cast
O	them
O	into
O	a
O	deep
O	dungeon
O	There
O	they
O	were
O	kept
O	a
O	year
O	but
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	that
O	time
O	the
O	tyrant
O	died
O	Then
O	the
O	great
O	men
O	of
O	the
O	land
O	gathered
O	together
O	to
O	consider
O	who
O	should
O	be
O	their
C	king
O	and
O	while
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	council
O	came
O	a
O	voice
O	bidding
O	them
O	take
O	as
O	their
C	king
O	the
O	youngest
O	of
O	the
O	three
O	knights
O	whom
C	Estorause
O	had
O	thrown
O	into
O	prison
O	So
O	in
O	fear
O	and
O	wonder
O	they
O	hastened
O	to
O	the
O	prison
O	and
O	releasing
O	the
O	three
O	knights
O	made
C	Galahad
C	king
O	as
O	the
O	voice
O	had
O	bidden
O	them
O	Thus
C	Sir
C	Galahad
O	became
C	king
O	of
O	the
O	famous
O	city
O	of
O	Sarras
O	in
O	far
O	Babylon
O	He
O	had
O	reigned
O	a
O	year
O	when
O	one
O	morning
O	early
O	he
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	knights
O	his
O	fellows
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	chapel
O	and
O	there
O	they
O	saw
O	kneeling
O	in
O	prayer
O	an
O	aged
O	man
O	robed
O	as
O	a
C	bishop
O	and
O	round
O	him
O	hovered
O	many
O	angels
O	The
O	knights
O	fell
O	on
O	their
O	knees
O	in
O	awe
O	and
O	reverence
O	whereupon
O	he
O	that
O	seemed
O	a
C	bishop
O	turned
O	to
O	them
O	and
O	said
O	I
O	am
C	Joseph
O	of
O	Arimathea
O	and
O	I
O	am
O	come
O	to
O	show
O	you
O	the
O	perfect
O	Vision
O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	On
O	the
O	instant
O	there
O	appeared
O	before
O	them
O	without
O	veil
O	or
O	cover
O	the
O	holy
O	vessel
O	in
O	a
O	radiance
O	of
O	light
O	such
O	as
O	almost
O	blinded
O	them
C	Sir
C	Bors
O	and
C	Sir
C	Percivale
O	when
O	at
O	length
O	they
O	were
O	recovered
O	from
O	the
O	brightness
O	of
O	that
O	glory
O	looked
O	up
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	the
O	holy
C	Joseph
O	and
O	the
O	wondrous
O	vessel
O	had
O	passed
O	from
O	their
O	sight
O	Then
O	they
O	Went
O	to
C	Sir
C	Galahad
O	where
O	he
O	still
O	knelt
O	as
O	in
O	prayer
O	and
O	behold
O	he
O	was
O	dead
O	for
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	with
O	him
O	even
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	prayed
O	in
O	the
O	moment
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	vision
O	his
O	soul
O	had
O	gone
O	back
O	to
O	God
O	So
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	buried
O	him
O	in
O	that
O	far
O	city
O	themselves
O	mourning
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	with
O	them
O	And
O	immediately
O	after
C	Sir
C	Percivale
O	put
O	off
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	a
O	monk
O	living
O	a
O	devout
O	and
O	holy
O	life
O	until
O	a
O	year
O	and
O	two
O	months
O	later
O	he
O	also
O	died
O	and
O	was
O	buried
O	near
C	Sir
C	Galahad
O	Then
C	Sir
C	Bors
O	armed
O	him
O	and
O	bidding
O	farewell
O	to
O	the
O	city
O	sailed
O	away
O	until
O	after
O	many
O	weeks
O	he
O	came
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	Britain
O	There
O	he
O	took
O	horse
O	and
O	stayed
O	not
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	Camelot
O	Great
O	was
O	the
O	rejoicing
O	of
O	Arthur
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	knights
O	when
C	Sir
C	Bors
O	was
O	once
O	more
O	among
O	them
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	told
O	all
O	the
O	adventures
O	which

O	befallen
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	good

O	his
O	companions
O	all
O	who
O	heard
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	amaze
O	But
O	the
C	king
O	he
O	caused
O	the
O	wisest
O	clerks
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	to
O	write
O	in
O	great
O	books
O	this

O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	that

C	Felim
C	Felim

O	his

O	of
O	her
O	lovely
O	faultless
O	form
O	For
O	her
O	sweet
O	sake
O	he
O	said
O	more
O	blood
O	should
O	be
O	spilt
O	in
O	Erin
O	than
O	for
O	generations

O	and
O	bright
O	torches
O	of

O	should

O	For
O	love
O	of
O	her
O	three
O	heroes
O	of
O	eternal
O	renown
O	must
O	give
O	their

O	away
O	the

O	in
O	which
O	her
O	starry
O	eyes
O	should

O	themselves
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	sea
O	of
O	blood
O	and
O	woe
O	unutterable
O	should
O	come
O	on
O	the
O	sons
O	of
O	Erin
O	Then
O	up
O	spoke
O	the
O	lords
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Branch
O	and
O	grimly
O	they
O	looked
O	at
C	Felim
O	the
O	Harper
O	If
O	the
O	babe
O	that
O	thy
O	wife
O	is
O	about
O	to
O	bear
O	is
O	to
O	bring
O	such
O	evil
O	upon
O	our
O	land
O	better
O	that
O	thou
O	shouldst
O	shed
O	her
O	innocent
O	blood
O	ere
O	she
O	spills
O	the
O	blood
O	of
O	our
O	nation
O	And
C	Felim
O	made
O	answer
O	It
O	is
O	well
O	spoken
O	Bitter
O	it
O	is
O	for
O	my
O	wife
O	and
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	lose
O	a
O	child
O	so
O	beautiful
O	yet
O	shall
O	I
O	slay
O	her
O	that
O	my
O	land
O	may
O	be
O	saved
O	from
O	such
O	a
O	doom
O	But
C	Conor
O	the
O	king
O	spoke
O	then
O	and
O	because
O	the
O	witchery
O	of
O	the
O	perfect
O	beauty
O	and
O	the
O	magic
O	charm
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	was
O	felt
O	by
O	him
O	even
O	before
O	she
O	was
O	born
O	he
O	said
O	She
O	shall
O	not
O	die
O	Upon
O	myself
O	I
O	take
O	the
O	doom
O	The

O	all
O	men
O	until
O	she
O	is
O	of
O	an
O	age
O	to
O	wed
O	Then
O	shall
O	I
O	take
O	her
O	for
O	my
O	wife
O	and
O	none
O	shall
O	dare
O	to
O	contend
O	for
O	her
O	His
O	voice
O	had
O	barely
O	ceased
O	when
O	a
O	messenger
O	came
O	to
C	Felim
O	to
O	tell
O	him
O	that
O	a
O	daughter
O	was
O	born
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	on
O	his
O	heels
O	came
O	a
O	procession
O	of
O	chanting
O	women
O	bearing
O	the
O	babe
O	on
O	a
O	cushion
O	And
O	all
O	who
O	saw
O	the
O	tiny
O	thing
O	with
O	skin
O	and
O	locks
O	more
O	yellow
O	than
O	the
O	western
O	gold
O	of
O	the
O	summer
O	sun
O	looked
O	on
O	her
O	with
O	the
O	fear
O	that
O	even
O	the
O	bravest
O	heart
O	feels
O	on
O	facing
O	the
O	Unknown
O	And
C	Cathbad
O	spoke
O	Let
C	Deirdrê
O	be
O	her
O	name
O	sweet
O	menace
O	that
O	she
O	is
O	And
O	the
O	babe
O	gazed
O	up
O	with
O	starry
O	eyes
O	at
O	the
O	Druid
O	as
O	he
O	chanted
O	to
O	her
O	Many
O	will
O	be
O	jealous
O	of
O	your
O	face
O	O
O	flame
O	of
O	beauty
O	for
O	your
O	sake
O	heroes
O	shall
O	go
O	to
O	exile
O	For
O	there
O	is
O	harm
O	in
O	your
O	face
O	it
O	will
O	bring
O	banishment
O	and
O	death
O	on
O	the
O	sons
O	of
O	kings
O	In
O	your
O	fate
O	O
O	beautiful
O	child
O	are
O	wounds
O	and
O	and
O	shedding
O	of
O	blood
O	You
O	will
O	have
O	a
O	little
O	grave
O	apart
O	to
O	yourself
O	you
O	will
O	be
O	a
O	tale
O	of
O	wonder
O	for
O	ever
C	Deirdrê
O	As
C	Conor
O	commanded
C	Deirdrê
O	the
O	little
O	babe
O	of
O	destiny
O	was
O	left
O	with
O	her
O	mother
O	for
O	only
O	a
O	month
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	and
O	then
O	was
O	sent
O	with
O	a
O	nurse
O	and
O	with
C	Cathbad
O	the
O	Druid
O	to
O	a
O	lonely
O	island
O	thickly
O	wooded
O	and
O	only
O	accessible
O	by
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	causeway
O	at
O	low
O	tide
O	Here
O	she
O	grew
O	into
O	maidenhood
O	and
O	each
O	day
O	became
O	more
O	fair
O	She
O	had
O	instruction
O	from
C	Cathbad
O	in
O	religion
O	and
O	in
O	all
O	manner
O	of
O	wisdom
O	and
O	it
O	would
O	seem
O	as
O	though
O	she
O	also
O	learned
O	from
O	him
O	some
O	of
O	that
O	mystical
O	power
O	that
O	enabled
O	her
O	to
O	see
O	things
O	hidden
O	from
O	human
O	eyes
O	Tell
O	me
O	one
O	day
O	she
O	asked
O	her
O	teacher
O	who
O	made
O	the
O	stars
O	the
O	firmament
O	above
O	the
O	earth
O	the
O	flowers
O	both
O	thee
O	and
O	me
O	And
C	Cathbad
O	answered
O	God
O	But
O	who
O	God
O	is
O	alas
O	no
O	man
O	can
O	say
O	Then
C	Deirdrê
O	an
O	impetuous
O	child
O	seized
O	the
O	druidical
O	staff
O	from
O	the
O	hand
O	of
C	Cathbad
O	broke
O	it
O	in
O	two
O	and
O	flung
O	the
O	pieces
O	far
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	water
O	Ah
C	Cathbad
O	she
O	cried
O	there
O	shall
O	come
O	One
O	in
O	the
O	dim
O	future
O	for
O	whom
O	all
O	your
O	Druid
O	spells
O	and
O	charms
O	are
O	naught
O	Then
O	seeing
C	Cathbad
O	hang
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	a
O	tear
O	trickle
O	down
O	his
O	face
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	child
O	spoke
O	truth
O	the
O	child
O	grieved
O	at
O	giving
O	pain
O	to
O	the
O	friend
O	whom
O	she
O	loved
O	threw
O	her
O	arms
O	about
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	s
O	neck
O	and
O	by
O	her
O	kisses
O	strove
O	to
O	comfort
O	him
O	As
C	Deirdrê
O	grew
O	older
C	Conor
O	sent
O	one
O	from
O	his
O	court
O	to
O	educate
O	her
O	in
O	all
O	that
O	any
O	queen
O	should
O	know
O	They
O	called
O	her
O	the
c	Lavarcam
O	which
O	in
O	our
O	tongue
O	really
O	means
O	the
O	Gossip
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	royal
O	blood
O	who
O	belonged
O	to
O	a
O	class
O	that
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	had
O	been
O	trained
O	to
O	be
O	chroniclers
O	or
O	The
C	Lavarcam
O	was
O	a
O	clever
O	woman
O	and
O	she
O	marvelled
O	at
O	the
O	wondrous
O	beauty
O	of
O	the
O	child
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	teach
O	and
O	at
O	her
O	equally
O	marvellous
O	mind
O	One
O	winter
O	day
O	when
O	the
O	snow
O	lay
O	deep
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
C	Deirdrê
O	saw
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	snow
O	a
O	calf
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	slain
O	for
O	her
O	food
O	The
O	red
O	blood
O	that
O	ran
O	from
O	its
O	neck
O	had
O	brought
O	a
O	black
O	raven
O	swooping
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	snow
O	And
O	to
C	Lavarcam
C	Deirdrê
O	said
O	If

O	One
O	I

O	is
O	whiter

O	son
O	of
O	Usna
O	To
O	him
O	shall
O	it
O	belong
O	forever
O	From
O	that
O	day
O	forward
C	Naoise
O	held
O	kingship
O	over
O	the
O	thoughts
O	and
O	dreams
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	And
O	when
C	Lavarcam
O	saw
O	how
O	deep
O	her
O	careless
O	words
O	had
O	sunk
O	into
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	maiden
O	she
O	grew
O	afraid
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	a
O	means
O	by
O	which
O	to
O	undo
O	the
O	harm
O	which
O	in
O	her
O	thoughtlessness
O	she
O	had
O	wrought
O	Now
C	Conor
O	had
O	made
O	a
O	law
O	that
O	none
O	but
C	Cathbad
C	Lavarcam
O	and
O	the
O	nurse
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	should
O	pass
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	that
O	led
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	that
O	none
O	but
O	they
O	should
O	look
O	upon
O	her
O	until
O	his
O	own
O	eyes
O	beheld
O	her
O	and
O	he
O	took
O	her
O	for
O	his
O	wife
O	But
O	as
C	Lavarcam
O	one
O	day
O	came
O	from
O	seeing
C	Deirdrê
O	and
O	from
O	listening
O	to
O	her
O	many
O	eager
O	questions
O	about
C	Naoise
O	she
O	met
O	a
O	swineherd
O	rough
O	in
O	looks
O	and
O	speech
O	and
O	clad
O	in
O	the
O	pelt
O	of
O	a
O	deer
O	and
O	with
O	him
O	two
O	rough
O	fellows
O	bondmen
O	of
O	the
O	Ultonians
O	and
O	to
O	her
O	quick
O	mind
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	plan
O	Thus
O	she
O	bade
O	them
O	follow
O	her
O	into
O	the
O	forbidden
O	forest
O	and
O	there
O	to
O	remain
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	a
O	well
O	until
O	they
O	should
O	hear
O	the
O	bark
O	of
O	a
O	fox
O	and
O	the
O	cry
O	of
O	a
O	jay
O	Then
O	they
O	were
O	to
O	walk
O	slowly
O	on
O	through
O	the
O	woods
O	speaking
O	to
O	none
O	whom
O	they
O	might
O	meet
O	and
O	still
O	keeping
O	silence
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	again
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	shadow
O	of
O	the
O	trees
O	Then
C	Lavarcam
O	sped
O	back
O	to
C	Deirdrê
O	and
O	begged
O	her
O	to
O	come
O	with
O	her
O	to
O	enjoy
O	the
O	beauty
O	of
O	the
O	woods
O	In
O	a
O	little
C	Lavarcam
O	strayed
O	away
O	from
O	her
O	charge
O	and
O	soon
O	the
O	cry
O	of
O	a
O	jay
O	and
O	the
O	bark
O	of
O	a
O	fox
O	were
O	heard
O	and
O	while
C	Deirdrê
O	still
O	marvelled
O	at
O	the
O	sounds
O	that
O	came
O	so
O	close
O	together
C	Lavarcam
O	returned
O	Nor
O	had
O	she
O	been
O	back
O	a
O	minute
O	before
O	three
O	men
O	came
O	through
O	the
O	trees
O	and
O	slowly
O	walked
O	past
O	close
O	to
O	where
C	Lavarcam
O	and
C	Deirdrê
O	were
O	hidden
O	I
O	have
O	never
O	seen
O	men
O	so
O	near
O	before
O	said
C	Deirdrê
O	Only
O	from
O	the
O	outskirts
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	have
O	I
O	seen
O	them
O	very
O	far
O	away
O	Who
O	are
O	these
O	men
O	who
O	bring
O	no
O	joy
O	to
O	my
O	eyes
O	And
C	Lavarcam
O	made
O	answer
O	These
O	are
C	Naoise
C	Ardan
O	and
C	Ainle
O	the
O	three
O	sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	But
C	Deirdrê
O	looked
O	hard
O	at
C	Lavarcam
O	and
O	scorn
O	and
O	laughter
O	were
O	in
O	her
O	merry
O	eyes
O	Then
O	shall
O	I
O	have
O	speech
O	with
C	Naoise
C	Ardan
O	and
C	Ainle
O	she
O	said
O	and
O	ere
C	Lavarcam
O	could
O	stop
O	her
O	she
O	had
O	flitted
O	through
O	the
O	trees
O	by
O	a
O	path
O	amongst
O	the
O	fern
O	and
O	stood
O	suddenly
O	before
O	the
O	three
O	men
O	And
O	the
O	rough
O	hinds
O	seeing
O	such
O	perfect
O	loveliness
O	made
O	very
O	sure
O	that
C	Deirdrê
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	and
O	stared
O	at
O	her
O	with
O	the
O	round
O	eyes
O	and
O	gaping
O	mouths
O	of
O	wondering
O	terror
O	For
O	a
O	moment
C	Deirdrê
O	gazed
O	at
O	them
O	Then
O	Are
O	ye
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	she
O	asked
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	stood
O	like
O	stocks
O	frightened
O	and
O	stupid
O	she
O	lashed
O	them
O	with
O	her
O	mockery
O	until
O	the
O	swineherd
O	could
O	no
O	more
O	and
O	blurted
O	out
O	the
O	whole
O	truth
O	to
O	this
O	most
O	beautiful
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	Then
O	very
O	gently
O	like
O	pearls
O	from
O	a
O	silver
O	string
O	the
O	words
O	fell
O	from
O	the
O	lips
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	I
O	blame
O	thee
O	not
O	poor
O	swineherd
O	she
O	said
O	and
O	that
O	thou
O	mayst
O	know
O	that
O	I
O	deem
O	thee
O	a
O	true
O	man
O	I
O	would
O	fain
O	ask
O	thee
O	to
O	do
O	one
O	thing
O	for
O	me
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	the
O	herd
O	met
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	a
O	soul
O	was
O	born
O	in
O	him
O	and
O	he
O	knew
O	things
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	never
O	before
O	had
O	dreamed
O	If
O	I
O	can
O	do
O	one
O	thing
O	to
O	please
O	thee
O	that
O	will
O	I
O	do
O	he
O	said
O	Aye
O	and
O	gladly
O	pay
O	for
O	it
O	with
O	my
O	life
O	Thenceforth
O	my
O	life
O	is
O	thine
O	And
C	Deirdrê
O	said
O	I
O	would
O	fain
O	see
C	Naoise
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	And
O	once
O	more
O	the
O	swineherd
O	said
O	My
O	life
O	is
O	thine
O	Then
C	Deirdrê
O	seeing
O	in
O	his
O	eyes
O	a
O	very
O	beautiful
O	thing
O	stooped
O	and
O	kissed
O	the
O	swineherd
O	on
O	his
O	tanned
O	forehead
O	Go
O	then
O	she
O	said
O	to
C	Naoise
O	Tell
O	him
O	that
O	I
C	Deirdrê
O	dream
O	of
O	him
O	all
O	the
O	night
O	and
O	think
O	of
O	him
O	all
O	the
O	day
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	bid
O	him
O	meet
O	me
O	here
O	an
O	hour
O	before
O	the
O	setting
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	The
O	swineherd
O	watched
O	her
O	flit
O	into
O	the
O	shadows
O	of
O	the
O	trees
O	and
O	then
O	went
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	snowy
O	woods
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	pay
O	with
O	his
O	life
O	for
O	the
O	kiss
O	that
C	Deirdrê
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	Sorely
O	puzzled
O	was
C	Lavarcam
O	over
O	the
O	doings
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	that
O	day
O	for
C	Deirdrê
O	told
O	her
O	not
O	a
O	word
O	of
O	what
O	had
O	passed
O	between
O	her
O	and
O	the
O	swineherd
O	On
O	the
O	morrow
O	when
O	she
O	left
O	her
O	to
O	go
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	of
O	King
C	Conor
O	she
O	saw
O	as
O	she
O	drew
O	near
O	Emain
O	Macha
O	where
O	he
O	stayed
O	black
O	wings
O	that
O	flapped
O	over
O	something
O	that
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	snow
O	At
O	her
O	approach
O	there
O	rose
O	three
O	ravens
O	three
O	kites
O	and
O	three
O	and
O	she
O	saw
O	that
O	their
O	prey
O	was
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	swineherd
O	with
O	gaping
O	all
O	over
O	him
O	Yet
O	even
O	then
O	he
O	looked
O	happy
O	He
O	had
O	died
O	laughing
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	still
O	a
O	smile
O	on
O	his
O	lips
O	Faithfully
O	had
O	he
O	delivered
O	his
O	message
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	spoken
O	of
O	the
O	beauty
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	rumour
O	of
O	his
O	speech
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	king
O	and
O	the
O	spears
O	of
C	Conor
O	s
O	men
O	had
O	enabled
O	him
O	to
O	make
O	true
O	the
O	words
O	he
O	had
O	said
O	to
C	Deirdrê
O	I
O	will
O	pay
O	for
O	it
O	with
O	my
O	life
O	In
O	this
O	way
O	was
O	shed
O	the
O	first
O	blood
O	of
O	that
O	great
O	sea
O	of
O	blood
O	that
O	was
O	spilt
O	for
O	the
O	love
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	the
O	Beauty
O	of
O	the
O	World
O	From
O	where
O	the
O	swineherd
O	lay
C	Lavarcam
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	camp
O	of
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	and
O	to
C	Naoise
O	she
O	told
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	the
O	love
O	that
C	Deirdrê
O	bore
O	him
O	and
O	counselled
O	him
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	she
O	was
O	hidden
O	and
O	behold
O	her
O	beauty
O	And
C	Naoise
O	who
O	had
O	seen
O	how
O	even
O	a
O	rough
O	clod
O	of
O	a
O	hind
O	could
O	achieve
O	the
O	noble
O	chivalry
O	of
O	a
O	race
O	of
O	kings
O	for
O	her
O	dear
O	sake
O	felt
O	his
O	heart
O	throb
O	within
O	him
O	I
O	will
O	come
O	he
O	said
O	to
C	Lavarcam
O	Days
O	passed
O	and
C	Deirdrê
O	waited
O	very
O	sure
O	that
C	Naoise
O	must
O	come
O	to
O	her
O	at
O	last
O	And
O	one
O	day
O	she
O	heard
O	a
O	song
O	of
O	magical
O	sweetness
O	coming
O	through
O	the
O	trees
O	Three
O	voices
O	sung
O	the
O	song
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	though
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	played
O	a
O	harp
O	to
O	cast
O	a
O	spell
O	upon
O	men
O	The
O	voice
O	of
C	Ainle
O	youngest
O	of
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	was
O	like
O	the
O	sweet
O	upper
O	strings
O	of
O	the
O	harp
O	that
O	of
C	Ardan
O	the
O	strings
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	and
O	the
O	voice
O	of
C	Naoise
O	was
O	like
O	the
O	strings
O	whose
O	deep
O	resonance
O	can
O	play
O	upon
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	warriors
O	and
O	move
O	them
O	to
O	tears
O	Then
C	Deirdrê
O	knew
O	that
O	she
O	heard
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	her
O	beloved
O	and
O	she
O	sped
O	to
O	him
O	as
O	a
O	bird
O	speeds
O	to
O	her
O	mate
O	Even
O	as
C	Lavarcam
O	had
O	told
O	her
O	was
C	Naoise
O	eldest
O	of
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	but
O	no
O	words
O	had
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	tell
C	Naoise
O	of
O	the
O	beauty
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	It
O	was
O	as
O	though
O	a
O	sudden
O	flood
O	of
O	sunshine
O	burst
O	forth
O	in
O	that
O	place
O	For
O	a
O	woman
O	came
O	from
O	the
O	thicket
O	more
O	beautiful
O	than
O	any
O	dream
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	dreamed
O	She
O	was
O	clad
O	in
O	a
O	saffron
O	robe
O	over
O	white
O	that
O	was
O	like
O	the
O	shining
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	on
O	foam
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	this
O	was
O	claspt
O	with
O	great
O	bands
O	of
O	yellow
O	gold
O	and
O	over
O	her
O	shoulders
O	was
O	the
O	rippling
O	flood
O	of
O	her
O	hair
O	the
O	sprays
O	of
O	which
O	lightened
O	into
O	delicate
O	fire
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	mist
O	before
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	which
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	her
O	eyes
O	like
O	two
O	blue
O	pools
O	wherein
O	purple
O	shadows
O	dreamed
O	From
O	that
O	moment
C	Naoise
O	gave
O	his
O	love
O	to
C	Deirdrê
O	above
O	every
O	other
O	creature
O	and
O	their
O	souls
O	rushed
O	together
O	and
O	were
O	one
O	for
O	evermore
O	It
O	was
O	for
O	them
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	a
O	perfect
O	love
O	and
O	so
O	sure
O	were
O	they
O	of
O	that
O	love
O	from
O	the
O	very
O	first
O	moment
O	that
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	though
O	they
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	born
O	loving
O	one
O	another
O	Of
O	that
O	love
O	they
O	talked
O	of
O	the
O	anger
O	of
C	Conor
O	when
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	his
O	destined
O	bride
O	was
O	the
O	love
O	of
C	Naoise
O	and
O	together
O	they
O	planned
O	how
O	it
O	was
O	best
O	for
C	Deirdrê
O	to
O	escape
O	from
O	the
O	furious
O	wrath
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	who
O	desired
O	her
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	Of
O	a
O	sudden
O	the
O	hands
O	of
C	Naoise
O	gripped
O	the
O	javelin
O	that
O	hung
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	and
O	drove
O	it
O	into
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	snow
O	weighed
O	down
O	the
O	bracken
O	Is
O	it
O	a
O	wolf
O	cried
C	Deirdrê
O	And
C	Naoise
O	made
O	answer
O	Either
O	a
O	dead
O	man
O	or
O	the
O	mark
O	of
O	where
O	a
O	man
O	has
O	lain
O	hidden
O	thou
O	wilt
O	find
O	under
O	the
O	bracken
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	look
O	they
O	found
O	like
O	the
O	clap
O	of
O	a
O	hare
O	the
O	mark
O	of
O	where
O	a
O	man
O	had
O	lain
O	hidden
O	and
O	close
O	beside
O	the
O	javelin
O	that
O	was
O	driven
O	in
O	the
O	ground
O	there
O	lay
O	a
O	knife
O	Then
O	said
C	Naoise
O	Well
O	I
O	knew
O	that
C	Conor
O	would
O	set
O	a
O	spy
O	on
O	my
O	tracks
O	Come
O	with
O	me
O	now
C	Deirdrê
O	else
O	may
O	I
O	lose
O	thee
O	forever
O	And
O	with
O	a
O	glad
O	heart
C	Deirdrê
O	went
O	with
O	him
O	who
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	her
O	lord
O	and
C	Naoise
O	took
O	her
O	to
O	where
O	his
O	brothers
O	awaited
O	his
O	coming
O	To
C	Deirdrê
O	both
C	Ainle
O	and
C	Ardan
O	swiftly
O	gave
O	their
O	lifelong
O	allegiance
O	and
O	their
O	love
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	full
O	of
O	forebodings
O	for
O	her
O	and
O	for
C	Naoise
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	certain
O	wrath
O	of
C	Conor
O	the
O	king
O	Then
O	said
C	Naoise
O	Although
O	harm
O	should
O	come
O	for
O	her
O	dear
O	sake
O	I
O	am
O	willing
O	to
O	live
O	in
O	disgrace
O	for
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	my
O	days
O	And
C	Ardan
O	and
C	Ainle
O	made
O	answer
O	Of
O	a
O	certainty
O	evil
O	will
O	be
O	of
O	it
O	yet
O	though
O	there
O	be
O	thou
O	shalt
O	not
O	be
O	under
O	disgrace
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	we
O	shall
O	be
O	alive
O	We
O	will
O	go
O	with
O	her
O	to
O	another
O	country
O	There
O	is
O	not
O	in
O	Erin
O	a
O	king
O	who
O	will
O	not
O	bid
O	us
O	welcome
O	Then
O	did
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	decide
O	to
O	cross
O	the
O	Sea
O	of
O	Moyle
O	and
O	in
O	their
O	own
O	land
O	of
O	Alba
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	happy
O	sanctuary
O	That
O	night
O	they
O	fled
O	and
O	with
O	them
O	took
O	three
O	times
O	fifty
O	men
O	three
O	times
O	fifty
O	women
O	three
O	times
O	fifty
O	horses
O	and
O	three
O	times
O	fifty
O	greyhounds
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	looked
O	back
O	to
O	where
O	they
O	had
O	had
O	their
O	dwelling
O	they
O	saw
O	red
O	flames
O	against
O	the
O	deep
O	blue
O	sky
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	and
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	vengeance
O	of
C	Conor
O	had
O	already
O	begun
O	And
O	first
O	they
O	travelled
O	round
O	Erin
O	from
O	Essa
O	to
O	Beinn
O	Etair
O	and
O	then
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	black
O	galley
O	they
O	set
O	sail
O	and
C	Deirdrê
O	had
O	a
O	heart
O	light
O	as
O	the
O	as
O	the
O	men
O	pulled
O	at
O	the
O	long
O	oars
O	and
O	sang
O	together
O	a
O	rowing
O	song
O	and
O	she
O	leaned
O	on
O	the
O	strong
O	arm
O	of
C	Naoise
O	and
O	saw
O	the
O	blue
O	of
O	Erin
O	fading
O	into
O	nothingness
O	In
O	the
O	bay
O	of
O	Aros
O	on
O	the
O	eastern
O	shores
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	Mull
O	they
O	found
O	their
O	first
O	but
O	there
O	they
O	feared
O	treachery
O	from
O	a
O	lord
O	of
O	Appin
O	For
O	the
O	starry
O	eyes
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	were
O	swift
O	to
O	discern
O	evil
O	that
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	Thus
O	they
O	fared
O	onward
O	until
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	great
O	of
O	Etive
O	with
O	hills
O	around
O	it
O	and
O	Ben
O	Cruachan
O	its
O	head
O	in
O	mist
O	towering
O	above
O	it
O	like
O	a
O	watchman
O	placed
O	there
O	by
O	Time
O	to
O	wait
O	and
O	to
O	watch
O	over
O	the
O	people
O	of
O	those
O	silent
O	hills
O	and
O	lonely
O	glens
O	until
O	Time
O	should
O	give
O	place
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	Eternity
O	Joy
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	hearts
O	of
O	the
O	three
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	when
O	they
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	home
O	of
O	their
O	fathers
O	Usna
O	was
O	dead
O	but
O	beyond
O	the
O	Falls
O	of
O	Lora
O	was
O	still
O	the
O	great
O	dun
O	the
O	vitrified
O	fort
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	built
O	for
O	himself
O	and
O	for
O	those
O	who
O	should
O	follow
O	him
O	For
C	Deirdrê
O	then
O	began
O	a
O	time
O	of
O	perfect
O	happiness
C	Naoise
O	was
O	her
O	heart
O	but
O	very
O	dear
O	to
O	her
O	also
O	were
O	the
O	brothers
O	of
C	Naoise
O	and
O	each
O	of
O	the
O	three
O	vied
O	with
O	one
O	another
O	in
O	their
O	acts
O	of
O	tender
O	and
O	loving
O	service
O	Their
O	thrice
O	fifty
O	vassals
O	had
O	no
O	love
O	for
O	Alba
O	and
O	rejoiced
O	when
O	their
O	lord
C	Naoise
O	allowed
O	them
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	Erin
O	but
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	were
O	glad
O	to
O	have
O	none
O	to
O	come
O	between
O	them
O	and
O	their
O	serving
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	the
O	queen
O	of
O	their
O	hearts
O	Soon
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	know
O	well
O	each
O	little
O	bay
O	each
O	beach
O	and
O	each
O	little
O	lonely
O	glen
O	of
O	Loch
O	Etive
O	for
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	did
O	not
O	always
O	stay
O	at
O	the
O	dun
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	their
O	father
O	s
O	but
O	went
O	up
O	the
O	loch
O	At
O	various
O	spots
O	on
O	the
O	shores
O	of
O	Etive
O	they
O	had
O	camping
O	places
O	and
O	at
O	they
O	built
O	for
C	Deirdrê
O	a
O	sunny
O	bower
O	On
O	a
O	sloping
O	bank
O	above
O	the
O	waterfall
O	they
O	built
O	the
O	little
O	nest
O	thatched
O	with
O	the
O	royal
O	fern
O	of
O	the
O	mountains
O	the
O	red
O	clay
O	of
O	the
O	pools
O	and
O	with
O	soft
O	feathers
O	from
O	the
O	breasts
O	of
O	birds
O	There
O	she
O	could
O	sit
O	and
O	listen
O	to
O	the
O	murmur
O	and
O	drip
O	of
O	the
O	clear
O	water
O	over
O	the
O	mossy
O	boulders
O	the
O	splash
O	of
O	the
O	salmon
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	pools
O	and
O	see
O	the
O	distant
O	silver
O	of
O	the
O	loch
O	When
O	the
O	summer
O	sun
O	was
O	hot
O	on
O	the
O	bog
O	myrtle
O	and
O	heather
O	the
O	hum
O	of
O	the
O	wild
O	bees
O	would
O	lull
O	her
O	to
O	sleep
O	and
O	in
O	autumn
O	when
O	the
O	bracken
O	grew
O	red
O	and
O	golden
O	and
O	the
O	rowan
O	berries
O	grew
O	red
O	as
C	Deirdrê
O	s
O	lips
O	her
O	keen
O	eyes
O	would
O	see
O	the
O	stags
O	grazing
O	high
O	up
O	among
O	the
O	grey
O	boulders
O	of
O	the

O	awaiting
O	them
O	The
O	crow
O	of

O	of
O	the

O	the

O	of
O	the
O	wind
O	through
O	the

O	all
O	these

O	made

O	to
O	whom
O	all

O	were
O	dear
O	tu

O	The
O	tenderness
O	of

C	Deirdrê
O	so
O	runs
O	a
O	line
O	in
O	an
O	old
O	old
O	Gaelic
O	verse
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	always
O	of
O	her
O	tenderness
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	her
O	beauty
O	that
O	the

O	she
O	would
O	hunt
O	the

O	with

O	his
O	brothers
O	up
O	the

O	So
O	the
O	happy
O	days
O	passed
O	away
O	and
O	in
O	Erin
O	the
O	angry
O	heart
O	of
C	Conor
O	grew
O	yet
O	more
O	angry
O	when
O	tidings
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	of
O	the
O	happiness
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	and
O	the
O	Sons
O	of

O	Rumour
O	came
O	to

O	that
O	the

O	of

O	had
O	planned
O	to
O	come
O	against
C	Naoise
O	to

O	but
O	that

O	he
O	could
O	come
O	the
O	Sons
O	of

O	and
C	Deirdrê
O	had
O	sailed
O	yet
O	further
O	north
O	in

O	and
O	that
O	there

O	of
O	the

O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	fairest
O	of
O	women
O	And
O	ever
O	the
O	hatred
O	of
C	Conor
O	grew
O	until
O	one
O	day
O	there
O	came
O	into
O	his
O	mind
O	a
O	plan
O	of
O	evil
O	by
O	which
O	his
O	burning
O	thirst
O	for
O	revenge
O	might
O	be
O	handsomely
O	assuaged
O	He
O	made
O	therefore
O	a
O	great
O	feast
O	at
O	which
O	all
O	the
O	heroes
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Branch
O	were
O	present
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	them
O	every
O	honour
O	he
O	asked
O	them
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	content
O	As
O	one
O	man
O	Well
O	content
O	indeed
O	answered
O	they
O	And
O	that
O	is
O	what
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	said
O	the
O	king
O	Then
O	with
O	the
O	guile
O	of
O	fair
O	words
O	he
O	told
O	them
O	that
O	to
O	him
O	it
O	was
O	great
O	sorrow
O	that
O	the
O	three
O	heroes
O	with

O	the

O	heroes
O	of

O	from
O	me
O	the

C	Cuchulainn
O	and
C	Fergus
O	the
O	son
O	of

O	the

O	Then
O	secretly
O	he
O	called
O	Conall
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	what

O	would
O	do
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	sent
O	to

O	they
O	were
O	slain
O	when
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	Ultonians
O	And
O	Conall
O	made
O	answer
O	that
O	should
O	such
O	a
O	shameful
O	thing
O	come
O	to

O	he
O	would
O	slay
O	with
O	his
O	own
O	hand
O	all
O	the

O	dogs
O	Then
O	he
O	sent
O	for
C	Cuchulainn
O	and
O	to
O	him
O	put
O	the
O	same
O	question
O	and
O	in
O	angry
O	scorn
O	the
O	young
O	hero
O	replied
O	that

O	not
O	be
O	safe
O	from
O	his
O	vengeance
O	were

O	thou
O	didst
O	bear
O	me
O	no

O	said
C	Conor
O	and
O	black
O	was
O	his
O	brow
O	He
O	called
O	for
C	Fergus
O	then
O	and
C	Fergus
O	sore
O	troubled
O	made
O	answer
O	that

O	the
O	king
O	alone
O	would
O	be
O	held
O	sacred
O	from
O	his
O	vengeance
O	Then
C	Conor
O	gladly
O	gave
C	Fergus
O	command
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	Alba
O	as

O	It
O	had
O	come
O	from

O	East
O	in
O	years
O	far
O	beyond
O	the
O	memory
O	of

O	man
O	and
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	dearest
O	of
C	Conor
O	s
O	possessions
O	Thus
O	when
C	Ainle
O	and
C	Ardan
O	carried
O	off
O	the

O	in

O	after
O	the

O	that
O	was
O	the
O	loss
O	that
O	gave
O	the
O	king
O	the
O	greatest
O	bitterness
O	Now
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	as
C	Naoise
O	and
C	Deirdrê
O	were
O	sitting
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	their
O	dun
O	the

O	far
O	below
O	and
O	playing
O	chess
O	at
O	this
O	board
O	they
O	heard
O	a
O	shout
O	from
O	the
O	woods
O	down
O	by
O	the
O	shore
O	where
O	the
O	hazels
O	and
O	birches
O	grew
O	thick
O	That
O	is
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	of
O	Erin
O	said
C	Naoise
O	and
O	stopped
O	in
O	his
O	game
O	to
O	listen
O	But
C	Deirdrê
O	said
O	very
O	quickly
O	Not
O	so
O	It
O	is
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	a
O	Gael
O	of
O	Alba
O	Yet
O	so
O	she
O	spoke
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	try
O	to
O	deceive
O	her
O	own
O	heart
O	that
O	even
O	then
O	was
O	chilled
O	by
O	the
O	black
O	shadow
O	of
O	an
O	approaching
O	evil
O	Then
O	came
O	another
O	shout
O	and
O	yet
O	a
O	third
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	heard
O	the
O	third
O	shout
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	doubt
O	left
O	in
O	their
O	minds
O	for
O	they
O	all
O	knew
O	the
O	voice
O	for
O	that
O	of
C	Fergus
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	Rossa
O	the
O	Red
O	And
O	when
C	Ardan
O	hastened
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	harbour
O	to
O	greet
O	him
C	Deirdrê
O	confessed
O	to
C	Naoise
O	why
O	she
O	had
O	refused
O	at
O	first
O	to
O	own
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	voice
O	from
O	Erin
O	that
O	she
O	heard
O	I
O	saw
O	in
O	a
O	dream
O	last
O	night
O	she
O	said
O	three
O	birds
O	that
O	flew
O	hither
O	from
O	Emain
O	Macha
O	carrying
O	three
O	sips
O	of
O	honey
O	in
O	their
O	beaks
O	The
O	honey
O	they
O	left
O	with
O	us
O	but
O	took
O	away
O	three
O	sips
O	of
O	blood
O	And
C	Naoise
O	said
O	What
O	then
O	best
O	beloved
O	dost
O	thou
O	read
O	from
O	this
O	dream
O	of
O	thine
O	And
C	Deirdrê
O	said
O	I
O	read
O	that
C	Fergus
O	comes
O	from
C	Conor
O	with
O	honeyed
O	words
O	of
O	peace
O	but
O	behind
O	his
O	treacherous
O	words
O	lies
O	death
O	As
O	they
O	spake
C	Ardan
O	and
C	Fergus
O	and
O	his
O	following
O	climbed
O	up
O	the
O	height
O	where
O	the
O	and
O	the
O	heather
O	and
O	sweet
O	fern
O	yielded
O	their
O	sweetest
O	incense
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	wounded
O	under
O	their
O	firm
O	tread
O	And
O	when
C	Fergus
O	stood
O	before
C	Deirdrê
O	and
C	Naoise
O	the
O	man
O	of
O	her
O	heart
O	he
O	told
O	them
O	of
C	Conor
O	s
O	message
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	peace
O	and
O	the
O	glory
O	that
O	awaited
O	them
O	in
O	Erin
O	if
O	they
O	would
O	but
O	listen
O	to
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	welcome
O	that
O	he
O	brought
O	Then
O	said
C	Naoise
O	I
O	am
O	ready
O	But
O	his
O	eyes
O	dared
O	not
O	meet
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	his
O	queen
O	Knowest
O	thou
O	that
O	my
O	pledge
O	is
O	one
O	of
O	honour
O	asked
C	Fergus
O	I
O	know
O	it
O	well
O	said
C	Naoise
O	So
O	in
O	joyous
O	feasting
O	was
O	that
O	night
O	spent
O	and
O	only
O	over

O	of
C	Deirdrê

O	told
O	him
O	sadly
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	sold
O	his
O	honour
O	The
O	gloomy
O	forebodings
O	that
O	had
O	assailed
O	the
O	heart
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	ere
O	they
O	had
O	left
O	Loch
O	Etive
O	grew
O	ever
O	the
O	stronger
O	as
O	they
O	went
O	southwards
O	She
O	begged
C	Naoise
O	to
O	let
O	them
O	go
O	to
O	some
O	place
O	of
O	safety
O	and
O	there
O	wait
O	until
C	Fergus
O	had
O	fulfilled
O	his
O	geasa
O	and
O	could
O	rejoin
O	them
O	and
O	go
O	with
O	them
O	to
O	Emain
O	Macha
O	But
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	strong
O	in
O	the
O	knowledge
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	strength
O	and
O	simply
O	trustful
O	of
O	the
O	pledged
O	word
O	of
C	Conor
O	and
O	of
C	Fergus
O	laughed
O	at
O	her
O	fears
O	and
O	continued
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	Dreams
O	of
O	dread
O	portent
O	haunted
O	her
O	sleep
O	and
O	by
O	daytime
O	her
O	eyes
O	in
O	her
O	white
O	face
O	looked
O	like
O	violets
O	in
O	the
O	snow
O	She
O	saw
O	a
O	cloud
O	of
O	blood
O	always
O	hanging
O	over
O	the
O	beautiful
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	and
O	all
O	of
O	them
O	she
O	saw
O	and
C	Illann
O	the
O	Fair
O	with
O	their
O	heads
O	shorn
O	off
O	gory
O	and
O	awful
O	Yet
O	no
O	pleading
O	words
O	could
O	prevail
O	upon
C	Naoise
O	His
O	fate
O	drove
O	him
O	on
O	To
O	Emain
O	Macha
O	we
O	must
O	go
O	my
O	beloved
O	he
O	said
O	To
O	do
O	other
O	than
O	this
O	would
O	be
O	to
O	show
O	that
O	we
O	have
O	fear
O	and
O	fear
O	we
O	have
O	none
O	Thus
O	at
O	last
O	did
O	they
O	arrive
O	at
O	Emain
O	Macha
O	and
O	with
O	courteous
O	welcome
C	Conor
O	sent
O	them
O	word
O	that
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	the
O	heroes
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Branch
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	theirs
O	that
O	night
O	And
O	although
O	the
O	place
O	the
O	king
O	had
O	chosen
O	for
O	their
O	lodgment
O	confirmed
O	all
O	the
O	intuitions
O	and
O	forebodings
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	the
O	evening
O	was
O	spent
O	by
O	in
O	good
O	cheer
O	and
C	Deirdrê
O	had
O	the
O	joy
O	of
O	a
O	welcome
O	there
O	from
O	her
O	old
O	friend
C	Lavarcam
O	For
O	to
C	Lavarcam
C	Conor
O	had
O	said
O	I
O	would
O	have
O	thee
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	House
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Branch
O	and
O	bring
O	me
O	back
O	tidings
O	if
O	the
O	beauty
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	has
O	waned
O	or
O	if
O	she
O	is
O	still
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	of
O	all
O	women
O	And
O	when
C	Lavarcam
O	saw
O	her
O	whom
O	she
O	had
O	loved
O	as
O	a
O	little
O	child
O	playing
O	chess
O	with
O	her
O	husband
O	at
O	the
O	board
O	of
O	ivory
O	and
O	gold
O	she
O	knew
O	that
O	love
O	had
O	made
O	the
O	beauty
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	blossom
O	and
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	now
O	more
O	beautiful
O	than
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	any
O	man
O	or
O	woman
O	could
O	tell
O	Nor
O	was
O	it
O	possible
O	for
O	her
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	tool
O	for
C	Conor
O	when
O	she
O	looked
O	in
O	the
O	starry
O	eyes
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	and
O	so
O	she
O	poured
O	forth
O	warning
O	of
O	the
O	treachery
O	of
C	Conor
O	and
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	knew
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	truth
O	in
O	the
O	dreams
O	of
O	her
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	queen
O	of
O	their
O	hearts
O	And
O	even
O	as
C	Lavarcam
O	ceased
O	there
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	a
O	vision
O	such
O	as
O	that
O	of
C	Cathbad
O	the
O	Druid
O	on
O	the
O	night
O	of
O	her
O	birth
O	I
O	see
O	three
O	torches
O	quenched
O	this
O	night
O	she
O	said
O	And
O	these
O	three
O	torches
O	are
O	the
O	Three
O	Torches
O	of
O	Valour
O	among
O	the
O	Gael
O	and
O	their
O	names
O	are
O	the
O	names
O	of
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	And
O	more
O	bitter
O	still
O	is
O	this
O	sorrow
O	because
O	that
O	the
O	Red
O	Branch
O	shall
O	ultimately
O	perish
O	through
O	it
O	and
O	Uladh
O	itself
O	be
O	overthrown
O	and
O	blood
O	fall
O	this
O	way
O	and
O	that
O	as
O	the
O	whirled
O	rains
O	of
O	winter
O	Fiona
O	Macleod
O	Then
C	Lavarcam
O	went
O	her
O	way
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	at
O	Emain
O	Macha
O	and
O	told
C	Conor
O	that
O	the
O	cruel
O	winds
O	and
O	snows
O	of
O	Alba
O	had
O	robbed
C	Deirdrê
O	of
O	all
O	her
O	loveliness
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	no
O	more
O	a
O	thing
O	to
O	be
O	desired
O	But
C	Naoise
O	had
O	said
O	to
C	Deirdrê
O	when
O	she
O	foretold
O	his
O	doom
O	Better
O	to
O	die
O	for
O	thee
O	and
O	for
O	thy
O	deathless
O	beauty
O	than
O	to
O	have
O	lived
O	without
O	knowledge
O	of
O	thee
O	and
O	thy
O	love
O	and
O	it
O	may
O	have
O	been
O	that
O	some
O	memory
O	of
O	the
O	face
O	of
C	Deirdrê
O	when
O	she
O	heard
O	these
O	words
O	dwelt
O	in
O	the
O	eyes
O	of
C	Lavarcam
O	and
O	put
O	quick
O	suspicion
O	into
O	the
O	evil
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	For
O	when
C	Lavarcam
O	had
O	gone
O	forth
O	well
O	pleased
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	saved
O	her
O	darling
C	Conor
O	sent
O	a
O	spy
O	a
O	man
O	whose
O	father
O	and
O	three
O	brothers
O	had
O	fallen
O	in
O	battle
O	under
O	the
O	sword
O	of
C	Naoise
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	see
C	Deirdrê
O	and
O	confirm
O	or
O	contradict
O	the
O	report
O	of
C	Lavarcam
O	And
O	when
O	this
O	man
O	reached
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Branch
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	had
O	been
O	put
O	on
O	their
O	guard
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	doors
O	and
O	windows
O	were
O	barred
O	Thus
O	he
O	climbed
O	to
O	a
O	narrow
O	upper
O	window
O	and
O	peered
O	in
O	There
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	couches
O	the
O	of
O	ivory
O	and
O	gold
O	between
O	them
O	were
C	Naoise
O	and
C	Deirdrê
O	So
O	beautiful
O	were
O	they
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	as
O	the
O	deathless
O	gods
O	and
O	as
O	they
O	played
O	that
O	last
O	game
O	of
O	their
O	lives
O	they
O	spoke
O	together
O	in
O	low
O	voices
O	of
O	love
O	that
O	sounded
O	like
O	the
O	melody
O	of
O	a
O	harp
O	in
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	a
O	master
O	player
C	Deirdrê
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	peering
O	face
O	with
O	the
O	eyes
O	that
O	gloated
O	on
O	her
O	loveliness
O	No
O	word
O	said
O	she
O	but
O	silently
O	made
O	the
O	gaze
O	of
C	Naoise
O	follow
O	her
O	own
O	even
O	as
O	he
O	held
O	a
O	golden
O	chessman
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	pondering
O	a
O	move
O	Swift
O	as
O	a
O	stone
O	from
O	a
O	sling
O	the
O	chessman
O	was
O	hurled
O	and
O	the
O	man
O	fell
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	with
O	his
O	eyeball
O	smashed
O	and
O	found
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	Emain
O	Macha
O	as
O	best
O	he
O	could
O	shaking
O	with
O	agony
O	and
O	snarling
O	with
O	lust
O	for
O	revenge
O	Vividly
O	he
O	painted
O	for
O	the
O	king
O	the
O	picture
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	woman
O	on
O	earth
O	as
O	she
O	played
O	at
O	the
O	that
O	he
O	held
O	so
O	dear
O	and
O	the
O	rage
O	of
C	Conor
O	that
O	had
O	smouldered
O	ever
O	since
O	that
O	day
O	when
O	he
O	learned
O	that
C	Naoise
O	had
O	stolen
C	Deirdrê
O	from
O	him
O	flamed
O	up
O	into
O	madness
O	With
O	a
O	bellow
O	like
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	wounded
O	bull
O	he
O	called
O	upon
O	the
O	Ultonians
O	to
O	come
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	House
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Branch
O	to
O	burn
O	it
O	down
O	and
O	to
O	slay
O	all
O	those
O	within
O	it
O	with
O	the
O	sword
O	save
O	only
C	Deirdrê
O	who
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	saved
O	for
O	a
O	more
O	cruel
O	fate
O	In
O	the
O	House
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Branch
C	Deirdrê
O	and
O	the
O	three
O	brothers
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	sons
O	of
C	Fergus
O	heard
O	the
O	shouts
O	of
O	the
O	Ultonians
O	and
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	storm
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	break
O	But
O	calm
O	as
O	rocks
O	against
O	which
O	the
O	angry
O	waves
O	beat
O	themselves
O	in
O	vain
O	sat
O	those
O	whose
O	portion
O	at
O	dawn
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	cruel
O	death
O	And
C	Naoise
O	and
C	Ainle
O	played
O	chess
O	with
O	hands
O	that
O	did
O	not
O	tremble
O	At
O	the
O	first
O	onslaught
O	Buinne
O	the
O	Red
O	son
O	of
C	Fergus
O	sallied
O	forth
O	quenched
O	the
O	flames
O	and
O	drove
O	back
O	the
O	Ultonians
O	with
O	great
O	slaughter
O	But
C	Conor
O	called
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	parley
O	and
O	offered
O	him
O	a
O	bribe
O	of
O	land
O	and
O	Buinne
O	treacherous
O	son
O	of
O	a
O	treacherous
O	father
O	went
O	over
O	to
O	the
O	enemy
O	His
O	brother
C	Illann
O	the
O	Fair
O	filled
O	with
O	shame
O	did
O	what
O	he
O	could
O	to
O	make
O	amends
O	He
O	went
O	forth
O	and
O	many
O	hundreds
O	of
O	the
O	besieging
O	army
O	fell
O	before
O	him
O	ere
O	death
O	stayed
O	his
O	loyal
O	hand
O	At
O	his
O	death
O	the
O	Ultonians
O	again
O	fired
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	first
C	Ardan
O	and
O	then
C	Ainle
O	left
O	their
O	chess
O	for
O	a
O	fiercer
O	game
O	and
O	glutted
O	their
O	sword
O	blades
O	with
O	the
O	blood
O	of
O	their
O	enemies
O	Last
O	came
O	the
O	turn
O	of
C	Naoise
O	He
O	kissed
C	Deirdrê
O	and
O	drank
O	a
O	drink
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	against
O	the
O	men
O	of
C	Conor
O	and
O	where
O	his
O	brothers
O	had
O	slain
O	hundreds
O	a
O	thousand
O	fell
O	before
O	his
O	sword
O	Then
O	fear
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	heart
O	of
C	Conor
O	for
O	he
O	foresaw
O	that
O	against
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	no
O	man
O	could
O	prevail
O	save
O	by
O	magic
O	Thus
O	he
O	sent
O	for
C	Cathbad
O	the
O	Druid
O	who
O	was
O	even
O	then
O	very
O	near
O	death
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	was
O	carried
O	on
O	a
O	litter
O	to
O	the
O	House
O	of
O	the
O	Red
O	Branch
O	from
O	which
O	the
O	flames
O	were
O	leaping
O	and
O	before
O	which
O	the
O	dead
O	lay
O	in
O	heaps
O	And
C	Conor
O	besought
O	him
O	to
O	help
O	him
O	to
O	subdue
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	ere
O	they
O	should
O	have
O	slain
O	every
O	Ultonian
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	So
O	by
O	his
O	magic
C	Cathbad
O	raised
O	a
O	hedge
O	of
O	spears
O	round
O	the
O	house
O	But
C	Naoise
C	Ardan
O	and
C	Ainle
O	with
C	Deirdrê
O	in
O	their
O	centre
O	sheltered
O	by
O	their
O	shields
O	burst
O	suddenly
O	forth
O	from
O	the
O	blazing
O	house
O	and
O	cut
O	a
O	way
O	for
O	themselves
O	through
O	the
O	hedge
O	as
O	though
O	they
O	sheared
O	green
O	wheat
O	And
O	laughing
O	aloud
O	they
O	took
O	a
O	terrible
O	toll
O	of
O	lives
O	from
O	the
O	Ultonians
O	who
O	would
O	have
O	withstood
O	them
O	Then
O	again
O	the
O	Druid
O	put
O	forth
O	his
O	power
O	and
O	a
O	noise
O	like
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	many
O	waters
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	ears
O	of
O	all
O	who
O	were
O	there
O	So
O	suddenly
O	the
O	magic
O	flood
O	arose
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	chance
O	of
O	escape
O	for
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	Higher
O	it
O	mounted
O	ever
O	higher
O	and
C	Naoise
O	held
C	Deirdrê
O	on
O	his
O	shoulder
O	and
O	smiled
O	up
O	in
O	her
O	eyes
O	as
O	the
O	water
O	rose
O	past
O	his
O	middle
O	Then
O	suddenly
O	as
O	it
O	had
O	come
O	the
O	flood
O	abated
O	and
O	all
O	was
O	well
O	with
O	the
O	Ultonians
O	who
O	had
O	sheltered
O	on
O	a
O	rising
O	ground
O	But
O	the
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	found
O	themselves
O	entrapped
O	in
O	a
O	morass
O	where
O	the
O	water
O	had
O	been
C	Conor
O	seeing
O	them
O	in
O	his
O	hands
O	at
O	last
O	bade
O	some
O	of
O	his
O	warriors
O	go
O	and
O	take
O	them
O	But
O	for
O	shame
O	no
O	Ultonian
O	would
O	go
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	from
O	Norway
O	who
O	walked
O	along
O	a
O	dry
O	spit
O	of
O	land
O	to
O	where
O	they
O	stood
O	sunk
O	deep
O	in
O	the
O	green
O	bog
O	Slay
O	me
O	first
O	called
C	Ardan
O	as
O	he
O	drew
O	near
O	sword
O	in
O	hand
O	I
O	am
O	the
O	youngest
O	and
O	who
O	knows
O	my
O	death
O	may
O	change
O	the
O	tides
O	of
O	fate
O	And
C	Ainle
O	also
O	craved
O	that
O	death
O	might
O	be
O	dealt
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	first
O	But
C	Naoise
O	held
O	out
O	his
O	own
O	sword
O	The
O	Retaliator
O	to
O	the
O	executioner
O	Mannanan
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	Lîr
O	gave
O	me
O	my
O	good
O	sword
O	he
O	said
O	With
O	it
O	strike
O	my
O	dear
O	brothers
O	and
O	me
O	one
O	blow
O	only
O	as
O	we
O	stand
O	here
O	like
O	three
O	trees
O	planted
O	in
O	the
O	soil
O	Then
O	shall
O	none
O	of
O	us
O	know
O	the
O	grief
O	and
O	shame
O	of
O	seeing
O	the
O	other
O	beheaded
O	And
O	because
O	it
O	was
O	hard
O	for
O	any
O	man
O	to
O	disobey
O	the
O	command
O	of
C	Naoise
O	a
O	king
O	of
O	men
O	the
O	Norseman
O	reached
O	out
O	his
O	hand
O	for
O	the
O	sword
O	But
C	Deirdrê
O	sprang
O	from
O	the
O	shoulder
O	of
C	Naoise
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	killed
O	the
O	man
O	ere
O	he
O	struck
O	Roughly
O	he
O	threw
O	her
O	aside
O	and
O	with
O	one
O	blow
O	he
O	shore
O	off
O	the
O	heads
O	of
O	the
O	three
O	greatest
O	heroes
O	of
O	Alba
O	For
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	stillness
O	there
O	like
O	the
O	silence
O	before
O	the
O	coming
O	of
O	a
O	storm
O	And
O	then
O	all
O	who
O	had
O	beheld
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	fair
O	and
O	noble
O	Sons
O	of
O	Usna
O	broke
O	into
O	great
O	lamentation
O	Only
C	Conor
O	stood
O	silent
O	gazing
O	at
O	the
O	havoc
O	he
O	had
O	wrought
O	To
C	Cuchulainn
O	the
O	mighty
O	champion
O	a
O	good
O	man
O	and
O	a
O	true
C	Deirdrê
O	fled
O	and
O	begged
O	him
O	to
O	protect
O	her
O	for
O	the
O	little
O	span
O	of
O	life
O	that
O	she
O	knew
O	yet
O	remained
O	to
O	her
O	And
O	with
O	him
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	head
O	of
C	Naoise
O	lay
O	and
O	tenderly
O	she
O	cleansed
O	it
O	from
O	blood
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	stains
O	of
O	strife
O	and
O	stress
O	and
O	smoothed
O	the
O	hair
O	that
O	was
O	black
O	as
O	a
O	raven
O	s
O	wing
O	and
O	kissed
O	the
O	cold
O	lips
O	again
O	and
O	again
O	And
O	as
O	she
O	held
O	it
O	against
O	her
O	white
O	breast
O	as
O	a
O	mother
O	holds
O	a
O	little
O	child
O	she
O	chanted
O	for
C	Naoise
O	her
O	heart
O	and
O	for
O	his
O	brothers
O	a
O	lament
O	that
O	still
O	lives
O	in
O	the

O	of

O	honour
O	that

O	Or

O	the

O	better
O	than

O	truth
O	Of
O	a

O	ye
O	must
O	be
O	glad
O	who

O	at
O	the
O	bidding
O	of
C	Cuchulainn
O	the
O	Ultonian
O	three
O	graves
O	were
O	dug
O	for
O	the

O	but
O	the
O	grave
O	of
C	Naoise
O	was
O	made
O	wider
O	than

O	and
O	when

O	was
O	placed
O	in

O	murmured
O	to

O	Death
O	took
O	her
O	and

O	they
O	were
O	buried
O	At

O	a

O	of

O	on
O	a
O	journey
O	and
O	being

O	stopped
O	one
O	day
O	at
O	the

O	to

O	The

O	was
O	particularly
O	neat
O	and
O	clean
O	and
O	in
O	good
O	order
O	the
O	ploughman
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	had
O	the
O	most
O	sorrowful
O	air
O	so
O	he
O	questioned
O	them
O	on
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	their
O	melancholy
O	and
O	learned
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	very
O	miserable
O	because
O	they
O	had
O	no
O	children
O	The
O	poor
O	woman
O	declared
O	with
O	tears
O	in
O	her
O	eyes
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	be
O	the
O	happiest

O	in
O	the

O	if

C	Merlin
O	was

O	of
O	a

O	no
O	bigger

O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	returned
O	home
O	he
O	sent
O	for
O	the
C	queen
O	of
O	the
O	fairies
O	with
O	whom
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	intimate
O	and
O	related
O	to

O	the
O	desire
O	of
O	the

O	exceedingly
O	and
O	declared
O	their
O	wish
O	should
O	be
O	speedily
O	granted
O	Accordingly
O	the
O	ploughman
O	s
O	wife
O	had
O	a

O	he
O	was
O	often
O	brought

O	difficulties

O	in
O	the

O	the

O	alive
O	At
O	the

O	was

O	Her

O	when

O	the

O	fell
O	sick

O	died
O	and
O	her
O	daughter
O	was
O	almost
O	So
O	was
O	her
O	husband
O	for
O	a
O	year
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	comfort
O	himself
O	by
O	hunting
O	One
O	day
O	after
O	a
O	long

C	Grognon
O	She
O	informed

O	went
O	out
O	to

O	him
O	and
O	received
O	him
O	most
O	respectfully
O	As
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	hot
O	with

O	she
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	coolest
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	which
O	was
O	a

O	elegantly
O	furnished
O	where
O	there
O	were
O	two

O	arranged
O	in
O	long
O	rows
O	Madam
O	are

O	all

O	inquired
O	the
C	king
O	Yes

O	if
O	you
O	will
O	condescend
O	to

O	Which
O	wine
O	do
O	you
O	prefer
O	canary
O	hermitage
O	champagne
O	and
O	she
O	ran
O	over
O	a
O	long
O	list
O	out
O	of
O	which
O	his
O	majesty
O	made
O	his
O	choice
C	Grognon
O	took
O	a
O	little
O	hammer
O	and
O	struck
O	toc
O	toc
O	on
O	the

O	from

O	rolled
O	out
O	a

O	Nay
O	what

O	this
O	said
O	she
O	smiling
O	and
O	passed
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	next
O	from
O	which
O	when
O	she
O	tapped
O	it
O	out
O	poured
O	a

O	coins
O	I
O	never

O	came
O	a
O	heap
O	of
O	pearls
O	and
O	diamonds
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	floor
O	of
O	the
O	cave
O	was
O	strewn
O	with
O	them
O	Sire
O	she
O	exclaimed
O	some
O	one
O	has
O	robbed
O	me
O	of
O	my
O	good
O	wine
O	and
O	put
O	this
O	rubbish
O	in
O	its
O	place
O	Rubbish
O	madam
O	Why

O	if

O	make
O	me
O	your
C	queen
O	The
C	king
O	who
O	was
O	a

O	should
O	have
O	the

C	Graciosa
O	entirely
O	in
O	her
O	own
O	rule
O	and

O	So
O	he
O	and

O	so
O	much
O	good
O	advice
O	that

O	looking
O	round
O	vainly
O	for
C	Prince
C	Percinet
O	The

O	knights
O	of
O	the

O	to

O	one
O	who
O	carried
O	a
O	little
O	box
O	adorned
O	with
O	diamonds
O	and
O	proclaimed
O	aloud
O	that
C	Grognon
O	was
O	the

C	Grognon
O	wild
O	with
O	anger
O	commanded

O	to

O	away
C	Graciosa
O	in
O	solitude
O	and

O	groped
O	through
O	the

O	sometimes
O	falling

O	than

O	two

O	received
O	the

O	with

O	of
O	glittering
O	with

O	where
O	to

O	amazement
C	Graciosa
O	saw
O	the

O	even
O	down
O	to
O	this

O	painted
O	on

O	you

O	Yes
O	and
O	I
O	wish
O	to

O	he
O	tenderly
O	whereupon
C	Graciosa
O	cast
O	down
O	her
O	eyes
O	She
O	was
O	only
O	too
O	happy
O	and
O	afraid
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	learn
O	to
O	love
O	the
O	too
O	much
O	She
O	spent
O	eight
O	days
O	in
O	his
O	palace
O	days
O	full
O	of
O	every
O	enjoyment
O	and
C	Percinet
O	tried
O	all
O	the
O	arguments
O	he
O	could
O	think
O	of
O	to
O	induce
O	her
O	to
O	marry
O	him
O	and
O	remain
O	there
O	for
O	ever
O	But
O	the
O	good
O	and
O	gentle
C	Graciosa
O	remembered
O	her
O	father
O	who
O	was
O	once
O	so
O	kind
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	she
O	preferred
O	rather
O	to
O	suffer
O	than
O	to
O	be
O	wanting
O	in
O	duty
O	She
O	entreated
C	Percinet
O	to
O	use
O	his
O	fairy
O	power
O	to
O	send
O	her
O	home
O	again
O	and
O	meantime
O	to
O	tell
O	her
O	what
O	had
O	become
O	of
O	her
O	father
O	Come
O	with
O	me
O	into
O	the
O	great
O	tower
O	there
O	and
O	you
O	shall
O	see
O	for
O	yourself
O	Thereupon
O	he
O	took
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	tower
O	prodigiously
O	high
O	put
O	her
O	little
O	finger
O	to
O	his
O	lips
O	and
O	her
O	foot
O	upon
O	his
O	foot
O	Then
O	he
O	bade
O	her
O	look
O	and
O	she
O	saw
O	as
O	hi
O	a
O	picture
O	or
O	as
O	in
O	a
O	play
O	upon
O	the
O	stage
O	the
C	king
O	and
C	Grognon
O	sitting
O	together
O	on
O	their
O	throne
O	The
O	latter
O	was
O	telling
O	how
C	Graciosa
O	had
O	hanged
O	herself
O	in
O	a
O	cave
O	She
O	will
O	not
O	be
O	much
O	loss
O	sire
O	and
O	as
O	when
O	dead
O	she
O	was
O	far
O	too
O	frightful
O	for
O	you
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	I
O	have
O	given
O	orders
O	to
O	bury
O	her
O	at
O	once
O	She
O	might
O	well
O	say
O	that
O	for
O	she
O	had
O	had
O	a
O	large
O	faggot
O	put
O	into
O	a
O	coffin
O	and
O	sealed
O	up
O	the
C	king
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	nation
O	mourned
O	over
O	it
O	and
O	now
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	no
O	more
O	they
O	declared
O	there
O	never
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	sweet
O	creature
O	as
O	the
O	lost
O	princess
O	The
O	sight
O	of
O	her
O	father
O	s
O	grief
O	quite
O	overcame
C	Graciosa
O	Oh
C	Percinet
O	she
O	cried
O	my
O	father
O	believes
O	me
O	dead
O	If
O	you
O	love
O	me
O	take
O	me
O	home
O	The
O	prince
O	consented
O	though
O	very
O	sorrowfully
O	saying
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	as
O	cruel

O	in
O	his
O	chariot
O	drawn
O	by
O	four
O	white
O	stags
O	As
O	they

O	they
O	heard
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	and
C	Graciosa
O	saw
O	the
O	palace
O	all
O	falling
O	to
O	pieces
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	crash
O	What

O	she
O	cried
O	terrified
O	Princess
O	my

O	which
O	you

O	Prince
O	you
O	are
O	angry

O	said
C	Graciosa
O	sorrowfully
O	only
O	she
O	knew
O	well
O	that
O	she
O	suffered
O	quite
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	he
O	did
O	in
O	thus
O	departing
O	and
O	quitting
O	him
O	Arrived
O	in
O	her
O	father
O	s
O	presence
O	she
O	had
O	great
O	difficulty
O	in
O	persuading
O	him
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	ghost
O	until
O	the
O	coffin
O	with
O	the
O	faggot
O	inside
O	it
O	was
O	taken
O	up
O	and
C	Grognon
O	s
O	malice
O	discovered
O	But
O	even
O	then
O	the
C	king
O	was
O	so
O	weak
O	a
O	man
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	soon
O	made
O	him
O	believe
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	cheated
O	that
O	the
O	princess
O	was
O	really
O	dead
O	and
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	a
O	false
C	Graciosa
O	Without

O	he
O	abandoned

C	Grognon
O	transported
O	with
O	joy
O	dragged
O	her
O	to
O	a
O	dark
O	prison
O	took
O	away
O	her

O	hopeless
C	Graciosa
O	dared
O	not
O	now
O	call
O	upon
C	Percinet
O	she
O	doubted
O	if
O	he
O	still
O	loved
O	her
O	enough
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	her
O	aid
O	Meantime
C	Grognon
O	had
O	sent
O	for
O	a
O	fairy
O	who
O	was
O	scarcely
O	less
O	malicious
O	than
O	herself
O	I
O	have
O	here
O	said
O	she
O	a
O	little
O	wretch
O	of
O	a
O	girl
O	for
O	whom
O	I
O	wish
O	to
O	find
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	difficult
O	tasks
O	pray
O	assist
O	me
O	in
O	giving
O	her
O	a
O	new
O	one
O	every
O	day
O	The
O	fairy
O	promised
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	soon
O	brought
O	a
O	skein
O	as
O	thick
O	as
O	four
O	persons
O	yet
O	composed
O	of
O	thread
O	so
O	fine
O	that
O	it
O	broke
O	if
O	you
O	only
O	blew
O	upon
O	it
O	and
O	so
O	tangled
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	neither
O	beginning
O	nor
O	end
C	Grognon
O	delighted
O	sent
O	for
O	her
O	poor
O	prisoner
O	There
O	miss
O	teach
O	your
O	clumsy
O	fingers
O	to
O	unwind
O	this
O	skein
O	and
O	if
O	you
O	break
O	a
O	single
O	thread
O	I
O	will
O	flay
O	you
O	alive
O	Begin
O	when
O	you
O	like
O	but
O	you
O	must
O	finish
O	at
O	sunset
O	or
O	it
O	will
O	be
O	the
O	worse
O	for
O	you
O	Then
O	she
O	sent
O	her
O	to
O	her
O	miserable
O	cell
O	and
O	the
O	door
C	Graciosa
O	stood
O	dismayed
O	turning
O	the
O	skein
O	over
O	and
O	over
O	and
O	breaking
O	hundreds
O	of
O	threads
O	each
O	time
O	Ah
C	Percinet
O	she
O	cried
O	in
O	despair
O	come
O	and
O	help
O	me
O	or
O	at
O	least
O	receive
O	my
O	last
O	farewell
O	Immediately
C	Percinet
O	stood
O	beside
O	her
O	having
O	entered
O	the
O	cell
O	as
O	easily
O	as
O	if
O	he

O	pocket
O	Behold

O	princess
O	ready
O	to

O	you
O	even
O	though

O	forsook
O	me
O	He
O	touched
O	the
O	skein
O	with
O	his
O	wand
O	and
O	it
O	untangled
O	itself
O	and
O	wound
O	itself
O	up
O	in
O	perfect
O	order
O	Do
O	you
O	wish
O	anything
O	more
O	madam
O	asked
O	he
O	coldly
C	Percinet
C	Percinet
O	do
O	not
O	reproach
O	me
O	I

O	happy
O	But
O	she
O	said
O	nothing
O	and
O	the

O	At
O	sunset
C	Grognon
O	eagerly
O	came
O	to

O	found
C	Graciosa
O	smiling

O	all
O	done
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	complaint
O	to
O	make
O	yet
C	Grognon
O	exclaimed
O	that
O	the
O	skein
O	was
O	dirty
O	and
O	boxed
O	the
O	princess
O	s
O	ears
O	till
O	her
O	rosy
O	cheeks
O	turned
O	yellow
O	and
O	blue
O	Then
O	she
O	left

O	Find
O	me
O	by
O	something
O	absolutely
O	impossible
O	for

O	to
O	do
O	The
O	fairy
O	brought
O	a
O	great
O	basket
O	full
O	of

C	Grognon
O	arrived
O	she

O	at

O	she
O	promised
O	to
O	try
O	once
O	more
O	and
O	for
O	several
O	days
O	employed
O	all
O	her
O	industry
O	in
O	inventing
O	a
O	box
O	which
O	she
O	said
O	the
O	prisoner
O	must
O	be
O	forbidden
O	on
O	any
O	account
O	to
O	open
O	Then
O	added
O	the
O	cunning
O	fairy
O	of
O	course
O	being
O	such
O	a
O	disobedient
O	and
O	wicked
O	girl
O	as

O	will
O	satisfy
O	you
O	to
O	your

C	Grognon
O	took
O	the
O	box
O	and
O	commanded
C	Graciosa
O	to
O	carry
O	it
O	to
O	her
O	castle
O	and
O	set
O	it
O	on
O	a
O	certain
O	table
O	in
O	an
O	apartment
O	she
O	named
O	but
O	not
O	upon
O	any
O	account
O	to
O	open
O	it
O	or
O	examine
O	its
O	contents
C	Graciosa
O	departed
O	She
O	was
O	dressed
O	like
O	any
O	poor
O	peasant
O	in
O	a
O	cotton
O	gown
O	a
O	woollen
O	hood
O	and
O	wooden
O	shoes
O	yet
O	as
O	she
O	walked
O	along
O	people
O	took
O	her
O	for
O	a
C	queen
O	in
O	disguise
O	so
O	lovely
O	were
O	her
O	looks

O	being
O	weak
O	with
O	imprisonment
O	she
O	soon
O	grew
O	weary
O	and
O	sitting
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	wood
O	took
O	the
O	box
O	upon
O	her
O	lap
O	Suddenly
O	a
O	wonderful
O	desire
O	seized
O	her
O	to
O	open
O	it
O	I
O	will
O	take
O	nothing
O	out
O	I
O	will
O	touch
O	nothing
O	said
O	she
O	to
O	herself
O	but
O	I
O	must
O	see
O	what
O	is
O	inside
O	Without
O	reflecting
O	on
O	the
O	consequences
O	she
O	lifted
O	up
O	the
O	lid
O	and
O	instantly
O	there
O	jumped
O	out
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	little
O	men
O	and
O	little
O	women
O	carrying
O	little
O	tables
O	and
O	chairs
O	little
O	dishes
O	and
O	little
O	musical
O	instruments
O	The
O	whole
O	company
O	were
O	so
O	small
O	that
O	the
O	biggest
O	giant
O	among
O	them
O	was
O	scarcely
O	the
O	height
O	of
O	a
O	finger
O	They
O	leaped
O	into
O	the
O	green
O	meadow
O	separated
O	into
O	various
O	bands
O	and
O	began
O	dancing
O	and
O	singing
O	eating
O	and
O	drinking
O	to
C	Graciosa
O	s
O	wonder
O	and
O	delight
O	But
O	when
O	she
O	recollected
O	herself
O	and
O	wished
O	to
O	get
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	box
O	again
O	they
O	all
O	scampered
O	away
O	played
O	at
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	by
O	no
O	means
O	could
O	she
O	catch
O	a
O	single
O	one
O	Again
O	in
O	her
O	distress
O	she
O	called
O	upon
C	Percinet
O	and
O	again
O	he
O	appeared
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	single
O	touch
O	of
O	his
O	wand
O	sent
O	all
O	the
O	little
O	people
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	box
O	Then
O	in
O	his
O	chariot
O	drawn
O	by
O	stags
O	he
O	took
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	where
O	she
O	did
O	all
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	commanded
O	and
O	returned
O	in
O	safety
O	to
O	her
O	stepmother
O	who
O	was
O	more
O	furious
O	than
O	ever
O	If
O	a
O	fairy
O	could
O	be
O	strangled
C	Grognon
O	certainly
O	would
O	have
O	done
O	it
O	in
O	her
O	rage
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	resolved
O	to
O	ask
O	help
O	no
O	more
O	but
O	to
O	work
O	her
O	own
O	wicked
O	will
O	upon
C	Graciosa
O	She
O	caused
O	to
O	be
O	dug
O	a
O	large
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	garden
O	and
O	taking
O	the

O	there
O	showed

O	standing
O	at
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	pit
C	Grognon
O	pushed

O	in

O	fall
O	down
O	again
O	upon

O	her
O	alive
O	After

O	regret
O	me
O	a
O	little
O	While
O	she
O	spoke
O	she
O	saw
O	through
O	the
O	blank
O	darkness
O	a
O	glimmer
O	of
O	light
O	it
O	came
O	through
O	a
O	little
O	door
O	She
O	remembered
O	what
C	Percinet
O	had
O	said
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	never
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	fairy
O	palace
O	until
O	after
O	she
O	was
O	buried
O	Perhaps
O	this
O	final
O	cruelty
O	of
C	Grognon
O	would
O	be
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	her
O	sorrows
O	So
O	she
O	took
O	courage
O	crept
O	through
O	the
O	little
O	door
O	and
O	lo
O	she
O	came
O	out
O	into
O	a
O	beautiful
O	garden
O	with
O	long
O	alleys
O	and
O	Well
O	she
O	knew
O	it
O	and
O	well
O	she
O	knew
O	the
O	glitter
O	of
O	the
O	walls
O	And
O	there
O	at
O	the
O	stood
C	Percinet
O	and
O	the
C	queen
O	his
O	mother
O	and
O	the
O	princesses
O	his
O	sisters
O	Welcome
C	Graciosa
O	cried
O	they
O	all
O	and
C	Graciosa
O	after
O	all
O	her
O	sufferings
O	wept
O	for
O	joy
O	The
O	marriage
O	was
O	celebrated
O	with
O	great
O	splendour
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	fairies
O	for
O	a
O	thousand
O	leagues
O	round
O	attended
O	it
O	Some
O	came
O	in
O	chariots
O	drawn
O	by
O	dragons
O	or
O	swans
O	or
O	peacocks
O	some
O	were
O	mounted
O	upon
O	floating
O	clouds
O	or
O	globes
O	of
O	fire
O	Among
O	the
O	rest
O	appeared
O	the
O	very
O	fairy
O	who
O	had
O	assisted
C	Grognon
O	to
O	torment
C	Graciosa
O	When
O	she
O	discovered
O	that
C	Grognon
O	s
O	poor
O	prisoner
O	was
O	now
C	Prince
C	Percinet
O	s
O	bride
O	she
O	was
O	overwhelmed
O	with
O	confusion
O	and
O	entreated
O	her
O	to
O	forget
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	passed
O	because
O	she
O	really
O	was
O	ignorant
O	who
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	cruelly
O	afflicting
O	But
O	I
O	will
O	make
O	amends
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	evil
O	that
O	I
O	have
O	done
O	said
O	the
O	fairy
O	and
O	refusing
O	to
O	stay
O	for
O	the
O	she
O	remounted
O	her
O	chariot
O	drawn
O	by
O	two
O	terrible
O	serpents
O	and
O	flew
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	of
C	Graciosa
O	s
O	father
O	There
O	before
O	either
C	king
O	or
O	courtiers
O	or
O	could
O	stop
O	her
O	even
O	had
O	they
O	wished
O	to
O	do
O	it
O	which
O	remains
O	doubtful
O	she
O	came
O	behind
O	the
O	wicked
C	Grognon
O	and
O	twisted
O	her
O	neck
O	just
O	as
O	a
O	cook
O	does
O	a
O	fowl
O	So
C	Grognon
O	died
O	and
O	was
O	buried
O	and
O	nobody
O	was
O	particularly
O	sorry
O	for
O	the
O	same
O	In
O	the
O	reign
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	caliph
O	of
O	whom
O	we
O	have
O	already
O	heard
O	there
O	lived
O	at
O	Bagdad
O	a
O	poor
O	porter
O	called
C	Hindbad
O	One
O	day
O	when
O	the
O	weather
O	was
O	excessively
O	hot
O	he
O	was
O	employed
O	to
O	carry
O	a
O	heavy
O	burden
O	from
O	one
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	to
O	the
O	other
O	Being
O	much
O	fatigued
O	he
O	took
O	off
O	his
O	load
O	and
O	sat
O	upon
O	it
O	near
O	a
O	large
O	mansion
O	He
O	was
O	much
O	pleased
O	that
O	he
O	stopped
O	at
O	this
O	place
O	for
O	the
O	agreeable
O	smell
O	of
O	wood
O	of
O	aloes
O	and
O	of
O	pastils
O	that
O	came
O	from
O	the
O	house
O	mixing
O	with
O	the
O	scent
O	of
O	the
O	completely
O	perfumed
O	and
O	embalmed
O	the
O	air
O	Besides
O	he
O	heard
O	from
O	within
O	a
O	concert
O	of
O	instrumental
O	music
O	accompanied
O	with
O	the
O	harmonious
O	notes
O	of
O	nightingales
O	and
O	other
O	birds
O	This
O	charming
O	melody
O	and
O	the
O	smell
O	of
O	several
O	sorts
O	of
O	savory
O	dishes
O	made
O	the
O	porter
O	conclude
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	feast
O	with
O	great
O	rejoicings
O	within
O	He
O	went
O	to
O	some
O	of
O	the
C	servants
O	whom
O	he
O	saw
O	standing
O	at
O	the
O	gate
O	in
O	magnificent
O	apparel
O	and
O	asked
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	the
O	proprietor
O	How
O	replied
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	do
O	you
O	live
O	in
O	Bagdad
O	and
O	know
O	not
O	that
O	this

O	the
O	house
O	of
C	Sindbad
O	the
O	Sailor
O	that
O	famous
O	voyager
O	who
O	has
O	sailed
O	round
O	the
O	world
O	The
O	porter
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	eyes
O	to
O	heaven
O	and
O	said
O	loud
O	enough
O	to
O	be
O	heard
O	Almighty
O	Creator
O	of
O	all
O	things
O	consider
O	the
O	difference
O	between
C	Sindbad
O	and
O	me
O	I
O	am
O	every
O	day
O	exposed
O	to
O	fatigues
O	and
O	calamities
O	and
O	can
O	scarcely
O	get
O	coarse
O	for
O	myself
O	and
O	my
O	family
O	while
O	happy
C	Sindbad
O	expends
O	immense
O	riches
O	and
O	leads
O	a
O	life
O	of
O	continual
O	pleasure
O	What
O	has
O	he
O	done
O	to
O	obtain
O	from
O	Thee
O	a
O	lot
O	so
O	agreeable
O	And
O	what
O	have
O	I
O	done
O	to
O	deserve
O	one
O	so
O	wretched
O	While
O	the
O	porter
O	was
O	thus
O	indulging
O	his
O	melancholy
O	a
O	servant
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	taking
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	arm
O	bade
O	him
O	follow
O	him
O	for
C	Sindbad
O	his
O	master
O	wanted
O	to
O	speak
O	to
O	him
O	The
C	servants
O	brought
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	great
O	hall
O	where
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	people
O	sat
O	round
O	a
O	table
O	covered
O	with
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	savory
O	dishes
O	At
O	the
O	upper
O	end
O	sat
O	a
O	comely
O	venerable
O	gentleman
O	with
O	a
O	long
O	white
O	beard
O	and
O	behind
O	him
O	stood
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	officers
O	and
O	domestics
O	all
O	ready
O	to
O	attend
O	his
O	pleasure
O	This
O	person
O	was
C	Sindbad
C	Hindbad
O	whose
O	fear
O	was
O	increased
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	so
O	many
O	people
O	and
O	of
O	a
O	banquet
O	so
O	sumptuous
O	saluted
O	the
O	company
O	trembling
C	Sindbad
O	bade
O	him
O	draw
O	near
O	and
O	seating
O	him
O	at
O	his
O	right
O	hand
O	served
O	him
O	himself
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	excellent
O	wine
O	of
O	which
O	there
O	was
O	abundance
O	upon
O	the
O	sideboard
O	Now
C	Sindbad
O	had
O	heard
O	the
O	porter
O	complain
O	through
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	this
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	induced
O	him
O	to
O	have
O	him
O	brought
O	in
O	When
O	the
O	repast
O	was
O	over
C	Sindbad
O	addressed
O	his
O	conversation
O	to
C	Hindbad
O	and
O	inquired
O	his
O	name
O	and
O	employment
O	and
O	said
O	I
O	wish
O	to
O	hear
O	from
O	your
O	own
O	mouth
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	you
O	lately
O	said
O	in
O	the
O	street
O	At
O	this
O	request
C	Hindbad
O	hung
O	down
O	his
O	head
O	in
O	confusion
O	and
O	replied
O	My
O	lord
O	I
O	confess
O	that
O	my
O	fatigue
O	put
O	me
O	out
O	of
O	humor
O	and
O	occasioned
O	me
O	to
O	utter
O	some
O	indiscreet
O	words
O	which
O	I
O	beg
O	you
O	to
O	pardon
O	Do
O	not
O	think
O	I
O	am
O	so
O	unjust
O	resumed
C	Sindbad
O	as
O	to
O	resent
O	such
O	a
O	complaint
O	But
O	I
O	must
O	correct
O	your
O	error
O	concerning
O	myself
O	You
O	think
O	no
O	doubt
O	that
O	I
O	have
O	acquired
O	without
O	labor
O	and
O	trouble
O	the
O	ease
O	and
O	indulgence
O	which
O	I
O	now
O	enjoy
O	But
O	do
O	not
O	mistake
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	attain
O	to
O	this
O	happy
O	condition
O	without
O	enduring
O	for
O	several
O	years
O	more
O	trouble
O	of
O	body
O	and
O	mind
O	than
O	can
O	well
O	be
O	imagined
O	Yes
O	gentlemen
O	he
O	added
O	speaking
O	to
O	the
O	whole
O	company
O	I
O	assure
O	you
O	that
O	my
O	sufferings
O	have
O	been
O	of
O	a
O	nature
O	so
O	extraordinary
O	as
O	would
O	deprive
O	the
O	greatest
O	miser
O	of
O	his
O	love
O	of
O	riches
O	and
O	as
O	an
O	opportunity
O	now
O	offers
O	I
O	will
O	with
O	your
O	leave
O	relate
O	the
O	dangers
O	I
O	have
O	encountered
O	which
O	I
O	think
O	will
O	not
O	be
O	uninteresting
O	to
O	you
O	There
O	was
O	once
O	a
O	king
O	s
O	daughter
O	so
O	beautiful
O	that
O	they
O	named
O	her
O	the
C	Fair
C	One
C	with
C	Golden
C	Locks
O	These
O	golden
O	locks
O	were
O	the
O	most
O	remarkable
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	soft
O	and
O	fine
O	and
O	falling
O	in
O	long
O	waves
O	down
O	to
O	her
O	very
O	feet
O	She
O	wore
O	them
O	always
O	thus
O	loose
O	and
O	flowing
O	surmounted
O	with
O	a
O	wreath
O	of
O	flowers
O	and
O	though
O	such
O	long
O	hair
O	was
O	sometimes
O	rather
O	inconvenient
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	exceedingly
O	beautiful
O	shining
O	in
O	the
O	sun
O	like
O	ripples
O	of
O	molten
O	gold
O	that
O	everybody
O	agreed
O	she
O	fully
O	deserved
O	her
O	name
O	Now
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	young
C	king
O	of
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	country
O	very
O	handsome
O	very
O	rich
O	and
O	wanting
O	nothing
O	but
O	a
O	wife
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	happy
O	He
O	heard
O	so
O	much
O	of
O	the
O	various
O	perfections
O	of
O	the
C	Fair
C	One
C	with
C	Golden
C	Locks
O	that
O	at
O	last
O	without
O	even
O	seeing
O	her
O	he
O	fell
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	her
O	so
O	desperately
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	neither
O	eat
O	nor
O	drink
O	and
O	resolved
O	to
O	send
O	an
O	ambassador
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	demand
O	her
O	in
O	marriage
O	So
O	he
O	ordered
O	a
O	magnificent
O	equipage
O	more
O	than
O	a
O	hundred
O	horses
O	and
O	a
O	hundred
O	footmen
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	bring
O	back
O	to
O	him
O	the
C	Fair
C	One
C	with
C	Golden
C	Locks
O	who
O	he
O	never
O	doubted
O	would
O	be
O	only
O	too
O	happy
O	to
O	become
O	his
O	queen
O	Indeed
O	he
O	felt
O	so
O	sure
O	of
O	her
O	that
O	he
O	refurnished
O	the
O	whole
O	palace
O	and
O	had
O	made
O	by
O	all
O	the
O	dressmakers
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	dresses
O	enough
O	to
O	last
O	a
O	lady
O	for
O	a
O	lifetime
O	But
O	alas
O	when
O	the
O	ambassador
O	arrived
O	and
O	delivered
O	his
O	message
O	either
O	the
C	princess
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	bad
O	humor
O	or
O	the
O	offer
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	to
O	be
O	to
O	her
O	taste
O	for
O	she
O	returned
O	her
O	best
O	thanks
O	to
O	his
O	majesty
O	but
O	said
O	she
O	had
O	not
O	the
O	slightest
O	wish
O	or
O	intention
O	to
O	be
O	married
O	She
O	also
O	being
O	a
O	prudent
O	damsel
O	declined
O	receiving
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	presents
O	which
O	the
C	king
O	had
O	sent
O	her
O	except
O	that
O	not
O	quite
O	to
O	offend
O	his
O	majesty
O	she
O	retained
O	a
O	box
O	of
O	English
O	pins
O	which
O	were
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	of
O	considerable
O	value
O	When
O	the
O	ambassador
O	returned
O	alone
O	and
O	unsuccessful
O	all
O	the
O	court
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	affected
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	himself
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	might
O	Now
O	there
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	household
O	a
O	young
O	gentleman
O	named
C	Avenant
O	beautiful
O	as
O	the
O	sun
O	besides
O	being
O	at
O	once
O	so
O	amiable
O	and
O	so

O	The

O	This

O	for

O	few
O	days
O	during

O	he
O	did
O	not
O	cease
O	to
O	complain
O	aloud
O	and
O	to
O	call
O	upon

C	Avenant
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	once
O	so
O	much

O	of

O	it
O	and

C	Avenant
O	fearlessly

O	her
O	so
O	much
O	about
O	your

O	high
O	qualities
O	which
O	no

O	so
O	well
O	as
O	myself
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	persuaded
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	returned
O	with
O	me
O	I
O	believe
O	it
O	said
O	the
C	king
O	with
O	an
O	angry
O	look
O	at
O	those
O	who
O	had
O	spoken
O	ill
O	of
O	his
O	favourite
O	he
O	then
O	gave
C	Avenant
O	a
O	free
O	pardon
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	back
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	After
O	having
O	supplied
O	the

O	youth
O	with
O	as
O	much
O	supper
O	as

O	Very
O	well
O	please
O	your
O	majesty
O	replied
C	Avenant
O	cheerfully
O	I
O	will
O	depart
O	The
C	king
O	overjoyed
O	with
O	his
O	willingness
O	and
O	hopefulness
O	would
O	have
O	furnished
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	still
O	more
O	magnificent
O	equipage
O	and
O	suite
O	than
O	the
O	first
O	ambassador
O	but
C	Avenant
O	refused
O	to
O	take
O	anything
O	except
O	a
O	good
O	horse
O	to
O	ride
O	and
O	letters
O	of
O	introduction
O	to
O	the
C	princess
O	s
O	father
O	The
C	king
O	embraced
O	him
O	and
O	eagerly
O	saw
O	him
O	depart
O	It
O	was
O	on
O	a
O	Monday
O	morning
O	when
O	without
O	any
O	pomp
O	or
O	show
C	Avenant
O	thus
O	started
O	on
O	his
O	mission
O	He
O	rode
O	slowly
O	and
O	meditatively
O	pondering
O	over
O	every
O	possible
O	means
O	of
O	persuading
O	the
C	Fair
C	One
C	with
C	Golden
C	Locks
O	to
O	marry
O	the
C	king
O	but
O	even
O	after
O	several
O	days
O	journey
O	towards
O	her
O	country
O	no
O	clear
O	project
O	had
O	entered
O	into
O	his
O	mind
O	One
O	morning
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	started
O	at
O	break
O	of
O	day
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	meadow
O	with
O	a
O	stream
O	running
O	through
O	it
O	along
O	which
O	were
O	planted
O	willows
O	and
O	poplars
O	It
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	pleasant
O	rippling
O	stream
O	that
O	he
O	dismounted
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	its
O	banks
O	There
O	he
O	perceived
O	gasping
O	on
O	the
O	grass
O	a
O	large
O	golden
O	carp
O	which
O	in
O	leaping
O	too
O	far
O	after
O	gnats
O	had
O	thrown
O	itself
O	quite
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	and
O	now
O	lay
O	dying
O	on
O	the
O	greensward
C	Avenant
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	it
O	and
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	hungry
O	and
O	the
O	fish
O	was
O	very
O	fat
O	and
O	he
O	would
O	well
O	enough
O	have
O	liked
O	it
O	for
O	his
O	breakfast
O	still
O	he
O	lifted
O	it
O	gently
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	stream
O	No
O	sooner
O	had
O	the
O	carp
O	touched
O	the
O	fresh
O	cool
O	water
O	than
O	it
O	revived
O	and
O	swam
O	away
O	but
O	shortly
O	returning
O	it
O	spoke
O	to
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	water
O	in
O	this
O	wise
C	Avenant
O	I
O	thank
O	you
O	for
O	your
O	good
O	deed
O	I
O	was
O	dying
O	and
O	you
O	have
O	saved
O	me
O	I
O	will
O	recompense
O	you
O	for
O	this
O	one
O	day
O	After
O	this
O	pretty
O	little
O	speech
O	the
O	fish
O	popped
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	stream
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	carp
O	leaving
C	Avenant
O	very
O	much
O	astonished
O	as
O	was
O	natural
O	Another
O	day
O	he
O	met
O	with
O	a
O	raven
O	that
O	was
O	in
O	great
O	distress
O	being
O	pursued
O	by
O	an
O	eagle
O	which
O	would
O	have
O	swallowed
O	him
O	up
O	in
O	no
O	time
O	See
O	thought
C	Avenant
O	how
O	the
O	stronger
O	oppress
O	the
O	weaker
O	What
O	right
O	has
O	an
O	eagle
O	to
O	eat
O	up
O	a
O	raven
O	So
O	taking
O	his
O	bow
O	and
O	arrow
O	which
O	he
O	always
O	carried
O	he
O	shot
O	the
O	eagle
O	dead
O	and
O	the
O	raven
O	delighted
O	perched
O	in
O	safety
O	on
O	an
O	opposite
O	tree
C	Avenant
O	screeched
O	he
O	though
O	not
O	in
O	the
O	sweetest
O	voice
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	you
O	have
O	generously
O	succoured
O	me
O	a
O	poor
O	miserable
O	raven
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	ungrateful
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	recompense
O	you
O	one
O	day
O	Thank
O	you
O	said
C	Avenant
O	and
O	continued
O	his
O	road
O	Entering
O	in
O	a
O	thick
O	wood
O	so
O	dark
O	with
O	the
O	shadows
O	of
O	early
O	morning
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	scarcely
O	find
O	his
O	way
O	he
O	heard
O	an
C	owl
O	hooting
O	like
O	an
C	owl
O	in
O	great
O	tribulation
O	She
O	had
O	been
O	caught
O	by
O	the
O	nets
O	spread
O	by
O	birdcatchers
O	to
O	entrap
O	finches
O	larks
O	and
O	other
O	small
O	birds
O	What
O	a
O	pity
O	thought
C	Avenant
O	that
O	men
O	must
O	always
O	torment
O	poor
O	birds
O	and
O	beasts
O	who
O	have
O	done
O	them
O	no
O	harm
O	So
O	he
O	took
O	out
O	his
O	knife
O	cut
O	the
O	net
O	and
O	let
O	the
C	owl
O	go
O	free
O	She
O	went
O	sailing
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	but
O	immediately
O	returned
O	hovering
O	over
O	his
O	head
O	on
O	her
O	brown
O	wings
C	Avenant
O	said
O	she
O	at
O	daylight
O	the
O	birdcatchers
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	here
O	and
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	caught
O	and
O	killed
O	I
O	have
O	a
O	grateful
O	heart
O	I
O	will
O	recompense
O	you
O	one
O	day
O	These
O	were
O	the
O	three
O	principal
O	adventures
O	that
O	befell
C	Avenant
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	kingom
O	of
O	the
C	Fair
C	One
C	with
C	Golden
C	Locks
O	Arrived
O	there
O	he
O	dressed
O	himself
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	care
O	in
O	a
O	habit
O	of
O	silver
O	brocade
O	and
O	a
O	hat
O	adorned
O	with
O	plumes
O	of
O	scarlet
O	and
O	white
O	He
O	threw
O	over
O	all
O	a
O	rich
O	mantle
O	and
O	carried
O	a
O	little
O	basket
O	in
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	lovely
O	little
C	dog
O	an
O	offering
O	of
O	respect
O	to
O	the
C	princess
O	With
O	this
O	he
O	presented
O	himself
O	at
O	the
O	where
O	even
O	though
O	he
O	came
O	alone
O	his
O	mien
O	was
O	so
O	dignified
O	and
O	graceful
O	so
O	altogether
O	charming
O	that
O	every
O	one
O	did
O	him
O	reverence
O	and
O	was
O	eager
O	to
O	run
O	and
O	tell
O	the
C	Fair
C	One
C	with
C	Golden
C	Locks
O	that
C	Avenant
O	another
O	ambassador
O	from
O	the
C	king
O	her
O	suitor
O	awaited
O	an
O	audience
C	Avenant
O	repeated
O	the
C	princess
O	That
O	is
O	a
O	pretty
O	name
O	perhaps
O	the
O	youth
O	is
O	pretty
O	too
O	So
O	beautiful
O	said
O	the
O	ladies
O	of
O	honour
O	that
O	while
O	he
O	stood
O	under
O	the
O	we
O	could
O	do
O	nothing
O	but
O	look
O	at
O	him
O	How
O	silly
O	of
O	you
O	sharply
O	said
O	the
C	princess
O	But
O	she
O	desired
O	them
O	to
O	bring
O	her
O	robe
O	of
O	blue
O	satin
O	to
O	comb
O	out
O	her
O	long
O	hair
O	and
O	adorn
O	it
O	with
O	the
O	freshest
O	garland
O	of
O	flowers
O	to
O	give
O	her
O	her
O	shoes
O	and
O	her
O	fan
O	Also
O	added
O	she
O	take
O	care
O	that
O	my
O	is
O	well
O	swept
O	and
O	my
O	throne
O	well
O	dusted
O	I
O	wish
O	in
O	everything
O	to
O	appear
O	as
O	becomes
O	the
C	Fair
C	One
C	with
C	Golden
C	Locks
O	This
O	done
O	she
O	seated
O	herself
O	on
O	her
O	throne
O	of
O	ivory
O	and
O	ebony
O	and
O	gave
O	orders
O	for
O	her
O	musicians
O	to
O	play
O	but
O	softly
O	so
O	as
O	not
O	to
O	disturb
O	conversation
O	Thus
O	shining
O	in
O	all
O	her
O	beauty
O	she
O	admitted
C	Avenant
O	to
O	her
O	presence
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	dazzled

O	Very
O	well

O	him
O	not
O	to

O	but
O	in

C	Avenant
O	armed
O	himself
O	and
O	started
O	carrying
O	his

O	While

C	Avenant
O	smiled
O	at

O	but
O	he
O	knew

O	was
O	useless
O	Arrived

O	all
O	strewn
O	with

O	of
O	men
O	Soon
O	he

O	Hearing
O	these
O	words
O	the
C	giant
O	took
O	up
O	his
O	massive
O	club
O	looked
O	around
O	for
O	the

O	and
O	answered
O	nothing
O	for

O	was
O	too
O	sad
O	at

O	He
O	reached
O	a
O	where

O	was
O	not
O	far
O	off
O	yet
O	he
O	looked
O	about
O	him
O	like
O	one
O	who
O	sees
O	nothing
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	perceived
O	a
O	rock
O	as
O	black
O	as
O	ink
O	whence
O	came
O	a
O	thick
O	smoke

O	hid
O	himself
O	in
O	terrible
O	fright
O	But
C	Avenant
O	resolved
O	to

O	bravely
O	so
O	taking
O	a
O	phial
O	which
O	the

O	he
O	prepared

C	Avenant
O	and

O	the
C	owl
O	You

O	the
O	king
O	s
O	city
O	and
O	the
C	Fair
C	One
C	with
C	Golden
C	Locks
O	became
O	his
O	spouse
O	and
O	queen
O	But
O	she
O	still
O	loved
C	Avenant
O	in
O	her
O	heart
O	and
O	often
O	said
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	her
O	But
O	for
C	Avenant
O	I
O	should
O	not
O	be
O	here
O	he
O	has
O	done
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	impossible
O	deeds
O	for
O	my
O	sake
O	he
O	has
O	fetched
O	me
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	beauty
O	and
O	I
O	shall
O	never
O	grow
O	old
O	in
O	short
O	I
O	owe
O	him
O	everything
O	And
O	she
O	praised
O	him
O	in
O	this
O	sort
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	at
O	length
O	the
C	king
O	became
O	jealous
O	and
O	though
C	Avenant
O	gave
O	him
O	not
O	the
O	slightest
O	cause
O	of
O	offence
O	he
O	shut
O	him
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	high
O	tower
O	once
O	more
O	but
O	with
O	irons
O	on
O	his
O	hands
O	and
O	feet
O	and
O	a
O	cruel
O	jailer
O	besides
O	who
O	fed
O	him
O	with
O	bread
O	and
O	water
O	only
O	His
O	sole
O	companion
O	was
O	his
O	little
C	dog
C	Cabriole
O	When
O	the
C	Fair
C	One
C	with
C	Golden
C	Locks
O	heard
O	of
O	this
O	she
O	reproached
O	her
O	husband
O	for
O	his
O	ingratitude
O	and
O	then
O	throwing
O	herself
O	at
O	his
O	knees
O	implored
O	that
C	Avenant
O	might
O	be
O	set
O	free
O	But
O	the
C	king
O	only
O	said
O	She
O	loves
O	him
O	and
O	refused
O	her
O	prayer
O	The
O	queen
O	entreated
O	no
O	more
O	but
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	deep
O	melancholy
O	When
O	the
C	king
O	saw
O	it
O	he
O	thought
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	care
O	for
O	him
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	handsome
O	enough
O	and
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	wash
O	his
O	face
O	with
O	her
O	water
O	of
O	beauty
O	it
O	would
O	make
O	her
O	love
O	him
O	more
O	He
O	knew
O	that
O	she
O	kept
O	it
O	in
O	a
O	cabinet
O	in
O	her
O	chamber
O	where
O	she
O	could
O	find
O	it
O	always
O	Now
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	a
O	in
O	cleaning
O	out
O	this
O	cabinet
O	had
O	the
O	very
O	day
O	before
O	knocked
O	down
O	the
O	phial
O	which
O	was
O	broken
O	in
O	a
O	thousand
O	pieces
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	contents
O	were
O	lost
O	Very
O	much
O	alarmed
O	she
O	then
O	remembered
O	seeing
O	in
O	a
O	cabinet
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	a
O	similar
O	phial
O	This
O	she
O	fetched
O	and
O	put
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	one
O	in
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	beauty
O	But
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	phial
O	contained
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	death
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	poison
O	used
O	to
O	destroy
O	great
O	criminals
O	that
O	is
O	noblemen
O	gentlemen
O	and
O	such
O	like
O	Instead
O	of
O	hanging
O	them
O	or
O	cutting
O	their
O	heads
O	off
O	like
O	common
O	people
O	they
O	were
O	compelled
O	to
O	wash
O	their
O	faces
O	with
O	this
O	water
O	upon
O	which
O	they
O	fell
O	asleep
O	and
O	woke
O	no
O	more
O	So
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	taking
O	up
O	this
O	phial
O	believing
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	beauty
O	washed
O	his
O	face
O	with
O	it
O	fell
O	asleep
O	and
O	died
C	Cabriole
O	heard
O	the
O	news
O	and
O	gliding
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	among
O	the
O	crowd
O	which
O	clustered
O	round
O	the
O	young
O	and
O	lovely
O	widow
O	whispered
O	softly
O	to
O	Madam
O	do
O	not
O	forget
O	poor
C	Avenant
O	If
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	disposed
O	to
O	do
O	so
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	his
O	little
C	dog
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	enough
O	to
O	remind
O	her
O	of
O	him
O	his
O	many
O	sufferings
O	and
O	his
O	great
O	fidelity
O	She
O	rose
O	up
O	without
O	speaking
O	to
O	anybody
O	and
O	went
O	straight
O	to
O	the
O	tower
O	where
C	Avenant
O	was
O	confined
O	There
O	with
O	her
O	own
O	hands
O	she
O	struck
O	off
O	his
O	chains
O	and
O	putting
O	a
O	crown
O	of
O	gold
O	on
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	a
O	purple
O	mantle
O	on
O	his
O	shoulders
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	Be
O	king
O	my
O	husband
C	Avenant
O	could
O	not
O	refuse
O	for
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	he
O	had
O	loved
O	her
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	He
O	threw
O	himself
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	and
O	then
O	took
O	the
O	crown
O	and
O	sceptre
O	and
O	ruled
O	her
O	kingom
O	like
O	a
C	king
O	All
O	the
O	people
O	were
O	delighted
O	to
O	have
O	him
O	as
O	their
O	sovereign
O	The
O	marriage
O	was
O	celebrated
O	in
O	all
O	imaginable
O	pomp
O	and
C	Avenant
O	and
O	the
C	Fair
C	One
C	with
C	Golden
C	Locks
O	lived
O	and
O	reigned
O	happily
O	together
O	all
O	their
O	days
O	The
C	Caterpillar
O	and
C	Alice
O	looked
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	silence
O	at
O	last
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	took
O	the
O	hookah
O	out
O	of
O	its
O	mouth
O	and
O	addressed
O	her
O	in
O	a
O	languid
O	sleepy
O	voice
O	Who
O	are
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	This
O	was
O	not
O	an
O	encouraging
O	opening
O	for
O	a
O	conversation
C	Alice
O	replied
O	rather
O	shyly
O	hardly
O	know
O	Sir
O	just
O	at
O	least
O	I
O	know
O	who
O	I
O	when
O	I
O	got
O	up
O	this
O	morning
O	but
O	I
O	think
O	I
O	must
O	have
O	changed
O	several
O	times
O	since
O	then
O	What
O	do
O	you
O	mean
O	by
O	that
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	sternly
O	Explain
O	yourself
O	I
O	can
O	t
O	explain
O	I
O	m
O	afraid
O	Sir
O	said
C	Alice
O	because
O	I
O	m
O	not
O	myself
O	you
O	see
O	I
O	don
O	t
O	see
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	I
O	m
O	afraid
O	I
O	can
O	t
O	put
O	it
O	more
O	clearly
C	Alice
O	replied
O	very
O	politely
O	for
O	I
O	can
O	t
O	understand
O	it
O	myself
O	to
O	begin
O	with
O	and
O	being
O	so
O	many
O	different
O	sizes
O	in
O	a
O	day
O	is
O	very
O	confusing
O	It
O	isn
O	t
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	Well
O	perhaps
O	you
O	haven
O	t
O	found
O	it
O	so
O	yet
O	said
C	Alice
O	but
O	when
O	you
O	have
O	to
O	turn
O	into
O	a
O	will
O	some
O	day
O	you
O	then
O	after
O	that
O	into
O	a
O	butterfly
O	I
O	should
O	think
O	you
O	ll
O	feel
O	it
O	a
O	little
O	queer
O	won
O	t
O	you
O	Not
O	a
O	bit
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	Well
O	perhaps
O	feelings
O	may
O	be
O	different
O	said
C	Alice
O	all
O	I
O	know
O	is
O	it
O	would
O	feel
O	very
O	queer
O	to
O	You
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	contemptuously
O	Who
O	are
O	Which
O	brought
O	them
O	back
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	the
O	conversation
C	Alice
O	felt
O	a
O	little
O	irritated
O	at
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	s
O	making
O	such
O	short
O	remarks
O	and
O	she
O	drew
O	herself
O	up
O	and
O	said
O	very
O	gravely
O	I
O	think
O	you
O	ought
O	to
O	tell
O	me
O	who
O	are
O	first
O	Why
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	Here
O	was
O	another
O	puzzling
O	question
O	and
O	as
C	Alice
O	could
O	not
O	think
O	of
O	any
O	good
O	reason
O	and
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	in
O	a
O	unpleasant
O	state
O	of
O	mind
O	she
O	turned
O	away
O	Come
O	back
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	called
O	after
O	her
O	I
O	ve
O	something
O	important
O	to
O	say
O	This
O	sounded
O	promising
O	certainly
C	Alice
O	turned
O	and
O	came
O	back
O	again
O	Keep
O	your
O	temper
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	Is
O	that
O	all
O	said
C	Alice
O	swallowing
O	down
O	her
O	anger
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	she
O	could
O	No
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
C	Alice
O	thought
O	she
O	might
O	as
O	well
O	wait
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	nothing
O	else
O	to
O	do
O	and
O	perhaps
O	after
O	all
O	it
O	might
O	tell
O	her
O	something
O	worth
O	hearing
O	For
O	some
O	minutes
O	it
O	puffed
O	away
O	without
O	speaking
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	it
O	unfolded
O	its
O	arms
O	took
O	the
O	hookah
O	out
O	of
O	its
O	mouth
O	again
O	and
O	said
O	So
O	you

O	changed
O	do
O	you
O	I
O	m
O	afraid
O	I

O	Sir
O	said
C	Alice
O	I
O	can

O	remember
O	things
O	as
O	I
O	I
O	don

O	for
O	ten
O	minutes
O	together
O	Can
O	t
O	remember
O	things
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	Well
O	I
O	ve
O	tried
O	to
O	say
O	doth
O	the
O	little
O	busy
O	but
O	it
O	all
O	came
O	different

O	voice
O	Repeat

O	old
C	Father
C	William

O	You

O	the

O	timidly
O	some

O	have
O	got
O	altered
O	It
O	is
O	wrong
O	from
O	beginning
O	to
O	end
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	decidedly
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	silence
O	for
O	some
O	minutes
O	The
C	Caterpillar
O	was
O	the
O	first
O	to
O	speak
O	What
O	size
O	do
O	you
O	want
O	to
O	be
O	it
O	asked
O	Oh
O	I

O	not
O	particular
O	as
O	to
O	size
C	Alice
O	hastily
O	replied
O	only
O	one
O	doesn
O	t
O	like
O	changing
O	so
O	often
O	you
O	know
O	I
O	know
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
C	Alice
O	said
O	nothing
O	she
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	so
O	much
O	contradicted
O	in
O	all
O	her
O	life
O	before
O	and
O	she
O	felt
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	losing
O	her
O	temper
O	Are
O	you
O	content
O	now
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	Well
O	I
O	should
O	like
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	larger
O	Sir
O	if
O	you
O	wouldn
O	t
O	mind
O	said
C	Alice
O	three
O	inches
O	is
O	such
O	a
O	wretched
O	height
O	to
O	be
O	It
O	is
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	height
O	indeed
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	angrily
O	rearing
O	itself
O	upright
O	as
O	it
O	spoke
O	it
O	was
O	exactly
O	three
O	inches
O	high
O	But
O	I
O	m
O	not
O	used
O	to
O	it
O	pleaded
O	poor
C	Alice
O	in
O	a
O	piteous
O	tone
O	And
O	she
O	thought
O	to
O	herself
O	I
O	wish
O	the
O	creature
O	wouldn
O	t
O	be
O	so
O	easily
O	offended
O	You
O	ll
O	get
O	used
O	to
O	it
O	in
O	time
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	and
O	it
O	put
O	the
O	hookah
O	into
O	its
O	mouth
O	and
O	began
O	smoking
O	again
O	This
O	time
C	Alice
O	waited
O	patiently
O	until
O	it
O	chose
O	to
O	speak
O	again
O	In
O	a
O	minute
O	or
O	two
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	took
O	the
O	hookah
O	out
O	of
O	its
O	mouth
O	and
O	yawned
O	once
O	or
O	twice
O	and
O	shook
O	itself
O	Then
O	it
O	got
O	down
O	off
O	the
O	mushroom
O	and
O	crawled
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	grass
O	merely
O	remarking
O	as
O	it
O	went
O	One
O	side
O	will
O	make
O	you
O	grow
O	taller
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	will
O	make
O	you
O	grow
O	shorter
O	One
O	side
O	of
O	The
O	other
O	side
O	of
O	thought
C	Alice
O	to
O	herself
O	Of
O	the
O	mushroom
O	said
O	the
C	Caterpillar
O	just
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	asked
O	it
O	aloud
O	and
O	in
O	another
O	moment
O	it
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	sight
C	Alice
O	remained
O	looking
O	thoughtfully
O	at
O	the
O	mushroom
O	for
O	a
O	minute
O	trying
O	to
O	make
O	out
O	which
O	were
O	the
O	two
O	sides
O	of
O	it
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	perfectly
O	round
O	she
O	found
O	this
O	a
O	very
O	difficult
O	question
O	However
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	stretched
O	her
O	arms
O	round
O	it
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	they
O	would
O	go
O	and
O	broke
O	off
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	the
O	edge
O	with
O	each
O	hand
O	And
O	now
O	which
O	is
O	which
O	she
O	said
O	to
O	herself
O	and
O	nibbled
O	a
O	little
O	of
O	the
O	bit
O	to
O	try
O	the
O	effect
O	The
O	next
O	moment
O	she
O	felt
O	a
O	violent
O	blow
O	underneath
O	her
O	chin
O	it
O	had
O	struck
O	her
O	foot
O	She
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	frightened
O	by
O	this
O	very
O	sudden
O	change
O	but
O	she
O	felt
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	time
O	to
O	be
O	lost
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	shrinking
O	rapidly
O	so
O	she
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	eat
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	bit
O	Her
O	chin
O	was
O	pressed
O	so
O	closely
O	against
O	her
O	foot
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	hardly
O	room
O	to
O	open
O	her
O	mouth
O	but
O	she
O	did
O	it
O	at
O	last
O	and
O	managed
O	to
O	swallow
O	a
O	morsel
O	of
O	the
O	bit
O	Come
O	my
O	head
O	s
O	free
O	at
O	last
O	said
C	Alice
O	in
O	a
O	tone
O	of
O	delight
O	which
O	changed
O	into
O	alarm
O	in
O	another
O	moment
O	when
O	she
O	found
O	that
O	her
O	shoulders
O	were
O	nowhere
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	all
O	she
O	could
O	see
O	when
O	she
O	looked
O	down
O	was
O	an
O	immense
O	length
O	of
O	neck
O	which
O	seemed
O	to
O	rise
O	like
O	a
O	stalk
O	out
O	a
O	sea
O	of
O	green
O	leaves
O	that
O	lay
O	far
O	below
O	her
O	What
O	all
O	that
O	green
O	stuff
O	be
O	said
C	Alice
O	And
O	where
O	my
O	shoulders
O	got
O	to
O	And
O	oh
O	my
O	poor
O	hands
O	how
O	is
O	it
O	I
O	can
O	t
O	see
O	you
O	She
O	was
O	moving
O	them
O	about
O	as
O	she
O	spoke
O	but
O	no
O	result
O	seemed
O	to
O	follow
O	except
O	a
O	little
O	shaking
O	among
O	the
O	distant
O	green
O	leaves
O	As
O	there
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	no
O	chance
O	of
O	getting
O	her
O	hands
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	head
O	she
O	tried
O	to
O	get
O	her
O	head
O	down
O	to
O	and
O	was
O	delighted
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	her
O	neck
O	would
O	bend
O	about
O	easily
O	in
O	any
O	direction
O	like
O	a
O	serpent
O	She
O	had
O	just
O	succeeded
O	in
O	curving
O	it
O	down
O	into
O	a
O	graceful
O	zigzag
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	dive
O	in
O	among
O	the
O	leaves
O	which
O	she
O	found
O	to
O	be
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	tops
O	of
O	the
O	trees
O	under
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	wandering
O	when
O	a
O	sharp
O	hiss
O	made
O	her
O	draw
O	back
O	in
O	a
O	hurry
O	a
O	large
C	Pigeon
O	had
O	flown
O	into
O	her
O	face
O	and
O	was
O	beating
O	her
O	violently
O	with
O	its
O	wings
O	Serpent

O	the
C	Pigeon
O	I

C	Alice
O	indignantly
O	Let
O	me
O	alone
O	Serpent
O	I
O	say
O	again
O	repeated
O	the
C	Pigeon
O	but
O	in
O	a
O	more
O	subdued
O	tone
O	and
O	added
O	with
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	sob
O	I
O	ve
O	tried
O	every
O	way
O	but
O	nothing
O	seems
O	to
O	suit
O	them
O	I
O	haven
O	t
O	the
O	least
O	idea
O	what
O	you
O	re
O	talking
O	about
O	said
C	Alice
O	I
O	ve
O	tried
O	the
O	roots
O	of

O	and
O	I

O	tried
O	banks
O	and
O	I

O	the
C	Pigeon
O	went
O	on
O	without

O	but
O	those
O	serpents
O	There
O	s
O	no
O	pleasing
O	them
C	Alice
O	was
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	puzzled
O	but
O	she
O	thought
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	use
O	in
O	saying
O	anything
O	more
O	till
O	the
C	Pigeon
O	had
O	finished
O	As
O	if
O	it
O	wasn
O	t
O	trouble
O	enough
O	hatching
O	the
O	eggs
O	said
O	the

O	be
O	on
O	the
O	lookout
O	for
O	serpents

O	and
O	day
O	Why
O	I
O	haven

O	had
O	a
O	wink
O	of
O	sleep
O	these
O	three
O	weeks
O	I
O	m
O	very
O	sorry
O	you
O	ve
O	been
O	annoyed
O	said
C	Alice
O	who
O	was
O	beginning
O	to
O	see
O	its
O	meaning
O	And
O	just
O	as
O	I
O	d
O	taken
O	the
O	highest
O	tree
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	continued
O	the
C	Pigeon
O	raising
O	its
O	voice
O	to
O	a
O	shriek
O	and
O	just
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	thinking
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	free
O	of
O	them
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	must

O	down
O	from
O	the

O	Ugh
O	Serpent
O	But
O	I
O	m
O	a
O	serpent
O	I
O	tell
O	you
O	said
C	Alice
O	I
O	m
O	m
O	Well
O	are
O	you
O	said
O	the
C	Pigeon
O	I
O	can
O	see
O	you
O	re
O	trying
O	to
O	invent
O	something
O	m
O	a
O	little
O	girl
O	said
C	Alice
O	rather
O	doubtfully
O	as
O	she
O	remembered
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	changes
O	she
O	had
O	gone
O	through
O	that
O	day
O	A
O	likely
O	story
O	indeed
O	said
O	the
C	Pigeon
O	in
O	a
O	tone
O	of
O	the
O	deepest
O	contempt
O	I
O	ve
O	seen
O	a
O	good
O	many
O	little
O	girls
O	in
O	my
O	time
O	but
O	never
O	with
O	such
O	a
O	neck
O	as
O	that

O	no
O	You
O	re
O	a
O	serpent
O	and
O	there
O	s
O	no
O	use
O	denying
O	it
O	I
O	suppose
O	you
O	ll
O	be
O	telling
O	me
O	next
O	that
O	you
O	never
O	tasted
O	an
O	egg
O	I
O	tasted
O	eggs
O	certainly
O	said
C	Alice
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	truthful
O	child
O	but
O	little
O	girls
O	eat
O	eggs
O	quite
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	serpents
O	do
O	you
O	know
O	I
O	don
O	t
O	believe
O	it
O	said
O	the
C	Pigeon
O	but
O	if
O	they
O	do
O	why
O	then
O	they
O	re
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	serpent
O	that
O	s
O	all
O	I
O	can
O	say
O	This
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	new
O	idea
O	to
C	Alice
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	quite
O	silent
O	for
O	a
O	minute
O	or
O	two
O	which
O	gave
O	the
C	Pigeon
O	the
O	opportunity
O	of
O	adding
O	You
O	re
O	looking
O	for
O	eggs
O	I
O	know
O	well
O	enough
O	and
O	what
O	does
O	it
O	matter
O	to
O	me
O	whether
O	you
O	re
O	a
O	little
O	girl
O	or
O	a
O	serpent
O	It
O	matters
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	to
O	said
C	Alice
O	hastily
O	but
O	I
O	m
O	not
O	looking
O	for
O	eggs
O	as
O	it
O	happens
O	and
O	if
O	I
O	was
O	I
O	shouldn
O	t
O	want
O	I
O	don
O	t
O	like
O	them
O	raw
O	Well
O	be
O	off
O	then
O	said
O	the
C	Pigeon
O	in
O	a
O	sulky
O	tone
O	as
O	it
O	settled
O	down
O	again
O	into
O	its
O	nest
C	Alice
O	crouched
O	down
O	among
O	the
O	trees
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	she
O	could
O	for
O	her
O	neck
O	kept
O	getting
O	entangled
O	among
O	the
O	branches
O	and
O	every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	she
O	had
O	to
O	stop
O	and
O	untwist
O	it
O	After
O	a
O	while
O	she
O	remembered
O	that
O	she
O	still
O	held
O	the
O	pieces
O	of
O	mushroom
O	in
O	her
O	hands
O	and
O	she
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	very
O	carefully
O	nibbling
O	first
O	at
O	one
O	and
O	then
O	at
O	the
O	other
O	and
O	growing
O	sometimes
O	taller
O	and
O	sometimes
O	shorter
O	until
O	she
O	had
O	succeeded
O	in
O	bringing
O	herself
O	down
O	to
O	her
O	usual
O	height
O	It
O	was
O	so
O	long
O	since
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	anything
O	near
O	the
O	right
O	size
O	that
O	it
O	felt
O	quite
O	strange
O	at
O	first
O	but
O	she
O	got
O	used
O	to
O	it
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	and
O	began
O	talking
O	to
O	herself
O	as
O	usual
O	Come
O	there
O	s
O	half
O	my
O	plan
O	done
O	now
O	How
O	puzzling
O	all
O	these
O	changes
O	are
O	I
O	m
O	never
O	sure
O	what
O	I
O	m
O	going
O	to
O	be
O	from
O	one
O	minute
O	to
O	another
O	However
O	I
O	ve
O	got
O	back
O	to
O	my
O	right
O	size
O	the
O	next
O	thing
O	is
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	that
O	beautiful
O	that
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	I
O	wonder
O	As
O	she
O	said
O	this
O	she
O	came
O	suddenly
O	upon
O	an
O	open
O	place
O	with
O	a
O	little
O	house
O	in
O	it
O	about
O	four
O	feet
O	high
O	Whoever
O	lives
O	there
O	thought
C	Alice
O	it
O	ll
O	never
O	do
O	to
O	come
O	upon
O	them
O	size
O	why
O	I
O	should
O	frighten
O	them
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	wits
O	So
O	she
O	began
O	nibbling
O	at
O	the
O	bit
O	again
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	venture
O	to
O	go
O	near
O	the
O	house
O	till
O	she
O	had
O	brought
O	herself
O	down
O	to
O	nine
O	inches
O	high
O	Long
O	ago
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	monarch
O	who
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	very
O	honest
O	man
O	that
O	his
O	subjects
O	entitled
O	him
O	the
C	Good
C	King
O	One
O	day
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	out
O	hunting
O	a
O	little
O	white
O	rabbit
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	half
O	killed
O	by
O	his
O	hounds
O	leaped
O	right
O	into
O	his
O	majesty
O	s
O	arms
O	Said
O	he
O	caressing
O	it
O	This
O	poor
O	creature
O	has
O	put
O	itself
O	under
O	my
O	protection
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	allow
O	no
O	one
O	to
O	injure
O	it
O	So
O	he
O	carried
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	palace
O	had
O	prepared
O	for
O	it
O	a
O	neat
O	little
O	with
O	abundance
O	of
O	the
O	daintiest
O	food
O	such
O	as
O	rabbits
O	love
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	left
O	it
O	The
O	same
O	night
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	alone
O	in
O	his
O	chamber
O	there
O	appeared
O	to
O	him
O	a
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	She
O	was
O	dressed
O	neither
O	in
O	gold
O	nor
O	silver
O	nor
O	brocade
O	but
O	her
O	flowing
O	robes
O	were
O	white
O	as
O	snow
O	and
O	she
O	wore
O	a
O	garland
O	of
O	white
O	roses
O	on
O	her
O	head
O	The
C	Good
C	King
O	was
O	greatly
O	astonished
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	for
O	his
O	door
O	was
O	locked
O	and
O	he
O	wondered
O	how
O	so
O	dazzling
O	a
O	lady
O	could
O	possibly
O	enter
O	but
O	she
O	soon
O	removed
O	his
O	doubts
O	I
O	am
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Candide
O	said
O	she
O	with
O	a
O	smiling
O	and
O	gracious
O	air
O	Passing
O	through
O	the
O	wood
O	where
O	you
O	were
O	hunting
O	I
O	took
O	a
O	desire
O	to
O	know
O	if
O	you
O	were
O	as
O	good
O	as
O	men
O	say
O	you
O	are
O	I
O	therefore
O	changed
O	myself
O	into
O	a
O	white
O	rabbit
O	and
O	took
O	refuge
O	in
O	your
O	arms
O	You
O	saved
O	me
O	and
O	now
O	I
O	know
O	that
O	those
O	who
O	are
O	merciful
O	to
O	dumb
O	beasts
O	will
O	be
O	ten

O	You

O	Madam
O	replied
O	the
C	king
O	if
O	you
O	are
O	a
O	fairy
O	you
O	must
O	know
O	without

O	to
O	be
O	good
O	the

O	Of

O	him
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	a
O	bad
O	man
O	You
O	are
O	right
O	said
O	the
O	fairy
O	but
O	I
O	cannot
O	make
O	him
O	good
O	he
O	must
O	do
O	that

O	himself
O	You
O	mortals
O	can
O	do
O	the
O	same
O	with
O	your
O	children
O	Ah
O	yes
O	said
O	the
C	king
O	sighing
O	Still
O	he
O	felt
O	that
O	the
O	kindness
O	of
O	a
O	fairy
O	was
O	something
O	gained
O	for
O	his
O	son
O	and
O	died
O	not
O	long
O	after
O	content
O	and
O	at
O	peace
C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	mourned
O	deeply
O	for
O	he
O	dearly
O	loved
O	his
O	father
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	gladly
O	given
O	all
O	his
O	kingdoms
O	and
O	treasures
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	in
O	life
O	a
O	little
O	longer
O	Two
O	days
O	after
O	the
C	Good
C	King
O	was
O	no
O	more
C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	was
O	sleeping
O	in
O	his
O	chamber
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	same
O	dazzling
O	vision
O	of
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Candide
O	I
O	promised
O	your
O	father
O	said
O	she
O	to
O	be
O	your
O	best
O	friend
O	and
O	in
O	pledge
O	of
O	this
O	take
O	what
O	I
O	now
O	give
O	you
O	and
O	she
O	placed
O	a
O	small
O	gold
O	ring
O	upon
O	his
O	finger
O	Poor
O	as
O	it
O	looks
O	it
O	is
O	more
O	precious
O	than
O	diamonds
O	for
O	whenever
O	you
O	do
O	ill
O	it
O	will
O	prick
O	your
O	finger
O	If
O	after
O	that
O	warning
O	you
O	still
O	continue
O	in
O	evil
O	you
O	will
O	lose
O	my
O	friendship
O	and
O	I
O	shall
O	become
O	your
O	direst
O	enemy
O	So
O	saying
O	she
O	disappeared
O	leaving
C	Cherry
O	in
O	such
O	amazement
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	believed
O	it
O	all
O	a
O	dream
O	save
O	for
O	the
O	ring
O	on
O	his
O	finger
O	He
O	was
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	so
O	good
O	that
O	the
O	ring
O	never
O	pricked
O	him
O	at
O	all
O	and
O	this
O	made
O	him
O	so
O	cheerful
O	and
O	pleasant
O	in
O	his
O	humour
O	that
O	everybody
O	called
O	him
O	Happy
C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	But
O	one
O	unlucky
O	day
O	he
O	was
O	out
O	hunting
O	and
O	found
O	no
O	sport
O	which
O	vexed
O	him
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	showed
O	his
O	ill
O	temper
O	by
O	his
O	looks
O	and
O	ways
O	He
O	fancied
O	his
O	ring
O	felt
O	very
O	tight
O	and
O	uncomfortable
O	but
O	as
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	prick
O	him
O	he
O	took
O	no
O	heed
O	of
O	this
O	until
O	his
O	palace
O	his
O	little
O	pet
C	dog
C	Bibi
O	jumped
O	up
O	upon
O	him
O	and
O	was
O	sharply
O	told
O	to
O	get
O	away
O	The
O	creature
O	accustomed
O	to
O	nothing
O	but
O	caresses
O	tried
O	to
O	attract
O	his
O	attention
O	by
O	pulling
O	at
O	his
O	garments
O	when
C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	turned
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	a
O	severe
O	kick
O	At
O	this
O	moment
O	he
O	felt
O	in
O	his
O	finger
O	a
O	prick
O	like
O	a
O	pin
O	What
O	nonsense
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	himself
O	The
O	fairy
O	must
O	be
O	making
O	game
O	of
O	me
O	Why
O	what
O	great
O	evil
O	have
O	I
O	done
O	I
O	the
O	master
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	empire
O	cannot
O	I
O	kick
O	my
O	own
C	dog
O	A
O	voice
O	replied
O	or
O	else
C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	imagined
O	it
O	No
O	sire
O	the
O	master
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	empire
O	has
O	a
O	right
O	to
O	do
O	good
O	but
O	not
O	evil
O	I
O	a
O	fairy
O	am
O	as
O	much
O	above
O	you
O	as
O	you
O	are
O	above
O	your
C	dog
O	I
O	might
O	punish
O	you
O	kill
O	you
O	if
O	I
O	chose
O	but
O	I
O	prefer
O	leaving
O	you
O	to
O	amend
O	your
O	ways
O	You
O	have
O	been
O	guilty
O	of
O	three
O	faults
O	bad
O	temper
O	passion
O	cruelty
O	do
O	better
O	The
C	Prince
O	promised
O	and
O	kept
O	his
O	word
O	awhile
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	brought
O	up
O	by
O	a
O	foolish
O	nurse
O	who
O	indulged
O	him
O	in
O	every
O	way
O	and
O	was
O	always
O	telling
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	a
C	king
O	one
O	day
O	when
O	he
O	might
O	do
O	as
O	he
O	liked
O	in
O	all
O	things
O	He
O	found
O	out
O	now
O	that
O	even
O	a
C	king
O	cannot
O	always
O	do
O	that
O	it
O	vexed
O	him
O	and
O	made
O	him
O	angry
O	His
O	ring
O	began
O	to
O	prick
O	him
O	so
O	often
O	that
O	his
O	little
O	finger
O	was
O	continually
O	bleeding
O	He
O	disliked
O	this
O	as
O	was
O	natural
O	and
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	consider
O	whether
O	it
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	easier
O	to
O	throw
O	the
O	ring
O	away
O	altogether
O	than
O	to
O	be
O	constantly
O	annoyed
O	by
O	it
O	It
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	queer
O	thing
O	for
O	a
C	king
O	to
O	have
O	always
O	a
O	spot
O	of
O	blood
O	on
O	his
O	finger
O	At
O	last
O	unable
O	to
O	put
O	up
O	with
O	it
O	any
O	more
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	ring
O	off
O	and
O	hid
O	it
O	where
O	he
O	would
O	never
O	see
O	it
O	and
O	believed
O	himself
O	the
O	happiest
O	of
O	men
O	for
O	he
O	could
O	now
O	do
O	exactly
O	what
O	he
O	liked
O	He
O	did
O	it
O	and
O	became
O	every
O	day
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	miserable
O	One
O	day
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	young
O	girl
O	so
O	beautiful
O	that
O	being
O	always
O	accustomed
O	to
O	have
O	his
O	own
O	way
O	he
O	immediately
O	determined
O	to
O	espouse
O	her
O	He
O	never
O	doubted
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	only
O	too
O	glad
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	a
C	queen
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	very
O	poor
O	But
C	Zelia
O	was
O	her
O	name
O	answered
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	astonishment
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	rather
O	not
O	marry
O	him
O	Do
O	I
O	displease
O	you
O	asked
O	the
C	Prince
O	into
O	whose
O	mind
O	it
O	had
O	never
O	entered
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	displease
O	anybody
O	Not
O	at
O	all
O	my
C	Prince
O	said
O	the
O	honest
O	You
O	are
O	very
O	handsome
O	very
O	charming
O	but
O	you
O	are
O	not
O	like
O	your
O	father
O	the
C	Good
C	King
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	be
O	your
C	queen
O	for
O	you
O	would
O	make
O	me
O	miserable
O	At
O	these
O	words
O	the
O	prince
O	s
O	love
O	seemed
O	all
O	to
O	turn
O	to
O	hatred
O	he
O	gave
O	orders
O	to
O	his
O	guards
O	to
O	convey
C	Zelia
O	to
O	a
O	prison
O	near
O	the
O	palace
O	and
O	then
O	took
O	counsel
O	with
O	his
O	foster
O	brother
O	the
O	one
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	ill
O	companions
O	who
O	most
O	incited
O	him
O	to
O	do
O	wrong
O	Sir
O	said
O	this
O	man
O	if
O	I
O	were
O	in
O	your
O	majesty
O	s
O	place
O	I
O	would
O	never
O	vex
O	myself
O	about
O	a
O	poor
O	silly
O	girl
O	Feed
O	her
O	on
O	bread
O	and
O	water
O	till
O	she
O	comes
O	to
O	her

O	to

O	loaded
O	heavily
O	with

O	Then
O	full
O	of
O	fury
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	shut

O	up
O	in
O	his

O	went
O	raging

O	he
O	found

O	At
O	the

O	to

O	distant
O	forest
O	where
O	standing
O	on
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	a
O	stream
O	he
O	saw
O	reflected
O	in
O	the

O	his
O	own
O	frightful
O	shape
O	and
O	heard
O	a

O	thy

C	Cherry
O	recognised
O	the

O	in
O	his
O	rage
O	would
O	have
O	sprung
O	upon

O	and
O	devoured
O	her
O	but
O	he
O	saw
O	nothing
O	and
O	the
O	same
O	voice
O	said
O	behind
O	him
O	Cease
O	thy

O	thy

O	to

O	Hearing
O	no

O	he
O	soon
O	quitted
O	the

O	at
O	least
O	to
O	get
O	rid
O	of
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	himself
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	scarcely
O	gone
O	twenty
O	paces
O	when
O	he
O	tumbled
O	into
O	a

O	that

O	too
O	delighted
O	to

O	a
O	animal
O	led

O	along
O	with
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	capital
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	kingdom
O	There
O	great
O	rejoicings
O	were

O	and
O	the
O	asking
O	what

O	all
O	about
O	were
O	told
O	that

O	the

O	punishment
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	crimes
O	Four
O	courtiers
O	his

O	the
O	people
O	had
O	risen
O	up
O	against
O	them
O	and
O	offered
O	the
O	crown
O	to
C	Suliman
O	the
O	old
O	tutor
O	whom
C	Cherry
O	had
O	ordered
O	to
O	be
O	arrested
O	All
O	this
O	the
O	poor
O	monster
O	heard
O	He
O	even
O	saw
C	Suliman
O	sitting
O	upon
O	his
O	own
O	throne
O	and
O	trying
O	to
O	calm
O	the
O	populace
O	by
O	representing
O	to
O	them
O	that
O	it

C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	was
O	dead
O	that

O	might
O	return
O	one
O	day
O	to
O	with
O	honour
O	the
O	crown
O	which
C	Suliman
O	only
O	consented
O	to
O	wear
O	as
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	viceroy
O	I
O	know
O	his
O	heart
O	said
O	the
O	honest
O	and
O	faithful
O	old
O	man
O	it
O	is
O	tainted
O	but
O	not
O	corrupt
O	If
O	alive
O	he
O	may
O	reform
O	yet
O	and
O	be
O	all
O	his
O	father
O	over
O	again
O	to
O	you
O	his
O	people
O	whom
O	he
O	has
O	caused
O	to
O	suffer
O	so
O	much
O	These
O	words
O	touched
O	the
O	poor
O	beast
O	so
O	deeply
O	that
O	he
O	ceased
O	to
O	beat
O	himself
O	against
O	the
O	iron
O	bars
O	of
O	the
O	cage
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	hunters
O	carried
O	him
O	about
O	became
O	gentle
O	as
O	a
O	lamb
O	and
O	suffered
O	himself
O	to
O	be
O	taken
O	quietly
O	to
O	a
O	menagerie
O	where
O	were
O	kept
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	strange
O	and
O	ferocious
O	animals
O	a
O	place
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	himself
O	often
O	visited
O	as
O	a
O	boy
O	but
O	never
O	thought
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	shut
O	up
O	there
O	himself
O	However
O	he
O	owned
O	he
O	had
O	deserved
O	it
O	all
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	make
O	amends
O	by
O	showing
O	himself
O	very
O	obedient
O	to
O	his
O	keeper
O	This
O	man
O	was
O	almost
O	as
O	great
O	a
O	brute
O	as
O	the
O	animals
O	he
O	had
O	charge
O	of
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	ill
O	humour
O	he
O	used
O	to
O	beat
O	them
O	without
O	rhyme
O	or
O	reason
O	One
O	day
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	sleeping
O	a
O	tiger
O	broke
O	loose
O	and
O	leaped
O	upon
O	him
O	eager
O	to
O	devour
O	him
C	Cherry
O	at
O	first
O	felt
O	a
O	thrill
O	of
O	pleasure
O	at
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	being
O	revenged
O	then
O	seeing
O	how
O	helpless
O	the
O	man
O	was
O	he
O	wished
O	himself
O	free
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	defend
O	him
O	Immediately
O	the
O	doors
O	of
O	his
O	cage
O	opened
O	The
O	keeper
O	waking
O	up
O	saw
O	the
O	strange
O	beast
O	leap
O	out
O	and
O	imagined
O	of
O	course
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	be
O	slain
O	at
O	once
O	Instead
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	tiger
O	lying
O	dead
O	and
O	the
O	strange
O	beast
O	creeping
O	up
O	and
O	laying
O	itself
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	to
O	be
O	caressed
O	But
O	as
O	he
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	stroke
O	it
O	a
O	voice
O	was
O	heard
O	saying
O	Good
O	actions
O	never
O	go
O	unrewarded
O	and
O	instead
O	of
O	the
O	frightful
O	monster
O	there
O	crouched
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	nothing
O	but
O	a
O	pretty
O	little
C	dog
C	Cherry
O	delighted
O	to
O	find
O	himself
O	thus
O	metamorphosed
O	caressed
O	the
O	keeper
O	in
O	every
O	possible
O	way
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	man
O	took
O	him
O	up
O	into
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	carried
O	him
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	related
O	this
O	wonderful
O	story
O	from
O	beginning
O	to
O	end
O	The
C	queen
O	wished
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	charming
O	little
C	dog
O	and
C	Cherry
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	exceedingly
O	happy
O	could
O	he
O	have
O	forgotten
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	originally
O	a
O	man
O	and
O	a
C	king
O	He
O	was
O	lodged
O	most
O	elegantly
O	had
O	the
O	richest
O	of
O	collars
O	to
O	adorn
O	his
O	neck
O	and
O	heard
O	himself
O	praised
O	continually
O	But
O	his
O	beauty
O	rather
O	brought
O	him
O	into
O	trouble
O	for
O	the
C	queen
O	afraid
O	lest
O	he
O	might
O	grow
O	too
O	large
O	for
O	a
O	pet
O	took
O	advice
O	of
O	who
O	ordered
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	fed
O	entirely
O	upon
O	bread
O	and
O	that
O	very
O	sparingly
O	so
O	poor
C	Cherry
O	was
O	sometimes
O	nearly
O	starved
O	One
O	day
O	when
O	they
O	gave
O	him
O	his
O	crust
O	for
O	breakfast
O	a
O	fancy
O	seized
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	eat
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	so
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	bread
O	in
O	his
O	mouth
O	and
O	trotted
O	away
O	towards
O	a
O	stream
O	which
O	he
O	knew
O	and
O	where
O	he
O	sometimes
O	stopped
O	to
O	drink
O	But
O	instead
O	of
O	the
O	stream
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	splendid
O	palace
O	glittering
O	with
O	gold
O	and
O	precious
O	stones
O	Entering
O	the
O	doors
O	was
O	a
O	crowd
O	of
O	men
O	and
O	women
O	magnificently
O	dressed
O	and
O	within
O	there
O	was
O	singing
O	and
O	dancing
O	and
O	good
O	cheer
O	of
O	all
O	sorts
O	Yet
O	however
O	grandly
O	and
O	gaily
O	the
O	people
O	went
O	in
C	Cherry
O	noticed
O	that
O	those
O	who
O	came
O	out
O	were
O	pale
O	thin
O	ragged
O	covered
O	with
O	wounds
O	and
O	sores
O	Some
O	of
O	them
O	dropped
O	dead
O	at
O	once
O	others
O	dragged
O	themselves
O	on
O	a
O	little
O	way
O	and
O	then
O	lay
O	down
O	dying
O	of
O	hunger
O	and
O	vainly
O	begged
O	a
O	morsel
O	of
O	bread
O	from
O	others
O	who
O	were
O	entering
O	in
O	who
O	never
O	took
O	the
O	least
O	notice
O	of
O	them
C	Cherry
O	perceived
O	one
O	woman
O	who
O	was
O	trying
O	feebly
O	to
O	gather
O	and
O	eat
O	some
O	green
O	herbs
O	Poor
O	thing
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	himself
O	I
O	know
O	what
O	it
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	hungry
O	and
O	I
O	want
O	my
O	breakfast
O	badly
O	enough
O	but
O	still
O	it
O	will
O	not
O	kill
O	me
O	to
O	wait
O	till
O	and
O	my
O	crust
O	may
O	save
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	this
O	poor
O	woman
O	So
O	the
O	little
C	dog
O	ran
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	dropped
O	his
O	bread
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	she
O	picked
O	it
O	up
O	and
O	ate
O	it
O	with
O	avidity
O	Soon
O	she
O	looked
O	quite
O	recovered
O	and
C	Cherry
O	delighted
O	was
O	trotting
O	back
O	again
O	to
O	his
O	kennel
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	loud
O	cries
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	young
O	girl
O	dragged
O	by
O	four
O	men
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	trying
O	to
O	compel
O	her
O	to
O	enter
O	Oh
O	how
O	he
O	wished
O	himself
O	a
O	monster
O	again
O	as
O	when
O	he
O	slew
O	the
O	tiger
O	for
O	the
O	young
O	girl
O	was
O	no
O	other
O	than
O	his
O	beloved
C	Zelia
O	Alas
O	what
O	could
O	a
O	poor
O	little
C	dog
O	do
O	to
O	defend
O	her
O	But
O	he
O	ran
O	forward
O	and
O	barked
O	at
O	the
O	men
O	and
O	bit
O	their
O	heels
O	until
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	chased
O	him
O	away
O	with
O	heavy
O	blows
O	And
O	then
O	he
O	lay
O	down
O	outside
O	the
O	determined
O	to
O	watch
O	and
O	see
O	what
O	had
O	become
O	of
C	Zelia
O	Conscience
O	pricked
O	him
O	now
O	What
O	thought
O	he
O	I
O	am
O	furious
O	against
O	these
O	wicked
O	men
O	who
O	are
O	carrying
O	her
O	away
O	and
O	did
O	I
O	not
O	do
O	the
O	same
O	myself
O	Did
O	I
O	not
O	cast
O	her
O	into
O	prison
O	and
O	intend
O	to
O	sell
O	her
O	as
O	a
O	slave
O	Who
O	knows
O	how
O	much
O	more
O	wickedness
O	I
O	might
O	not
O	have
O	done
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	others
O	if
O	heaven
O	s
O	justice
O	had
O	not
O	stopped
O	me
O	in
O	time
O	While
O	he
O	lay
O	thinking
O	and
O	repenting
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	window
O	open
O	and
O	saw
C	Zelia
O	throw
O	out
O	of
O	it
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	dainty
O	meat
C	Cherry
O	who
O	felt
O	hungry
O	enough
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	was
O	just
O	about
O	to
O	eat
O	it
O	when
O	the
O	woman
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	his
O	crust
O	snatched
O	him
O	up
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	Poor
O	little
O	beast
O	cried
O	she
O	patting
O	him
O	every
O	bit
O	of
O	food
O	in
O	that
O	palace
O	is
O	poisoned
O	you
O	shall
O	not
O	touch
O	a
O	morsel
O	And
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	the
O	voice
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	repeated
O	again
O	Good
O	actions
O	never
O	go
O	unrewarded
O	and
C	Cherry
O	found
O	himself
O	changed
O	into
O	a
O	beautiful
O	little
O	white
O	pigeon
O	He
O	remembered
O	with
O	joy
O	that
O	white
O	was
O	the
O	colour
O	of
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Candide
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	hope
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	taking
O	him
O	into
O	favour
O	again
O	So
O	he
O	stretched
O	his
O	wings
O	delighted
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	now
O	have
O	a
O	chance
O	of
O	approaching
O	his
O	fair
C	Zelia
O	He
O	flew
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	and
O	finding
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	open
O	entered
O	and
O	sought
O	everywhere
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	find
C	Zelia
O	Then
O	in
O	despair
O	he
O	flew
O	out
O	again
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	over
O	the
O	world
O	until
O	he
O	beheld
O	her
O	once
O	more
O	He
O	took
O	flight
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	traversed
O	many
O	countries
O	swiftly
O	as
O	a
O	bird
O	can
O	but
O	found
O	no
O	trace
O	of
O	his
O	beloved
O	At
O	length
O	in
O	a
O	desert
O	sitting
O	beside
O	an
O	old
O	hermit
O	in
O	his
O	cave
O	and
O	partaking
O	with
O	him
O	his
O	frugal
O	repast
C	Cherry
O	saw
O	a
O	poor
O	and
O	recognised
C	Zelia
O	Transported
O	with
O	joy
O	he
O	flew
O	in
O	perched
O	on
O	her
O	shoulder
O	and
O	expressed
O	his
O	delight
O	and
O	affection
O	by
O	a
O	thousand
O	caresses
O	She
O	charmed
O	with
O	the
O	pretty
O	little
O	pigeon
O	caressed
O	it
O	in
O	her
O	turn
O	and
O	promised
O	it
O	that
O	if
O	it
O	would
O	stay
O	with
O	her
O	she
O	would
O	love
O	it
O	always
O	What
O	have
O	you
O	done
C	Zelia
O	said
O	the
O	hermit
O	smiling
O	and
O	while
O	he
O	spoke
O	the
O	white
O	pigeon
O	vanished

O	promised
O	to

O	you
O	Indeed
O	she
O	has
O	loved
O	you
O	always
O	but
O	your
O	many
O	faults
O	constrained
O	her
O	to
O	hide
O	her
O	love
O	These
O	are
O	now
O	amended
O	and
O	you
O	may
O	both
O	live
O	happy
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	because
O	your
O	union
O	is
O	founded
O	upon
O	mutual
O	esteem
C	Cherry
O	and
C	Zelia
O	threw
O	themselves
O	at
O	the
O	feet
O	of
O	the
O	hermit
O	whose
O	form
O	also
O	began
O	to
O	change
O	His
O	soiled

O	dazzling
O	whiteness
O	and
O	his

O	beard
O	and
O	withered

O	grew
O	into
O	the

O	and
O	lovely
O	countenance
O	of
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Candide
O	Rise
O	up
O	my
O	children
O	said
O	she
O	I
O	must
O	now
O	transport
O	you
O	to
O	your

O	is
O	now
O	worthy
O	She
O	had
O	scarcely

O	speaking
O	when
O	they
O	found
O	themselves
O	in
O	the
O	chamber
O	of
C	Suliman
O	who
O	delighted
O	to
O	find
O	again
O	his
O	beloved
O	pupil
O	and
O	master
O	willingly
O	resigned
O	the

O	faithful
O	of
O	his
O	subjects
C	King
C	Cherry
O	and
C	queen
C	Zelia
O	reigned
O	together
O	for
O	many
O	years
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	said
O	that
O	the
O	former
O	was
O	so
O	blameless
O	and
O	strict
O	in
O	all
O	his
O	duties
O	that
O	though
O	he
O	constantly
O	wore
O	the
O	ring
O	which
C	Candide
O	had
O	restored
O	to
O	him
O	it
O	never
O	once
O	pricked
O	his
O	finger
O	enough
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	bleed
O	There
O	was
O	once
O	a
C	queen
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	the
C	mother
O	of
O	several
O	children
O	but
O	all
O	were
O	dead
O	except
O	one
O	daughter
O	of
O	whom
O	she
O	was
O	excessively
O	fond
O	humouring
O	and
O	indulging
O	her
O	in
O	all
O	her
O	ways
O	and
O	wishes
O	This
C	princess
O	was
O	so
O	extremely
O	beautiful
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	called
O	and
O	twenty
O	kings
O	were
O	at
O	one
O	time
O	paying
O	their
O	addresses
O	to
O	her
O	She
O	had
O	so
O	many
O	lovers
O	indeed
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	which
O	to
O	choose
O	and
O	refused
O	them
O	all
O	Her
C	mother
O	being
O	advanced
O	in
O	years
O	was
O	anxious
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	married
O	and
O	settled
O	before
O	she
O	died
O	but
O	as
O	no
O	entreaties
O	could
O	prevail
O	she
O	determined
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
C	Desert
C	Fairy
O	to
O	ask
O	advice
O	concerning
O	her
O	stubborn
O	daughter
O	Now
O	this
O	fairy
O	being
O	guarded
O	by
O	two
O	fierce
O	lions
O	the
C	queen
O	made
O	a
O	cake
O	of
O	millet
O	and
O	crocodiles
O	eggs
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	appease
O	their
O	fury
O	and
O	pass
O	by
O	them
O	and
O	having
O	thus
O	provided
O	herself
O	she
O	set
O	out
O	After
O	travelling
O	some
O	time
O	she
O	found
O	herself
O	weary
O	and
O	lying
O	down
O	under
O	a
O	tree
O	fell
O	asleep
O	When
O	she
O	awoke
O	she
O	heard
O	the
O	roaring
O	of
O	the
O	lions
O	which
O	guarded
O	the
O	fairy
O	and
O	on
O	looking
O	for
O	her
O	cake
O	she
O	found
O	it
O	was
O	gone
O	This
O	threw
O	her
O	into
O	the
O	utmost
O	agony
O	as
O	she
O	felt
O	sure
O	she
O	should
O	be
O	devoured
O	when
O	hearing
O	somebody
O	approach
O	she
O	raised
O	her
O	eyes
O	and
O	saw
O	in
O	a
O	tree
O	a
O	little
O	yellow
O	man
O	half
O	a
O	yard
O	high
O	picking
O	and
O	eating
O	oranges
O	Ah
C	queen
O	said
O	the
C	Yellow
C	Dwarf
O	for
O	so
O	he
O	was
O	called
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	complexion
O	and
O	the
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	lived
O	how
O	will
O	you
O	escape
O	the
O	lions
O	There
O	is
O	but
O	one
O	way
O	I
O	know
O	what
O	business
O	brought
O	you
O	here
O	promise
O	me
O	your
O	daughter
O	in
O	marriage
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	save
O	you
O	The
C	queen
O	though
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	look
O	without
O	horror
O	upon
O	so
O	frightful
O	a
O	figure
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	consent
O	and
O	having
O	agreed
O	to
O	the
O	terms
O	proposed
O	she
O	instantly
O	found
O	herself
O	in
O	her
O	own
O	palace
O	and
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	passed
O	seemed
O	much
O	like
O	a
O	dream
O	nevertheless
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	thoroughly
O	persuaded
O	of
O	the
O	reality
O	of
O	it
O	that
O	she
O	became
O	melancholy
O	The
O	young
C	princess
O	being
O	unable
O	to
O	learn
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	her
O	mother
O	s
O	dejection
O	resolved
O	in
O	her
O	turn
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	inquire
O	of
O	the
C	Desert
C	Fairy
O	and
O	accordingly
O	having
O	prepared
O	a
O	cake
O	for
O	the
O	lions
O	she
O	also
O	set
O	off
O	on
O	the
O	same
O	journey
O	It
O	happened
O	that
O	took
O	exactly
O	the
O	route
O	her
C	mother
O	had
O	done
O	before
O	her
O	and
O	coming
O	to
O	the
O	fatal
O	tree
O	which

O	plentifully
O	indulged
O	herself
O	with
O	the
O	delicious
O	fruit
O	The
O	lions
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	roar
O	looking
O	for

O	was
O	thrown
O	into
O	the

O	to

O	leaped
O	with

O	upon
O	the

O	and
O	immediately
O	disappeared
O	As
O	the
C	king
O	stood
O	confused
O	and
O	astonished
O	at
O	this
O	strange
O	adventure
O	he
O	suddenly
O	found
O	a
O	mist
O	before
O	his
O	eyes
O	and
O	felt
O	himself
O	lifted
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	by
O	some
O	extraordinary
O	power
O	for
O	the
C	Desert
C	Fairy
O	had
O	fallen
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	him
O	To
O	secure
O	him
O	for
O	herself
O	therefore
O	she
O	carried
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	frightful
O	cavern
O	hoping
O	he
O	would
O	there
O	forget
O	But
O	finding
O	this
O	scheme
O	ineffectual
O	she
O	resolved
O	to
O	carry
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	place
O	altogether
O	as
O	pleasant
O	as
O	the
O	other
O	was
O	terrible
O	and
O	accordingly
O	placed
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	chariot
O	drawn
O	by
O	swans
O	In
O	passing
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	he
O	was
O	unspeakably
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	his
O	beloved
C	princess
O	in
O	a
O	castle
O	of
O	polished
O	steel
O	leaning
O	her
O	head
O	on
O	one
O	hand
O	and
O	wiping
O	away
O	her
O	tears
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	She
O	happened
O	to
O	look
O	up
O	and
O	had
O	the
O	mortification
O	to
O	see
O	the
C	king
O	sitting
O	by
O	the
O	fairy
O	who
O	then
O	by
O	her
O	art
O	made
O	herself
O	appear
O	extremely
O	beautiful
O	Had
O	not
O	the
C	king
O	been
O	sensible
O	of
O	the
O	fairy
O	s
O	power
O	he
O	would
O	certainly
O	have
O	tried
O	to
O	free
O	himself
O	from
O	her
O	by
O	some
O	means
O	or
O	other
O	but
O	he
O	knew
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	in
O	vain
O	and
O	therefore
O	made
O	believe
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	liking
O	for
O	her
O	At
O	last
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	stately
O	palace
O	fenced
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	by
O	walls
O	of
O	emeralds
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	by
O	a
O	boisterous
O	sea
O	The
C	king
O	by
O	pretending
O	an
O	attachment
O	to
O	the
O	fairy
O	obtained
O	the
O	liberty
O	to
O	walk
O	by
O	himself
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	There
O	one
O	day
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	voice
O	and
O	presently
O	after
O	was
O	surprised
O	by
O	the
O	appearance
O	of
O	a
C	mermaid
O	who
O	swimming
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	pleasing
O	smile
O	spoke
O	to
O	this
O	effect
O	O
C	king
C	of
C	the
C	Golden
C	Mines
O	I
O	well
O	know
O	all
O	that
O	has
O	befallen
O	you
O	and
O	the
C	princess
O	Do
O	not
O	suspect
O	this
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	contrivance
O	of
O	the
O	fairy
O	to
O	try
O	you
O	for
O	I
O	am
O	an
O	inveterate
O	enemy
O	both
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	the
C	Yellow
C	Dwarf
O	therefore
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	place
O	confidence
O	in
O	me
O	I
O	will
O	lend
O	you
O	my
O	assistance
O	to
O	procure
O	the
O	release
O	not
O	only
O	of
O	yourself
O	but
O	of
O	also
O	The
O	overjoyed
C	king
O	promised
O	to
O	do
O	whatever
O	the
C	mermaid
O	should
O	direct
O	and
O	seating
O	himself
O	by
O	her
O	desire
O	upon
O	her
O	fish
O	s
O	tail
O	they
O	sailed
O	away
O	together
O	over
O	the
O	rolling
O	sea
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	sailed
O	some
O	time
O	Now
O	said
O	the
C	mermaid
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	we
O	are
O	approaching
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	your
C	princess
O	is
O	kept
O	prisoner
O	by
O	the
C	Yellow
C	Dwarf
O	You
O	will
O	have
O	many
O	enemies
O	to
O	fight
O	before
O	you
O	can
O	come
O	to
O	her
O	take
O	therefore
O	this
O	sword
O	with
O	which
O	you
O	may
O	overcome
O	everything
O	provided
O	you
O	never
O	let
O	it
O	go
O	out
O	of
O	your
O	hand
O	The
C	king
O	returned
O	her
O	all
O	the
O	thanks
O	that
O	the
O	most
O	grateful
O	heart
O	could
O	suggest
O	and
O	the
C	mermaid
O	landed
O	and
O	took
O	leave
O	of
O	him
O	promising
O	him
O	farther
O	assistance
O	when
O	necessary
O	The
C	king
O	boldly
O	advanced
O	and
O	meeting
O	with
O	two
O	terrible
O	sphinxes
O	laid
O	them
O	dead
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	with
O	the
O	sword
O	Next
O	he
O	attacked
O	six
O	dragons
O	that
O	opposed
O	him
O	and
O	despatched
O	them
O	also
O	Then
O	he
O	met
C	nymphs
O	crowned
O	with
O	garlands
O	of
O	flowers
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	whom
O	he
O	stopped
O	being
O	unwilling
O	to
O	destroy
O	so
O	much
O	beauty
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	voice
O	say
O	Strike
O	strike
O	or
O	you
O	lose
O	your
C	princess
O	for
O	ever
O	So
O	he
O	threw
O	himself
O	into
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	the
C	nymphs
O	smiting
O	right
O	and
O	left
O	and
O	soon
O	dispersed
O	them
O	Presently
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	where
O	was
O	imprisoned
O	the
C	princess
O	O
O	my

O	exclaimed

O	lover
O	Faithful
O	lover
O	she
O	replied
O	drawing
O	herself
O	back
O	Did
O	I
O	not
O	see
O	you
O	passing
O	through
O	the

O	with
O	a
O	beautiful
C	nymphs
O	were
O	you
O	faithful
O	then
O	Yes

O	the
O	detested
C	Desert
C	Fairy
O	who
O	was
O	carrying
O	me
O	to
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	must
O	have
O	languished
O	out
O	all
O	my
O	days
O	had

O	am
O	now
O	come
O	to
O	release
O	you
O	Having
O	uttered
O	these
O	words
O	he
O	threw
O	himself
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	but
O	catching
O	hold
O	of
O	her
O	gown
O	he
O	unfortunately
O	let
O	go
O	the
O	magic
O	sword
O	which
O	the
C	Yellow
C	Dwarf
O	no
O	sooner
O	discovered
O	than
O	leaping
O	from
O	behind
O	a
O	shrub
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	concealed
O	he
O	ran
O	and
O	seized
O	it
O	By
O	two
O	cabalistical
O	words
O	he
O	then
O	conjured
O	up
O	a
O	couple
O	of
O	giants
O	who
O	laid
O	the
C	king
O	in
O	irons
O	Now
O	said
O	the
C	dwarf
O	my
O	rival
O	s
O	fate
O	is
O	in
O	my

O	hands
O	however

O	the
C	princess
O	he
O	shall
O	have

O	I
O	scorn
O	thy
O	favour
O	on
O	such
O	terms
O	The
C	dwarf
O	was
O	so
O	exasperated
O	by
O	this
O	reply
O	that
O	he
O	instantly
O	stabbed
O	the
C	king
O	to
O	the
O	heart
O	The
O	disconsolate
C	princess
O	stood
O	a
O	moment
O	petrified
O	and
O	then
O	exclaimed
O	Thou
O	hideous
O	creature
O	since
O	entreaties
O	could
O	not
O	avail
O	thee
O	perhaps

O	his
O	body
O	and
O	expired
O	without
O	a
O	sigh
O	Thus
O	ended
O	the
O	fate
O	of
O	these
O	two
O	faithful
O	lovers
O	whom
O	the
C	mermaid
O	very
O	much
O	regretted
O	but
O	as
O	all
O	her
O	power
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	sword
O	she
O	could
O	only
O	change
O	them
O	into
O	two
O	which
O	preserving
O	a
O	constant
O	and
O	mutual
O	affection
O	still
O	fondly
O	unite
O	their
O	branches
O	together
O	I
O	soon
O	again
O	grew
O	weary
O	of
O	living
O	a
O	life
O	of
O	idleness
O	and
O	hardening
O	myself
O	against
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	any
O	danger
O	I
O	embarked
O	with
O	some
C	merchants
O	on
O	another
O	long
O	voyage
O	We
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	ports
O	where
O	we
O	traded
O	One
O	day
O	we
O	were
O	overtaken
O	by
O	a
O	dreadful
O	tempest
O	which
O	drove
O	us
O	from
O	our
O	course
O	The
O	storm
O	continued
O	several
O	days
O	and
O	brought
O	us
O	before
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	an
O	island
O	which
O	the
C	captain
O	was
O	very
O	unwilling
O	to
O	enter
O	but
O	we
O	were
O	obliged
O	to
O	cast
O	anchor
O	When
O	we
O	had
O	furled
O	our
O	sails
O	the
C	captain
O	told
O	us
O	that
O	this
O	and
O	some
O	other
O	neighboring
O	islands
O	were
O	inhabited
O	by
O	hairy
O	savages
O	who
O	would
O	speedily
O	attack
O	us
O	and
O	though
O	they
O	were
O	but
O	dwarfs
O	yet
O	that
O	we
O	must
O	make
O	no
O	resistance
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	more
O	in
O	number
O	than
O	the
O	locusts
O	and
O	if
O	we
O	happened
O	to
O	kill
O	one
O	they
O	would
O	all
O	fall
O	upon
O	us
O	and
O	destroy
O	us
O	We
O	soon
O	found
O	that
O	what
O	the
C	captain
O	had
O	told
O	us
O	was
O	but
O	too
O	true
O	An
O	innumerable
O	multitude
O	of
O	frightful
O	savages
O	about
O	two
O	feet
O	high
O	covered
O	all
O	over
O	with
O	red
O	hair
O	came
O	swimming
O	toward
O	us
O	and
O	encompassed
O	our
O	ship
O	They
O	chattered
O	as
O	they
O	came
O	near
O	but
O	we
O	understood
O	not
O	their
O	language
O	They
O	climbed
O	up
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	with
O	such
O	agility
O	as
O	surprised
O	us
O	They
O	took
O	down
O	our
O	sails
O	cut
O	the
O	cable
O	and
O	hauling
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	made
O	us
O	all
O	get
O	out
O	and
O	afterward
O	carried
O	the
O	ship
O	into
O	another
O	island
O	whence
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	As
O	we
O	advanced
O	we
O	perceived
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	a
O	vast
O	pile
O	of
O	building
O	and
O	made
O	toward
O	it
O	We
O	found
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	palace
O	elegantly
O	built
O	and
O	very
O	lofty
O	with
O	a
O	gate
O	of
O	ebony
O	of
O	two
O	leaves
O	which
O	we
O	opened
O	We
O	saw
O	before
O	us
O	a
O	large
O	apartment
O	with
O	a
O	porch
O	having
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	a
O	heap
O	of
O	human
O	bones
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	a
O	vast
O	number
O	of
O	We
O	trembled
O	at
O	this
O	spectacle
O	and
O	were
O	seized
O	with
O	deadly
O	apprehension
O	when
O	suddenly
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	apartment
O	opened
O	with
O	a
O	loud
O	crash
O	and
O	there
O	came
O	out
O	the
O	horrible
O	figure
O	of
O	a
O	black
O	man
O	as
O	tall
O	as
O	a
O	lofty
O	tree
O	He
O	had
O	but
O	one
O	eye
O	and
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	his
O	forehead
O	where
O	it
O	blazed
O	bright
O	as
O	a
O	burning
O	coal
O	His
O	fore
O	teeth
O	were
O	very
O	long
O	and
O	sharp
O	and
O	stood
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	mouth
O	which
O	was
O	as
O	deep
O	as
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	horse
O	His
O	upper
O	lip
O	hung
O	down
O	upon
O	his
O	breast
O	His
O	ears
O	resembled
O	those
O	of
O	an
O	elephant
O	and
O	covered
O	his
O	shoulders
O	and
O	his
O	nails
O	were
O	as
O	long
O	and
O	crooked
O	as
O	the
O	talons
O	of
O	the
O	greatest
O	birds
O	At
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	so
O	frightful
O	a
O	genie
O	we
O	became
O	insensible
O	and
O	lay
O	like
O	dead
O	men
O	At
O	last
O	we
O	came
O	to
O	ourselves
O	and
O	saw
O	him
O	sitting
O	in
O	the
O	porch
O	looking
O	at
O	us
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	considered
O	us
O	well
O	he
O	advanced
O	toward
O	us
O	and
O	laying
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	me
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	nape
O	of
O	my
O	neck
O	and
O	turned
O	me
O	round
O	as
O	a
O	butcher
O	would
O	do
O	a
O	sheep
O	s
O	head
O	After
O	having
O	examined
O	me
O	and
O	perceiving
O	me
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	lean
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	nothing
O	but
O	skin
O	and
O	bone
O	he
O	let
O	me
O	go
O	He
O	took
O	up
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	and
O	viewed
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	The
C	captain
O	being
O	the
O	fattest
O	he
O	held
O	him
O	with
O	one
O	hand
O	as
O	I
O	would
O	do
O	a
O	sparrow
O	and
O	thrust
O	a
O	spit
O	through
O	him
O	he
O	then
O	kindled
O	a
O	great
O	fire
O	roasted
O	and
O	ate
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	apartment
O	for
O	his
O	supper
O	Having
O	finished
O	his
O	repast
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	porch
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	snoring
O	louder
O	than
O	thunder
O	He
O	slept
O	thus
O	till
O	morning
O	As
O	to
O	ourselves
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	possible
O	for
O	us
O	to
O	enjoy
O	any
O	rest
O	so
O	that
O	we
O	passed
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	painful
O	apprehension
O	that
O	can
O	be
O	imagined
O	When
O	day
O	appeared
O	the
C	giant
O	awoke
O	got
O	up
O	went
O	out
O	and
O	left
O	us
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	The
O	next
O	night
O	we
O	determined
O	to
O	revenge
O	ourselves
O	on
O	the
O	brutish
C	giant
O	and
O	did
O	so
O	in
O	the
O	following
O	manner
O	After
O	he
O	had
O	again
O	finished
O	his
O	inhuman
O	supper
O	on
O	another
O	of
O	our
O	seamen
O	he
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	we
O	heard
O	him
O	snore
O	according
O	to
O	his
O	custom
O	nine
O	of
O	the
O	boldest
O	among
O	us
O	and
O	myself
O	took
O	each
O	of
O	us
O	a
O	spit
O	and
O	putting
O	the
O	points
O	of
O	them
O	into
O	his
O	fire
O	till
O	they
O	were
O	burning
O	hot
O	we
O	thrust
O	them
O	into
O	his
O	eye
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	blinded
O	him
O	The
O	pain
O	made
O	him
O	break
O	out
O	into
O	a
O	frightful
O	yell
O	he
O	started
O	up
O	and
O	stretched
O	out
O	his
O	hands
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	sacrifice
O	I
O	some
O	of
O	us
O	to
O	his
O	rage
O	but
O	we
O	ran
O	to
O	such
O	places
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	reach
O	and
O	after
O	having
O	sought
O	for
O	us
O	in
O	vain
O	he
O	groped
O	for
O	the
O	gate
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	howling
O	in
O	agony
O	We
O	immediately
O	left
O	the
O	palace
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	where
O	we
O	made
O	some
O	rafts
O	each
O	large
O	enough
O	to
O	carry
O	three
O	men
O	with
O	some
O	timber
O	that
O	lay
O	about
O	in
O	great
O	quantities
O	We
O	waited
O	till
O	day
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	get
O	upon
O	them
O	for
O	we
O	hoped
O	if
O	the
C	giant
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	by
O	sunrising
O	and
O	give
O	over
O	his
O	howling
O	which
O	we
O	still
O	heard
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	prove
O	to
O	be
O	dead
O	and
O	if
O	that
O	happened
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	case
O	we
O	resolved
O	to
O	stay
O	in
O	that
O	island
O	and
O	not
O	to
O	risk
O	our
O	lives
O	upon
O	the
O	rafts
O	But
O	day
O	had
O	scarcely
O	appeared
O	when
O	we
O	perceived
O	our
O	cruel
O	enemy
O	accompanied
O	by
O	two
O	others
O	almost
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	size
O	leading
O	him
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	more
O	coming
O	before
O	him
O	at
O	a
O	quick
O	pace
O	We
O	did
O	not
O	hesitate
O	to
O	take
O	to
O	our
O	rafts
O	and
O	put
O	to
O	sea
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	speed
O	we
O	could
O	The
C	giants
O	who
O	perceived
O	this
O	took
O	up
O	great
O	stones
O	and
O	running
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	entered
O	the
O	water
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	middle
O	and
O	threw
O	so
O	exactly
O	that
O	they
O	sunk
O	all
O	the
O	rafts
O	but
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	upon
O	and
O	all
O	my
O	companions
O	except
O	the
O	two
O	with
O	me
O	were
O	drowned
O	We
O	rowed
O	with
O	all
O	our
O	might
O	and
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	reach
O	of
O	the
C	giants
O	But
O	when
O	we
O	got
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	we
O	were
O	exposed
O	to
O	the
O	mercy
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	and
O	winds
O	and
O	spent
O	that
O	day
O	and
O	the
O	following
O	night
O	under
O	the
O	most
O	painful
O	uncertainty
O	as
O	to
O	our
O	fate
O	but
O	next
O	morning
O	we
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	fortune
O	to
O	be
O	thrown
O	upon
O	an
O	island
O	where
O	we
O	landed
O	with
O	much
O	joy
O	We
O	found
O	excellent
O	fruit
O	which
O	afforded
O	us
O	great
O	relief
O	and
O	recruited
O	our
O	strength
O	At
O	night
O	we
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	on
O	the
O	but
O	were
O	awakened
O	by
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	a
C	serpent
O	of
O	surprising
O	length
O	and
O	thickness
O	whose
O	scales
O	made
O	a
O	rustling
O	noise
O	as
O	he
O	wound
O	himself
O	along
O	It
O	swallowed
O	up
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	comrades
O	notwithstanding
O	his
O	loud
O	cries
O	and
O	the
O	efforts
O	he
O	made
O	to
O	extricate
O	himself
O	from
O	it
O	dashing
O	him
O	several
O	times
O	against
O	the
O	ground
O	it
O	crushed
O	him
O	and
O	we
O	could
O	hear
O	it
O	gnaw
O	and
O	tear
O	the
O	poor
O	fellow
O	s
O	bones
O	though
O	we
O	had
O	fled
O	to
O	a
O	considerable
O	distance
O	The
O	following
O	day
O	to
O	our
O	great
O	terror
O	we
O	saw
O	the
C	serpent
O	again
O	when
O	I
O	exclaimed
O	O
O	Heaven
O	to
O	what
O	dangers
O	are
O	we
O	exposed
O	We
O	rejoiced
O	yesterday
O	at
O	having
O	escaped
O	from
O	the
O	cruelty
O	of
O	a
C	giant
O	and
O	the
O	rage
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	now
O	are
O	we
O	fallen
O	into
O	another
O	danger
O	equally
O	dreadful
O	As
O	we
O	walked
O	about
O	we
O	saw
O	a
O	large
O	tall
O	tree
O	upon
O	which
O	we
O	designed
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	following
O	night
O	for
O	our
O	security
O	and
O	having
O	satisfied
O	our
O	hunger
O	with
O	fruit
O	we
O	mounted
O	it
O	accordingly
O	Shortly
O	after
O	the
C	serpent
O	came
O	hissing
O	to
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	raised
O	itself
O	up
O	against
O	the
O	trunk
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	meeting
O	with
O	my
O	comrade
O	who
O	sat
O	lower
O	than
O	I
O	swallowed
O	him
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	went
O	off
O	I
O	remained
O	upon
O	the
O	tree
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	day
O	and
O	then
O	came
O	down
O	more
O	like
O	a
O	dead
O	man
O	than
O	one
O	alive
O	expecting
O	the
O	same
O	fate
O	with
O	my
O	two
O	companions
O	This
O	filled
O	me
O	with
O	horror
O	and
O	I
O	advanced
O	some
O	steps
O	to
O	throw
O	myself
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	but
O	I
O	withstood
O	this
O	dictate
O	of
O	despair
O	and
O	submitted
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	God
O	who
O	disposes
O	of
O	our
O	lives
O	at
O	His
O	pleasure
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	I
O	collected
O	together
O	a
O	great
O	quantity
O	of
O	small
O	wood
O	brambles
O	and
O	dry
O	thorns
O	and
O	making
O	them
O	up
O	into
O	fagots
O	made
O	a
O	wide
O	circle
O	with
O	them
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	also
O	tied
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	branches
O	over
O	my
O	head
O	Having
O	done
O	this
O	when
O	the
O	evening
O	came
O	I
O	shut
O	myself
O	up
O	within
O	this
O	circle
O	with
O	the
O	melancholy
O	satisfaction
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	neglected
O	nothing
O	which
O	could
O	preserve
O	me
O	from
O	the
O	cruel
O	destiny
O	with
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	threatened
O	The
C	serpent
O	failed
O	not
O	to
O	come
O	at
O	the
O	usual
O	hour
O	and
O	went
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	seeking
O	for
O	an
O	opportunity
O	to
O	devour
O	me
O	but
O	was
O	prevented
O	by
O	the
O	rampart
O	I
O	had
O	made
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	lay
O	till
O	day
O	like
O	a
O	cat
O	watching
O	in
O	vain
O	for
O	a
O	mouse
O	that
O	has
O	fortunately
O	reached
O	a
O	place
O	of
O	safety
O	When
O	day
O	appeared
O	he
O	retired
O	but
O	I
O	dared
O	not
O	leave
O	my
O	fort
O	until
O	the
O	sun
O	arose
O	God
O	took
O	compassion
O	on
O	my
O	hopeless
O	state
O	for
O	just
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	going
O	in
O	a
O	fit
O	of
O	desperation
O	to
O	throw
O	myself
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	I
O	perceived
O	a
O	ship
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	I
O	called
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	and
O	unfolding
O	the
O	linen
O	of
O	my
O	turban
O	displayed
O	it
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	observe
O	me
O	This
O	had
O	the
O	desired
O	effect
O	the
O	crew
O	perceived
O	me
O	and
O	the
C	captain
O	sent
O	his
O	boat
O	for
O	me
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	I
O	came
O	on
O	board
O	the
C	merchants
O	and
O	seamen
O	flocked
O	about
O	me
O	to
O	know
O	how
O	I
O	came
O	into
O	that
O	desert
O	island
O	and
O	after
O	I
O	had
O	related
O	to
O	them
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	befallen
O	me
O	the
O	oldest
O	among
O	them
O	said
O	they
O	had
O	several
O	times
O	heard
O	of
O	the
C	giants
O	that
O	dwelt
O	in
O	that
O	island
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	cannibals
O	and
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	serpents
O	they
O	added
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	abundance
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	that
O	they
O	hid
O	themselves
O	by
O	day
O	and
O	came
O	abroad
O	by
O	night
O	After
O	having
O	testified
O	their
O	joy
O	at
O	my
O	escaping
O	so
O	many
O	dangers
O	they
O	brought
O	me
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	their
O	provisions
O	and
O	took
O	me
O	before
O	the
C	captain
O	who
O	seeing
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	rags
O	gave
O	me
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	suits
O	Looking
O	steadfastly
O	upon
O	him
O	I
O	knew
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	person
O	who
O	in
O	my
O	second
O	voyage
O	had
O	left
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	where
O	I
O	fell
O	asleep
O	and
O	sailed
O	without
O	me
O	or
O	sending
O	to
O	seek
O	for
O	me
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	surprised
O	that
O	he
O	believing
O	me
O	to
O	be
O	dead
O	did
O	not
O	recognize
O	me
C	captain
O	said
O	I
O	look
O	at
O	me
O	and
O	you
O	may
O	know
O	that
O	I
O	am
C	Sindbad
O	whom
O	you
O	left
O	in
O	that
O	desert
O	island
O	The
C	captain
O	having
O	considered
O	me
O	attentively
O	recognized
O	me
O	God
O	be
O	praised
O	said
O	he
O	embracing
O	me
O	I
O	rejoice
O	that
O	fortune
O	has
O	rectified
O	my
O	fault
O	There
O	are
O	your
O	goods
O	which
O	I
O	always
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	preserve
O	I
O	took
O	them
O	from
O	him
O	and
O	made
O	him
O	my
O	acknowledgments
O	for
O	his
O	care
O	of
O	them
O	We
O	continued
O	at
O	sea
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	islands
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	landed
O	at
O	that
O	of
O	Salabat
O	where
O	is
O	obtained
O	which
O	is
O	much
O	used
O	in
O	medicine
O	From
O	the
O	isle
O	of
O	Salabat
O	we
O	went
O	to
O	another
O	where
O	I
O	furnished
O	myself
O	with
O	cloves
O	cinnamon
O	and
O	other
O	spices
O	As
O	we
O	sailed
O	from
O	this
O	island
O	we
O	saw
O	a
O	tortoise
O	twenty
O	cubits
O	in
O	length
O	and
O	breadth
O	We
O	observed
O	also
O	an
O	amphibious
O	animal
O	like
O	a
O	cow
O	which
O	gave
O	milk
O	its
O	skin
O	is
O	so
O	hard
O	that
O	they
O	usually
O	make
O	bucklers
O	of
O	it
O	I
O	saw
O	another
O	which
O	had
O	the
O	shape
O	and
O	color
O	of
O	a
O	camel
O	In
O	short
O	after
O	a
O	long
O	voyage
O	I
O	arrived
O	at
O	Bussorah
O	and
O	thence
O	returned
O	to
O	Bagdad
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	wealth
O	that
O	I
O	knew
O	not
O	its
O	extent
O	I
O	gave
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	to
O	the
O	poor
O	and
O	bought
O	another
O	considerable
O	estate
O	in
O	addition
O	to
O	what
O	I
O	had
O	already
O	Thus
C	Sindbad
O	finished
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	his
O	third
O	voyage
O	He
O	gave
O	another
O	hundred
O	sequins
O	to
C	Hindbad
O	and
O	invited
O	him
O	to
O	dinner
O	again
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	to
O	hear
O	A
C	Miller
O	dying
O	divided
O	all
O	his
O	property
O	between
O	his
O	three
O	children
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	simple
O	matter
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	leave
O	but
O	his
O	mill
O	his
O	ass
O	and
O	his
C	cat
O	so
O	he
O	made
O	no
O	will
O	and
O	called
O	in
O	no
O	lawyer
O	who
O	would
O	probably
O	have
O	taken
O	a
O	large
O	slice
O	out
O	of
O	these
O	poor
O	possessions
O	The
O	eldest
O	son
O	took
O	the
O	mill
O	the
O	second
O	the
O	ass
O	while
O	the
O	third
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	content
O	himself
O	with
O	the
C	cat
O	at
O	which
O	he
O	grumbled
O	very
O	much
O	My
O	brothers
O	said
O	he
O	by
O	putting
O	their
O	property
O	together
O	may
O	gain
O	an
O	honest
O	livelihood
O	but
O	there
O	is
O	nothing
O	left
O	for
O	me
O	except
O	to
O	die
O	of
O	hunger
O	unless
O	indeed
O	I
O	were
O	to
O	kill
O	my
C	cat
O	and
O	eat
O	him
O	and
O	make
O	a
O	coat
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	skin
O	which
O	would
O	be
O	very
O	scanty
O	clothing
O	The
C	cat
O	who
O	heard
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	talking
O	to
O	himself
O	sat
O	up
O	on
O	his
O	four
O	paws
O	and
O	looking
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	grave
O	and
O	wise
O	air
O	said
O	Master
O	I
O	think
O	you
O	had
O	better
O	not
O	kill
O	me
O	I
O	shall
O	be
O	much
O	more
O	useful
O	to
O	you
O	alive
O	How
O	so
O	asked
O	his
O	master
O	You
O	have
O	but
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	a
O	sack
O	and
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	boots
O	such
O	as
O	gentlemen
O	wear
O	when
O	they
O	go
O	shooting
O	and
O	you
O	will
O	find
O	you
O	are
O	not
O	so
O	ill
O	off
O	as
O	you
O	suppose
O	Now
O	though
O	the
O	young
O	miller
O	did
O	not
O	much
O	depend
O	upon
O	the
C	cat
O	s
O	words
O	still
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	rather
O	surprising
O	that
O	a
C	cat
O	should
O	speak
O	at
O	all
O	And
O	he
O	had
O	before
O	now
O	seen
O	him
O	show
O	so
O	much
O	adroitness
O	and
O	cleverness
O	in
O	catching
O	rats
O	and
O	mice
O	that
O	it
O	seemed
O	advisable
O	to
O	trust
O	him
O	a
O	little
O	farther
O	especially
O	as
O	poor
O	young
O	fellow
O	he
O	had
O	nobody
O	else
O	to
O	trust
O	When
O	the
C	cat
O	got
O	his
O	boots
O	he
O	drew
O	them
O	on
O	with
O	a
O	grand
O	air
O	and
O	slinging
O	his
O	sack
O	over
O	his
O	shoulder
O	and
O	drawing
O	the
O	cords
O	of
O	it
O	round
O	his
O	neck
O	he
O	marched
O	bravely
O	to
O	a
O	hard
O	by
O	with
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	well
O	acquainted
O	Then
O	putting
O	some
O	bran
O	and
O	lettuces
O	into
O	his
O	bag
O	and
O	stretching
O	himself
O	out
O	beside
O	it
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	dead
O	he
O	waited
O	till
O	some
O	fine
O	fat
O	young
O	rabbit
O	ignorant
O	of
O	the
O	wickedness
O	and
O	deceit
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	should
O	peer
O	into
O	the
O	sack
O	to
O	eat
O	the
O	food
O	that
O	was
O	inside
O	This
O	happened
O	very
O	shortly
O	for
O	there
O	are
O	plenty
O	of
O	foolish
O	young
O	rabbits
O	in
O	every
O	warren
O	and
O	when
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	who
O	really
O	was
O	a
O	splendid
O	fat
O	fellow
O	put
O	his
O	head
O	inside
O	Master
C	Puss
O	drew
O	the
O	cords
O	immediately
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	and
O	killed
O	him
O	without
O	mercy
O	Then
O	very
O	proud
O	of
O	his
O	prey
O	he
O	marched
O	direct
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	and
O	begged
O	to
O	speak
O	with
O	the
C	king
O	He
O	was
O	desired
O	to
O	ascend
O	to
O	the
O	apartments
O	of
O	his
O	majesty
O	where
O	making
O	a
O	low
O	bow
O	he
O	said
O	Sire
O	here
O	is
O	a
O	magnificent
O	rabbit
O	killed
O	in
O	the
O	warren
O	which
O	belongs
O	to
O	my
O	lord
O	the
C	Marquis
C	of
C	Carabas
O	and
O	which
O	he
O	has
O	desired
O	me
O	to
O	offer
O	humbly
O	to
O	your
O	majesty
O	Tell
O	your
O	master
O	replied
O	the
C	king
O	politely
O	that
O	I
O	accept
O	his
O	present
O	and
O	am
O	very
O	much
O	obliged
O	to
O	him
O	Another
O	time
C	Puss
O	went
O	and
O	hid
O	himself
O	and
O	his
O	sack
O	in
O	a
O	and
O	there
O	caught
O	two
O	splendid
O	fat
O	partridges
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	the
O	rabbit
O	When
O	he
O	presented
O	them
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	with
O	a
O	similar
O	message
O	as
O	before
O	his
O	majesty
O	was
O	so
O	pleased
O	that
O	he
O	ordered
O	the
C	cat
O	to
O	be
O	taken
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	kitchen
O	and
O	given
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	drink
O	where
O	while
O	enjoying
O	himself
O	the
O	faithful
O	animal
O	did
O	not
O	cease
O	to
O	talk
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	cunning
O	way
O	of
O	the
O	large
O	preserves
O	and
O	abundant
O	game
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	my
O	lord
O	the
C	Marquis
C	of
C	Carabas
O	One
O	day
O	hearing
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	was
O	intending
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	drive
O	along
O	the
O	with
O	his
O	daughter
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
C	princess
O	in
O	the
O	world
C	Puss
O	said
O	to
O	his
O	master
O	Sir
O	if
O	you
O	would
O	only
O	follow
O	my
O	advice
O	your
O	fortune
O	is
O	made
O	Be
O	it
O	so
O	said
O	the
O	miller
O	s
O	son
O	who
O	was
O	growing
O	very
O	disconsolate

O	only
O	to

O	Just
O	so
O	said
O	the
O	miller
O	s
O	son
O	it
O	s
O	all
O	the
O	same
O	to
O	me
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	as
O	the
C	cat
O	told
O	him
O	While
O	he
O	was
O	bathing
O	the
C	king
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	court
O	passed
O	by
O	and
O	were
O	startled
O	to
O	hear
O	loud
O	cries
O	of
O	Help
O	help
O	my
O	lord
O	the
C	Marquis
C	of
C	Carabas
O	is
O	drowning
O	The
C	king
O	put
O	his
O	head
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	carriage
O	and
O	saw
O	nobody
O	but
O	the
C	cat
O	who
O	had
O	at
O	different
O	times
O	brought
O	him
O	so
O	many
O	presents
O	of
O	game
O	however
O	he
O	ordered
O	his
O	guards
O	to
O	fly
O	quickly
O	to
O	the
O	succour
O	of
O	my
O	lord
O	the
C	Marquis
C	of
C	Carabas
O	While
O	they
O	were
O	pulling
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	marquis
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	the
C	cat
O	came
O	up
O	bowing
O	to
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	s
O	carriage
O	and
O	told
O	a
O	long
O	and
O	pitiful
O	story
O	about
O	some
O	thieves
O	who
O	while
O	his
O	master
O	was
O	bathing
O	had
O	come
O	and
O	carried
O	away
O	all
O	his
O	clothes
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	impossible
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	appear
O	before
O	his
O	majesty
O	and
O	the
O	illustrious
C	princess
O	Oh
O	we
O	will
O	soon
O	remedy
O	that
O	answered
O	the
C	king
O	kindly
O	and
O	immediately
O	ordered
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	officers
O	of
O	the
O	household
O	to
O	ride
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	with
O	all
O	speed
O	and
O	bring
O	back
O	the
O	most
O	elegant
O	supply
O	of
O	clothes
O	for
O	the
O	young
O	gentleman
O	who
O	kept
O	in
O	the
O	background
O	until
O	they
O	arrived
O	Then
O	being
O	handsome
O	and
O	his
O	new
O	clothes
O	became
O	him
O	so
O	well
O	that
O	he
O	looked
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	marquis
O	all
O	his
O	days
O	and
O	advanced
O	with
O	an
O	air
O	of
O	respectful
O	ease
O	to
O	offer
O	his
O	thanks
O	to
O	his
O	majesty
O	The
C	king
O	received
O	him
O	courteously
O	and
O	the
C	princess
O	admired
O	him
O	very
O	much
O	Indeed
O	so
O	charming
O	did
O	he
O	appear
O	to
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	hinted
O	to
O	her
O	father
O	to
O	invite
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	carriage
O	with
O	them
O	which
O	you
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	did
O	not
O	refuse
O	The
C	cat
O	delighted
O	at
O	the
O	success
O	of
O	his
O	scheme
O	went
O	away
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	and
O	ran
O	so
O	swiftly
O	that
O	he
O	kept
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	ahead
O	of
O	the
O	royal
O	carriage
O	He
O	went
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	some
O	peasants
O	who
O	were
O	mowing
O	in
O	a
O	meadow
O	Good
O	people
O	said
O	he
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	firm
O	voice
O	the
C	king
O	is
O	coming
O	past
O	here
O	shortly
O	and
O	if
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	say
O	that
O	the
O	field
O	you
O	are
O	mowing
O	belongs
O	to
O	my
O	lord
O	the
C	Marquis
C	of
C	Carabas
O	you
O	shall
O	all
O	be
O	chopped
O	as
O	small
O	as
O	So
O	when
O	the
C	king
O	drove
O	by
O	and
O	asked
O	whose
O	meadow
O	it
O	was
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	splendid
O	crop
O	of
O	hay
O	the
O	mowers
O	all
O	answered
O	trembling
O	that
O	it
O	belonged
O	to
O	my
O	lord
O	the
C	Marquis
C	of
C	Carabas
O	You
O	have
O	very
O	fine
O	land
C	Marquis
O	said
O	his
O	majesty
O	to
O	the
O	miller
O	s
O	son
O	who
O	bowed
O	and
O	answered
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	bad
O	meadow
O	take
O	it
O	altogether
O	Then
O	the
C	cat
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	where
O	the
O	reapers
O	were
O	reaping
O	with
O	all
O	their
O	might
O	He
O	bounded
O	in
O	upon
O	them
O	The
C	king
O	is
O	coming
O	past
O	and
O	if
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	tell
O	him
O	that
O	this
O	wheat
O	belongs
O	to
O	my
O	lord
O	the
C	Marquis
C	of
C	Carabas
O	I
O	will
O	have
O	you
O	every
O	one
O	chopped
O	as
O	small
O	as
O	The
O	reapers
O	very
O	much
O	alarmed
O	did
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	bid
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	congratulated
O	the
C	Marquis
O	upon
O	possessing
O	such
O	beautiful
O	fields
O	laden
O	with
O	such
O	an
O	abundant
O	harvest
O	They
O	drove
O	on
O	the
C	cat
O	always
O	running
O	before
O	and
O	saying
O	the
O	same
O	thing
O	to
O	everybody
O	he
O	met
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	to
O	declare
O	the
O	whole
O	country
O	belonged
O	to
O	his
O	master
O	so
O	that
O	even
O	the
C	king
O	was
O	astonished
O	at
O	the
O	vast
O	estate
O	of
O	my
O	lord
O	the
C	Marquis
C	of
C	Carabas
O	But
O	now
O	the
C	cat
O	arrived
O	at
O	a
O	great
O	castle
O	where
O	dwelt
O	an
C	Ogre
O	to
O	whom
O	belonged
O	all
O	the
O	land
O	through
O	which
O	the
O	royal
O	equipage
O	had
O	been
O	driving
O	He
O	was
O	a
O	cruel
O	tyrant
O	and
O	his
O	tenants
O	and
O	servants
O	were
O	terribly
O	afraid
O	of
O	him
O	which
O	accounted
O	for
O	their
O	being
O	so
O	ready
O	to
O	say
O	whatever
O	they
O	were
O	told
O	to
O	say
O	by
O	the
C	cat
O	who
O	had
O	taken
O	pains
O	to
O	inform
O	himself
O	of
O	all
O	about
O	the
C	Ogre
O	So
O	putting
O	on
O	the
O	boldest
O	face
O	he
O	could
O	assume
C	Puss
O	marched
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	with
O	his
O	boots
O	on
O	and
O	asked
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	owner
O	of
O	it
O	saying
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	on
O	his
O	travels
O	but
O	did
O	not
O	wish
O	to
O	pass
O	so
O	near
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	noble
O	gentleman
O	without
O	paying
O	his
O	respects
O	to
O	him
O	When
O	the
C	Ogre
O	heard
O	this
O	message
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	received
O	the
C	cat
O	as
O	civilly
O	as
O	an
C	Ogre
O	can
O	and
O	begged
O	him
O	to
O	walk
O	in
O	and
O	repose
O	himself
O	Thank
O	you
O	sir
O	said
O	the
C	cat
O	but
O	first
O	I
O	hope
O	you
O	will
O	satisfy
O	a
O	traveller
O	s
O	curiosity
O	I
O	have
O	heard
O	in
O	far
O	countries
O	of
O	your
O	many
O	remarkable
O	qualities
O	and
O	especially
O	how
O	you
O	have
O	the
O	power
O	to
O	change
O	yourself
O	into
O	any
O	sort
O	of
O	beast
O	you
O	choose
O	a
O	lion
O	for
O	instance
O	or
O	an
O	elephant
O	That
O	is
O	quite
O	true
O	replied
O	the
C	Ogre
O	and
O	lest
O	you
O	should
O	doubt
O	it
O	I
O	will
O	immediately
O	become
O	a
O	lion
O	He
O	did
O	so
O	and
O	the
C	cat
O	was
O	so
O	frightened
O	that
O	he
O	sprang
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	and
O	hid
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	gutter
O	a
O	proceeding
O	rather
O	inconvenient
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	boots
O	which
O	were
O	not
O	exactly
O	fitted
O	to
O	walk
O	with
O	upon
O	tiles
O	At
O	length
O	perceiving
O	that
O	the
C	Ogre
O	had
O	resumed
O	his
O	original
O	form
O	he
O	came
O	down
O	again
O	stealthily
O	and
O	confessed
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	very
O	much
O	frightened
O	But
O	sir
O	said
O	he
O	it
O	may
O	be
O	easy
O	enough
O	for
O	such
O	a
O	big
O	gentleman
O	as
O	you
O	to
O	change
O	himself
O	into
O	a
O	large
O	animal
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	suppose
O	you
O	can
O	become
O	a
O	small
O	one
O	a
O	rat
O	or
O	mouse
O	for
O	instance
O	I
O	have
O	heard
O	that
O	you
O	can
O	still
O	for
O	my
O	part
O	I
O	consider
O	it
O	quite
O	impossible
O	Impossible
O	cried
O	the
O	other
O	indignantly
O	You
O	shall
O	see
O	and
O	immediately
O	the
C	cat
O	saw
O	the
C	Ogre
O	no
O	longer
O	but
O	a
O	little
O	mouse
O	running
O	along
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	This
O	was
O	exactly
O	what
O	he
O	wanted
O	and
O	he
O	did
O	the
O	very
O	best
O	a
C	cat
O	could
O	do
O	and
O	the
O	most
O	natural
O	under
O	the
O	circumstances
O	he
O	sprang
O	upon
O	the
O	mouse
O	and
O	gobbled
O	it
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	trice
O	So
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	end
O	of
O	the
C	Ogre
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	the
C	king
O	had
O	arrived
O	opposite
O	the
O	castle
O	and
O	was
O	seized
O	with
O	a
O	strong
O	desire
O	to
O	enter
O	it
O	The
C	cat
O	hearing
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	the
O	ran
O	forward
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	hurry
O	and
O	standing
O	at
O	the
O	gate
O	said
O	in
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	Welcome
O	sire
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	my
O	lord
O	the
C	Marquis
C	of
C	Carabas
O	What
O	cried
O	his
O	majesty
O	very
O	much
O	surprised
O	does
O	the
O	castle
O	also
O	belong
O	to
O	you
O	Truly
C	Marquis
O	you
O	have
O	kept
O	your
O	secret
O	well
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	last
O	minute
O	I
O	have
O	never
O	seen
O	anything
O	finer
O	than
O	this
O	courtyard
O	and
O	these
O	battlements
O	Indeed
O	I
O	have
O	nothing
O	like
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	of
O	my
O	dominions
O	The
C	Marquis
O	without
O	speaking
O	offered
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	the
C	princess
O	to
O	assist
O	her
O	to
O	descend
O	and
O	standing
O	aside
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	might
O	enter
O	first
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	already
O	acquired
O	all
O	the
O	manners
O	of
O	a
O	court
O	followed
O	his
O	majesty
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	hall
O	where
O	a
O	magnificent
O	collation
O	was
O	laid
O	out
O	and
O	where
O	without
O	more
O	delay
O	they
O	all
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	feast
O	Before
O	the
O	banquet
O	was
O	over
O	the
C	king
O	charmed
O	with
O	the
O	good
O	qualities
O	of
O	the
C	Marquis
C	of
C	Carabas
O	and
O	likewise
O	with
O	his
O	wine
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	drunk
O	six
O	or
O	seven
O	cups
O	said
O	bowing
O	across
O	the
O	table
O	at
O	which
O	the
C	princess
O	and
O	the
O	miller
O	s
O	son
O	were
O	talking
O	very
O	confidentially
O	together
O	It
O	rests
O	with
O	you
C	Marquis
O	whether
O	you
O	will
O	not
O	become
O	my
O	I
O	shall
O	be
O	only
O	too
O	happy
O	said
O	the
O	complaisant
C	Marquis
O	and
O	the
C	princess
O	s
O	eyes
O	declared
O	the
O	same
O	So
O	they
O	were
O	married
O	the
O	very
O	next
O	day
O	and
O	took
O	possession
O	of
O	the
C	Ogre
O	s
O	castle
O	and
O	of
O	everything
O	that
O	had
O	belonged
O	to
O	him
O	As
O	for
O	the
C	cat
O	he
O	became
O	at
O	once
O	a

O	personage
O	and
O	had
O	never
O	more
O	any

O	to

O	after

O	except
O	for

O	diversion
O	THE
C	Wolf
O	AND
O	The
O	Seven
O	Young
C	Goslings
O	There
O	was
O	once
O	an
O	old
C	goose
O	who
O	had
O	seven
O	young
C	Goslings
O	and
O	loved
O	them
O	as
O	only
O	a
O	mother
O	can
O	love
O	her
O	children
O	One
O	day
O	she
O	was
O	going
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	to
O	seek
O	for
O	provender
O	and
O	before
O	setting
O	off
O	she
O	called
O	all
O	seven
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	said
O	Dear
O	children
O	I
O	am
O	obliged
O	to
O	go
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	so
O	be
O	on
O	your
O	guard
O	against
O	the
C	Wolf
O	for
O	if
O	he
O	gets
O	in
O	here
O	he
O	will
O	eat
O	you
O	up
O	feathers
O	skin
O	and
O	all
O	The
O	villain
O	often
O	disguises
O	himself
O	but
O	you
O	can
O	easily
O	recognise
O	him
O	by
O	his
O	rough
O	voice
O	and
O	black
O	paws
O	The
O	children
O	answered
O	Dear
O	mother
O	we
O	will
O	take
O	great
O	care
O	you
O	may
O	go
O	without
O	any
O	anxiety
O	So
O	the
O	old
O	lady
O	was
O	comforted
O	and
O	set
O	off
O	cheerfully
O	for
O	the
O	wood
O	Before
O	long
O	some
O	one
O	knocked
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	cried
O	Open
O	open
O	my
O	dear
O	children
O	your
O	mother
O	is
O	here
O	and
O	has
O	brought
O	something
O	for
O	each
O	of
O	you
O	But
O	the
C	Goslings
O	soon
O	perceived
O	by
O	the
O	rough
O	voice
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	the
C	Wolf
O	We
O	will
O	not
O	open
O	said
O	they
O	you
O	are
O	not
O	our
O	mother
O	for
O	she
O	has
O	a
O	sweet
O	and
O	lovely
O	voice
O	but
O	your
O	voice
O	is
O	rough
O	you
O	are
O	the
C	Wolf
O	Thereupon
O	the
C	Wolf
O	set
O	off
O	to
O	a
O	merchant
O	and
O	bought
O	a
O	large
O	lump
O	of
O	chalk
O	he
O	ate
O	it
O	and
O	it
O	made
O	his
O	voice
O	sweet
O	Back
O	he
O	came
O	knocked
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	cried
O	Open
O	open
O	my
O	dear
O	children
O	your
O	mother
O	is
O	here
O	and
O	has
O	brought
O	something
O	for
O	each
O	of
O	you
O	But
O	the
C	Wolf
O	had
O	laid
O	his
O	black
O	paw
O	on
O	the
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	children
O	saw
O	it
O	they
O	cried
O	We
O	will
O	not
O	open
O	our
O	mother
O	has
O	not
O	black
O	feet
O	like
O	you
O	you
O	are
O	the
C	Wolf
O	So
O	the
C	Wolf
O	ran
O	off
O	to
O	the
O	baker
O	and
O	said
O	I
O	have
O	hurt
O	my
O	foot
O	put
O	some
O	dough
O	on
O	it
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	baker
O	had
O	plastered
O	it
O	with
O	dough
O	the
C	Wolf
O	went
O	to
O	the
C	miller
O	and
O	cried
O	Strew
O	some
O	meal
O	on
O	my
O	paws
O	But
O	the
C	miller
O	thought
O	to
O	himself
O	The
C	Wolf
O	wants
O	to
O	deceive
O	some
O	one
O	and
O	he
O	hesitated
O	to
O	do
O	it
O	till
O	the
C	Wolf
O	said
O	If
O	you
O	don
O	t
O	do
O	it
O	at
O	once
O	I
O	will
O	eat
O	you
O	up
O	So
O	the
C	miller
O	was
O	afraid
O	and
O	made
O	his
O	paws
O	white
O	Such
O	is
O	the
O	way
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	Now
O	came
O	the
O	rogue
O	back
O	for
O	the
O	third
O	time
O	knocked
O	and
O	said
O	Open
O	the
O	door
O	dear
O	children
O	your
O	mother
O	has
O	come
O	home
O	and
O	has
O	brought
O	something
O	for
O	each
O	of
O	you
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	The
O	little
C	Goslings
O	cried
O	Show
O	us
O	your
O	paws
O	first
O	that
O	we
O	may
O	see
O	whether
O	you
O	are
O	indeed
O	our
O	mother
O	So
O	he
O	laid
O	his
O	paws
O	on
O	the
O	and
O	when
O	the
C	Goslings
O	saw
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	white
O	they
O	believed
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	right
O	and
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	who
O	should
O	come
O	in
O	but
O	the
C	Wolf
O	They
O	screamed
O	out
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	hide
O	themselves
O	one
O	jumped
O	under
O	the
O	table
O	another
O	into
O	the
O	bed
O	the
O	third
O	into
O	the
O	oven
O	the
O	fourth
O	ran
O	into
O	the
O	kitchen
O	the
O	fifth
O	hopped
O	into
O	a
O	chest
O	the
O	sixth
O	under
O	the
O	and
O	the
O	seventh
O	got
O	into
O	the
O	But
O	the
C	Wolf
O	seized
O	them
O	and
O	stood
O	on
O	no
O	ceremony
O	with
O	them
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	he
O	gobbled
O	them
O	all
O	up
O	except
O	the
O	youngest
O	who
O	being
O	in
O	the
O	he
O	couldn
O	t
O	find
O	When
O	the
C	Wolf
O	had
O	eaten
O	his
O	fill
O	he
O	strolled
O	forth
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	green
O	meadow
O	under
O	a
O	tree
O	and
O	went
O	fast
O	asleep
O	Not
O	long
O	after
O	back
O	came
O	the
O	old
C	goose
O	home
O	from
O	the
O	wood
O	but
O	what
O	alas
O	did
O	she
O	see
O	The
O	stood
O	wide
O	open
O	table
O	chairs
O	benches
O	were
O	all
O	overthrown
O	the

O	in
O	the

O	blankets
O	and
O	pillows
O	were
O	torn
O	off
O	the
O	bed
O	She
O	looked
O	for
O	her
O	children
O	but
O	nowhere
O	could
O	she
O	find
O	them
O	she
O	called
O	them
O	each
O	by
O	name
O	but
O	nobody
O	answered
O	At
O	last
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	youngest
O	a
O	little
O	squeaking
O	voice
O	answered
O	Dear
O	mother
O	I
O	am
O	in
O	the
O	She
O	pulled
O	him
O	out
O	and
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	how
O	the
C	Wolf
O	had
O	come
O	and
O	had
O	eaten
O	up
O	all
O	the
O	others
O	You
O	may
O	think
O	how
O	she
O	wept
O	for
O	her
O	dear
O	children
O	At
O	last
O	in
O	her
O	grief
O	she
O	went
O	out
O	and
O	the
O	youngest
C	gosling
O	ran
O	beside
O	her
O	And
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	meadow
O	there
O	lay
O	the
C	Wolf
O	under
O	the
O	tree
O	snoring
O	till
O	the
O	boughs
O	shook
O	She
O	walked
O	round
O	and
O	examined
O	him
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	till
O	she
O	perceived
O	that
O	something
O	was
O	moving
O	and
O	kicking
O	about
O	inside
O	him
O	Can
O	it
O	be
O	thought
O	she
O	that
O	my
O	poor
O	children
O	whom
O	he
O	has
O	swallowed
O	for
O	his
O	supper
O	are
O	yet
O	alive
O	So
O	she
O	sent
O	the
O	little
C	gosling
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	house
O	for
O	scissors
O	needle
O	and
O	thread
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	slit
O	up
O	the
O	monster
O	s
O	stomach
O	Scarcely
O	had
O	she
O	given
O	one
O	snip
O	when
O	out
O	came
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	a
C	gosling
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	cut
O	a
O	little
O	further
O	the
O	six
O	jumped
O	out
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	not
O	having
O	taken
O	the
O	least
O	hurt
O	because
O	the
O	greedy
O	monster
O	had
O	swallowed
O	them
O	down
O	whole
O	That
O	was
O	a
O	joy
O	They
O	embraced
O	their
O	mother
O	tenderly
O	and
O	skipped
O	about
O	as
O	lively
O	as
O	a
O	tailor
O	at
O	his
O	wedding
O	But
O	the
O	old
C	goose
O	said
O	Now
O	go
O	and
O	find
O	me
O	six
O	large
O	stones
O	which
O	we
O	will
O	put
O	inside
O	the
O	greedy
O	beast
O	while
O	he
O	is
O	still
O	asleep
O	So
O	the
C	Goslings
O	got
O	the
O	stones
O	in
O	all
O	haste
O	and
O	they
O	put
O	them
O	inside
O	the
C	Wolf
O	and
O	the
O	old
C	goose
O	sewed
O	him
O	up
O	again
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	hurry
O	while
O	he
O	never
O	once
O	moved
O	nor
O	took
O	any
O	notice
O	Now
O	when
O	the
C	Wolf
O	at
O	last
O	woke
O	up
O	and
O	got
O	upon
O	his
O	legs
O	he
O	found
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	thirsty
O	and
O	wished
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	spring
O	to
O	drink
O	But
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	move
O	the
O	stones
O	began
O	to
O	shake
O	and
O	rattle
O	inside
O	him
O	till
O	he
O	cried
O	What
O	s
O	this
O	rumbling
O	and
O	tumbling
O	What
O	s
O	this
O	rattling
O	like
O	bones
O	I
O	thought
O	I
O	had
O	eaten
O	six
O	little
O	geese
O	But
O	they
O	ve
O	turned
O	out
O	only
O	stones
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	spring
O	and
O	bent
O	down
O	his
O	head
O	to
O	drink
O	the
O	heavy
O	stones
O	overbalanced
O	him
O	and
O	in
O	he
O	went
O	head
O	over
O	heels
O	Now
O	when
O	the
O	seven
C	Goslings
O	saw
O	this
O	they
O	came
O	running
O	up
O	crying
O	loudly
O	The
C	Wolf
O	is
O	dead
O	the
C	Wolf
O	is
O	dead
O	and
O	danced
O	for
O	joy
O	all
O	round
O	the
O	spring
O	and
O	their
O	mother
O	with
O	them
O	I
O	heard
O	a
O	voice
O	that
O	cried
C	Baldur
O	the

O	Is
O	dead
O	is
O	dead
O	And
O	through

O	cry
O	Of

O	sailing
O	cranes
O	Longfellow
O	Among
O	the

O	of
O	Greece
O	we
O	find

O	unworthy
O	deeds
O	but
O	none
O	to

O	In

O	by

O	a

O	and
O	tracing
O	those

O	why
C	Hel

O	to

O	asked
O	the

O	great
O	wrath
O	in

O	And
O	the
O	prophetess
O	replied

O	should
O	be
O	avenged
O	by
O	Vali
O	his

O	until
O	he
O	had
O	brought
O	the
O	slayer
O	of
C	Baldur
O	to
O	the

O	pyre
O	But
O	yet
O	another
O	question
C	Odin
O	would
O	fain
O	have
O	answered
O	he
O	asked
O	refuse
O	to

O	at
C	Baldur
O	s
O	death
O	Thereat
O	the
O	prophetess
O	knowing
O	that

O	could
O	be
O	none
O	other
O	than
C	Odin
O	for
O	to
O	no
O	mortal
O	man
O	could
O	be
O	known
O	so
O	much
O	of

O	refused
O	for

O	to
O	speak
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	silence
O	of
O	her
O	tomb
O	And
C	Odin
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	mount
O	his
O	steed
O	and
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	land
O	of
O	warmth
O	and
O	pleasure
O	On
O	his
O	return
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	all
O	was
O	well
O	with
C	Baldur
O	Thus
O	he
O	tried
O	to
O	still
O	his
O	anxious
O	heart
O	and
O	to
O	forget
O	the
O	feast
O	in
O	the
O	chill
O	regions
O	of
O	Niflheim
O	spread
O	for
O	the
O	son
O	who
O	was
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	dearest
O	and
O	to
O	laugh
O	with
O	those
O	who
O	tried
O	in
O	vain
O	to
O	bring
O	scathe
O	to
C	Baldur
O	Only
O	one
O	among
O	those
O	who
O	looked
O	at
O	those
O	sports
O	and
O	grew
O	merry
O	as
O	he
O	whom
O	they
O	loved
O	stood
O	like
O	a
O	great
O	cliff
O	against
O	which
O	the
O	devouring
O	waves
O	of
O	the
O	fierce
O	North
O	Sea
O	beat
O	and
O	foam
O	and
O	crash
O	in
O	vain
O	had
O	malice
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	as
O	he
O	beheld
O	the
O	wonder
O	In
O	the
O	evil
O	heart
O	of
C	Loki
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	desire
O	to
O	overthrow
O	the
O	god
O	who
O	was
O	beloved
O	by
O	all
O	gods
O	and
O	by
O	all
O	men
O	He
O	hated
O	him
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	pure
O	and
O	the
O	mind
O	of
C	Loki
O	was
O	as
O	a
O	stream
O	into
O	which
O	all
O	the
O	filth
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	is
O	discharged
O	He
O	hated
O	him
O	because
C	Baldur
O	was
O	truth
O	and
O	loyalty
O	and
O	he
C	Loki
O	was
O	treachery
O	and
O	dishonour
O	He
O	hated
O	him
O	because
O	to
C	Loki
O	there
O	came
O	never
O	a
O	thought
O	that
O	was
O	not
O	full
O	of
O	meanness
O	and
O	greed
O	and
O	cruelty
O	and
O	vice
O	and
C	Baldur
O	was
O	indeed
O	one
O	peur
O	et
O	sans
O	Thus
C	Loki
O	taking
O	upon
O	himself
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	a
O	woman
O	went
O	to
O	Fensalir
O	the
O	palace
O	all
O	silver
O	and
O	gold
O	where
O	dwelt
C	Freya
O	the
O	mother
O	of
C	Baldur
O	The
O	goddess
O	sat
O	in
O	happy
O	majesty
O	spinning
O	the
O	clouds
O	and
O	when
C	Loki
O	apparently
O	a
O	gentle
O	old
O	woman
O	passed
O	by
O	where
O	she
O	sat
O	and
O	then
O	paused
O	and
O	asked
O	as
O	if
O	amazed
O	what
O	were
O	the
O	shouts
O	of
O	merriment
O	that
O	she
O	heard
O	the
O	smiling
O	goddess
O	replied
O	All
O	things
O	on
O	earth
O	have
O	sworn
O	to
O	me
O	never
O	to
O	injure
C	Baldur
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	gods
O	use
O	their
O	weapons
O	against
O	him
O	in
O	vain
C	Baldur
O	is
O	safe
O	for
O	evermore
O	All
O	things
O	queried
C	Loki
O	And
C	Freya
O	answered
O	All
O	things
O	but
O	the
O	mistletoe
O	No
O	harm
O	can
O	come
O	to
O	him
O	from
O	a
O	thing
O	so
O	weak
O	that
O	it
O	only
O	lives
O	by
O	the
O	lives
O	of
O	others
O	Then
O	the
O	vicious
O	heart
O	of
C	Loki
O	grew
O	joyous
O	Quickly
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	mistletoe
O	grew
O	cut
O	a
O	slender
O	green
O	branch
O	shaped
O	it
O	into
O	a
O	point
O	and
O	sought
O	the
O	blind
O	god
C	Hodur
C	Hodur
O	stood
O	aside
O	while
O	the
O	other
O	gods
O	merrily
O	pursued
O	their
O	sport
O	Why
O	dost
O	thou
O	not
O	take
O	aim
O	at
C	Baldur
O	with
O	a
O	weapon
O	that
O	fails
O	and
O	so
O	join
O	in
O	the
O	laughter
O	asked
C	Loki
O	And
C	Hodur
O	sadly
O	made
O	answer
O	Well
O	dost
O	thou
O	know
O	that
O	darkness
O	is
O	my
O	lot
O	nor
O	have
O	I
O	ought
O	to
O	cast
O	at
O	my
O	brother
O	Then
C	Loki
O	placed
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	the
O	shaft
O	of
O	mistletoe
O	and
O	guided
O	his
O	aim
O	and
O	well
O	and
O	surely
C	Hodur
O	cast
O	the
O	dart
O	He
O	waited
O	then
O	for
O	the
O	merry
O	laughter
O	that
O	followed
O	ever
O	on
O	the
O	onslaught
O	of
O	those
O	against
O	him
O	whom
O	none
O	could

O	But

O	The
O	sound
O	of
O	terrible
O	mourning
O	in

O	of

O	brought
C	Freya
O	to
O	where
O	on
O	the

O	lay
C	Baldur
O	dead
O	and

C	Freya

O	grief
O	was
O	a
O	grief

O	as
O	he
O	came
O	near
O	it
O	there
O	suddenly
O	rose
O	a
O	violent
O	wind
O	and
O	the
O	sea
O	rolled
O	every
O	moment
O	higher
O	and
O	higher
O	He
O	turned
O	about
O	with
O	a
O	view
O	of
O	approaching
O	it
O	on
O	another
O	side
O	but
O	with
O	no
O	better
O	success
O	his
O	vessel
O	as
O	often
O	as
O	it
O	neared
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	driven
O	back
O	as
O	if
O	by
O	an
O	invisible
O	power
O	God
O	help
O	us
O	he
O	cried
O	and
O	crossed
O	himself
O	and
O	looked
O	on
O	poor
C	Aslog
O	who
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	dying
O	of
O	weakness
O	before
O	his
O	eyes
O	But
O	scarcely
O	had
O	the
O	exclamation
O	passed
O	his
O	lips
O	when
O	the
O	storm
O	ceased
O	the
O	waves
O	subsided
O	and
O	the
O	vessel
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	without
O	encountering
O	any
O	hindrance
C	Orm
O	jumped
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	some
O	mussels
O	that
O	he
O	found
O	on
O	the
O	strand
O	strengthened
O	and
O	revived
O	the
O	exhausted
C	Aslog
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	soon
O	able
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	boat
O	The
O	island
O	was
O	overgrown
O	with
O	low
O	dwarf
O	shrubs
O	and
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	uninhabited
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	it
O	they
O	discovered
O	a
O	house
O	which
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	half
O	under
O	the
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	In
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	meeting
O	with
O	human
O	help
O	the
O	wanderers
O	approached
O	it
O	They
O	listened
O	but
O	the
O	most
O	perfect
O	silence
O	reigned
O	there
C	Orm
O	at
O	length
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	they
O	both
O	walked
O	in
O	but
O	what
O	was
O	their
O	surprise
O	to
O	find
O	everything
O	regulated
O	and
O	arranged
O	as
O	if
O	for
O	inhabitants
O	yet
O	not
O	a
O	single
O	living
O	creature
O	visible
O	The
O	fire
O	was
O	burning
O	on
O	the
O	hearth
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	and
O	a
O	kettle
O	with
O	fish
O	hung
O	on
O	it
O	apparently
O	only
O	waiting
O	for
O	some
O	one
O	to
O	take
O	it
O	up
O	and
O	eat
O	it
O	The
O	beds
O	were
O	made
O	and
O	ready
O	to
O	receive
O	their
O	wearied
O	tenants
C	Orm
O	and
C	Aslog
O	stood
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	dubious
O	and
O	looked
O	on
O	with
O	a
O	certain
O	degree
O	of
O	awe
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	overcome
O	by
O	hunger
O	they
O	took
O	up
O	the
O	food
O	and
O	ate
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	satisfied
O	their
O	appetites
O	and
O	still
O	discovered
O	no
O	human
O	being
O	they
O	gave
O	way
O	to
O	weariness
O	and
O	laid
O	themselves
O	in
O	the
O	beds
O	which
O	looked
O	so
O	peaceful
O	and
O	inviting
O	to
O	their
O	wearied
O	limbs
O	They
O	had
O	expected
O	to
O	be
O	awakened
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	by
O	the
O	owners
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	on
O	their
O	return
O	home
O	but
O	their
O	expectation
O	was
O	not
O	fulfilled
O	they
O	slept
O	undisturbed
O	till
O	the
O	morning
O	sun
O	shone
O	in
O	upon
O	them
O	No
O	one
O	appeared
O	on
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	following
O	days
O	and
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	some
O	invisible
O	power
O	had
O	made
O	ready
O	the
O	house
O	for
O	their
O	reception
O	They
O	spent
O	the
O	whole
O	summer
O	in
O	perfect
O	happiness
O	they
O	were
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	solitary
O	yet
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	miss
O	mankind
O	The
O	wild
O	birds
O	eggs
O	and
O	the
O	fish
O	they
O	caught
O	yielded
O	them
O	provisions
O	in
O	abundance
O	When
O	autumn
O	came
C	Aslog
O	brought
O	forth
O	a
O	son
O	In
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	their
O	joy
O	at
O	this
O	they
O	were
O	surprised
O	by
O	a
O	wonderful
O	apparition
O	The
O	door
O	opened
O	on
O	a
O	sudden
O	and
O	an
O	old
O	woman
O	stepped
O	in
O	She
O	wore
O	a
O	handsome
O	blue
O	dress
O	there
O	was
O	something
O	proud
O	but
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	something
O	strange
O	in
O	her
O	appearance
O	Do
O	not
O	be
O	afraid
O	said
O	she
O	at
O	my
O	unexpected
O	appearance
O	I
O	am
O	the
O	owner
O	of
O	this
O	house

O	I
O	thank

O	You

O	the

O	on
O	Yule
O	evening
O	when
O	the

O	and
O	then
O	only
O	are
O	we
O	permitted
O	to
O	be
O	merry
O	At
O	least
O	if
O	you
O	should
O	not
O	be
O	willing
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	of
O	the

O	keep
O	yourselves
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	loft
O	as
O	quiet
O	as
O	possible
O	the
O	whole
O	day
O	long
O	and
O	as

O	value
O	your

O	do
O	not
O	look
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	below
O	until
O	midnight
O	is
O	past
O	After
O	that
O	you
O	may
O	take
O	possession
O	of
O	everything
O	again
O	When
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	had
O	thus
O	spoken
O	she
O	vanished
O	and
C	Aslog
O	and
C	Orm
O	lived
O	without
O	any
O	disturbance
O	contented
O	and
O	happy
C	Orm
O	never
O	made
O	a
O	cast
O	of
O	his
O	net
O	without
O	getting
O	a
O	plentiful
O	draught
O	he
O	never
O	shot
O	an
O	arrow
O	from
O	his
O	bow
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	sure
O	to
O	hit
O	in
O	short
O	whatever
O	they
O	took
O	in
O	hand
O	were
O	it
O	ever
O	so
O	trifling
O	evidently
O	prospered
O	When
O	Christmas
O	came
O	they
O	cleaned
O	up
O	the
O	house
O	in
O	the
O	best
O	manner
O	set
O	everything
O	in
O	order
O	kindled
O	a
O	fire
O	on
O	the
O	hearth
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	twilight
O	approached
O	they
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	loft
O	where
O	they
O	remained
O	quite
O	still
O	and
O	quiet
O	At
O	length
O	it
O	grew
O	dark
O	they
O	thought
O	they
O	heard
O	a
O	sound
O	of
O	whizzing
O	and
O	snorting
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	such
O	as
O	the
O	swans
O	used
O	to
O	make
O	in
O	the
O	winter
O	time
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	roof
O	over
O	the
O	fireplace
O	which
O	might
O	be
O	opened
O	and
O	shut
O	either
O	to
O	let
O	in
O	the
O	light
O	from
O	above
O	or
O	to
O	afford
O	a
O	free
O	passage
O	for
O	the
O	smoke
C	Orm
O	lifted
O	up
O	the
O	lid
O	which
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	a
O	skin
O	and
O	put
O	out
O	his
O	head
O	But
O	what
O	a
O	wonderful
O	sight
O	then
O	presented
O	itself
O	to
O	his
O	eyes
O	The
O	little
O	islands
O	around
O	were
O	all
O	lit
O	up
O	with
O	countless
O	blue
O	lights
O	which
O	moved
O	about
O	without
O	ceasing
O	jumped
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	then
O	skipped
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	assembled
O	together
O	and
O	came
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	to
O	the
O	large
O	island
O	where
C	Orm
O	and
C	Aslog
O	lived
O	At
O	last
O	they
O	reached
O	it
O	and
O	arranged
O	themselves
O	in
O	a
O	circle
O	around
O	a
O	large
O	stone
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	the
O	shore
O	and
O	which
C	Orm
O	well
O	knew
O	But
O	what
O	was
O	his
O	surprise
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	stone
O	had
O	now
O	completely
O	assumed
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	though
O	a
O	monstrous
O	and
O	gigantic
O	one
O	He
O	could
O	clearly
O	perceive
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	blue
O	lights
O	were
O	borne
O	by
C	Dwarfs
O	whose
O	pale
O	faces
O	with
O	their
O	huge
O	noses
O	and
O	red
O	eyes
O	disfigured
O	too
O	by
O	birds
O	bills
O	and
O	owls
O	eyes
O	were
O	supported
O	by
O	misshapen
O	bodies
O	and
O	they
O	tottered
O	and
O	wabbled
O	about
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	merry
O	and
O	in
O	pain
O	Suddenly
O	the
O	circle
O	opened
O	the
O	little
O	ones
O	retired
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	and
C	Guru
O	was
O	the
O	woman
C	Guru
O	whom
C	Orm
O	recognised
O	immediately
O	though
O	she
O	had
O	risen
O	in
O	stature
O	and
O	size
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	be
O	almost
O	as
O	gigantic
O	as
O	the
O	stone
O	man
O	advanced
O	towards
O	it
O	She
O	threw
O	both
O	her
O	arms
O	round
O	the
O	image
O	which
O	immediately
O	seemed
O	to
O	receive
O	life
O	and
O	motion
O	Then
O	the
C	Dwarfs
O	with
O	wonderful
O	capers
O	and
O	grimaces
O	began
O	a
O	song
O	or
O	to
O	speak
O	more
O	properly
O	a
O	howl
O	with
O	which
O	the
O	whole
O	island
O	resounded
O	and
O	almost
O	trembled
O	at
O	the
O	noise
C	Orm
O	quite
O	terrified
O	drew
O	in
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	he
O	and
C	Aslog
O	remained
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	so
O	still
O	that
O	they
O	hardly
O	ventured
O	to
O	draw
O	their
O	breath
O	The
O	procession
O	moved
O	on
O	towards
O	the
O	house
O	as
O	might
O	be
O	clearly
O	perceived
O	by
O	the
O	nearer
O	approach
O	of
O	the
O	shouting
O	and
O	crying
O	They
O	were
O	now
O	all
O	come
O	in
O	light
O	and
O	active
O	the
C	Dwarfs
O	were
O	heard
O	jumping
O	about
O	on
O	the
O	benches
O	and
O	heavy
O	and
O	loud
O	sounded
O	at
O	intervals
O	the
O	steps
O	of
O	the
O	giants
C	Orm
O	and
O	his
O	wife

O	joy
O	with

O	have
O	heard
O	in

O	to
O	the

O	As
O	soon

C	Aslog

O	she

O	an
O	irresistible
O	longing

O	Nor

O	took
O	her

O	herself
O	at

O	end
O	of
O	the

O	whence
O	without

O	she
O	could
O	see
O	all

O	without
O	taking
O	off
O	her
O	eyes
O	for
O	an
O	instant
O	on
O	the
O	dance
O	on
O	the
O	bold
O	and
O	wonderful
O	springs
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	creatures
O	who
O	seemed
O	to

O	promise
O	she

O	ere
O	I

O	came
O	the

O	and
O	quiet
O	and

O	called

O	the
O	Holy
O	and
C	Andfind
O	instantly

O	that
O	his
O	voyage
O	would
O	be
O	inauspicious
O	to
O	the
O	Giants
O	When
O	he
O	heard
O	how
C	Oluf
O	s
O	ship
O	rushed
O	through
O	the
O	waves
O	he
O	went
O	down

O	against

O	with

O	strength
O	The
O	waves
O	swelled
O	up
O	like

O	than
O	he
O	his
O	ship
O	flew
O	unchecked
O	through
O	the
O	billows
O	like

O	grasped
O	at
O	the

O	with

O	right
O	hand
O	and
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	drag

O	down
O	to
O	the

O	as
O	he
O	had
O	often
O	done
O	with

O	But
C	Oluf
O	the

O	stepped
O	forward

O	till

O	instant
O	my
O	unhappy

O	became
O	a
O	mass
O	of

O	The

O	sailed
O	on
O	unimpeded

O	married
O	a
O	woman
O	as
O	poor

O	himself
O	and
O	lived
O	by
O	cutting

O	upon
O	three

O	into

O	day
O	when

O	enough

O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	a
O	great
O	cloud
O	of
O	dust
O	which
O	seemed
O	to
O	approach
O	him

O	observed
O	it
O	with
O	attention
O	and

O	soon
O	after
O	a
O	body
O	of
O	horsemen
O	whom
O	he
O	suspected
O	might

C	robbers
O	He
O	determined
O	to
O	leave
O	his
O	asses
O	to

O	He
O	climbed
O	up
O	a

O	rock
O	whose

O	enough
O	to

O	to

O	all
O	that

O	The

O	to
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	to
O	be
O	full
O	of
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	from

O	was
O	concealed

O	through

O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the

O	of

O	had
O	thus
O	spoken
O	a

O	shut
O	again
O	of

O	The
C	robbers
O	stayed
O	some
O	time
O	within
O	the
O	rock
O	during
O	which
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	fearful
O	of
O	being
O	caught
O	remained
O	in
O	the

O	At

O	the

O	opened
O	again
O	and
O	as

O	went
O	in

O	so
O	he
O	came
O	out
O	first
O	and
O	stood
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	all
O	pass
O	by
O	him
O	when
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	heard

O	make
O	the

O	close
O	by

O	these

O	Shut
C	Sesame
O	Every

O	at
O	once
O	went
O	and
O	bridled
O	his
O	horse
O	fastened
O	his
O	wallet
O	and
O	mounted
O	again
O	When
O	the
C	captain
O	saw
O	them
O	all
O	ready
O	he
O	put
O	himself
O	at

O	and
O	they
O	returned
O	the

O	they
O	had
O	come
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	followed
O	them
O	with
O	his
O	eyes
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	them
O	and
O	afterward
O	stayed
O	a
O	considerable
O	time
O	before
O	he
O	descended
O	Remembering
O	the
O	words
O	the
C	captain
O	of
O	the
C	robbers
O	used
O	to
O	cause
O	the
O	door
O	to

O	he
O	had
O	the
O	curiosity
O	to
O	try
O	if
O	his
O	pronouncing
O	them
O	would
O	have
O	the
O	same
O	effect
O	Accordingly
O	he
O	went
O	among
O	the
O	shrubs
O	and
O	perceiving
O	the
O	door
O	concealed
O	behind
O	them
O	stood
O	before
O	it
O	and
O	said
O	Open
C	Sesame
O	The
O	door
O	instantly
O	flew
O	wide
O	open
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	who
O	expected
O	a
O	dark
O	dismal
O	cavern
O	was
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	and
O	spacious
O	chamber
O	which
O	received
O	the
O	light
O	from
O	an
O	opening
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	rock
O	and
O	in
O	which
O	were
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	provisions
O	rich
O	bales
O	of

O	silver
O	ingots
O	in
O	great
O	heaps
O	and
O	money
O	in
O	bags
O	The
O	sight
O	of
O	all
O	these
O	riches
O	made
O	him
O	suppose
O	that
O	this
O	cave
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	occupied
O	for
O	ages
O	by
C	robbers
O	who
O	had
O	succeeded
O	one
O	another
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	went
O	boldly
O	into
O	the
O	cave
O	and
O	collected
O	as
O	much
O	of
O	the
O	gold
O	coin
O	which
O	was
O	in
O	bags
O	as
O	he
O	thought
O	his
O	three
O	asses
O	could
O	carry
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	loaded
O	them
O	with
O	the
O	bags
O	he
O	laid
O	wood
O	over
O	them
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	manner
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	seen
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	passed
O	in
O	and
O	out
O	as
O	often
O	as
O	he
O	wished
O	he
O	stood
O	before
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	pronouncing
O	the
O	words
O	Shut
C	Sesame
O	the
O	door
O	closed
O	of
O	itself
O	He
O	then
O	made
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	town
O	When
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	got
O	home
O	he
O	drove
O	his
O	asses
O	into
O	a
O	little
O	yard
O	shut
O	the
O	gates
O	very
O	carefully
O	threw
O	off
O	the
O	wood
O	that
O	covered
O	the
O	panniers
O	carried
O	the
O	bags
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	ranged
O	them
O	in
O	order
O	before
O	his
O	wife
O	He
O	then
O	emptied
O	the
O	bags
O	which
O	raised
O	such
O	a
O	great
O	heap
O	of
O	gold
O	as
O	dazzled
O	his
O	wife
O	s
O	eyes
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	the
O	whole
O	adventure
O	from
O	beginning
O	to
O	end
O	and
O	above
O	all
O	recommended
O	her
O	to
O	keep
O	it
O	secret
O	The

O	rejoiced
O	greatly
O	at

O	his
O	wife
O	wanted
O	to

O	he
O	all
O	this
O	wealth
C	Cassim
O	her
O	husband
O	was
O	at
O	his
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	home
O	his
O	wife
O	said
O	to
O	him
C	Cassim
O	I
O	know
O	you
O	think
O	yourself
O	rich
O	but
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	is
O	infinitely
O	richer
O	than
O	you
O	He
O	does
O	not
O	count
O	his
O	money
O	but
O	measures
O	it
C	Cassim
O	desired
O	her
O	to
O	explain
O	the
O	riddle
O	which
O	she
O	did
O	by
O	telling
O	him
O	the
O	stratagem
O	she
O	had
O	used
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	discovery
O	and
O	showed
O	him
O	the
O	piece
O	of
O	money
O	which
O	was
O	so
O	old
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	in
O	what
O	prince
O	s

O	it
O	was
O	coined
C	Cassim
O	after
O	he

O	had
O	never
O	treated
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	as
O	a

O	but
O	neglected
O	him
O	and
O	now
O	instead
O	of
O	being
O	pleased
O	he
O	conceived
O	a
O	base
O	envy
O	at
O	his
O	brother
O	s
O	prosperity
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	sleep
O	all
O	that
O	night
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	before
O	sunrise
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	said
O	he
O	I
O	am
O	surprised
O	at
O	you
O	you
O	pretend
O	to
O	be
O	miserably
O	poor
O	and
O	yet
O	you
O	measure
O	gold
O	My
O	wife
O	found
O	this
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	measure
O	you
O	borrowed
O	yesterday
O	By
O	this
O	discourse
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	perceived
O	that
C	Cassim
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	through
O	his
O	own
O	wife
O	s
O	folly
O	knew
O	what
O	they
O	had
O	so
O	much
O	reason
O	to
O	conceal
O	but
O	what
O	was
O	done
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	undone
O	Therefore
O	without
O	showing
O	the
O	least
O	surprise
O	or
O	trouble
O	he
O	confessed
O	all
O	and
O	offered
O	his
O	brother
O	part
O	of
O	his
O	treasure
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	secret
O	I
O	expect
O	as
O	much
O	replied
C	Cassim
O	haughtily
O	but
O	I
O	must
O	know
O	exactly
O	where
O	this
O	treasure
O	is
O	and
O	how
O	I
O	may
O	visit
O	it
O	myself
O	when
O	I
O	choose
O	otherwise
O	I
O	will

C	Ali
C	Baba
O	told
O	him
O	all
O	he
O	desired
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	very
O	words
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	use
O	to
O	gain
O	admission
O	into
O	the
O	cave
C	Cassim
O	rose
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	long
O	before
O	the
O	sun
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	for
O	the
O	forest
O	with
O	ten
O	mules
O	bearing
O	great
O	chests
O	which
O	he
O	designed
O	to
O	fill
O	and
O	followed
O	the
O	road
O	which
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	had
O	pointed
O	out
O	to
O	him
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	rock
O	and
O	found
O	out
O	the
O	place
O	by
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	other
O	marks
O	which
O	his
O	brother
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	When
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	entrance
O	of
O	the
O	cavern
O	he
O	pronounced
O	the
O	words
O	Open
C	Sesame
O	The
O	door
O	immediately
O	opened
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	closed
O	upon
O	him
O	On
O	examining
O	the
O	cave
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	great
O	admiration
O	to
O	find
O	much
O	more
O	riches
O	than
O	he
O	had
O	expected
O	from
O	Ali
O	Baba
O	s
O	relation
O	He
O	quickly
O	laid
O	as
O	many
O	bags
O	of
O	gold
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	carry
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	cavern
O	but
O	his
O	thoughts
O	were
O	so
O	full
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	riches
O	he
O	should
O	possess
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	think
O	of
O	the
O	necessary
O	word
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	open
O	and
O	instead
O	of
C	Sesame
O	said
O	Open
O	Barley
O	and
O	was
O	much
O	amazed
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	the
O	door
O	remained
O	fast
O	shut
O	He
O	named
O	several
O	sorts
O	of
O	grain
O	but
O	still
O	the
O	door
O	would
O	not
O	open
C	Cassim
O	had
O	never
O	expected
O	such
O	an
O	incident
O	and
O	was
O	so
O	alarmed
O	at
O	the
O	danger
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	that
O	the
O	more
O	he
O	endeavored
O	to
O	remember
O	the
O	word
C	Sesame
O	the
O	more
O	his
O	memory
O	was
O	confounded
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	as
O	much
O	forgotten
O	it
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	heard
O	it
O	mentioned
O	He
O	threw
O	down
O	the
O	bags
O	he
O	had
O	loaded
O	himself
O	with
O	and
O	walked
O	distractedly
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	cave
O	without
O	having
O	the
O	least
O	regard
O	to
O	the
O	riches
O	that
O	were
O	round
O	him
O	About
O	noon
O	the
C	robbers
O	visited
O	their
O	cave
O	At
O	some
O	distance
O	they
O	saw
O	Cassim
O	s
O	mules
O	straggling
O	about
O	the
O	rock
O	with
O	great
O	chests
O	on
O	their
O	backs
O	Alarmed
O	at
O	this
O	they
O	galloped
O	full
O	speed
O	to
O	the
O	cave
O	They
O	drove
O	away
O	the
O	mules
O	who
O	strayed
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	so
O	far
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	soon
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	and
O	went
O	directly
O	with
O	their
O	naked
O	sabres
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	which
O	on
O	their
C	captain
O	pronouncing
O	the
O	proper
O	words
O	immediately
O	opened
C	Cassim
O	who
O	heard
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	the
O	horses
O	feet
O	at
O	once
O	guessed
O	the
O	arrival
O	of
O	the
C	robbers
O	and
O	resolved
O	to
O	make
O	one
O	effort
O	for
O	his
O	life
O	He
O	rushed
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	no
O	sooner
O	saw
O	the
O	door
O	open
O	than
O	he
O	ran
O	out
O	and
O	threw
O	the
O	leader
O	down
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	escape
O	the
O	other
C	robbers
O	who
O	with
O	their
O	cimeters
O	soon
O	deprived
O	him
O	of
O	life
O	The
O	first
O	care
O	of
O	the
C	robbers
O	after
O	this
O	was
O	to
O	examine
O	the
O	cave
O	They
O	found
O	all
O	the
O	bags
O	which
C	Cassim
O	had
O	brought
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	to
O	be
O	ready
O	to
O	load
O	his
O	mules
O	and
O	carried
O	them
O	again
O	to
O	their
O	places
O	but
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	miss
O	what
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	had
O	taken
O	away
O	before
O	Then
O	holding
O	a
O	council
O	and
O	deliberating
O	upon
O	this
O	occurrence
O	they
O	guessed
O	that
C	Cassim
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	out
O	again
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	imagine
O	how
O	he
O	had
O	learned
O	the
O	secret
O	words
O	by
O	which
O	alone
O	he
O	could
O	enter
O	They
O	could
O	not
O	deny
O	the
O	fact
O	of
O	his
O	being
O	there
O	and
O	to
O	terrify
O	any
O	person
O	or
O	accomplice
O	who
O	should
O	attempt
O	the
O	same
O	thing
O	they
O	agreed
O	to
O	cut
C	Cassim
O	s
O	body
O	into
O	four
O	quarters
O	to
O	hang
O	two
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	and
O	two
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	within
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	cave
O	They
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	taken
O	this
O	resolution
O	than
O	they
O	put
O	it
O	in
O	execution
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	nothing
O	more
O	to
O	detain
O	them
O	left
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	their
O	hoards
O	well
O	closed
O	They
O	mounted
O	their
O	horses
O	went
O	to
O	beat
O	the
O	roads
O	again
O	and
O	to
O	attack
O	the
O	caravans
O	they
O	might
O	meet
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
C	Cassim
C	s
C	wife
O	was
O	very
O	uneasy
O	when
O	night
O	came
O	and
O	her
O	husband
O	was
O	not
O	returned
O	She
O	ran
O	to
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	in
O	great
O	alarm
O	and
O	said
O	I
O	believe
O	that
O	you
O	know
C	Cassim
O	is
O	gone
O	to
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	upon
O	what
O	account
O	it
O	is
O	now
O	night
O	and
O	he
O	has
O	not
O	returned
O	I
O	am
O	afraid
O	some
O	misfortune
O	has
O	happened
O	to
O	him
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	need
O	not
O	frighten
O	herself
O	for
O	that
O	certainly
C	Cassim
O	would
O	not
O	think
O	it
O	proper
O	to
O	come
O	into
O	the
O	town
O	till
O	the
O	night
O	should
O	be
O	pretty
O	far
O	advanced
C	Cassim
C	s
C	wife
O	considering
O	how
O	much
O	it
O	concerned
O	her
O	husband
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	business
O	secret
O	was
O	the
O	more
O	easily
O	persuaded
O	to
O	believe
O	her
O	She
O	went
O	home
O	again
O	and
O	waited
O	patiently
O	till
O	midnight
O	Then
O	her
O	fear
O	redoubled
O	and
O	her
O	grief
O	was
O	the
O	more
O	sensible
O	because
O	she
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	keep
O	it
O	to
O	herself
O	She
O	repented
O	of
O	her
O	foolish
O	curiosity
O	and
O	cursed
O	her
O	desire
O	of
O	prying
O	into
O	the
O	affairs
O	of
O	her
O	brother
O	and
O	She
O	spent
O	all
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	weeping
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	day
O	went
O	to
O	them
O	telling
O	them
O	by
O	her
O	tears
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	her
O	coming
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	did
O	not
O	wait
O	for
O	his
O	to
O	desire
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	was
O	become
O	of
C	Cassim
O	but
O	departed
O	immediately
O	with
O	his
O	three
O	asses
O	begging
O	of
O	her
O	first
O	to
O	moderate
O	her
O	affliction
O	He
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	near
O	the
O	rock
O	having
O	seen
O	neither
O	his
O	brother
O	nor
O	the
O	mules
O	in
O	his
O	way
O	was
O	seriously
O	alarmed
O	at
O	finding
O	some
O	blood
O	spilled
O	near
O	the
O	door
O	which
O	he
O	took
O	for
O	an
O	ill
O	omen
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	pronounced
O	the
O	word
O	and
O	the
O	door
O	had
O	opened
O	he
O	was
O	struck
O	with
O	horror
O	at
O	the
O	dismal
O	sight
O	of
O	his
O	brother
O	s
O	body
O	He
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	in
O	determining
O	how
O	he
O	should
O	pay
O	the
O	last
O	dues
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	but
O	without
O	adverting
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	fraternal
O	affection
O	he
O	had
O	shown
O	for
O	him
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	cave
O	to
O	find
O	something
O	to
O	enshroud
O	his
O	remains
O	and
O	having
O	loaded
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	asses
O	with
O	them
O	covered
O	them
O	over
O	with
O	wood
O	The
O	other
O	two
O	asses
O	he
O	loaded
O	with
O	bags
O	of
O	gold
O	covering
O	them
O	with
O	wood
O	also
O	as
O	before
O	and
O	then
O	bidding
O	the
O	door
O	shut
O	came
O	away
O	but
O	was
O	so
O	cautious
O	as
O	to
O	stop
O	some
O	time
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	not
O	go
O	into
O	the
O	town
O	before
O	night
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	home
O	he
O	drove
O	the
O	two
O	asses
O	loaded
O	with
O	gold
O	into
O	his
O	little
O	yard
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	care
O	of
O	unloading
O	them
O	to
O	his
O	wife
O	while
O	he
O	led
O	the
O	other
O	to
O	his
O	s
O	house
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	knocked
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	which
O	was
O	opened
O	by
C	Morgiana
O	a
O	clever
O	intelligent
O	slave
O	who
O	was
O	fruitful
O	in
O	inventions
O	to
O	meet
O	the
O	most
O	difficult
O	circumstances
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	court
O	he
O	unloaded
O	the
O	ass
O	and
O	taking
C	Morgiana
O	aside
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	You
O	must
O	observe
O	an
O	inviolable
O	secrecy
O	Your
O	master
O	s
O	body
O	is
O	contained
O	in
O	these
O	two
O	panniers
O	We
O	must
O	bury
O	him
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	died
O	a
O	natural
O	death
O	Go
O	now
O	and
O	tell
O	your
O	mistress
O	I
O	leave
O	the
O	matter
O	to
O	your
O	wit
O	and
O	skilful
O	devices
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	helped
O	to
O	place
O	the
O	body
O	in
C	Cassim
O	s
O	house
O	again
O	recommended
O	to
C	Morgiana
O	to
O	act
O	her
O	part
O	well
O	and
O	then
O	returned
O	with
O	his
O	ass
C	Morgiana
O	went
O	out
O	early
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	to
O	a
O	druggist
O	and
O	asked
O	for
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	lozenge
O	which
O	was
O	considered
O	efficacious
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	dangerous
O	disorders
O	The
O	apothecary
O	inquired
O	who
O	was
O	ill
O	She
O	replied
O	with
O	a
O	sigh
O	Her
O	good
O	master
C	Cassim
O	himself
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	neither
O	eat
O	nor
O	speak
O	In
O	the
O	evening
C	Morgiana
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	same
O	druggist
O	s
O	again
O	and
O	with
O	tears
O	in
O	her
O	eyes
O	asked
O	for
O	an
O	essence
O	which
O	they
O	used
O	to
O	give
O	to
O	sick
O	people
O	only
O	when
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	extremity
O	Alas
O	said
O	she
O	taking
O	it
O	from
O	the
O	apothecary
O	I
O	am
O	afraid
O	that
O	this
O	remedy
O	will
O	have
O	no
O	better
O	effect
O	than
O	the
O	lozenges
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	shall
O	lose
O	my
O	good
O	master
O	On
O	the
O	other
O	hand
O	as
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	and

O	were
O	often
O	seen
O	to
O	go
O	between
O	Cassim
O	s
O	and
O	their
O	own
O	house
O	all
O	that
O	day
O	and
O	to
O	seem
O	melancholy
O	nobody
O	was
O	surprised

C	Baba

O	Oh
O	oh

O	you

C	Baba

O	till
O	he
O	was
O	quite

O	great
O	commendations
O	from

O	said
O	Honest
O	man
O	you
O	begin
O	to

O	very
O	early
O	is
O	it
O	possible
O	that
O	one
O	of
O	your

O	can
O	see
O	so
O	well
O	I
O	question
O	even
O	if

O	A

O	exclaimed
O	the

O	with
O	affected
O	amazement
O	Yes
O	yes
O	answered
C	Baba
C	Mustapha
O	I
O	see
O	you

O	me
O	speak
O	out
O	but
O	you

O	felt
O	sure
O	that

O	sought
O	He
O	pulled

O	I
O	do

O	though
O	I
O	can
O	assume
O	you
O	you
O	might
O	safely
O	trust
O	me
O	with
O	it
O	The
O	only
O	thing
O	I
O	desire
O	of
O	you
O	is
O	to

O	the

O	see
O	therefore
O	the
O	impossibility
O	of

O	doing
O	what
O	you
O	desire
O	Well
O	replied
O	the

O	you
O	may

O	remember
O	a
O	little
O	of
O	the

O	were

O	blindfold
O	Come
O	let
O	me
O	blind
O	your
O	eyes
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	place
O	We
O	will
O	walk
O	together
O	perhaps
O	you
O	may
O	recognize
O	some
O	part
O	and
O	as
O	everybody
O	ought
O	to
O	be
O	paid
O	for

O	of
O	gold
O	into
O	his
O	hand
O	The

O	pieces
O	of

O	He
O	looked
O	at

O	a
O	long
O	time
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	without
O	saying
O	a

O	that
O	I
O	can
O	remember
O	the
O	way
O	exactly
O	but
O	since
O	you
O	desire
O	I

O	At
O	these
O	words
C	Baba
C	Mustapha
O	rose
O	up
O	to

O	filed
O	off
O	in
O	parties
O	of
O	two
O	each
O	after
O	some
O	interval
O	of
O	time
O	and
O	got
O	into
O	the
O	town
O	without
O	being
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	suspected
O	The
C	captain
O	and
O	he
O	who
O	had
O	visited
O	the
O	town
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	as
O	spy
O	came
O	in
O	the
O	last
O	He
O	led
O	the
C	captain
O	into
O	the
O	street
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	marked
O	Ali
O	Baba
O	s
O	residence
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	first
O	of
O	the
O	houses
O	which
C	Morgiana
O	had
O	marked
O	he
O	pointed
O	it
O	out
O	But
O	the
C	captain
O	observed
O	that
O	the
O	next
O	door
O	was
O	chalked
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	place
O	and
O	showing
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	guide
O	asked
O	him
O	which
O	house
O	it
O	was
O	that
O	or
O	the
O	first
O	The
O	guide
O	was
O	so
O	confounded
O	that
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	answer
O	to
O	make
O	but
O	still
O	more
O	puzzled
O	when
O	he
O	and
O	the
C	captain
O	saw
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	houses
O	similarly
O	marked
O	He
O	assured
O	the
C	captain
O	with
O	an
O	oath
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	marked
O	but
O	one
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	who
O	had
O	chalked
O	the
O	rest
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	distinguish
O	the
O	house
O	which
O	the
O	cobbler
O	had
O	stopped
O	at
O	The
C	captain
O	finding
O	that
O	their
O	design
O	had
O	proved
O	abortive
O	went
O	directly
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	rendezvous
O	and
O	told
O	his
O	troop
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	lost
O	their
O	labor
O	and
O	must
O	return
O	to
O	their
O	cave
O	He
O	himself
O	set
O	them
O	the
O	example
O	and
O	they
O	all
O	returned
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	When
O	the
O	troop
O	was
O	all
O	got
O	together
O	the
C	captain
O	told
O	them
O	the
O	reason
O	of
O	their
O	returning
O	and
O	presently
O	the
O	conductor
O	was
O	declared
O	by
O	all
O	worthy
O	of
O	death
O	He
O	condemned
O	himself
O	acknowledging
O	that
O	he
O	ought
O	to
O	have
O	taken
O	better
O	precaution
O	and
O	prepared
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	stroke
O	from
O	him
O	who
O	was
O	appointed
O	to
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	head
O	But
O	as
O	the
O	safety
O	of
O	the
O	troop
O	required
O	the
O	discovery
O	of
O	the
O	second
O	intruder
O	into
O	the
O	cave
O	another
O	of
O	the
O	gang
O	who
O	promised
O	himself
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	succeed
O	better
O	presented
O	himself
O	and
O	his
O	offer
O	being
O	accepted
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	corrupted
C	Baba
C	Mustapha
O	as
O	the
O	other
O	had
O	done
O	and
O	being
O	shown
O	the
O	house
O	marked
O	it
O	in
O	a
O	place
O	more
O	remote
O	from
O	sight
O	with
O	red
O	chalk
O	Not
O	long
O	after
C	Morgiana
O	whose
O	eyes
O	nothing
O	could
O	escape
O	went
O	out
O	and
O	seeing
O	the
O	red
O	chalk
O	and
O	arguing
O	with
O	herself
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	done
O	before
O	marked
O	the
O	other
O	neighbors
O	houses
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	place
O	and
O	manner
O	The
O	robber
O	at
O	his
O	return
O	to
O	his
O	company
O	valued
O	himself
O	much
O	on
O	the
O	precaution
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	which
O	he
O	looked
O	upon
O	as
O	an
O	infallible
O	way
O	of
O	distinguishing
O	Ali
O	Baba
O	s
O	house
O	from
O	the
O	others
O	and
O	the
C	captain
O	and
O	all
O	of
O	them
O	thought
O	it
O	must
O	succeed
O	They
O	conveyed
O	themselves
O	into
O	the
O	town
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	precaution
O	as
O	before
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	robber
O	and
O	his
C	captain
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	street
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	same
O	difficulty
O	at
O	which
O	the
C	captain
O	was
O	enraged
O	and
O	the
O	robber
O	in
O	as
O	great
O	confusion
O	as
O	his
O	predecessor
O	Thus
O	the
C	captain
O	and
O	his
O	troop
O	were
O	forced
O	to
O	retire
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	and
O	much
O	more
O	dissatisfied
O	while
O	the
O	robber
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	author
O	of
O	the
O	mistake
O	underwent
O	the
O	same
O	punishment
O	which
O	he
O	willingly
O	submitted
O	to
O	The
C	captain
O	having
O	lost
O	two
O	brave
O	fellows
O	of
O	his
O	troop
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	diminishing
O	it
O	too
O	much
O	by
O	pursuing
O	this
O	plan
O	to
O	get
O	information
O	of
O	the
O	residence
O	of
O	their
O	plunderer
O	He
O	found
O	by
O	their
O	example
O	that
O	their
O	heads
O	were
O	not
O	so
O	good
O	as
O	their
O	hands
O	on
O	such
O	occasions
O	and
O	therefore
O	resolved
O	to
O	take
O	upon
O	himself
O	the
O	important
O	commission
O	Accordingly
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	addressed
O	himself
O	to
C	Baba
C	Mustapha
O	who
O	did
O	him
O	the
O	same
O	service
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	to
O	the
O	other
C	robbers
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	set
O	any
O	particular
O	mark
O	on
O	the
O	house
O	but
O	examined
O	and
O	observed
O	it
O	so
O	carefully
O	by
O	passing
O	often
O	by
O	it
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	impossible
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	mistake
O	it
O	The
C	captain
O	well
O	satisfied
O	with
O	his
O	attempt
O	and
O	informed
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	wanted
O	to
O	know
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	cave
O	where
O	the
O	troop
O	waited
O	for
O	him
O	said
O	Now
O	comrades
O	nothing
O	can
O	prevent
O	our
O	full
O	revenge
O	as
O	I
O	am
O	certain
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	in
O	my
O	way
O	hither
O	I
O	have
O	thought
O	how
O	to
O	put
O	it
O	into
O	execution
O	but
O	if
O	any
O	one
O	can
O	form
O	a
O	better
O	expedient
O	let
O	him
O	communicate
O	it
O	He
O	then
O	told
O	them
O	his
O	contrivance
O	and
O	as
O	they
O	approved
O	of
O	it
O	ordered
O	them
O	to
O	go
O	into
O	the
O	villages
O	about
O	and
O	buy
O	nineteen
O	mules
O	with
O	large
O	leather
O	jars
O	one
O	full
O	of
O	oil
O	and
O	the
O	others
O	empty
O	In
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	days
O	time
O	the
C	robbers
O	had
O	purchased
O	the
O	mules
O	and
O	jars
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	mouths
O	of
O	the
O	jars
O	were
O	rather
O	too
O	narrow
O	for
O	his
O	purpose
O	the
C	captain
O	caused
O	them
O	to
O	be
O	widened
O	and
O	after

O	put
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	men
O	into

O	with

O	been
O	undone
O	to

O	rubbed
O	the
O	jars
O	on
O	the
O	outside
O	with
O	oil
O	from
O	the
O	full
O	vessel

O	being
O	thus
O	prepared
O	when

O	the

O	as
O	their
O	driver
O	set
O	out
O	with

O	and
O	reached
O	the
O	town
O	by
O	the
O	dusk
O	of
O	the
O	evening
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	intended
O	He
O	led
O	them
O	through
O	the
O	streets
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	Ali
O	Baba
O	s
O	at
O	whose
O	door
O	he
O	designed
O	to
O	have
O	knocked
O	but
O	was
O	prevented
O	by
O	his
O	sitting
O	there
O	after
O	supper
O	to
O	take
O	a
O	little
O	fresh
O	air
O	He
O	stopped
O	his
O	mules
O	addressed
O	himself
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	said
O	I
O	have
O	brought
O	some
O	oil
O	a
O	great
O	way
O	to
O	sell
O	at
O	s

O	If

O	I
O	shall
O	be
O	very
O	much
O	obliged
O	by
O	your
O	hospitality
O	Though
C	Ali

O	had
O	seen
O	the
C	captain
O	of
O	the
C	robbers
O	in
O	the

O	and

O	him
O	in
O	the

O	oil
O	merchant
O	He
O	told
O	him
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	welcome
O	and
O	immediately
O	opened
O	his
O	gates
O	for

O	she

C	Ali

O	was
O	very
O	much
O	surprised

O	Look
O	well
O	at
O	him
O	and
O	you
O	will

O	to

O	I

O	him
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	you
O	told
O	me
O	you
O	had
O	such
O	a

O	I

C	Ali
C	Baba
O	who

O	for
O	saving
O	his

O	a
O	second

O	said
O	he
O	I
O	gave
O	you
O	your
O	liberty
O	and
O	then
O	promised
O	you
O	that
O	my
O	gratitude
O	should
O	not
O	stop
O	there
O	but
O	that
O	I
O	would
O	soon
O	give
O	you
O	higher
O	proofs
O	of
O	its
O	sincerity
O	which
O	I
O	now
O	do
O	by
O	making
O	you
O	my
O	Then
O	addressing
O	himself
O	to
O	his
O	son
O	he
O	said
O	I
O	believe
O	you
O	son
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	dutiful
O	a
O	child
O	that
O	you
O	will
O	not
O	refuse
C	Morgiana
O	for
O	your
O	wife
O	You
O	see
O	that
C	Cogia
C	Houssain
O	sought
O	your
O	friendship
O	with
O	a
O	treacherous
O	design
O	to
O	take
O	away
O	my
O	life
O	and
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	succeeded
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	doubt
O	but
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	sacrificed
O	you
O	also
O	to
O	his
O	revenge
O	Consider
O	that
O	by
O	marrying
C	Morgiana
O	you
O	marry
O	the
O	preserver
O	of
O	my
O	family
O	and
O	your
O	own
O	The
O	son
O	far
O	from
O	showing
O	any
O	dislike
O	readily
O	consented
O	to
O	the
O	marriage
O	not
O	only
O	because
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	disobey
O	his
O	father
O	but
O	also
O	because
O	it
O	was
O	agreeable
O	to
O	his
O	inclination
O	After
O	this
O	they
O	thought
O	of
O	burying
O	the
C	captain
O	of
O	the
C	robbers
O	with
O	his
O	comrades
O	and
O	did
O	it
O	so
O	privately
O	that
O	nobody
O	discovered
O	their
O	bones
O	till
O	many
O	years
O	after
O	when
O	no
O	one
O	had
O	any
O	concern
O	in
O	the
O	publication
O	of
O	this
O	remarkable
O	history
O	A
O	few
O	days
O	afterward
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	celebrated
O	the
O	nuptials
O	of
O	his
O	son
O	and
C	Baba
C	Mustapha
O	with
O	great
O	solemnity
O	a
O	sumptuous
O	feast
O	and
O	the
O	usual
O	dancing
O	and
O	spectacles
O	and
O	had
O	the
O	satisfaction
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	his
O	friends
O	and
O	neighbors
O	whom
O	he
O	invited
O	had
O	no
O	knowledge
O	of
O	the
O	true
O	motives
O	of
O	the
O	marriage
O	but
O	that
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	not
O	unacquainted
O	with
O	Morgiana
O	s
O	good
O	qualities
O	commended
O	his
O	generosity
O	and
O	goodness
O	of
O	heart
C	Ali
C	Baba
O	did
O	not
O	visit
O	the
C	robbers
O	cave
O	for
O	a
O	whole
O	year
O	as
O	he
O	supposed
O	the
O	other
O	two
O	might
O	be
O	alive
O	At
O	the
O	year
O	s
O	end
O	when
O	he
O	found
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	made
O	any
O	attempt
O	to
O	disturb
O	him
O	he
O	had
O	the
O	curiosity
O	to
O	make
O	another
O	journey
O	He
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	cave
O	he
O	alighted
O	tied
O	his
O	horse
O	to
O	a
O	tree
O	then
O	approaching
O	the
O	entrance
O	and
O	pronouncing
O	the
O	words
O	Open
C	Sesame
O	the
O	door
O	opened
O	He
O	entered
O	the
O	cavern
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	condition
O	he
O	found
O	things
O	in
O	judged
O	that
O	nobody
O	had
O	been
O	there
O	since
O	the
C	captain
O	had
O	fetched
O	the
O	goods
O	for
O	his
O	shop
O	From
O	this
O	time
O	he
O	believed
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	person
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	who
O	had
O	the
O	secret
O	of
O	opening
O	the
O	cave
O	and
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	treasure
O	was
O	at
O	his
O	sole
O	disposal
O	He
O	put
O	as
O	much
O	gold
O	into
O	his
O	as
O	his
O	horse
O	could
O	carry
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	town
O	Some
O	years
O	later
O	he
O	carried
O	his
O	son
O	to
O	the
O	cave
O	and
O	taught
O	him
O	the
O	secret
O	which
O	descended
O	to
O	his
O	posterity
O	who
O	using
O	their
O	fortune
O	with
O	moderation
O	lived
O	in
O	honor
O	and
O	splendor
O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	a
O	wicked
O	nobleman
O	rose
O	in
O	rebellion
O	against
O	his
O	rightful
O	king
O	and
O	taking
O	the
O	royal
O	forces
O	by
O	surprise
O	defeated
O	them
O	and
O	seized
O	the
O	kingdom
O	The
O	dethroned
C	King
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	severely
O	wounded
O	in
O	battle
O	was
O	cast
O	in
O	prison
O	where
O	he
O	soon
O	died
O	but
O	his
O	widow
O	the
C	Queen
O	managed
O	to
O	escape
O	from
O	the
O	palace
O	before
O	the
O	usurper
O	could
O	lay
O	hands
O	upon
O	her
O	Into
O	the
O	dark
O	forest
O	which
O	lay
O	behind
O	the
O	palace
O	ran
O	the
C	Queen
O	holding
O	her
O	baby
C	daughter
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	It
O	was
O	winter
O	time
O	and
O	a
O	heavy
O	snow
O	had
O	hidden
O	the
O	and
O	the
O	roads
O	Presently
O	the
C	Queen
O	realized
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	lost
O	All
O	afternoon
O	however
O	she
O	trudged
O	bravely
O	on
O	through
O	the
O	silence
O	and
O	the
O	cold
O	her
O	heart
O	sinking
O	as
O	mile
O	after
O	mile
O	revealed
O	no
O	sign
O	of
O	a
O	house
O	or
O	a
O	shelter
O	But
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
O	when
O	the
O	red
O	shield
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	could
O	scarcely
O	be
O	seen
O	through
O	the
O	tangle
O	of
O	the
O	wild
O	she
O	perceived
O	a
O	light
O	coming
O	from
O	a
O	little
O	grove
O	of
O	cedars
O	by
O	the
O	shore
O	of
O	a
O	frozen
O	lake
O	The
C	Queen
O	made
O	her
O	way
O	toward
O	this
O	light
O	and
O	discovered
O	a
O	little
O	thatched
O	hut
O	in
O	the
O	silent
O	wood
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	The
C	dwarf
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	the
C	Queen
O	but
O	his
O	efforts
O	were
O	vain
O	for
O	the
O	poor
O	woman
O	was
O	so
O	weak
O	and
O	exhausted
O	that
O	she
O	died
O	without
O	telling
O	the
C	dwarf
O	anything
O	about
O	herself
O	or
O	the
O	child
O	she
O	carried
O	So
O	the
O	little
C	dwarf
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	kind
O	old
O	fellow
O	brought
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	up
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	his
O	own
O	child
O	His
O	brother
O	the
O	dwarf
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	made
O	her
O	the
O	prettiest
O	shoes
O	and
O	his
O	cousins
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	of
O	the
O	pines
O	made
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	dresses
O	from
O	cloth
O	woven
O	on
O	fairy
O	looms
O	Now
O	on
O	the
O	night
O	her
O	mother
O	brought
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	hut
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	was
O	wearing
O	a
O	golden
O	locket
O	with
O	a
O	crown
O	and
O	the
O	letter
O	M
O	upon
O	it
O	in
O	diamonds
O	So
O	the
C	dwarf
O	called
O	the
O	little
O	girl
C	Marianna
O	Seventeen
O	years
O	passed
O	and
C	Marianna
O	grew
O	to
O	be
O	quite
O	the
O	loveliest
O	lass
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	Her
O	hair
O	was
O	as
O	black
O	as
O	the
O	raven
O	s
O	wing
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	as
O	blue
O	as
O	the
O	midsummer
O	sea
O	and
O	her
O	skin
O	was
O	fair
O	as
O	the
O	petal
O	of
O	a
O	rose
O	One
O	spring
O	morning
O	a
O	little
O	yellow
O	bird
O	flew
O	into
O	the
O	cedar
O	grove
O	and
O	gave
O	the
C	dwarf
O	a
O	letter
O	which
O	it
O	held
O	in
O	its
O	beak
O	The
C	dwarf
O	read
O	the
O	letter
O	and
O	said
O	to
C	Marianna
O	Little
C	Marianna
O	the
C	Emperor
C	of
C	the
C	Elves
O	has
O	bidden
O	me
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	assembly
O	of
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	which
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	held
O	next
O	year
O	on
O	the
O	Golden
O	Mountain
O	Alas
O	what
O	are
O	we
O	to
O	do
O	I
O	can
O	not
O	take
O	you
O	with
O	me
O	dear
O	child
O	for
O	it
O	is
O	forbidden
O	on
O	pain
O	of
O	death
O	to
O	bring
O	mortals
O	to
O	the
O	assembly
O	nor
O	can
O	I
O	leave
O	you
O	here
O	in
O	this
O	lonely
O	wood
O	To
O	this
C	Marianna
O	replied
O	Do
O	not
O	fear
O	dear
O	father
O	Give
O	me
O	but
O	yon
O	crystal
O	flask
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	healing
O	and
O	I
O	shall
O	go
O	forth
O	into
O	the
O	world
O	until
O	it
O	is
O	time
O	for
O	you
O	to
O	return
O	again
O	Perhaps
O	I
O	shall
O	discover
O	somebody
O	who
O	can
O	tell
O	me
O	the
O	meaning
O	of
O	this
O	locket
O	or
O	the
O	history
O	of
O	my
O	dear
O	mother
O	So
O	the
C	dwarf
O	took
O	his
O	knotted
O	staff
O	and
O	went
O	away
O	over
O	hill
O	over
O	dale
O	to
O	the
O	Golden
O	Mountain
O	Then
C	Marianna
O	took
O	the
O	crystal
O	flask
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	healing
O	and
O	walked
O	boldly
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	into
O	the
O	wide
O	wide
O	world
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	spring
O	the
O	ice
O	and
O	snow
O	had
O	all
O	disappeared
O	the
O	trees
O	were
O	putting
O	forth
O	their
O	leaves
O	and
O	there
O	were
O	clusters
O	of
O	primroses
O	by
O	the
O	roadside
O	In
O	the
O	swaying
O	rustling
O	heart
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	elm
O	tree
O	a
O	little
O	thrush
O	was
O	singing
O	Through
O	cities
O	and
O	towns
O	went
O	lovely
C	Marianna
O	bringing
O	good
O	cheer
O	to
O	the
O	helpless
O	and
O	the
O	sick
O	and
O	curing
O	all
O	who
O	came
O	to
O	her
O	rich
O	and
O	poor
O	with
O	the
O	wonderful
O	water
O	of
O	healing
O	But
O	never
O	did
O	she
O	find
O	anybody
O	who
O	could
O	tell
O	her
O	about
O	the
O	gold
O	heart
O	with
O	the
O	diamond
O	crown
O	Now
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	pass
O	that
O	as
C	Marianna
O	was
O	one
O	day
O	walking
O	through
O	a
O	village
O	in
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	Adamant
O	Mountains
O	a
O	ragged
C	old
C	woman
O	besought
O	her
O	with
O	tears
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	a
O	hamlet
O	which
O	stood
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	a
O	high
O	and
O	dangerous
O	path
O	Touched
O	by
O	the
C	old
C	woman
O	s
O	supplication
C	Marianna
O	followed
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	hamlet
O	and
O	found
O	in
O	a
O	wretched
O	hut
O	lying
O	on
O	a
O	wretched
O	bed
O	a
O	beautiful
O	young
C	peasant
C	girl
O	dying
O	of
O	a
O	fever
O	So
C	Marianna
O	touched
O	the
C	girl
O	with
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	healing
O	and
O	in
O	an
O	instant
O	she
O	became
O	well
O	and
O	strong
O	Dear
O	lady
O	said
O	the
C	peasant
C	girl
O	pressing
C	Marianna
O	s
O	hand
O	to
O	her
O	lips
O	how
O	sweet
O	and
O	kind
O	thou
O	art
O	Great
O	is
O	the
O	debt
O	I
O	owe
O	thee
O	And
O	as
O	the
C	girl
O	poured
O	out
O	her
O	thanks
C	Marianna
O	heard
O	a
O	faint
O	chirp
O	chirp
O	and
O	looking
O	down
O	beheld
O	a
O	little
O	yellow
O	bird
O	crouching
O	on
O	the
O	hearthstone
O	Every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	hid
O	his
O	head
O	under
O	his
O	wings
O	and
O	cried
O	unhappily
O	It
O	was
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	which
O	had
O	brought
O	the
O	message
O	from
O	the
C	Emperor
C	of
C	the
C	Elves
O	Poor
O	little
O	bird
O	said
C	Marianna
O	bending
O	down
O	and
O	taking
O	him
O	up
O	in
O	her
O	hands
O	why
O	criest
O	thou
O	so
O	mournfully
O	Who
O	hath
O	done
O	thee
O	harm
O	But
O	the
O	bird
O	uttered
O	only
O	a
O	forlorn
O	little
O	cry
O	and
O	hid
O	his
O	head
O	again
O	under
O	his
O	wings
O	I
O	found
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	rocks
O	at
O	the
O	mountaintop
O	yesterday
O	said
O	the
O	mother
O	Someone
O	has
O	wounded
O	him
O	His
O	wing
O	is
O	broken
O	And
O	she
O	put
O	the
O	bird
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	bade
C	Marianna
O	watch
O	how
O	he
O	fluttered
O	trailing
O	a
O	wing
O	in
O	the
O	dust
O	Again
C	Marianna
O	stooped
O	and
O	picking
O	up
O	the
O	bird
O	touched
O	the
O	wounded
O	wing
O	with
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	healing
O	Scarcely
O	had
O	she
O	done
O	so
O	when
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	burst
O	into
O	a
O	joyous
O	and
O	golden
O	song
O	and
O	flying
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	beat
O	madly
O	against
O	the
O	panes
O	Then
O	the
C	peasant
C	girl
O	threw
O	open
O	the
O	casement
O	and
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	flew
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	streaming
O	sun
O	He
O	is
O	gone
O	forever
O	said
O	the
C	peasant
C	girl
O	Nay
O	he
O	returns
O	said
C	Marianna
O	gently
O	as
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	flew
O	back
O	and
O	perched
O	in
O	the
O	sheltering
O	bower
O	of
C	Marianna
O	s
O	arms
O	Then
O	accompanied
O	by
O	the
C	peasant
C	girl
O	and
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	who
O	flew
O	singing
O	before
O	her
C	Marianna
O	went
O	down
O	the
O	dangerous
O	path
O	to
O	the
O	high
O	road
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	When
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	path
O	the
C	peasant
C	girl
O	cried
O	Farewell
O	dear
C	Marianna
O	may
O	it
O	some
O	day
O	be
O	mine
O	to
O	repay
O	thee
O	Into
O	the
O	world
O	again
O	went
C	Marianna
O	and
O	with
O	her
O	went
O	the
O	yellow
O	bird
O	Presently
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	fairest
O	land
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	ever
O	seen
O	a
O	land
O	of
O	rolling
O	fields
O	little
O	hills
O	and
O	rivers
O	bordered
O	with
O	pale
O	willow
O	trees
O	This
O	pleasant
O	land
O	unknown
O	to
C	Marianna
O	was
O	part
O	of
O	her
O	father
O	s
O	kingdom
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	really
O	its
O	queen
O	because
O	her
O	father
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	last
O	rightful
O	king
O	Now
O	while
C	Marianna
O	had
O	been
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	the
O	wicked
O	nobleman
O	who
O	had
O	stolen
O	the
O	kingdom
O	from
C	Marianna
O	s
O	father
O	had
O	died
O	leaving
O	his
O	brother
C	Garabin
O	in
O	charge
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	interests
O	of
O	his
O	little
O	son
C	Prince
C	Desire
O	This
C	Garabin
O	however
O	taking
O	advantage
O	of
O	the
O	youth
O	and
O	helplessness
O	of
O	his
O	nephew
O	had
O	himself
O	assumed
O	the
O	state
O	and
O	airs
O	of
C	king
O	For
O	some
O	time
O	he
O	had
O	enjoyed
O	undisturbed
O	the
O	possession
O	of
O	his
O	stolen
O	throne
O	but
O	as
C	Desire
O	grew
O	taller
O	and
O	stronger
O	every
O	year
C	Garabin
O	began
O	to
O	fear
O	the
O	day
O	when
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	compelled
O	to
O	resign
O	in
O	favor
O	of
O	his
O	nephew
O	When
O	the
C	Prince
O	reached
O	his
O	twentieth
O	year
C	Garabin
O	would
O	certainly
O	have
O	killed
O	him
O	openly
O	had
O	he
O	dared
O	but
O	fearing
O	the
O	people
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	use
O	secret
O	methods
O	and
O	bribed
O	a
O	cruel
C	magician
O	to
O	afflict
O	poor
C	Desire
O	with
O	a
O	deadly
O	and
O	mysterious
O	malady
O	Of
O	this
O	malady
C	Desire
O	was
O	slowly
O	dying
O	for
O	no
O	medicine
O	could
O	cure
O	him
O	or
O	even
O	give
O	him
O	any
O	relief
O	from
O	his
O	constant
O	pain
O	Every
O	morning
O	the
O	cruel
C	Garabin
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	finding
O	his
O	nephew
O	dead
O	would
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	sick
O	room
O	and
O	you
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	that
O	his
O	wicked
O	heart
O	rejoiced
O	when
O	he
O	found
O	the
C	Prince
O	weaker
O	and
O	more
O	feverish
C	Garabin
O	had
O	just
O	returned
O	from
O	a
O	visit
O	to
O	the
C	Prince
O	who
O	was
O	rapidly
O	failing
O	when
O	the
O	Captain
O	of
O	the
O	Castle
O	Guard
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	news
O	that
O	the
O	wonderful
C	Marianna
O	had
O	arrived
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	The
C	King
O	gave
O	orders
O	that
O	she
O	be
O	brought
O	before
O	him
O	So
C	Marianna
O	walking
O	between
O	two
O	halberdiers
O	and
O	followed
O	across
O	the
O	courtyard
O	by
O	crowds
O	of
O	curious
O	people
O	was
O	led
O	before
O	the
C	King
O	The
O	little
O	yellow
O	bird
O	sat
O	on
C	Marianna
O	s
O	shoulder
O	and
O	never
O	did
O	maiden
O	appear
O	lovelier
O	or
O	more
O	gentle
O	Scarcely
O	had
C	Garabin
O	set
O	eyes
O	on
C	Marianna
O	when
O	he
O	caught
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	golden
O	locket
O	which
O	she
O	wore
O	about
O	her
O	neck
O	Had
O	he
O	not
O	been
O	very
O	old
O	and
O	crafty
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	started
O	from
O	his
O	golden
O	throne
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	golden
O	heart
O	set
O	with
O	diamonds
O	had
O	been
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	crown

O	and
O	that
O	therefore
C	Marianna
O	must
O	be
O	the
O	missing
O	Princess
O	and
O	rightful
O	queen
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	What
O	was
O	he
O	to
O	do
O	If
O	he
O	refused
O	to
O	let
C	Marianna
O	help
O	the
C	Prince
O	the
O	people
O	might
O	begin
O	to
O	suspect
O	him
O	and
O	start
O	a
O	revolution
O	which
O	would
O	thrust
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	throne
O	if
O	he
O	allowed
C	Marianna
O	to
O	cure
O	the
C	Prince
O	the
C	Prince
O	would
O	certainly
O	demand
O	the
O	kingdom
O	on
O	his
O	birthday
O	What
O	was
O	he
O	to
O	do
O	with
C	Marianna
O	whose
O	right
O	to
O	the
O	throne
O	was
O	superior
O	even
O	to
O	his
O	nephew
O	s
O	Perplexed
O	and
O	with
O	fear
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	the
C	King
O	sought
O	the
O	cruel
C	magician
O	who
O	had
O	cast
O	the
O	spell
O	on
C	Desire
O	The
C	magician
O	lived
O	in
O	a
O	gloomy
O	tower
O	and
O	had
O	an
O	enchanted
O	black
O	dog
O	that
O	he
O	fed
O	with
O	flaming
O	coals
O	He
O	listened
O	to
C	Garabin
O	s
O	story
O	stirring
O	a
O	great
O	cauldron
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	and
O	said
O	Do
O	not
O	fear
O	I
O	will
O	destroy
O	both
O	claimants
O	to
O	the
O	throne
O	at
O	once
C	Garabin
O	rubbed
O	his
O	hands
O	together
O	with
O	glee
O	I
O	shall
O	cast
O	a
O	spell
O	of
O	sleep
O	on
C	Marianna
O	steal
O	the
O	crystal
O	flask
O	empty
O	it
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	healing
O	and
O	refill
O	it
O	with
O	a
O	liquid
O	which
O	will
O	cause
O	death
O	within
O	a
O	night
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	I
O	shall
O	then
O	replace
O	the
O	flask
O	before
C	Marianna
O	wakes
O	You
O	will
O	allow
C	Marianna
O	to
O	visit
O	the
C	Prince
O	she
O	will
O	touch
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	deadly
O	water
O	and
O	the
C	Prince
O	will
O	die
O	You
O	can
O	then
O	try
C	Marianna
O	for
O	having
O	killed
O	the
C	Prince
O	and
O	condemn
O	her
O	to
O	be
O	thrown
O	from
O	the
O	precipice
O	So
O	pleased
O	was
C	Garabin
O	with
O	this
O	horrid
O	plot
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	have
O	danced
O	for
O	joy
O	That
O	very
O	night
O	the
C	magician
O	filled
C	Marianna
O	s
O	flask
O	with
O	the
O	poisonous
O	water
O	and
O	departed
O	thinking
O	that
O	nobody
O	had
O	noticed
O	him
O	The
O	yellow
O	bird
O	however
O	had
O	seen
O	everything
O	and
O	followed
O	the
C	magician
O	to
O	note
O	where
O	he
O	hid
O	the
O	real
O	water
O	of
O	healing
O	The
O	next
O	morning
C	Marianna
O	was
O	once
O	more
O	led
O	before
O	the
C	King
O	Welcome
O	thrice
O	welcome
O	lovely
O	maiden
O	said
C	Garabin
O	with
O	the
O	most
O	dreadful
O	hypocrisy
O	I
O	have
O	long
O	hoped
O	that
O	you
O	would
O	turn
O	your
O	footsteps
O	hither
O	for
O	my
O	poor
O	dear
O	nephew
C	Prince
C	Desire
O	only
O	son
O	of
O	the
O	late
C	King
O	has
O	been
O	ill
O	for
O	some
O	months
O	of
O	a
O	malady
O	no
O	physician
O	can
O	cure
O	Perhaps
O	you
O	can
O	cure
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	healing
C	Marianna
O	replied
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	do
O	her
O	best
O	to
O	help
O	the
C	Prince
O	so
O	the
C	Court
C	Chamberlain
O	gave
O	her
O	his
O	arm
O	and
O	escorted
O	her
O	to
O	the
C	Prince
O	s
O	sick
O	room
O	The
C	King
O	and
O	many
O	courtiers
O	followed
O	after
O	him
C	Desire
O	lay
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	bed
O	his
O	face
O	flushed
O	with
O	fever
O	So
O	weak
O	was
O	the
O	poor
C	Prince
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	scarcely
O	lift
O	his
O	head
O	to
O	look
O	at

O	A
O	great

O	the

O	she
O	saw
O	him
O	as
O	for

O	he
O	fell
O	madly
O	in
O	love
O	with
C	Marianna
O	at
O	first
O	sight
O	Now
O	just
O	as
C	Marianna
O	bent
O	over
O	the
C	Prince
O	to
O	touch
O	his
O	forehead
O	with
O	the

O	of

O	the

O	screamed

O	as
O	if

C	Marianna

O	Nothing

O	with

O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	so
O	terrible
O	was
O	the

O	s
O	poison
O	that
O	the
C	Prince
O	turned
O	white
O	as
O	the

O	and
O	fell
O	back
O	on
O	the

O	The
O	who
O	had
O	expected
O	to

O	him
O	spring
O	up
O	entirely
O	cured
O	began
O	to
O	murmur
O	and
C	Marianna
O	herself
O	terrified
O	at
O	what

O	happened
O	let

O	the

O	Suddenly
C	Garabin
O	cried
O	at

O	Seize
O	the

O	she

O	Presently
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	confusion
O	rough
O	hands
O	seized
C	Marianna
O	and
O	somebody
O	caught
O	the

O	The

O	remained
O	insensible
O	on
O	the

O	At
O	high
O	noon
O	a
O	trial
O	was
O	held
O	and
O	since
O	the
C	Doctors
O	declared
O	that
O	the

O	was
O	dying
C	Marianna
O	was
O	condemned
O	to

O	When
O	somebody
O	asked
O	about
O	the

C	Garabin
O	laughed
O	and

O	should
O	wring
O	its

O	and
O	toss
O	it
O	to

O	So
C	Marianna
O	was

O	to
O	a

O	loaded
O	with

O	the

O	let

O	your

O	I
O	should
O	take
O	the

O	Which

O	but
O	nobody

O	So
C	Desire

O	happily
O	ever
O	after
O	The

O	when

O	singing
O	into
O	the

O	and
O	flew
O	joyously
O	home
O	to
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	Elves
O	It
O	is
O	the
O	custom
O	nowadays
O	for
O	scientists
O	and
O	for
O	other
O	scholarly
O	people
O	to
O	take
O	hold
O	of
O	the

O	myths
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	to

O	find
O	some
O	deep
O	hidden
O	meaning
O	in
O	each
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	story
O	So
O	you
O	will
O	find
O	that
O	some
O	will
O	tell
O	you
O	that
C	Orpheus
O	is
O	the
O	personification
O	of
O	the
O	winds
O	which
O	tear
O	up
O	trees
O	as
O	they
O	course
O	along
O	chanting
O	their
O	wild
O	music
O	and
O	that
C	Eurydice
O	is
O	the
O	morning
O	with
O	its
O	beauty
O	Others
O	say
O	that
C	Orpheus
O	is
O	the
O	mythological
O	expression
O	of
O	the
O	delight
O	which
O	music
O	gives
O	to
O	the
O	primitive
O	races
O	while
O	yet
O	others
O	accept
O	without
O	hesitation
O	the
O	idea
O	that
C	Orpheus
O	is
O	the
O	sun
O	that
O	when

O	is
O	done

O	into
O	the

O	of

O	of
O	overtaking
O	his
O	lost
O	bride
C	Eurydice
O	the
O	rosy
O	dawn
O	And
O	whether
O	they
O	be
O	right
O	or
O	wrong
O	it
O	would
O	seem
O	that
O	the
O	sadness
O	that
O	comes
O	to
O	us
O	sometimes
O	as
O	the
O	day
O	dies
O	and

O	feeling
O	that
O	we
O	cannot
O	understand
O	when
O	in

O	we
O	hear

O	are
O	things
O	that

O	belong

O	with

O	and
O	returned
O	laden
O	with
O	presents
O	to

O	drawn
O	by
O	white
O	pigeons
O	of

O	at
O	once
O	cheerful
O	and
O	majestic

O	hands
O	could
O	have
O	spun
O	it
O	lace
O	and
O	embroidery
O	without
O	end
O	and
O	a
O	cradle
O	the
O	wonder
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	It
O	was
O	made
O	of
O	wood
O	more
O	precious
O	than
O	gold
O	and
O	at
O	each
O	corner
O	stood
O	four

O	images
O	little
O	cupids
O	who
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	baby
O	cried
O	began
O	to
O	rock
O	it
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	accord
O	Then
O	the
O	six
O	fairies
O	kissed
O	and
O	dandled
O	the
C	Princess
O	bestowing
O	on

O	for
O	her
O	portion
O	beauty
O	good

O	thoroughly
O	well
O	everything
O	she
O	tried
O	to
O	do
O	The
C	queen
O	overcome
O	with
O	gratitude
O	was
O	thanking
O	them
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	heart
O	for
O	their
O	kindness
O	to
O	her
O	little
O	daughter
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	enter
O	her
O	chamber
O	a
O	so
O	large
O	that
O	it
O	could
O	hardly
O	pass
O	through
O	the
O	door
O	Ungrateful
C	queen
O	said
O	the
O	crab
O	have
O	you
O	forgotten
O	the
C	Fairy
O	of
O	the
O	fountain
O	You
O	sent
O	for
O	these
O	my
O	sisters
O	and
O	not
O	for
O	me
O	who
O	am
O	the
O	one
O	to
O	whom
O	you
O	owed
O	most
O	of
O	all
O	The
C	queen
O	made
O	a
O	hundred
O	apologies
O	and
O	the
O	six
O	fairies
O	tried
O	vainly
O	to
O	pacify
O	the
O	other
O	one
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	determined
O	as
O	she
O	said
O	to
O	punish
O	ingratitude
O	However
O	added
O	she
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	no
O	worse
O	gift
O	to
O	the
C	Princess
O	than
O	to
O	warn
O	you
O	that
O	if
O	you
O	let
O	her
O	see
O	daylight
O	before
O	she
O	is
O	fifteen
O	years
O	old
O	you
O	will
O	repent
O	it
O	So
O	saying
O	she
O	retired
O	backwards
O	resisting
O	all
O	entreaties
O	to
O	resume
O	her
O	proper
O	form
O	and
O	join
O	in
O	the
O	festivities
O	The
O	afflicted
O	mother
O	took
O	council
O	with
O	the
O	six
O	fairies
O	how
O	she
O	was
O	to
O	save
O	her
O	baby
O	from
O	this
O	impending
O	evil
O	and
O	after
O	many
O	conflicting
O	opinions
O	they
O	advised
O	her
O	to
O	build
O	a
O	tower
O	without
O	doors
O	or
O	windows
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	subterranean
O	entrance
O	which
O	the
C	Princess
O	might
O	inhabit
O	till
O	she
O	had
O	passed
O	the
O	fatal
O	age
O	Everything
O	is
O	easy
O	to
O	fairies
O	so
O	three
O	strokes
O	of
O	their
O	wands
O	making
O	eighteen
O	strokes
O	in
O	all
O	began
O	and
O	finished
O	the
O	edifice
O	It
O	was
O	built
O	of
O	green
O	and
O	white
O	marble
O	ornamented
O	inside
O	with
O	diamonds
O	and
O	emeralds
O	and
O	hung
O	with
O	tapestry
O	all
C	Fairy
O	work
O	on
O	which
O	was
O	pictured
O	the
O	lives
O	of
O	heroes
O	Though
O	there
O	was
O	only
O	allowed
O	yet
O	the
O	lamps
O	were
O	so
O	numerous
O	that
O	they
O	made
O	the
O	tower
O	seem
O	as
O	bright
O	as
O	day
O	Whether
O	the
C	Princess
O	was
O	ever
O	permitted
O	any
O	fresh
O	air
O	or
O	taken
O	out
O	for
O	a
O	walk
O	by
O	starlight
O	or
O	moonlight
O	the
O	history
O	does
O	not
O	say
O	but
O	it
O	does
O	say
O	one
O	thing
O	that
O	she
O	grew
O	up
O	very
O	happy
O	very
O	lovely
O	and
O	very
O	well
O	educated
O	The
O	six
O	fairies
O	came
O	frequently
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	and
O	were
O	most
O	kind
O	and
O	affectionate
O	to
O	her
O	but
O	the
O	one
O	she
O	loved
O	best
O	among
O	them
O	all
O	was
O	Tulip
O	By
O	this
O	fairy
O	s
O	advice
O	the
O	nearer
O	she
O	approached
O	the
O	age
O	of
O	fifteen
O	the
O	more
O	carefully
O	was
C	Désirée
O	shut
O	up
O	from
O	daylight
O	But
O	her
O	mother
O	who
O	was
O	very
O	proud
O	of
O	her
O	beauty
O	caused
O	her
O	portrait
O	to
O	be
O	painted
O	and
O	sent
O	among
O	all
O	the
O	neighbouring
O	courts
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	some
C	prince
O	might
O	seek
O	her
O	in
O	marriage
O	There
O	was
O	one
C	prince
O	who
O	was
O	so
O	captivated
O	by
O	this
O	likeness
O	that
O	he
O	shut
O	himself
O	up
O	with
O	it
O	and
O	talked
O	to
O	it
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	alive
O	making
O	love
O	to
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	passionate
O	manner
O	and
O	then
O	falling
O	into
O	a
O	hopeless
O	melancholy
O	When
O	his
O	father
O	tried
O	to
O	discover
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	Sir
O	said

O	that
O	you
O	wish
O	me
O	to

O	the
C	Black
C	Princess
O	while

O	and
O	of
O	the
O	six
O	fairies
O	who
O	were
O	all
O	equally
O	delighted
O	But
O	said
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Tulip
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	sagest
O	of

O	beware

O	tenderly
O	called

O	train
O	took
O	days
O	in
O	going
O	through
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	He
O	made
O	his
O	harangue
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	and
O	much
O	state
O	ceremonial
O	passed
O	between
O	them
O	then
O	he
O	begged
O	for
O	the
O	honour
O	of
O	an
O	audience
O	with
O	the
C	Princess
O	and
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	astonished
O	to
O	find
O	it
O	denied
O	him
O	still
O	more
O	so
O	when
O	the
C	king
O	candidly
O	told
O	him
O	the
O	whole
O	story
O	The
C	queen
O	had
O	strictly
O	enjoined
O	the
O	ladies
O	of
O	honour
O	not
O	to

O	her

O	one
O	word
O	of
O	the

O	s
O	visit
O	or
O	her
O	intended
O	marriage
O	yet
O	somehow
O	the
C	Princess
O	already
O	knew
O	it
O	quite
O	well
O	But
O	she
O	was
O	wise
O	enough
O	to
O	say
O	nothing
O	about
O	it
O	and
O	when
O	her
O	mother
O	showed
O	her
O	the
O	prince
O	s
O	portrait
O	and
O	asked
O	her
O	if

O	should
O	like
O	such
O	a
O	gallant
O	young
O	man
O	for
O	her
O	husband
O	she
O	replied
O	humbly
O	that

O	quite
O	satisfied
O	with
O	any
O	choice
O	her
O	parents
O	made
O	for

O	So
O	her
O	hand

O	but
O	as
O	she
O	still
O	wanted
O	three
O	months
O	of
O	fifteen
O	the
C	Prince
O	was
O	requested
O	to
O	wait
O	thus
O	long
O	He
O	took
O	this
O	delay
O	so
O	much
O	to
O	heart
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	neither
O	eat
O	nor
O	sleep
O	meantime
C	Désirée
O	was
O	little
O	better
O	she
O	did
O	nothing
O	but
O	look
O	at
O	the
O	prince
O	s
O	portrait
O	and
O	was
O	exceedingly
O	irritable
O	with
C	Longthorn
O	and
C	Gilliflower
O	her
O	two
O	maids
O	of
O	honour
O	The

O	haters
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	warm
O	lovers
O	The
C	Black
C	Princess
O	was
O	softened
O	and
O	dismissed
O	him
O	on
O	which
O	he
O	gladly
O	took
O	himself
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	But
O	the
O	Ethiopian
O	lady
O	was
O	too
O	deeply
O	offended
O	with
C	Prince
C	Warrior
O	to
O	pardon
O	him
O	so
O	readily
O	She

O	and
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	her
O	godmother
O	the
C	Fairy
C	of
C	the

O	who
O	had

O	so
O	offended
O	by
O	being
O	forgotten
O	at
O	the
O	birth
O	of
C	Désirée
O	Arrived
O	there
O	she
O	unfolded
O	all
O	her
O	annoyances
O	The
C	Fairy
O	consoled
O	her
O	and
O	promised
O	to
O	aid
O	her
O	in
O	her
O	revenge
O	Meantime
C	Becafico
O	had
O	travelled
O	with
O	all
O	diligence
O	to
O	the
O	capital
O	of
C	Désirée
O	s
O	father
O	where
O	with
O	earnest
O	entreaties
O	he
O	begged
O	that
O	the
C	Princess
O	might
O	be
O	sent
O	back
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	her
O	betrothed
O	spouse
O	who
O	otherwise
O	would
O	certainly
O	die
O	at
O	which
O	tidings
O	the
C	Princess
O	herself
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	moved
O	that
O	she
O	fainted
O	away
O	Thus
O	her
O	parents
O	discovered
O	how
O	deeply
O	in
O	love
O	she
O	was
O	with
C	Prince
C	Warrior
O	Do
O	not
O	disquiet
O	yourself
O	my
O	dear
O	child
O	said
O	the
C	queen
O	if
O	the
C	Prince
O	suffers
O	it
O	is
O	you
O	who
O	can
O	console
O	him
O	My
O	only
O	fear
O	is
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	menaces
O	of
O	the
C	Fairy
C	of
C	the
C	Fountain
O	But
C	Désirée
O	was
O	so
O	eager
O	to
O	start
O	that
O	she
O	suggested
O	being
O	sent
O	away
O	in
O	a
O	closed
O	carriage
O	where
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	day
O	should
O	never
O	penetrate
O	and
O	which
O	should
O	only
O	be
O	opened
O	at
O	to
O	give
O	her
O	food
O	She
O	was
O	willing
O	to
O	suffer
O	any
O	inconvenience
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	saving
O	the
O	life
O	of
C	Prince
C	Warrior
O	The
O	parents
O	assented
O	So
O	there
O	was
O	built
O	a
O	magnificent
O	equipage
O	of
O	green
O	velvet
O	outside
O	and
O	lined
O	with
O	and
O	silver
O	brocade
O	It
O	was
O	very
O	large
O	but
O	it
O	shut
O	up
O	as
O	tight
O	as
O	a
O	box
O	and
O	it
O	had
O	a
O	huge
O	lock
O	the
O	key
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	entrusted
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	highest
O	noblemen
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	In
O	this
O	carriage
C	Désirée
O	was
O	placed
O	after
O	most
O	affecting
O	adieus
O	by
O	her
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	and
O	with
O	her
O	were
O	sent
O	her
O	maids
O	of
O	honour
C	Longthorn
O	and
C	Gilliflower
O	and
O	a
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	mother
O	of
O	both
O	Now
C	Longthorn
O	cared
O	little
O	for
O	the
C	Princess
O	but
O	she
O	cared
O	very
O	much
O	for
C	Prince
C	Warrior
O	whose
O	portrait
O	she
O	had
O	seen
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	bridal
O	train
O	departed
O	she
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	mother
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	certainly
O	die
O	if
O	this
O	marriage
O	were
O	accomplished
O	so
O	the
O	mother
O	notwithstanding
O	the
O	confidence
O	placed
O	in
O	her
O	by
C	queen
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	watch
O	over
O	the
C	Princess
O	and
O	carefully
O	seclude
O	her
O	from
O	daylight
O	until
O	she
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	age
O	of
O	fifteen
O	yielded
O	to
O	her
O	own
O	child
O	s
O	persuasions
O	and
O	determined
O	to
O	betray
O	her
O	trust
C	Longthorn
O	who
O	learned
O	each
O	evening
O	from
O	the
O	officers
O	of
O	the
O	household
O	when
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	bring
O	the
C	Princess
O	her
O	supper
O	how
O	far
O	they
O	were
O	on
O	their
O	journey
O	at
O	last
O	persuaded
O	her
O	mother
O	who
O	put
O	off
O	the
O	cruel
O	act
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	she
O	could
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	never
O	do
O	to
O	wait
O	any
O	longer
O	They
O	were
O	nearly
O	at
O	the
O	capital
O	and
O	the
O	young
C	Prince
O	might
O	in
O	his
O	impatience
O	come
O	to
O	meet
O	them
O	and
O	the
O	opportunity
O	be
O	lost
O	So
O	next

O	at
O	noon
O	when
O	the

O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	in
O	her
O	life
O	beheld
O	daylight
O	She
O	uttered
O	a
O	deep
O	sigh
O	and
O	immediately
O	leaped
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	carriage
O	in
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	a
O	white
O	hind
O	which
O	fled
O	away
O	like
O	lightning
O	and
O	hid
O	itself
O	in
O	the
O	thickest
O	recesses
O	of
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	wood
O	None

O	a
O	storm
O	of
O	thunder
O	and
O	lightning
O	that
O	the
O	whole
O	cavalcade
O	took
O	shelter
O	in

O	they

O	after

O	so
O	the

O	indeed
O	the

O	was
O	so
O	weak
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	to

O	conveyed
O	in
O	a

O	much
O	But
O	the

O	was
O	so
O	overcome
O	by
O	this

O	affliction
O	that
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	he
O	did
O	not

O	Then
O	he
O	resolved
O	as

O	as
O	his

O	allowed
O	to

O	secretly
O	from

O	who
O	insisted
O	upon

O	fortunes
O	wherever

O	So
O	one
O	day
O	the
C	Prince
O	left
O	a
O	letter
O	for
O	his
O	father
O	assuring
O	him
O	that
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	his
O	mind
O	was
O	tranquillized
O	he
O	would
O	return
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	but
O	imploring
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	meantime
O	no
O	search
O	might
O	be
O	made
O	after
O	him
O	then
O	he
O	and
C	Becafico
O	departed
O	together
O	Meanwhile
O	the
O	poor
O	white
O	hind
O	fled
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	She
O	wandered
O	about
O	till
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	fountain
O	where
O	as
O	in
O	a
O	mirror
O	she
O	saw
O	her
O	own
O	changed
O	shape
O	and
O	wept
O	convulsed
O	with
O	grief
O	Then
O	hunger
O	began
O	to
O	attack
O	her
O	she
O	bent
O	her
O	head
O	and
O	browsed
O	upon
O	the
O	green
O	grass
O	which
O	she
O	was
O	surprised
O	to
O	find
O	tasted
O	very
O	good
O	She
O	laid
O	herself
O	down
O	on
O	a
O	bank
O	of
O	moss
O	but
O	passed
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	extreme
O	terror
O	hearing
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	roaring
O	around
O	her
O	and
O	often
O	forgetting
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	hind
O	trying
O	to
O	save
O	herself
O	by
O	climbing
O	a
O	tree
O	like
O	a
O	human
O	being
O	Daybreak
O	reassured
O	her
O	a
O	little
O	she
O	admired
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	the
O	wonderful
O	beauty
O	of
O	dawn
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	sun
O	rose
O	it
O	appeared
O	to
O	her
O	such
O	a
O	marvellous
O	sight
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	take
O	her
O	eyes
O	from
O	it
O	She
O	was
O	strangely
O	comforted
O	spite
O	of
O	all
O	her
O	misfortune
O	by
O	the
O	charm
O	that
O	she
O	found
O	out
O	every
O	minute
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	in
O	the
O	new
O	world
O	which
O	now
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	she
O	beheld
O	in
O	daylight
O	The
C	Fairy
C	Tulip
O	who
O	loved
C	Désirée
O	was
O	very
O	sorry
O	for
O	her
O	although
O	somewhat
O	offended
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	had
O	not
O	taken
O	her
O	advice
O	and
O	detained
O	the
C	Princess
O	safe
O	in
O	her
O	tower
O	till
O	she
O	was
O	fifteen
O	however
O	she
O	would
O	not
O	leave
O	her
O	a
O	prey
O	to
O	the
O	malice
O	of
O	the
C	Fairy
C	of
C	the
C	Fountain
O	so
O	contrived
O	invisibly
O	to
O	conduct
O	the
O	faithful
C	Gilliflower
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	poor
O	forlorn
O	hind
O	reposed
O	As
O	soon
O	as
C	Désirée
O	saw
O	her
O	she
O	leaped
O	the
O	stream
O	and
O	came
O	towards
O	her
O	former
O	companion
O	lavishing
O	on
O	her
O	a
O	thousand
O	caresses
O	At
O	first
C	Gilliflower
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	astonished
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	taken
O	notice
O	of
O	by
O	a
O	deer
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	but
O	looking
O	at
O	it
O	attentively
O	she
O	saw
O	two
O	great
O	tears
O	rolling
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	soft
O	eyes
O	and
O	some
O	instinct
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	her
O	dear
C	Princess
O	She
O	took
O	the
O	forefeet
O	of
O	the
O	hind
O	and
O	kissed
O	them
O	as
O	respectfully
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	her
O	mistress
O	s
O	hands
O	She
O	spoke
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	though
O	the
O	hind
O	could
O	not
O	reply
O	yet
O	it
O	was
O	clear
O	she
O	understood
O	for
O	the
O	tears
O	flowed
O	faster
O	than
O	ever
O	and
O	she
O	showed
O	by
O	as
O	much
O	intelligence
O	as
O	a
O	dumb
O	beast
O	could
O	possibly
O	evince
O	that
O	she
O	responded
O	to
O	the
O	love
O	of
O	the
O	faithful
O	girl
O	When
C	Gilliflower
O	promised
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	never
O	quit
O	her
O	by
O	a
O	hundred
O	little
O	signs
O	the
O	poor
O	hind
O	tried
O	to
O	express
O	how
O	happy
O	she
O	was
O	They
O	passed
O	the
O	day
O	together
C	Désirée
O	leading
O	her
O	companion
O	to
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	she
O	had
O	seen
O	plenty
O	of
O	wild
O	fruits
O	so
O	that
C	Gilliflower
O	who
O	was
O	dying
O	of
O	hunger
O	became
O	strengthened
O	and
O	refreshed
O	But
O	when
O	night
O	came
O	the
O	girl
O	s
O	terrors
O	returned
O	Dear
O	hind
O	said
O	she
O	where
O	shall
O	we
O	sleep
O	If
O	we
O	stay
O	here
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	will
O	devour
O	us
O	is
O	there
O	no
O	little
O	hut
O	where
O	we
O	can
O	hide
O	The
O	poor
O	hind
O	shook
O	her
O	pretty
O	head
O	and
O	the
O	tears
O	again
O	began
O	to
O	flow
O	almost
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	a
O	human
O	being
O	Her
O	tears
O	melted
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Tulip
O	who
O	had
O	watched
O	her
O	invisibly
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	and
O	now
O	made
O	herself
O	known
O	appearing
O	suddenly
O	in
O	a
O	shady
O	alley
O	of
O	the
O	wood
C	Gilliflower
O	and
O	the
O	white
O	hind
O	threw
O	themselves
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	the
O	latter
O	licking
O	her
O	hands
O	and
O	caressing
O	her
O	as
O	prettily
O	as
O	a
O	deer
O	could
O	the
O	former
O	imploring
O	her
O	to
O	take
O	pity
O	on
O	the
C	Princess
O	and
O	restore
O	her
O	to
O	her
O	natural
O	shape
O	I
O	cannot
O	do
O	that
O	said
O	the
C	Fairy
O	her
O	enemy
O	has
O	too
O	much
O	power
O	but
O	I
O	can
O	shorten
O	her
O	term
O	of
O	punishment
O	and
O	soften
O	it
O	a
O	little
O	by
O	granting
O	that
O	during
O	every
O	night
O	she
O	becomes
O	a
O	woman
O	though
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	day
O	breaks
O	she
O	must
O	again
O	wander
O	about
O	as
O	a
O	hind
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	comfort
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	woman
O	every
O	night
O	and
O	the
O	hind
O	showed
O	her
O	joy
O	by
O	innumerable
O	leaps
O	and
O	bounds
O	which
O	delighted
O	the
O	good
O	Tulip
O	Follow
O	this
O	said
O	she
O	and
O	you
O	will
O	find
O	a
O	hut
O	that
O	will
O	serve
O	you
O	as
O	a
O	quiet
O	home
O	Farewell
O	She
O	disappeared
O	and
C	Gilliflower
O	with
O	the
O	hind
O	trotting
O	after
O	her
O	went
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	till
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	hut
O	before
O	which
O	sat
O	an
C	old
C	woman
O	making
O	a
O	basket
O	of
O	osiers
O	My
O	good
O	woman
O	said
O	she
O	have
O	you
O	a
O	room
O	to
O	let
O	for
O	me
O	and
O	my
O	pet
O	here
O	Yes
O	truly
O	replied
O	the
C	old
C	woman
O	and
O	took
O	them
O	into
O	a
O	room
O	where
O	were
O	two
O	little
O	beds
O	hung
O	with
O	white
O	dimity
O	with
O	fine
O	white
O	sheets
O	and
O	everything
O	as
O	neat
O	and
O	comfortable
O	as
O	possible
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	grew
O	dark
O	the
C	Princess
O	recovered
O	her
O	own
O	shape
O	and
O	kissed
O	and
O	embraced
O	a
O	thousand
O	times
O	her
O	dear
C	Gilliflower
O	who
O	on
O	her
O	part
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	delight
O	and
O	thankfulness
O	Then
O	they
O	had
O	their
O	supper
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	in
O	their
O	two
O	little
O	beds
O	When
O	morning
O	broke
C	Gilliflower
O	was
O	awakened
O	by
O	a
O	scratching
O	and
O	there
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	hind
O	just
O	as
O	much
O	a
O	hind
O	as
O	before
O	waiting
O	to
O	be
O	let
O	out
O	The
O	faithful
O	attendant
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	the
O	deer
O	sprang
O	out
O	quickly
O	and
O	disappeared
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	Now
O	by
O	an
O	extraordinary
O	chance
O	it
O	happened
O	that
C	Prince
C	Warrior
O	wandering
O	about
O	indifferent
O	to
O	where
O	he
O	went
O	lost
O	himself
O	in
O	this
O	very
O	forest
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	with
O	his
O	companion
C	Becafico
O	The
O	latter
O	seeking
O	for
O	fruits
O	to
O	satisfy
O	their
O	hunger
O	reached
O	the
O	same
O	where
O	the
C	old
C	woman
O	lived
O	and
O	being
O	received
O	kindly
O	asked
O	her
O	for
O	some
O	food
O	for
O	his
O	master
O	She
O	put
O	some
O	bread
O	into
O	a
O	basket
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	give
O	it
O	to
O	him
O	when
O	her
O	charity
O	made
O	her
O	offer
O	the
O	wanderers
O	shelter
O	for
O	the
O	night
O	It
O	is
O	a
O	poor
O	cottage
O	said
O	she
O	but
O	I
O	have
O	still
O	one
O	empty
O	room
O	which
O	will
O	at
O	least
O	save
O	you
O	from
O	being
O	eaten
O	up
O	by
O	wolves
O	and
O	lions
O	So
O	the
C	Prince
O	was
O	persuaded
O	and
O	the
C	old
C	woman
O	who
O	appeared
O	ignorant
O	of
O	his
O	rank
O	admitted
O	him
O	and
C	Becafico
O	cautiously
O	so
O	as
O	not
O	to
O	disturb
O	the
O	lady
O	and
O	the
O	hind
O	who
O	occupied
O	the
O	next
O	room
O	Thus
O	the
O	two
O	lovers
O	were
O	so
O	near
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	almost
O	have
O	heard
O	one
O	another
O	speak
O	yet
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	it
O	The
C	Prince
O	rarely
O	slept
O	much
O	his
O	sorrow
O	was
O	still
O	too
O	great
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	first
O	rays
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	shone
O	through
O	his
O	window
O	he
O	arose
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	There
O	he
O	wandered
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	without
O	finding
O	any
O	sure
O	track
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	bower
O	overhung
O	with
O	trees
O	and
O	carpeted
O	with
O	moss
O	out
O	of
O	which
O	started
O	a
O	beautiful
O	white
O	hind
O	who
O	immediately
O	fled
O	away
O	Now
O	the
C	Prince
O	had
O	formerly
O	been
O	a
O	great
O	hunter
O	until
O	his
O	passion
O	for
O	the
O	chase
O	was
O	swallowed
O	up
O	by
O	his
O	love
O	for
C	Désirée
O	but
O	the
O	old
O	fancy
O	returned
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	white
O	hind
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	following
O	her
O	and
O	sending
O	after
O	her
O	arrows
O	not
O	a
O	few
O	from
O	the
O	bow
O	which
O	he
O	always
O	carried
O	causing
O	her
O	almost
O	to
O	die
O	of
O	fear
O	although
O	by
O	the
O	care
O	of
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Tulip
O	she
O	was
O	not

O	he

O	until
O	towards

O	she
O	escaped
O	from
O	him
O	towards
O	the
O	cottage
O	where
C	Gilliflower
O	was
O	watching
O	in
O	the
O	utmost
O	anxiety
O	The
O	faithful
O	girl
O	received
O	tenderly
O	into
O	her
O	arms
O	the
O	poor
O	hind
O	breathless
O	exhausted
O	and
O	eagerly
O	awaited
O	the
O	moment
O	when
O	her
O	mistress
O	should
O	become
O	a
O	woman
O	again
O	and
O	tell
O	her
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	When
O	darkness
O	came
O	on
O	the
O	deer
O	vanished
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	the
C	Princess
C	Désirée
O	who
O	lay
O	on
C	Gilliflower
O	s
O	bosom
O	Alas
O	cried
O	she
O	weeping
O	I
O	have
O	more
O	to
O	fear
O	than
O	the
C	Fairy
C	of
C	the
C	Fountain
O	and
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	I
O	have
O	been
O	pursued
O	all
O	day
O	by
O	a
O	young
O	hunter
O	whom
O	I
O	had
O	scarcely
O	seen
O	before
O	he
O	obliged
O	me
O	to
O	fly
O	and
O	sent
O	so
O	many
O	arrows
O	after
O	me
O	that
O	I
O	marvel
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	killed
O	or
O	at
O	least
O	wounded
O	My
C	Princess
O	you
O	must
O	never
O	quit
O	this
O	room
O	again
O	said
C	Gilliflower
O	I
O	must
O	for
O	the
O	same
O	enchantment
O	which
O	makes
O	me
O	a
O	hind
O	forces
O	me
O	to
O	do
O	as
O	hinds
O	do
O	I
O	feel
O	myself
O	every
O	morning
O	irresistibly
O	compelled
O	to
O	run
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	to
O	leap
O	and
O	bound
O	and
O	eat
O	grass
O	and
O	behave
O	myself
O	exactly
O	like
O	a
O	wild
O	creature
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	Oh
O	how
O	weary
O	I
O	am
O	Her
O	soft
O	eyes
O	closed
O	and
O	she
O	fell
O	asleep
O	until
O	the
O	dawn
O	of
O	day
O	when
O	again
O	she
O	was
O	driven
O	out
O	in
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	a
O	poor
O	creature
O	to
O	fulfil
O	her
O	sad
O	destiny
O	The
C	Prince
O	on
O	his
O	part
O	came
O	home
O	also
O	very
O	much
O	wearied
O	and
O	vexed
C	Becafico
O	he
O	said
O	I
O	have
O	spent
O	the
O	day
O	in
O	chasing
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	hind
O	I
O	ever
O	saw
O	She
O	has
O	slipped
O	from
O	me
O	time
O	after
O	time
O	with
O	the
O	most
O	wondrous
O	adroitness
O	yet
O	my
O	arrows
O	were
O	so
O	true
O	that
O	I
O	marvel
O	how
O	she
O	escaped
O	At
O	dawn
O	I
O	must
O	be
O	after
O	her
O	once
O	more
O	So
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	fail
O	to
O	go
O	at
O	earliest
O	dawn
O	to
O	her
O	but
O	the
O	hind
O	took
O	care
O	not
O	to
O	her
O	favourite
O	haunt
O	He
O	sought
O	her
O	everywhere
O	and
O	could
O	see
O	nothing
O	then
O	being
O	very
O	tired
O	and
O	hot
O	he
O	gathered
O	some
O	luscious
O	apples
O	which
O	he
O	saw
O	hanging
O	upon
O	a
O	tree
O	over
O	his
O	head
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	ate
O	them
O	he
O	fell
O	fast
O	asleep
O	Meantime
O	the
O	hind
O	roaming
O	stealthily
O	about
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	came
O	quite
O	suddenly
O	or
O	else
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	taken
O	to
O	flight
O	but
O	now
O	seeing
O	her
O	enemy
O	sound
O	asleep
O	she
O	paused
O	a
O	minute
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	him
O	and
O	in
O	his
O	features
O	wasted
O	with
O	grief
O	but
O	still
O	so
O	loveable
O	and
O	beautiful
O	she
O	recognised
O	the
O	face
O	which
O	had
O	long
O	been
O	engraven
O	on
O	her
O	heart
O	The
O	poor
O	hind
O	she
O	crouched
O	down
O	at
O	a
O	little
O	distance
O	and
O	watched
O	him
O	her
O	eyes
O	beaming
O	with
O	joy
O	Then
O	she
O	sighed
O	at
O	length
O	become
O	bolder
O	she
O	approached
O	nearer
O	and
O	softly
O	touched
O	him
O	with
O	her
O	Awaking
O	what
O	was
O	the
C	Prince
O	s
O	surprise
O	to
O	see
O	beside
O	him
O	tame
O	and
O	familiar
O	the
O	pretty
O	creature
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	hunted
O	all
O	yesterday
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	put
O	out
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	seize
O	her
O	she
O	fled
O	away
O	like
O	lightning
O	He
O	followed
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	speed
O	he
O	could
O	and
O	thus
O	she
O	flying
O	and
O	he
O	pursuing
O	they
O	passed
O	the
O	whole
O	day
O	Towards
O	evening
O	her
O	strength
O	failed
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	hunter
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	poor
O	deer
O	that
O	he
O	found
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	grass
O	She
O	thought
O	her
O	death
O	was
O	certain
O	still
O	from
O	his
O	hands
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	seem
O	so
O	terrible
O	as
O	from
O	any
O	one
O	else
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	killing
O	her
O	he
O	caressed
O	her
O	Beautiful
O	hind
O	said
O	he
O	do
O	not
O	be
O	afraid
O	I
O	only
O	wish
O	to
O	take
O	you
O	home
O	with
O	me
O	and
O	have
O	you
O	with
O	me
O	always
O	He
O	cut
O	branches
O	of
O	trees
O	wove
O	them
O	ingeniously
O	into
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	couch
O	which
O	he
O	strewed
O	with
O	roses
O	and
O	moss
O	then
O	took
O	the
O	creature
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	laid
O	her
O	gently
O	down
O	upon
O	them
O	and
O	sat
O	beside
O	her
O	feeding
O	her
O	from
O	time
O	to
O	time
O	with
O	the
O	softest
O	grass
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	She
O	ate
O	contentedly
O	from
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	he
O	almost
O	fancied
O	she
O	understood
O	all
O	the
O	sweet
O	things
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	so
O	time
O	passed
O	till
O	it
O	grew
O	dusk
O	My
O	pretty
O	hind
O	said
O	he
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	a
O	stream
O	where
O	you
O	can
O	drink
O	and
O	then
O	we
O	will
O	take
O	our
O	way
O	home
O	together
O	But
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	absent
O	she
O	stole
O	away
O	and
O	had
O	only
O	time
O	to
O	reach
O	the
O	cottage
O	when
O	the
O	transformation
O	happened
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	hind
O	but
O	a
O	weeping
C	Princess
O	who
O	threw
O	herself
O	on
O	the
O	bed
O	beside
O	the
O	faithful
C	Gilliflower
O	I
O	have
O	seen
O	him
O	she
O	cried
O	My
C	Prince
C	Warrior
O	is
O	himself
O	in
O	this
O	forest
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	hunter
O	who
O	has
O	pursued
O	me
O	these
O	two
O	days
O	and
O	has
O	taken
O	me
O	at
O	last
O	But
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	slay
O	me
O	he
O	saved
O	and
O	caressed
O	me
O	Ah
O	he
O	is
O	gentler
O	and
O	sweeter
O	even
O	than
O	the
O	image
O	in
O	my
O	heart
O	Here
O	she
O	began
O	again
O	to
O	weep
O	but
C	Gilliflower
O	consoled
O	her
O	and
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	wondering
O	much
O	how
O	this
O	adventure
O	would
O	end
O	The
C	Prince
O	returning
O	from
O	the
O	stream
O	missed
O	his
O	beautiful
O	white
O	hind
O	and
O	came
O	back
O	to
C	Becafico
O	full
O	of
O	grief
O	mingled
O	with
O	a
O	certain
O	anger
O	at
O	the
O	ingratitude
O	of
O	the
O	creature
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	kind
O	But
O	at
O	break
O	of
O	day
O	he
O	rose
O	determined
O	again
O	to
O	pursue
O	her
O	She
O	however
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	avoid
O	him
O	took
O	a
O	quite
O	different
O	route
O	Still
O	the
O	forest
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	large
O	but
O	that
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	saw
O	her
O	leaping
O	and
O	bounding
O	among
O	the
O	bushes
O	Seized
O	by
O	an
O	irresistible
O	impulse
O	he
O	shot
O	an
O	arrow
O	after
O	her
O	it
O	struck
O	her
O	she
O	felt
O	a
O	violent
O	pain
O	dart
O	through
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	slender
O	limbs
O	and
O	fell
O	helpless
O	on
O	the
O	grass
O	When
O	the
C	Prince
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	he
O	was
O	overcome
O	with
O	remorse
O	for
O	his
O	cruelty
O	He
O	took
O	a
O	handful
O	of
O	herbs
O	and
O	bound
O	up
O	her
O	wound
O	made
O	her
O	a
O	bed
O	of
O	branches
O	and
O	moss
O	laid
O	her
O	head
O	upon
O	his
O	knees
O	and
O	wept
O	over
O	her
O	My
O	lovely
O	hind
O	said
O	he
O	why
O	did
O	I
O	wound
O	you
O	so
O	cruelly
O	You
O	will
O	hate
O	me
O	when
O	I
O	wish
O	you
O	to
O	love
O	me
O	So
O	he
O	tended
O	and
O	cherished
O	her
O	all
O	day
O	and
O	towards
O	nightfall
O	he
O	knotted
O	a
O	ribbon
O	round
O	her
O	neck
O	with
O	the
O	intention
O	of
O	gently
O	leading
O	her
O	home
O	But
O	she
O	struggled
O	with
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	struggle
O	was
O	so
O	sore
O	that
C	Gilliflower
O	coming
O	out
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	her
O	dear
O	mistress
O	heard
O	the
O	rustling
O	and
O	saw
O	her
O	hind
O	in
O	the
O	hunter
O	s
O	power
O	She
O	rushed
O	to
O	rescue
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	prince
O	s
O	great
O	astonishment
O	Whatever
O	consideration
O	I
O	owe
O	you
O	madam
O	said
O	he
O	you
O	must

O	that

O	committing
O	a
O	robbery
O	this
O	hind
O	is
O	mine
O	No
O	sir
O	she
O	is
O	mine
O	returned
C	Gilliflower
O	respectfully
O	She
O	knows
O	she
O	is
O	and
O	will
O	prove
O	it
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	only
O	give
O	her
O	a
O	little
O	liberty
O	My
O	pretty
O	pet
O	come
O	and
O	embrace
O	me
O	The
O	hind
O	crept
O	into
O	her
O	arms
O	Now
O	kiss
O	me
O	on
O	my
O	right
O	cheek
O	She
O	obeyed
O	Now
O	touch
O	my
O	heart
O	She
O	laid
O	her
O	foot
O	against
C	Gilliflower
O	s
O	bosom
O	I
O	allow
O	she

O	said
O	the
C	Prince
O	discontentedly
O	Take
O	her
O	and
O	go
O	your
O	ways
O	But
O	he
O	followed
O	them
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	and
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	enter
O	the
O	cottage
O	He
O	asked
O	the
C	old
C	woman
O	who
O	the
O	damsel
O	was
O	but
O	she
O	said
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	except
O	that
O	the
O	lady
O	and
O	the
O	hind
O	lived
O	there
O	together
O	in
O	solitude
O	and
O	paid
O	her
O	well
O	But
O	when
C	Becafico
O	who
O	had
O	eyes
O	as
O	sharp
O	as

O	coming
O	to

O	by
O	chance
O	caught
O	sight

O	that

O	which
O	only
O	recalls
O	my

O	said
O	the
C	Prince
O	sadly
O	but
C	Becafico
O	determined
O	to
O	gratify
O	his
O	curiosity
O	made
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	inquiries
O	and

O	was
O	lodged
O	in
O	the

O	I
O	should

O	the

O	better
O	let

O	He

O	Sir
O	cried

O	only

O	you

O	the

O	which
O	so
O	fascinated
O	you
O	The
C	Prince
O	looked
O	and
O	recognised
O	at

O	his

O	He
O	would
O	have

O	with
O	joy
O	had
O	he
O	not

O	He
O	knocked
O	at

C	Gilliflower
O	opened
O	it
O	he
O	entered
O	and
O	threw

C	Désirée
O	What
O	followed
O	of
O	explanations
O	vows
O	tears
O	and

O	was
O	never

O	not
O	even
O	by
C	Gilliflower
O	and
C	Becafico
O	who
O	were
O	present
O	but
O	who
O	considerately
O	drew
O	aside
O	and
O	spent
O	the
O	time
O	in
O	conversing
O	with
O	one
O	another
O	So
O	passed
O	the
O	night
O	and
O	anxiously
O	they
O	awaited
O	for
O	the
O	dawn
O	to
O	see
O	whether
O	the
O	beautiful
C	Princess
O	would
O	again

O	But
O	the
O	day
O	broke
O	grew
O	clearer
O	brightened
O	into
O	sunrise
O	and
O	the
C	Princess
O	with
O	the
C	Prince
O	sitting
O	beside
O	her
O	remained
O	a
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	still
O	Then
O	came
O	a
O	knock
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	there
O	entered
O	the
O	little
C	old
C	woman
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	such
O	a
O	kind
O	hostess
O	for
O	all
O	this
O	while
O	The
O	period
O	of
O	enchantment
O	is
O	ended
O	my
O	children
O	said
O	she
O	Go
O	home
O	and
O	be
O	happy
O	And
O	then
O	they
O	knew
O	her
O	as
O	no
O	longer
O	the
O	little
C	old
C	woman
O	but

C	Fairy
C	Tulip
O	who

O	So
O	the

O	returned
O	to

O	capital
O	where
O	the
O	marriage
O	was
O	solemnized
O	with

O	were
O	set
O	free

O	no
O	further
O	punishment
O	than
O	banishment
O	to
O	their
O	own
O	country
O	where
O	they
O	were
O	to
O	remain
O	for
O	life
O	As
O	for
O	the
O	faithful
C	Gilliflower
O	she
O	stayed
O	at

O	with

O	as
O	devotedly
O	as
O	she
O	the

C	Désirée
O	The
O	two

O	and

O	the
O	happiness
O	of
O	the

O	death
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	the
O	White
O	Hind
O	of

O	in

O	half
O	over
O	the

O	A
C	brother
O	took
O	his
C	sister
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	and
O	said
O	Since
O	our

O	we
O	have
O	no
O	more
O	happy
O	hours
O	our

O	her
O	she

O	away
O	She
O	gives

O	for
O	he
O	does
O	sometimes
O	get
O	a
O	nice
O	bit
O	thrown
O	to

O	It

O	it
O	Come
O	we
O	will
O	go
O	out
O	into
O	the
O	wide
O	world
O	together
O	They
O	went
O	along
O	the
O	whole
O	day
O	through
O	meadows
O	over
O	rocks
O	and
O	stones
O	and
O	when
O	it
O	rained
O	the
O	little
C	sister
O	said
O	Heaven
O	and
O	our
O	hearts
O	are
O	crying
O	together
O	In
O	the
O	evening
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	wood
O	and
O	were
O	so
O	worn
O	out
O	with
O	grief
O	hunger
O	and
O	weariness
O	that
O	they
O	sat
O	down
O	in

O	and
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	The
O	next

O	awoke
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	already
O	high
O	in
O	the

O	and
O	shone
O	down
O	very
O	hot
O	on
O	the
O	tree
O	Upon
O	which
O	said
O	the
C	brother
C	sister
O	I
O	am
O	thirsty
O	I
O	would
O	go
O	and
O	have
O	a
O	drink
O	if
O	I
O	knew
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	spring
O	I
O	think
O	I
O	can
O	hear
O	one
O	trickling
O	He
O	got
O	up
O	took
O	his
C	sister
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	and
O	they

O	to
O	look
O	for
O	the

O	The
O	wicked
O	stepmother
O	however
O	who
O	was
O	a
C	witch
O	and
O	well
O	knew
O	how
O	the

O	had
O	run
O	away

O	after

O	secretly
O	in
O	the

O	witches
O	do
O	and
O	had
O	bewitched
O	all
O	the
O	springs
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	found
O	a
O	spring
O	that
O	was
O	dancing
O	brightly
O	over
O	the
O	stones
O	the
C	brother
O	stooped
O	down
O	to
O	drink
O	but
O	his
C	sister
O	heard
O	a
O	voice
O	in
O	its
O	murmur
O	which
O	said
O	Whoever
O	drinks
O	of
O	me
O	will
O	become
O	a
O	tiger
O	Eagerly
O	the
O	little
C	sister
O	cried
O	I
O	pray
O	thee
C	brother
O	do
O	not
O	drink
O	lest
O	thou
O	become
O	a
O	wild
O	beast
O	and
O	tear
O	me
O	to
O	pieces
O	The
C	brother
O	did
O	not
O	drink
O	although
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	thirsty
O	but
O	said
O	I
O	will
O	wait
O	for
O	the
O	next
O	spring
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	next
O	the
O	little
C	sister
O	heard
O	it
O	say
O	Who
O	drinks
O	of
O	me
O	will
O	become
O	a
O	wolf
O	who
O	drinks
O	of
O	me
O	will
O	become
O	a
O	wolf
O	and
O	cried
O	out
O	Oh
C	brother
O	I
O	pray
O	thee
O	do
O	not
O	drink
O	lest
O	thou
O	become
O	a
O	wolf
O	and
O	eat
O	me
O	up
O	The
C	brother
O	did
O	not
O	drink
O	but
O	said
O	I
O	will
O	wait
O	till
O	I
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	next
O	spring
O	but
O	then
O	I
O	must
O	drink
O	say
O	what
O	you
O	will
O	for
O	my
O	thirst
O	is
O	getting
O	unbearable
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	third
O	spring
O	the
O	little
C	sister
O	heard
O	a
O	voice
O	in
O	its
O	murmur
O	saying
O	Whoever
O	drinks
O	of
O	me
O	will
O	become
O	a
O	roe
O	and
O	she
O	cried
O	Oh
C	brother
O	do
O	not
O	drink
O	I
O	pray
O	thee
O	lest
O	thou
O	become
O	a
C	roe
O	and
O	run
O	away
O	from
O	me
O	But
O	the
C	brother
O	had
O	already
O	knelt
O	down
O	by
O	the
O	stream
O	stooped
O	down
O	and
O	drank
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	first
O	drop
O	touched
O	his
O	lips
O	there
O	he
O	lay
O	a
O	white
C	roe
O	The
O	little
C	sister
O	cried
O	over
O	her
O	poor
O	bewitched
C	brother
O	and
O	the
C	roe
O	cried
O	also
O	as
O	he
O	rested
O	mournfully
O	beside
O	her
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	maiden
O	said
O	Never
O	mind
O	dear
C	roe
O	I
O	will
O	never
O	forsake
O	you
O	So
O	she
O	took
O	off
O	her
O	golden
O	garter
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	round
O	the
C	roe
O	s
O	neck
O	then
O	pulled
O	some
O	rushes
O	and
O	wove
O	them
O	into
O	a
O	cord
O	To
O	this
O	she
O	tied
O	the
O	little
O	animal
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	on
O	and
O	they
O	both
O	went
O	still
O	deeper
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	When
O	they
O	had
O	gone
O	a
O	long
O	long
O	way
O	they
O	came
O	at
O	last
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	house
O	into
O	which
O	the
O	maiden
O	peeped
O	and
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	empty
O	she
O	thought
O	Here
O	we
O	may
O	stay
O	and
O	live
O	So
O	she
O	made
O	a
O	pretty
O	bed
O	of
O	leaves
O	and
O	moss
O	for
O	the
C	roe
O	and
O	every
O	morning
O	she
O	went
O	out
O	and
O	gathered
O	roots
O	berries
O	and
O	nuts
O	for
O	herself
O	and
O	for
O	the
C	roe
O	she
O	brought
O	tender
O	grass
O	which
O	he
O	ate
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	hand
O	and
O	played
O	about
O	and
O	was
O	very
O	happy
O	In
O	the
O	evening
O	when
O	the
O	little
C	sister
O	was
O	tired
O	and
O	had
O	said
O	her
O	prayers
O	she
O	laid
O	her
O	head
O	upon
O	the
C	roe
O	who
O	was
O	her
O	pillow
O	and
O	went
O	sweetly
O	to
O	sleep
O	and
O	if
O	her
C	brother
O	had
O	only
O	kept
O	his
O	proper
O	shape
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	led
O	a
O	very
O	happy
O	life
O	They
O	had
O	lived
O	alone
O	in
O	this
O	way
O	during
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	when
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	held
O	a
O	great
O	hunt
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	Through
O	the
O	trees
O	might
O	be
O	heard
O	the
O	blowing
O	of
O	horns
O	the
O	barking
O	of
O	dogs
O	and
O	the
O	joyous
O	cries
O	of
O	the
O	hunters
O	which
O	when
O	the
O	little
C	roe
O	heard
O	he
O	was
O	almost
O	beside
O	himself
O	with
O	delight
O	Oh
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	his
C	sister
O	let
O	me
O	go
O	and
O	see
O	the
O	hunt
O	I
O	can
O	no
O	longer
O	refrain
O	and
O	he
O	begged
O	hard
O	till
O	she
O	consented
O	But
O	said
O	she
O	when
O	you
O	return
O	at
O	evening
O	I
O	shall
O	have
O	shut
O	my
O	door
O	against
O	the
O	wild
C	huntsmen
O	and
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	I
O	may
O	know
O	you
O	knock
O	and
O	say
O	My
O	little
C	sister
O	let
O	me
O	in
O	but
O	if
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	say
O	so
O	I
O	shall
O	not
O	open
O	the
O	door
O	Now
O	off
O	sprang
O	the
C	roe
O	and
O	was
O	so
O	happy
O	to
O	find
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	open
O	air
O	The
C	king
O	and
O	his

O	for
O	when
O	they
O	thought
O	they
O	had
O	certainly
O	got

O	he

O	over
O	a

O	and
O	disappeared

O	knocked
O	and
O	cried
O	My
O	little
C	sister
O	let
O	me
O	in
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	door
O	was
O	opened
O	he
O	sprang
O	in
O	and
O	rested
O	all
O	night
O	on
O	his
O	pretty
O	little
O	bed
O	Next
O	morning
O	the
O	hunt
O	began
O	again
O	and
O	when
O	the
C	roe
O	heard
O	the
O	blast
O	of
O	the
O	horns
O	and
O	the
O	Ho
O	ho
O	of
O	the

O	and
O	said
O	But
O	mind
O	you
O	must
O	be
O	back
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	and
O	make
O	your
O	little
O	speech
O	that
O	I
O	may
O	let
O	you
O	in
O	When
O	the
C	king
O	and
O	his
C	huntsmen
O	saw
O	the
O	white
C	roe
O	with
O	the
O	gold
O	band
O	once
O	more
O	they
O	all
O	rode
O	after
O	him
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	too
O	quick
O	and
O	agile
O	for
O	them
O	This
O	chase
O	lasted
O	the
O	whole
O	day
O	at
O	last
O	towards
O	evening
O	the
O	hunters
O	surrounded
O	him
O	and
O	wounded
O	him
O	with
O	an
O	arrow
O	in
O	the
O	foot
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	limp
O	and
O	go
O	slowly
O	One
O	of
O	the
O	hunters
O	creeping
O	softly
O	after
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	house
O	heard
O	him
O	say
O	My
C	sister
O	let
O	me
O	in
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	the
O	door
O	was
O	opened
O	and
O	immediately
O	shut
O	to
O	again
O	so
O	he
O	went
O	back
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	all
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	and
O	heard
O	We
O	will
O	have
O	another
O	hunt
O	said
O	the
C	king
O	The
O	little
C	sister
O	was
O	greatly
O	alarmed
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	her
O	white
C	roe
O	was
O	wounded
O	she
O	washed
O	off
O	the
O	blood
O	laid
O	herbs
O	upon
O	the
O	place
O	and
O	said
O	Go
O	now
O	to
O	thy
O	bed
O	dear
C	roe
O	and
O	get
O	well
O	The
O	wound
O	however
O	was
O	so
O	slight
O	that
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	he
O	felt
O	nothing
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	the
O	hunt
O	he
O	said
O	I
O	cannot
O	keep
O	away
O	I
O	must
O	go
O	and
O	nothing
O	shall
O	keep
O	me
O	His
C	sister
O	cried
O	and
O	said
O	Now
O	you
O	will
O	go
O	and
O	be
O	killed
O	and
O	leave
O	me
O	here
O	alone
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	forsaken
O	by
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	let
O	you
O	go
O	out
O	Then
O	I
O	shall
O	die
O	here
O	of
O	grief
O	answered
O	the
C	roe
O	for
O	when
O	I
O	hear
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	the
O	horn
O	I
O	do
O	feel
O	as
O	if
O	I
O	could
O	jump
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	shoes
O	So
O	his
C	sister
O	could
O	not
O	do
O	less
O	than
O	open
O	the
O	door
O	with
O	a
O	heavy
O	heart
O	and
O	the
C	roe
O	sprang
O	out
O	joyfully
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
C	king
O	saw
O	him
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	his
C	huntsmen
O	Now
O	hunt
O	him
O	all
O	day
O	till
O	evening
O	but
O	don

O	do
O	anything
O	to
O	hurt
O	him
O	When
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	set
O	the
C	king
O	said
O	to
O	his
O	huntsman
O	Now
O	come
O	and
O	show
O	me
O	the
O	little
O	house
O	you
O	saw
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	before
O	the
O	door
O	he
O	knocked
O	and
O	cried
O	Dear
O	little
C	sister
O	let
O	me
O	in
O	Immediately
O	the
O	door
O	opened
O	the
C	king
O	entered
O	and
O	there
O	stood
O	a
O	maiden
O	more
O	beautiful
O	than
O	any
O	one
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	seen
O	The
O	damsel
O	was
O	frightened
O	when
O	she
O	found
O	there
O	had
O	come
O	in
O	not
O	her
C	roe
O	but
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	wore
O	a
O	golden
O	crown
O	on
O	his
O	head
O	But
O	the
C	king
O	looked
O	kindly
O	at
O	her
O	took
O	her
O	hand
O	and
O	said
O	Wilt
O	thou
O	go
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	my
O	castle
O	and
O	be
O	my
O	dear
O	wife
O	Oh
O	yes
O	answered
O	the
O	maiden
O	but
O	the
C	roe
O	must
O	come
O	with
O	me
O	for
O	I
O	cannot
O	forsake
O	him
O	The
C	king
O	replied
O	He
O	shall
O	remain
O	with
O	you
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	you
O	live
O	and
O	shall
O	want
O	for
O	nothing
O	At
O	this
O	moment
O	he
O	came
O	springing
O	in
O	his
C	sister
O	tied
O	the
O	cord
O	of
O	rushes
O	round
O	his
O	neck
O	led
O	him
O	with
O	her
O	own
O	hand
O	and
O	they
O	all
O	left
O	the

O	house
O	together
O	The
C	king
O	took
O	the
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	on
O	his

O	horse
O	and
O	conducted
O	her
O	to
O	his
O	castle
O	where
O	the
O	marriage
O	was
O	celebrated
O	with
O	great
O	pomp
O	She
O	was
O	now
C	queen
O	and
O	they
O	lived
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	very
O	happily
O	together
O	while
O	the
C	roe
O	was
O	petted
O	and
O	taken
O	care
O	of
O	and
O	played
O	all
O	day
O	about

O	account
O	these
O	children
O	had
O	been
O	driven
O	into
O	the
O	wide
O	world
O	thought
O	nothing
O	less
O	than
O	that
O	the
O	little
C	sister
O	had
O	been
O	torn
O	to
O	pieces
O	by
O	wild
O	beasts
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	that
O	the
C	brother
O	in
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	a
C	roe
O	had
O	been
O	killed
O	by

O	hunters
O	When

O	now
O	heard
O	they
O	were
O	so
O	happy

O	that
O	everything
O	went
O	well
O	with
O	them
O	envy
O	and
O	spite

O	and
O	gave
O	her

O	she
O	could
O	do
O	some
O	mischief
O	to
O	them
O	both
O	Her
O	own
O	daughter
O	who
O	was
O	as
O	ugly
O	as
O	the
O	night
O	and
O	had
O	only
O	one
O	eye
O	was
O	continually
O	reproaching
O	her
O	and
O	saying

O	to
O	console
O	her
O	when

O	time
O	comes
O	I
O	will

O	by
O	the
C	queen
O	gave
O	birth
O	to
O	a
O	beautiful
O	little
O	boy
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	being
O	away
O	at
O	the
O	hunt
O	the
O	old
C	witch
O	took
O	upon
O	herself
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	the
O	entered
O	the
O	room
O	where
O	the
C	queen
O	lay
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	Come
O	the
O	bath
O	is
O	ready
O	which
O	will
O	do
O	you
O	good
O	and
O	give
O	you
O	new
O	strength
O	make
O	haste
O	before
O	it
O	gets
O	cold
O	Her
O	daughter
O	was
O	also
O	at
O	hand
O	and
O	they
O	carried
O	the
O	poor
O	weak
C	queen
O	between
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	bathroom
O	and
O	laid
O	her
O	in
O	the
O	bath
O	then
O	they
O	shut
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	ran
O	away
O	But
O	under
O	the
O	bath
O	they
O	had
O	first
O	lighted
O	a
O	great
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	beautiful
O	young
C	queen
O	could
O	not
O	save
O	herself
O	from
O	being
O	scorched
O	alive
O	When
O	that
O	was
O	done
O	the
O	old
C	witch
O	took
O	her
O	own
O	daughter
O	put
O	a
O	cap
O	on
O	her
O	and
O	laid
O	her
O	on
O	the
O	bed
O	in
O	the
C	queen
O	s
O	room
O	She
O	changed
O	her
O	also
O	into
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	the
O	young
C	queen
O	all
O	except
O	her
O	one
O	eye
O	and
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	give
O	her
O	another
O	But
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	might
O	not
O	observe
O	it
O	she
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	lie
O	on
O	that
O	side
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	eye
O	In
O	the
O	evening
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	come
O	home
O	and
O	heard
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	little
O	son
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	delighted
O	and
O	wished
O	to
O	visit
O	his
O	dear
O	wife
O	and
O	see
O	how
O	she
O	was
O	getting
O	on
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	cried
O	out
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	hurry
O	As
O	you
O	value
O	your
O	life
O	don

O	touch
O	the

O	the

O	must
O	not
O	see
O	the
O	light
O	and
O	must
O	be
O	left
O	quite
O	quiet
O	So
O	the
C	king
O	went
O	away
O	and
O	never
O	found
O	out
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	false
C	queen
O	in
O	the
O	bed
O	But
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	midnight
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	was
O	asleep
O	the
O	nurse
O	who
O	was
O	sitting
O	beside
O	the
O	cradle
O	and
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	person
O	awake
O	saw
O	the
O	door
O	open
O	and
O	the
O	true
C	queen
O	come
O	in
O	She
O	took
O	the
C	baby
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	cradle
O	laid
O	it
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	and
O	nursed
O	it
O	tenderly
O	She
O	then
O	shook
O	up
O	the
O	pillows
O	laid
O	it
O	down
O	again
O	and
O	covered
O	it
O	with
O	the
O	counterpane
O	She
O	did
O	not
O	forget
O	the
C	roe
O	either
O	but
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	corner
O	where
O	it
O	lay
O	and
O	stroked
O	it
O	gently
O	After
O	this
O	she
O	passed
O	out
O	quite
O	silently
O	through
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	the
O	nurse
O	inquired
O	next
O	morning
O	of
O	the
O	sentinels
O	whether
O	any
O	one
O	had
O	gained
O	entrance
O	into
O	the
O	palace
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	but
O	they
O	answered
O	No
O	we
O	have
O	seen
O	nobody
O	She
O	continued
O	to
O	come
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	way
O	for
O	several
O	nights
O	though
O	she
O	spoke
O	never
O	a
O	word
O	the
O	nurse
O	always
O	saw
O	her
O	but
O	never
O	dared
O	to
O	mention
O	it
O	When
O	some
O	time
O	had
O	passed
O	the
C	queen
O	at
O	last
O	began
O	to
O	speak
O	and
O	How
O	is
O	my
C	baby
O	How
O	is
O	my
C	roe
O	I
O	can
O	come
O	again
O	twice
O	then
O	for
O	ever
O	must
O	go
O	The
O	nurse
O	could
O	not
O	answer
O	her
O	but
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	disappeared
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	all
O	about
O	it
O	upon
O	which
O	he
O	cried
O	What
O	does
O	it
O	mean
O	I
O	will
O	myself
O	watch
O	by
O	the
O	child
O	In
O	the
O	evening
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	nursery
O	and
O	there
O	at
O	midnight
O	the
O	dead
C	queen
O	appeared
O	and
O	How
O	is
O	my
C	baby
O	How
O	is
O	my
C	roe
O	I
O	can
O	come
O	but
O	once
O	more
O	then
O	for

O	and
O	nursed
O	and
O	fondled
O	the
C	baby
O	as
O	before
O	then
O	vanished
O	The
C	king
O	did
O	not
O	dare
O	to
O	address
O	her
O	but
O	watched
O	again
O	the
O	following
O	night
O	This
O	time
O	she
O	How
O	is
O	my
C	baby
O	How
O	is
O	my
C	roe
O	I
O	can
O	come
O	but
O	this
O	once
O	then
O	for
O	ever
O	must
O	go
O	Upon
O	which
O	the
C	king
O	could
O	no
O	longer
O	contain
O	himself
O	but
O	sprang
O	forward
O	and
O	cried
O	Thou
O	canst
O	surely
O	be
O	no
O	one
O	but
O	my
O	own
O	dear
O	wife
O	She
O	replied
O	Yes
O	I
O	am
O	thy
O	dear
O	wife
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	spoken
O	these
O	words
O	she
O	was
O	restored
O	to
O	life
O	and
O	became
O	once
O	more
O	fresh
O	and
O	blooming
O	Then
O	she
O	related
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	the
O	crime
O	committed
O	on
O	her
O	by
O	the
O	old
C	witch
O	and
O	her
O	ugly
O	daughter
O	whom
O	he
O	at
O	once
O	commanded
O	to
O	be
O	brought
O	to
O	judgment
O	and
O	had
O	sentence
O	passed
O	upon
O	them
O	The
O	daughter
O	was
O	taken
O	forth
O	into
O	the
O	woods
O	where
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	tore
O	her
O	in
O	pieces
O	and
O	the
C	witch
O	was
O	burnt
O	And
O	behold
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	left
O	of
O	her
O	but
O	ashes
O	the
O	white
C	roe
O	became
O	changed
O	again
O	and
O	resumed
O	his
O	human
O	form
O	so
O	they
O	all
O	lived
O	happily
O	together
O	till
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	their
O	lives
O	A
O	poor
O	widow
O	lived
O	alone
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	cottage
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	garden
O	where
O	stood
O	two
O	little
O	one
O	bore
O	white
O	roses
O	the
O	other
O	red
O	The
O	widow
O	had
O	two
O	children
O	who
O	resembled
O	the
O	two
O	one
O	was
O	called
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	They
O	were
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	best
O	children
O	that
O	ever
O	lived
O	but
O	was
O	quieter
O	and
O	more
O	gentle
O	than
O	liked
O	best
O	to
O	jump
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	meadows
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	flowers
O	and
O	catch
O	butterflies
O	but
O	sat
O	at
O	home
O	with
O	her
C	mother
O	helped
O	her
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	or
O	read
O	to
O	her
O	when
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	else
O	to
O	do
O	The
O	two
O	children
O	loved
O	one
O	another
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	they
O	always
O	walked
O	hand
O	in
O	hand
O	and
O	when
O	said
O	We
O	will
O	not
O	forsake
O	one
O	another
O	answered
O	Never
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	we
O	live
O	and
O	the
C	mother
O	added
O	Yes
O	my
O	children
O	whatever
O	one
O	has
O	let
O	her
O	divide
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	They
O	often
O	ran
O	about
O	in
O	solitary
O	places
O	and
O	gathered
O	red
O	berries
O	and
O	the
O	wild
O	creatures
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	never
O	hurt
O	them
O	but
O	came
O	confidingly
O	up
O	to
O	them
O	The
O	little
O	hare
O	ate
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	hands
O	the
O	doe
O	grazed
O	at
O	their
O	side
O	the
O	stag
O	sprang
O	merrily
O	past
O	them
O	and
O	the
O	birds
O	remained
O	sitting
O	on
O	the
O	boughs
O	and
O	never
O	ceased
O	their
O	songs
O	They
O	met
O	with
O	no
O	accident
O	if
O	they
O	loitered
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	right
O	came
O	on
O	they
O	lay
O	down
O	together
O	on
O	the
O	moss
O	and
O	slept
O	till
O	morning
O	and
O	the
C	mother
O	knew
O	this
O	and
O	was
O	in
O	no
O	anxiety
O	about
O	them
O	Once
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	spent
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	the
O	red
O	morning
O	awoke
O	them
O	they
O	saw
O	a
O	beautiful
O	child
O	in
O	a
O	shining
O	white
O	dress
O	sitting
O	by
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	they
O	had
O	slept
O	who
O	arising
O	and
O	looking
O	at
O	them
O	kindly
O	said
O	nothing
O	but
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	And
O	when
O	they
O	looked
O	round
O	they
O	found
O	out
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	sleeping
O	close
O	to
O	a
O	precipice
O	and
O	would
O	certainly
O	have
O	fallen
O	down
O	it
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	gone
O	a
O	few
O	steps
O	farther
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	Their
C	mother
O	told
O	them
O	it
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	the
O	angel
O	that
O	takes
O	care
O	of
O	good
O	children
O	who
O	had
O	sat
O	by
O	them
O	all
O	night
O	long
O	and
O	kept
O	their
C	mother
O	s
O	cottage
O	so
O	clean
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	pleasure
O	to
O	look
O	into
O	it
O	In
O	the
O	summer
O	managed
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	every
O	morning
O	she
O	gathered
O	a
O	nosegay
O	in
O	which
O	was
O	a
O	rose
O	off
O	each
O	tree
O	and
O	set
O	it
O	by
O	her
C	mother
O	s
O	bed
O	before
O	she
O	awoke
O	In
O	winter
O	lighted
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	hung
O	the
O	kettle
O	on
O	the
O	hook
O	and
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	copper
O	it
O	shone
O	like
O	gold
O	it
O	was
O	rubbed
O	so
O	clean
O	In
O	the
O	evening
O	when
O	the
O	snow
O	fell
O	the
C	mother
O	said
O	Go
O	and
O	bolt
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	then
O	they
O	seated
O	themselves
O	on
O	the
O	hearth
O	and
O	the
C	mother
O	took
O	her
O	spectacles
O	and
O	read
O	aloud
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	book
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	girls
O	listened
O	and
O	sat
O	and
O	span
O	Near
O	them
O	lay
O	a
O	lamb
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	and
O	behind
O	them
O	on
O	a
O	perch
O	sat
O	a
O	white
O	dove
O	with
O	its
O	head
O	under
O	its
O	wing
O	One
O	evening
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	thus
O	happy
O	together
O	some
O	one
O	knocked
O	to
O	be
O	let
O	in
O	The
C	mother
O	said
O	Quick
O	open
O	the
O	door
O	perhaps
O	it
O	is
O	a
O	traveller
O	who
O	seeks
O	shelter
O	went
O	and
O	pushed
O	the
O	bolt
O	back
O	and
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	poor
O	man
O	but
O	a
C	bear
O	stretched
O	his
O	thick
O	black
O	head
O	into
O	the
O	door
O	screamed
O	and
O	sprang
O	back
O	the
O	little
O	lamb
O	bleated
O	the
O	little
O	dove
O	fluttered
O	about
O	and
O	hid
O	herself
O	behind
O	her
C	mother
O	s
O	bed
O	However
O	the
C	bear
O	began
O	to
O	speak
O	and
O	said
O	Do
O	not
O	be
O	frightened
O	I
O	will
O	do
O	you
O	no
O	harm
O	I
O	am
O	half
O	frozen
O	and
O	only
O	want
O	to
O	warm
O	myself
O	a
O	little
O	You
O	poor
C	bear
O	said
O	the
C	mother
O	lay
O	yourself
O	down
O	before
O	the
O	fire
O	only
O	take
O	care
O	your
O	fur
O	does
O	not
O	burn
O	Then
O	she
O	called
O	out
O	and
O	come
O	out
O	the
C	bear
O	will
O	not
O	hurt
O	you
O	he
O	means
O	honestly
O	by
O	us
O	Then
O	they
O	both
O	came
O	out
O	and
O	by
O	degrees
O	the
O	lamb
O	and
O	the
O	dove
O	also
O	approached
O	and
O	ceased
O	to
O	be
O	afraid
O	The
C	bear
O	said
O	Children
O	knock
O	the
O	snow
O	a
O	little
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	fur
O	and
O	they
O	fetched
O	a
O	broom
O	and
O	swept
O	the
C	bear
O	s
O	skin
O	clean
O	and
O	he
O	stretched
O	himself
O	before
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	growled
O	softly
O	like
O	a
C	bear
O	that
O	was
O	quite
O	happy
O	and
O	comfortable
O	In
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	they
O	all
O	became
O	quite
O	friendly
O	together
O	and
O	the
O	children
O	played
O	tricks
O	with
O	the
O	awkward
O	guest
O	They
O	pulled
O	his
O	hair
O	set
O	their
O	feet
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	and
O	rolled
O	him
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	or
O	took
O	a
O	hazel
O	rod
O	and
O	beat
O	him
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	growled
O	they
O	laughed
O	The
C	bear
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	pleased
O	with
O	this
O	frolic
O	only
O	when
O	they
O	became
O	too
O	mischievous
O	he
O	called
O	out
O	Children
O	leave
O	me
O	alone
O	Little
O	and
O	You
O	will
O	strike
O	your
O	lover
O	dead
O	When
O	bedtime
O	came
O	and
O	the
O	others
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	the
C	mother
O	said
O	to
O	the
C	bear
O	You
O	can
O	lie
O	there
O	on
O	the
O	hearth
O	and
O	then
O	you
O	will
O	be
O	sheltered
O	from
O	the
O	cold
O	and
O	the
O	bad
O	weather
O	At
O	daybreak
O	the
O	two
O	children
O	let
O	him
O	out
O	and
O	he
O	trotted
O	over
O	the
O	snow
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	Henceforward
O	the
C	bear
O	came
O	every
O	evening
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	hour
O	laid
O	himself
O	on
O	the
O	hearth
O	and
O	allowed
O	the
O	children
O	to
O	play
O	with
O	him
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	they
O	liked
O	and
O	they
O	became
O	so
O	used
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	door
O	was
O	never
O	bolted
O	until
O	their
O	black
O	companion
O	had
O	arrived
O	When
O	spring
O	came
O	and
O	everything
O	was
O	green
O	out
O	of
O	doors
O	the
C	bear
O	said
O	one
O	morning
O	to
O	Now
O	I
O	must
O	go
O	away
O	and
O	may
O	not
O	come
O	again
O	the
O	whole
O	summer
O	Where
O	are
O	you
O	going
O	dear
C	bear
O	asked
O	I
O	must
O	go
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	guard
O	my
O	treasures
O	from
O	the
O	bad
O	dwarfs
O	in
O	winter
O	when
O	the
O	ground
O	is
O	frozen
O	hard
O	they
O	have
O	to
O	stay
O	underneath
O	and
O	cannot
O	work
O	their
O	way
O	through
O	but
O	now
O	that
O	the
O	sun
O	has
O	thawed
O	and
O	warmed
O	the
O	earth
O	they
O	break
O	through
O	come
O	up
O	seek
O	and
O	steal
O	what
O	is
O	once
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	and
O	lies
O	in
O	their
O	caverns
O	does
O	not
O	come
O	so
O	easily
O	into
O	daylight
O	again
O	was
O	quite
O	sorrowful
O	at
O	parting
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	unbolted
O	the
O	door
O	for
O	him
O	and
O	the
C	bear
O	ran
O	out
O	the
O	hook
O	of
O	the
O	door
O	caught
O	him
O	and
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	his
O	skin
O	tore
O	off
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	seen
O	gold
O	shining
O	through
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	not
O	sure
O	But
O	the
C	bear
O	ran
O	quickly
O	away
O	and
O	soon
O	disappeared
O	behind
O	the
O	trees
O	After
O	some
O	time
O	their
C	mother
O	sent
O	the
O	children
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	to
O	collect
O	faggots
O	They
O	found
O	there
O	a
O	large
O	tree
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	cut
O	down
O	and
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	trunk
O	something
O	was
O	jumping
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	but
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	As
O	they
O	came
O	nearer
O	they
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
C	dwarf
O	with
O	an
O	old
O	withered
O	face
O	and
O	a
O	beard
O	a
O	yard
O	long
O	The
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	beard
O	was
O	stuck
O	fast
O	in
O	a
O	cleft
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	jumped
O	about
O	like
O	a
O	dog
O	on
O	a
O	rope
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	to
O	help
O	himself
O	He
O	stared
O	at
O	the

O	Stupid
O	little
O	goose
O	answered
O	the
C	dwarf
O	I
O	wanted
O	to
O	chop
O	the
O	tree
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	have
O	some
O	small
O	pieces
O	of
O	wood
O	for
O	the
O	kitchen
O	we
O	only
O	want
O	little

O	are

O	like
O	you
O	great
O	greedy
O	people
O	burns
O	directly
O	I
O	had
O	driven
O	the
O	wedge
O	well
O	in
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	going
O	on
O	right
O	but
O	the
O	detestable
O	wood
O	was
O	too
O	smooth
O	and
O	sprang
O	out
O	unexpectedly
O	and
O	the
O	tree
O	closed
O	up
O	so
O	quickly
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	pull
O	my
O	beautiful
O	white
O	beard
O	out
O	now
O	it
O	is

O	you

O	crying
O	out
O	How
O	ugly
O	you
O	are
O	how
O	ugly
O	you
O	are
O	The
O	children
O	took
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	trouble
O	but
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	pull
O	the
O	beard
O	out
O	it
O	stuck
O	too
O	fast
O	I

O	you
O	are
O	two
O	too
O	many
O	for

O	now

O	t
O	you
O	think
O	of
O	anything
O	better
O	Only
O	don
O	t
O	be
O	impatient
O	said
O	I
O	have
O	thought
O	of
O	something
O	and
O	she
O	took
O	her
O	little
O	scissors
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	pocket
O	and
O	cut
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	beard
O	off
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
C	dwarf
O	felt
O	himself
O	free
O	he
O	seized
O	a
O	sack
O	filled
O	with
O	gold
O	that
O	was
O	sticking
O	between
O	the
O	roots
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	pulling
O	it
O	out
O	he
O	growled
O	to
O	himself
O	You
O	rude
O	people
O	to
O	cut
O	off
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	my
O	beautiful
O	beard
O	May
O	evil
O	reward
O	you
O	Then
O	he
O	threw
O	his
O	sack
O	over
O	his
O	shoulders
O	and
O	walked
O	away
O	without
O	once
O	looking
O	at
O	the
O	children
O	Some
O	time
O	afterwards
O	and
O	Rose
O	red
O	wished
O	to
O	catch
O	some
O	fish
O	for
O	dinner
O	As
O	they
O	came
O	near
O	to
O	the
O	stream
O	they
O	saw
O	that
O	something
O	like
O	a
O	grasshopper
O	was
O	jumping
O	towards
O	the
O	water
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	going
O	to
O	spring
O	in
O	They
O	ran
O	on
O	and
O	recognised
O	the
C	dwarf
O	Where
O	are
O	you
O	going
O	asked
O	You
O	don
O	t
O	want
O	to
O	go
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	such
O	a
O	fool
O	as
O	that
O	cried
O	the
C	dwarf
O	Don
O	t
O	you
O	see
O	the
O	detestable
O	fish
O	wants
O	to
O	pull
O	me
O	in
O	The
O	little
O	fellow
O	had
O	been
O	sitting
O	there
O	fishing
O	and
O	unluckily
O	the
O	wind
O	had
O	entangled
O	his
O	beard
O	with
O	the
O	line
O	When
O	directly
O	afterwards
O	a
O	great
O	fish
O	bit
O	at
O	his
O	hook
O	the
O	weak
O	creature
O	could
O	not
O	pull
O	him
O	out
O	so
O	the
O	fish
O	was
O	pulling
O	the
C	dwarf
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	It
O	is
O	true
O	he
O	caught
O	hold
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	reeds
O	and
O	rushes
O	but
O	that
O	did
O	not
O	help
O	him
O	much
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	follow
O	all
O	the
O	movements
O	of
O	the
O	fish
O	and
O	was
O	in
O	imminent
O	danger
O	of
O	being
O	drowned
O	The
O	girls
O	coming
O	at
O	the
O	right
O	time
O	held
O	him
O	fast
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	get
O	the
O	beard
O	loose
O	from
O	the
O	line
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	beard
O	and
O	line
O	were
O	entangled
O	fast
O	together
O	There
O	was
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	to
O	pull
O	out
O	the
O	scissors
O	and
O	to
O	cut
O	off
O	the
O	beard
O	in
O	doing
O	which
O	a
O	little
O	piece
O	of
O	it
O	was
O	lost
O	When
O	the
C	dwarf
O	saw
O	that
O	he
O	cried
O	out
O	Is
O	that
O	manners
O	you
O	goose
O	to
O	disfigure
O	one
O	s
O	face
O	so
O	Is
O	it
O	not
O	enough
O	that
O	you
O	once
O	cut
O	my
O	beard
O	shorter
O	But
O	now
O	you
O	have
O	cut
O	the
O	best
O	part
O	of
O	it
O	off
O	I
O	dare
O	not
O	be
O	seen
O	by
O	my
O	people
O	I
O	wish
O	you
O	had
O	had
O	to
O	run
O	and
O	had
O	lost
O	the
O	soles
O	of
O	your
O	shoes
O	Then
O	he
O	fetched
O	a
O	sack
O	of
O	pearls
O	that
O	lay
O	among
O	the
O	rushes
O	and
O	without
O	saying
O	a
O	word
O	more
O	he
O	dragged
O	it
O	away
O	and
O	disappeared
O	behind
O	a
O	stone
O	Soon
O	after
O	the
C	mother
O	sent
O	the
O	two
O	girls
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	to
O	buy
O	cotton
O	needles
O	cord
O	and
O	tape
O	The
O	road
O	led
O	them
O	by
O	a
O	heath
O	scattered
O	over
O	which
O	lay
O	great
O	masses
O	of
O	rock
O	There
O	they
O	saw
O	a
O	large
O	bird
O	hovering
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	it
O	flew
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	just
O	above
O	them
O	always
O	sinking
O	lower
O	and
O	lower
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	it
O	settled
O	down
O	by
O	a
O	rock
O	not
O	far
O	distant
O	Directly
O	after
O	they
O	heard
O	a
O	piercing
O	wailing
O	cry
O	They
O	ran
O	up
O	and
O	saw
O	with
O	horror
O	that
O	the
O	eagle
O	had
O	seized
O	their
O	old
O	acquaintance
O	the
C	dwarf
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	carry
O	him
O	off
O	The
O	compassionate
O	children
O	instantly
O	seized
O	hold
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	man
O	held
O	him
O	fast
O	and
O	struggled
O	so
O	long
O	that
O	the
O	eagle
O	let
O	his
O	prey
O	go
O	When
O	the
C	dwarf
O	had
O	recovered
O	from
O	his
O	first
O	fright
O	he
O	called
O	out
O	in
O	his
O	shrill
O	voice
O	Could
O	not
O	you
O	deal
O	rather
O	more
O	gently
O	with
O	me
O	You
O	have
O	torn
O	my
O	thin
O	coat
O	all
O	in
O	tatters
O	awkward
O	clumsy
O	creatures
O	that
O	you
O	are
O	Then
O	he
O	took
O	a
O	sack
O	of
O	precious
O	stones
O	and
O	slipped
O	behind
O	the
O	rock
O	again
O	into
O	his
O	den
O	The
O	girls
O	who
O	were
O	used
O	to
O	his
O	ingratitude
O	went
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	and
O	completed
O	their
O	business
O	in
O	the
O	town
O	As
O	they
O	were
O	coming
O	home
O	again
O	over
O	the
O	heath
O	they
O	surprised
O	the
C	dwarf
O	who
O	had
O	emptied
O	his
O	sack
O	of
O	precious
O	stones
O	on
O	a
O	little
O	clean
O	place
O	and
O	had
O	not
O	thought
O	that
O	any
O	one
O	would
O	come
O	by
O	there
O	so
O	late
O	The
O	evening
O	sun
O	shone
O	on
O	the
O	glittering
O	stones
O	which
O	looked
O	so
O	beautiful
O	in
O	all
O	their
O	colours
O	that
O	the
O	children
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	standing
O	still
O	to
O	gaze
O	Why
O	do
O	you
O	stand
O	there
O	gaping
O	cried
O	the
C	dwarf
O	his
O	face
O	turning
O	vermilion
O	with
O	anger
O	With
O	these
O	cross
O	words
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	away
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	loud
O	roaring
O	and
O	a
O	black
C	bear
O	trotted
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	towards
O	them
O	The
C	dwarf
O	sprang
O	up
O	terrified
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	to
O	his
O	lurking
O	hole
O	again
O	the
C	bear
O	was
O	already
O	close
O	upon
O	him
O	Then
O	he
O	called
O	out
O	in
O	anguish
O	Dear
O	Mr
C	bear
O	spare
O	me
O	and
O	you
O	shall
O	have
O	all
O	my
O	treasures
O	look
O	at
O	the
O	beautiful
O	precious
O	stones
O	that
O	lie
O	there
O	Give
O	me
O	my
O	life
O	for
O	what
O	do
O	you
O	want
O	with
O	a
O	poor
O	thin
O	little
O	fellow
O	like
O	me
O	You
O	would
O	scarcely
O	feel
O	me
O	between
O	your
O	teeth
O	Rather
O	seize
O	those
O	two
O	wicked
O	girls
O	they
O	will
O	be
O	tender
O	morsels
O	for
O	you
O	as
O	fat
O	as
O	young
O	quails
O	pray
O	eat
O	them
O	at
O	once
O	The
C	bear
O	without
O	troubling
O	himself
O	to
O	answer
O	gave
O	the
O	malicious
O	creature
O	one
O	single
O	stroke
O	with
O	his
O	paw
O	and
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	move
O	again
O	The
O	girls
O	had
O	run
O	away
O	but
O	the
C	bear
O	called
O	after
O	them
O	and
O	do
O	not
O	be
O	frightened
O	wait
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	with
O	you
O	Recognising
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	their
O	old
O	friend
O	they
O	stood
O	still
O	and
O	when
O	the
C	bear
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	them
O	his
O	skin
O	suddenly
O	fell
O	off
O	and
O	behold
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	a
C	bear
O	but
O	a
O	handsome
O	young
O	man
O	dressed
O	all
O	in
O	gold
O	I
O	am
O	a
O	king
O	s
O	son
O	said
O	he
O	I
O	was
O	changed
O	by
O	the
O	wicked
C	dwarf
O	who
O	had
O	stolen
O	all
O	my
O	treasures
O	into
O	a
O	wild
C	bear
O	and
O	obliged
O	to
O	run
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	until
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	freed
O	by
O	his
O	death
O	Now
O	he
O	has
O	received
O	his
O	punishment
O	So
O	they
O	all
O	went
O	home
O	together
O	to
O	the
O	widow
O	s
O	cottage
O	and
O	was
O	married
O	to
O	the
O	prince
O	and
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	They
O	divided
O	between
O	them
O	the
O	great
O	treasures
O	which
O	the
C	dwarf
O	had
O	amassed
O	The
O	old
C	mother
O	lived
O	many
O	quiet
O	and
O	happy
O	years
O	with
O	her
O	children
O	but
O	when
O	she
O	left
O	her
O	cottage
O	for
O	the
O	palace
O	she
O	took
O	the
O	two
O	with
O	her
O	and
O	they
O	stood
O	before
O	her
O	window
O	and
O	bore
O	every
O	year
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	roses
O	one
O	white
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	red
O	I
O	know
O	my
O	friends
O	that
O	you
O	will
O	wish
O	to
O	hear
O	how
O	after
O	having
O	been
O	shipwrecked
O	five
O	times
O	and
O	escaped
O	so
O	many
O	dangers
O	I
O	could
O	resolve
O	again
O	to
O	tempt
O	fortune
O	and
O	expose
O	myself
O	to
O	new
O	hardships
O	I
O	am
O	myself
O	astonished
O	at
O	my
O	conduct
O	when
O	I
O	reflect
O	upon
O	it
O	and
O	must
O	certainly
O	have
O	been
O	actuated
O	by
O	my
O	destiny
O	from
O	which
O	none
O	can
O	escape
O	Be
O	that
O	as
O	it
O	may
O	after
O	a
O	year
O	s
O	rest
O	I
O	prepared
O	for
O	a
O	sixth
O	voyage
O	notwithstanding
O	the
O	entreaties
O	of
O	my
O	kindred
O	and
O	friends
O	who
O	did
O	all
O	in
O	their
O	power
O	to
O	dissuade
O	me
O	Instead
O	of
O	taking
O	my
O	way
O	by
O	the
O	Persian
O	Gulf
O	I
O	travelled
O	once
O	more
O	through
O	several
O	provinces
O	of
O	Persia
O	and
O	the
O	Indies
O	and
O	arrived
O	at
O	a
O	seaport
O	where
O	I
O	embarked
O	in
O	a
O	ship
O	the
O	captain
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	bound
O	on
O	a
O	long
O	voyage
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	and
O	the
O	pilot
O	lost
O	their
O	course
O	Suddenly
O	we
O	saw
O	the
O	captain
O	quit
O	his
O	rudder
O	uttering
O	loud
O	lamentations
O	He
O	threw
O	off
O	his
O	turban
O	pulled
O	his
O	beard
O	and
O	beat
O	his
O	head
O	like
O	a
O	madman
O	We
O	asked
O	him
O	the
O	reason
O	and
O	he
O	answered
O	that
O	we
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	dangerous
O	place
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	ocean
O	A
O	rapid
O	current
O	carries
O	the
O	ship
O	along
O	with
O	it
O	and
O	we
O	shall
O	all
O	perish
O	in
O	less
O	than
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	Pray
O	to
O	God
O	to
O	deliver
O	us
O	from
O	this
O	peril
O	we
O	cannot
O	escape
O	if
O	He
O	do
O	not
O	take
O	pity
O	on
O	us
O	At
O	these
O	words
O	he
O	ordered
O	the
O	sails
O	to
O	be
O	lowered
O	but
O	all
O	the
O	ropes
O	broke
O	and
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	carried
O	by
O	the
O	current
O	to
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	an
O	inaccessible
O	mountain
O	where
O	she
O	struck
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	pieces
O	yet
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	manner
O	that
O	we
O	saved
O	our
O	lives
O	our
O	provisions
O	and
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	our
O	goods
O	The
O	mountain
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	which
O	we
O	were
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	wrecks
O	with
O	a
O	vast
O	number
O	of
O	human
O	bones
O	and
O	with
O	an
O	incredible
O	quantity
O	of
O	goods
O	and
O	riches
O	of
O	all
O	kinds
O	These
O	objects
O	served
O	only
O	to
O	augment
O	our
O	despair
O	In
O	all
O	other
O	places
O	it
O	is
O	usual
O	for
O	rivers
O	to
O	run
O	from
O	their
O	channels
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	but
O	here
O	a
O	river
O	of
O	fresh
O	water
O	runs
O	from
O	the
O	sea
O	into
O	a
O	dark
O	cavern
O	whose
O	entrance
O	is
O	very
O	high
O	and
O	spacious
O	What
O	is
O	most
O	remarkable
O	in
O	this
O	place
O	is
O	that
O	the
O	stones
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	are
O	of
O	crystal
O	rubies
O	or
O	other
O	precious
O	stones
O	Here
O	is
O	also
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	fountain
O	of
O	pitch
O	or
O	bitumen
O	that
O	runs
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	which
O	the
O	fish
O	swallow
O	and
O	evacuate
O	soon
O	afterward
O	turned
O	into
O	ambergris
O	and
O	this
O	the
O	waves
O	throw
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	in
O	great
O	quantities
O	Trees
O	also
O	grow
O	here
O	most
O	of
O	which
O	are
O	of
O	wood
O	of
O	aloes
O	equal
O	in
O	goodness
O	to
O	those
O	of
O	Comari
O	To
O	finish
O	the
O	description
O	of
O	this
O	place
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	possible
O	for
O	ships
O	to
O	get
O	off
O	when
O	once
O	they
O	approach
O	within
O	a
O	certain
O	distance
O	If
O	they
O	be
O	driven
O	thither
O	by
O	a
O	wind
O	from
O	the
O	sea
O	the
O	wind
O	and
O	the
O	current
O	impel
O	them
O	and
O	if
O	they
O	come
O	into
O	it
O	when
O	a
O	land
O	wind
O	blows
O	which
O	might
O	seem
O	to
O	favor
O	their
O	getting
O	out
O	again
O	the
O	height
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	stops
O	the
O	wind
O	and
O	occasions
O	a
O	calm
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	force
O	of
O	the
O	current
O	carries
O	them
O	ashore
O	and
O	what
O	completes
O	the
O	misfortune
O	is
O	that
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	possibility
O	of
O	ascending
O	the
O	mountain
O	or
O	of
O	escaping
O	by
O	sea
O	We
O	continued
O	upon
O	the
O	shore
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	in
O	a
O	state
O	of
O	despair
O	and
O	expected
O	death
O	every
O	day
O	On
O	our
O	first
O	landing
O	we
O	had
O	divided
O	our
O	provisions
O	as
O	equally
O	as
O	we
O	could
O	and
O	thus
O	every
O	one
O	lived
O	a
O	longer
O	or
O	shorter
O	time
O	according
O	to
O	his
O	temperance
O	and
O	the
O	use
O	he
O	made
O	of
O	his
O	provisions
O	I
O	survived
O	all
O	my
O	companions
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	buried
O	the
O	last
O	I
O	had
O	so
O	little
O	provisions
O	remaining
O	that
O	I
O	thought
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	long
O	survive
O	and
O	I
O	dug
O	a
O	grave
O	resolving
O	to
O	lie
O	down
O	in
O	it
O	because
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	one
O	left
O	to
O	pay
O	me
O	the
O	last
O	offices
O	of
O	respect
O	But
O	it
O	pleased
O	God
O	once
O	more
O	to
O	take
O	compassion
O	on
O	me
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	in
O	my
O	mind
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	which
O	ran
O	into
O	the
O	great
O	cavern
O	Considering
O	its
O	probable
O	course
O	with
O	great
O	attention
O	I
O	said
O	to
O	myself
O	This
O	river
O	which
O	runs
O	thus
O	underground
O	must
O	somewhere
O	have
O	an
O	issue
O	If
O	I
O	make
O	a
O	raft
O	and
O	leave
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	current
O	it
O	will
O	convey
O	me
O	to
O	some
O	inhabited
O	country
O	or
O	I
O	shall
O	perish
O	If
O	I
O	be
O	drowned
O	I
O	lose
O	nothing
O	but
O	only
O	change
O	one
O	kind
O	of
O	death
O	for
O	another
O	I
O	immediately
O	went
O	to
O	work
O	upon
O	large
O	pieces
O	of
O	timber
O	and
O	cables
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	choice
O	of
O	them
O	from
O	the
O	wrecks
O	and
O	tied
O	them
O	together
O	so
O	strongly
O	that
O	I
O	soon
O	made
O	a
O	very
O	solid
O	raft
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	finished
O	I
O	loaded
O	it
O	with
O	some
O	chests
O	of
O	rubies
O	emeralds
O	ambergris
O	rock
O	crystal
O	and
O	bales
O	of
O	rich
O	stuffs
O	Having
O	balanced
O	my
O	cargo
O	exactly
O	and
O	fastened
O	it
O	well
O	to
O	the
O	raft
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	with
O	two
O	oars
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	made
O	and
O	leaving
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	course
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	resigned
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	God
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	I
O	entered
O	the
O	cavern
O	I
O	lost
O	all
O	light
O	and
O	the
O	stream
O	carried
O	me
O	I
O	knew
O	not
O	whither
O	Thus
O	I
O	floated
O	on
O	in
O	perfect
O	darkness
O	and
O	once
O	found
O	the
O	arch
O	so
O	low
O	that
O	it
O	very
O	nearly
O	touched
O	my
O	head
O	which
O	made
O	me
O	cautious
O	afterward
O	to
O	avoid
O	the
O	like
O	danger
O	All
O	this
O	while
O	I
O	ate
O	nothing
O	but
O	what
O	was
O	just
O	necessary
O	to
O	support
O	nature
O	yet
O	notwithstanding
O	my
O	frugality
O	all
O	my
O	provisions
O	were
O	spent
O	Then
O	I
O	became
O	insensible
O	I
O	cannot
O	tell
O	how
O	long
O	I
O	continued
O	so
O	but
O	when
O	I
O	revived
O	I
O	was
O	surprised
O	to
O	find
O	myself
O	in
O	an
O	extensive
O	plain
O	on
O	the
O	brink
O	of
O	a
O	river
O	where
O	my
O	raft
O	was
O	tied
O	among
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	negroes
O	I
O	got
O	up
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	I
O	saw
O	them
O	and
O	saluted
O	them
O	They
O	spoke
O	to
O	me
O	but
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	understand
O	their
O	language
O	I
O	was
O	so
O	transported
O	with
O	joy
O	that
O	I
O	knew
O	not
O	whether
O	I
O	was
O	asleep
O	or
O	awake
O	but
O	being
O	persuaded
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	asleep
O	I
O	recited
O	the
O	following
O	words
O	in
C	Arabic
O	aloud
O	Call
O	upon
O	the
O	Almighty
O	He
O	will
O	help
O	thee
O	thou
O	needst
O	not
O	perplex
O	thyself
O	about
O	anything
O	else
O	shut
O	thy
O	eyes
O	and
O	while
O	thou
O	art
O	asleep
O	God
O	will
O	change
O	thy
O	bad
O	fortune
O	into
O	good
O	One
O	of
O	the
O	negroes
O	who
O	understood
C	Arabic
O	hearing
O	me
O	speak
O	thus
O	came
O	toward
O	me
O	and
O	said
O	Brother
O	be
O	not
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	us
O	we
O	are
O	inhabitants
O	of
O	this
O	country
O	and
O	water
O	our
O	fields
O	from
O	this
O	river
O	which
O	comes
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	neighboring
O	mountain
O	We
O	saw
O	your
O	raft
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	us
O	swam
O	into
O	the
O	river
O	and
O	brought
O	it
O	hither
O	where
O	we
O	fastened
O	it
O	as
O	you
O	see
O	until
O	you
O	should
O	awake
O	Pray
O	tell
O	us
O	your
O	history
O	Whence
O	did
O	you
O	come
O	I
O	begged
O	of
O	them
O	first
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	then
O	I
O	would
O	satisfy
O	their
O	curiosity
O	They
O	gave
O	me
O	several
O	sorts
O	of
O	food
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	had
O	satisfied
O	my
O	hunger
O	I
O	related
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	befallen
O	me
O	which
O	they
O	listened
O	to
O	with
O	attentive
O	surprise
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	finished
O	they
O	told
O	me
O	by
O	the
O	person
O	who
O	spoke
C	Arabic
O	and
O	interpreted
O	to
O	them
O	what
O	I
O	said
O	that
O	I
O	must
O	go
O	along
O	with
O	them
O	and
O	tell
O	my
O	story
O	to
O	their
O	king
O	myself
O	it
O	being
O	too
O	extraordinary
O	to
O	be
O	related
O	by
O	any
O	other
O	than
O	the
O	person
O	to
O	whom
O	the
O	events
O	had
O	happened
O	They
O	immediately
O	sent
O	for
O	a
O	horse
O	and
O	having
O	helped
O	me
O	to
O	mount
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	walked
O	before
O	to
O	show
O	the
O	way
O	while
O	the
O	rest
O	took
O	my
O	raft
O	and
O	cargo
O	and
O	followed
O	We
O	marched
O	till
O	we
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	capital
O	of
O	Serendib
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	that
O	island
O	I
O	had
O	landed
O	The
O	negroes
O	presented
O	me
O	to
O	their
O	king
O	I
O	approached
O	his
O	throne
O	and
O	saluted
O	him
O	as
O	I
O	used
O	to
O	do
O	the
O	kings
O	of
O	the
O	Indies
O	that
O	is
O	to
O	say
O	I
O	prostrated
O	myself
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	The
C	prince
O	ordered
O	me
O	to
O	rise
O	received
O	me
O	with
O	an
O	obliging
O	air
O	and
O	made
O	me
O	sit
O	down
O	near
O	him
O	I
O	concealed
O	nothing
O	from
O	the
O	king
O	but
O	related
O	to
O	him
O	all
O	that
O	I
O	have
O	told
O	you
O	At
O	last
O	my
O	raft
O	was
O	brought
O	in
O	and
O	the
O	bales
O	opened
O	in
O	his
O	presence
O	he
O	admired
O	the
O	quantity
O	of
O	wood
O	of
O	aloes
O	and
O	ambergris
O	but
O	above
O	all
O	the

O	and
O	emeralds
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	none
O	in
O	his
O	treasury
O	that
O	equalled
O	them
O	Observing
O	that
O	he
O	looked
O	on
O	my
O	jewels
O	with
O	pleasure
O	and
O	viewed
O	the
O	most
O	remarkable
O	among
O	them
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	I
O	fell
O	prostrate
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	liberty
O	to
O	say
O	to

O	Sire
O	not

O	my

O	but
O	the

O	of
O	the

O	always
O	in
O	her
O	way
O	and
O	she
O	was
O	always
O	thinking
O	how
O	she
O	could
O	get
O	all
O	the
O	property
O	for
O	her
C	daughter
O	The
O	Evil
O	One
O	possessed
O	her
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	quite
O	angry
O	with
O	the
O	little
O	boy
O	and
O	pushed
O	him
O	about
O	from
O	one
O	corner
O	to
O	another
O	and
O	cuffed
O	him
O	here
O	and
O	pinched
O	him
O	there
O	until
O	the
O	poor
O	child
O	was
O	always
O	in
O	fear
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	home
O	from
O	school
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	a
O	quiet
O	place
O	to
O	creep
O	into
O	Once
O	when
O	the
O	woman
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	room
O	her
O	little
C	daughter
O	came
O	up
O	too
O	and
O	said
C	Mother
O	give
O	me
O	an
O	apple
O	Yes
O	my
O	child
O	said
O	the
O	woman
O	and
O	gave
O	her
O	a
O	beautiful
O	apple
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	chest
O	and
O	the
O	chest
O	had
O	a
O	great
O	heavy
O	lid
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	sharp
O	iron
O	lock
C	Mother
O	said
O	the
O	little
C	daughter
O	shall
O	not
C	brother
O	have
O	one
O	too
O	That
O	vexed
O	the
O	woman
O	but
O	she
O	said
O	Yes
O	when
O	he
O	comes
O	from
O	school
O	And
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	from
O	the
O	window
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	coming
O	it
O	was
O	just
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	Evil
O	One
O	came
O	into
O	her
O	and
O	she
O	snatched
O	away
O	the
O	apple
O	from
O	her
C	daughter
O	and
O	said
O	You
O	shall
O	not
O	have
O	one
O	before
O	your
C	brother
O	Then
O	she
O	threw
O	the
O	apple
O	into
O	the
O	chest
O	and
O	shut
O	the
O	lid
O	close
O	down
O	When
O	the
O	little
O	boy
O	came
O	in
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	the
O	Evil
O	One
O	made
O	her
O	say
O	kindly
O	My
C	son
O	will
O	you
O	have
O	an
O	apple
O	Yet
O	she
O	looked
O	so
O	angry
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	boy
O	said
C	mother
O	how
O	dreadful
O	you
O	look
O	Yes
O	give
O	me
O	an
O	apple
O	Then
O	she
O	felt
O	that
O	she
O	must
O	speak
O	to
O	him
O	Come
O	with
O	me
O	said
O	she
O	and
O	opened
O	the
O	lid
O	pick
O	out
O	an
O	apple
O	for
O	yourself
O	And
O	as
O	the
O	little
O	boy
O	stooped
O	over
O	the
O	Evil
O	One
O	prompted
O	her
O	and
O	smash
O	she
O	banged
O	the
O	lid
O	down
O	so
O	that
O	his
O	head
O	flew
O	off
O	and
O	fell
O	among
O	the
O	red
O	apples
O	Then
O	she
O	was
O	seized
O	with
O	terror
O	and
O	thought
O	Can
O	I
O	get
O	rid
O	of
O	the
O	blame
O	of
O	this
O	So
O	she
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	room
O	to
O	her
O	chest
O	of
O	drawers
O	and
O	took
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	top
O	drawer
O	a
O	white
O	cloth
O	and
O	placed
O	the
O	head
O	on
O	the
O	neck
O	again
O	and
O	tied
O	the
O	handkerchief
O	round
O	it
O	so
O	that
O	one
O	could
O	see
O	nothing
O	and
O	set
O	him
O	before
O	the
O	door
O	on
O	a
O	chair
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	the
O	apple
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	Soon
O	after
O	little
C	Margery
O	came
O	to
O	her
C	mother
O	who
O	stood
O	by
O	the
O	kitchen
O	fire
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	pot
O	of
O	hot
O	water
O	before
O	her
O	which
O	she
O	kept
O	stirring
O	round
C	mother
O	said
O	little
C	Margery
C	brother
O	sits
O	before
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	looks
O	quite
O	white
O	and
O	has
O	an
O	apple
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	I
O	asked
O	him
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	the
O	apple
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	answer
O	me
O	and
O	I
O	was
O	frightened
O	Go
O	to
O	him
O	again
O	said
O	her
C	mother
O	and
O	if
O	he
O	will
O	not
O	answer
O	you
O	give
O	him
O	a
O	box
O	on
O	the
O	ear
O	Then
C	Margery
O	went
O	and
O	said
C	brother
O	give
O	me
O	the
O	apple
O	But
O	he
O	was
O	silent
O	so
O	she
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	box
O	on
O	the
O	ear
O	and
O	the
O	head
O	fell
O	down
O	She
O	was
O	frightened
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	cry
O	and
O	sob
O	and
O	ran
O	to
O	her
C	mother
O	and
O	said
O	Oh
C	mother
O	I
O	have
O	knocked
O	my
C	brother
O	s
O	head
O	off
O	and
O	cried
O	and
O	cried
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	comforted
C	Margery
O	said
O	her
C	mother
O	what
O	have
O	you
O	done
O	but
O	now
O	be
O	quiet
O	and

O	cannot
O	be
O	helped
O	now
O	we
O	will
O	cook
O	him
O	in
O	vinegar
O	Then
O	the
C	mother
O	took
O	the
O	little
O	boy
O	and
O	chopped
O	him
O	in
O	pieces
O	put

O	so
O	that
O	the

O	When
O	the

O	he

O	Then
O	the

O	walked
O	off
O	leaving
C	Alice
O	alone
O	with
O	the

C	Alice
O	did
O	not

O	said
O	the

O	half
O	to

O	half
O	to

O	thought
C	Alice
O	as

O	slowly
O	after

O	I
O	never

O	They
O	had
O	not
O	gone
O	far
O	before
O	they
O	saw
O	the

C	Turtle
O	in
O	the

O	sitting
O	sad
O	and

O	and
O	as
O	they
O	came
O	nearer
C	Alice
O	could

O	She
O	pitied
O	him
O	deeply
O	What
O	is
O	his
O	sorrow
O	she
O	asked
O	the
C	Gryphon
O	And
O	the
C	Gryphon
O	answered
O	very

O	all

O	t
O	got
O	no
O	sorrow
O	you

O	Come
O	on
O	So
O	they
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	the
C	Mock
C	Turtle
O	who
O	looked
O	at
O	them

O	Sit
O	down
O	both

O	they
O	sat
O	down
O	and
O	nobody
O	spoke
O	for
O	some
O	minutes
C	Alice
O	thought
O	to
O	herself
O	I
O	don
O	t
O	see
O	how
O	he
O	can
O	finish
O	if
O	he
O	doesn
O	t
O	begin
O	But
O	she
O	waited
O	patiently
O	Once
O	said
O	the
C	Mock
C	Turtle
O	at
O	last
O	with
O	a
O	deep
O	sigh
O	I
O	was
O	a
O	real
C	Turtle
O	These
O	words
O	were
O	followed
O	by
O	a
O	very
O	long
O	silence
O	broken
O	only
O	by
O	an
O	occasional
O	exclamation
O	of
O	Hjckrrh
O	from
O	the
C	Gryphon
O	and
O	the
O	constant
O	heavy
O	sobbing
O	of
O	the
C	Mock
C	Turtle
C	Alice
O	was
O	very
O	nearly
O	getting
O	up
O	and
O	saying
O	Thank
O	you
O	Sir
O	for
O	your
O	interesting
O	story
O	but
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	thinking
O	there
O	be
O	more
O	to
O	come
O	so
O	she
O	sat
O	still
O	and
O	said
O	nothing
O	When
O	we
O	were
O	little
O	the
C	Mock
C	Turtle
O	went
O	on
O	at
O	last
O	more
O	calmly
O	though
O	still
O	sobbing
O	a
O	little
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	we
O	went
O	to
O	school
O	in
O	the
O	sea
O	The
O	master
O	was
O	an
O	old
O	used
O	to

O	Why

O	you
O	call
O	him
O	Tortoise
O	if
O	he
O	wasn
O	t
O	one
C	Alice
O	asked
O	We
O	called
O	him
O	Tortoise
O	because
O	he
O	taught
O	us
O	said
O	the
C	Mock
C	Turtle
O	angrily
O	Really
O	you
O	are
O	very
O	dull
O	You
O	ought
O	to
O	be
O	ashamed
O	of
O	yourself
O	for
O	asking
O	such
O	a
O	simple
O	question
O	added
O	the
C	Gryphon
O	and
O	then
O	they
O	both
O	sat
O	silent
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	poor
C	Alice
O	who
O	felt
O	ready
O	to
O	sink
O	into
O	the
O	earth
O	At
O	last
O	the
C	Gryphon
O	said

O	before

O	could
O	speak

O	The

O	Ah
O	Then

O	really
O	good

O	in
O	a
O	tone
O	of
O	great
O	relief
O	Now
O	at

O	the

C	Turtle
O	with
O	a
O	sigh
O	I
O	only
O	took
O	the
O	regular
O	course
O	What
O	was
O	that
O	inquired
C	Alice
O	Reeling

O	then
O	the

O	of
O	Distraction
O	Uglification
O	and
O	Derision
O	I
O	never

C	Alice
O	ventured
O	to

O	The

O	doubtfully
O	it
O	Well
O	then
O	the

O	went
O	on
O	if

O	about
O	it
O	so
O	she
O	turned
O	to
O	the
C	Mock
C	Turtle
O	and
O	said
O	What
O	else
O	had
O	you
O	to
O	learn
O	Well
O	there
O	was
O	Mystery
O	the

C	Turtle
O	replied
O	counting
O	off
O	the

O	ancient
O	and
O	modern
O	with

O	I

O	master
O	though
O	He

O	was
O	I
O	never

O	said
O	with
O	a
O	sigh
O	He
O	taught
O	Laughing
O	and
O	Grief
O	they
O	used
O	to
O	say
O	So
O	he
O	did
O	so
O	he
O	did
O	said
O	the
C	Gryphon
O	sighing
O	in
O	his
O	turn
O	and
O	both
O	creatures
O	hid
O	their
O	faces
O	in
O	their

O	And
O	how
O	many
O	hours
O	a
O	day
O	did
O	you
O	do
O	lessons
O	said
C	Alice
O	in
O	a
O	hurry
O	to
O	change
O	the
O	subject
O	Ten
O	hours
O	the

O	day
O	said
O	the
C	Mock
C	Turtle
O	nine
O	the
O	next
O	and
O	so
O	on
O	What
O	a
O	curious
O	plan
O	exclaimed
C	Alice
O	That
O	s
O	the
O	reason
O	they
O	re
O	called
O	lessons
O	the
C	Gryphon
O	remarked
O	because
O	they
O	lessen
O	from
O	day
O	to
O	day
O	This
O	was
O	quite
O	a
O	new
O	idea
O	to
C	Alice
O	and
O	she
O	thought
O	it
O	over
O	a
O	little
O	before
O	she
O	made
O	her
O	next
O	remark
O	Then
O	the
O	eleventh
O	day
O	must
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	holiday
O	Of
O	course
O	it
O	was
O	said
O	the
C	Mock
C	Turtle
O	And
O	how
O	did
O	you
O	manage
O	on
O	the
O	twelfth
C	Alice
O	went
O	on
O	eagerly
O	That
O	s
O	enough
O	about
O	lessons
O	the
C	Gryphon
O	interrupted
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	decided
O	tone
O	Tell
O	her
O	something
O	about
O	the
O	games
O	now
C	Grim
O	was
O	a
O	skilful
O	fisherman
O	and
O	caught
O	many
O	good
O	fish
O	Great
O	baskets
O	did
O	he
O	make
O	and
O	others
O	his
O	sons
O	made
O	and
O	they
O	carried
O	the
O	fish
O	inland
O	in
O	these
O	baskets
O	and
O	sold
O	them
O	All
O	over
O	the
O	country
O	did
C	Grim
O	go
O	with
O	his
O	fish
O	and
O	came
O	home
O	always
O	with
O	store
O	of
O	bread
O	or
O	corn
O	or
O	beans
O	against
O	their
O	need
O	Much
O	he
O	sold
O	in
O	the
O	fair
O	town
O	of
O	Lincoln
O	and
O	counted
O	many
O	a
O	coin
O	after
O	his
O	sales
O	there
O	Thus
C	Grim
O	fared
O	for
O	many
O	winterw
O	and
C	Havelok
O	worked
O	with
O	the
O	rest
O	thinking
O	it
O	no
O	shame
O	to
O	toil
O	like
O	any
O	thrall
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	a
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	born
O	There
O	came
O	at
O	last
O	a
O	year
O	of
O	great
O	dearth
O	Corn
O	was
O	so
O	scarce
O	that
O	all
O	men
O	were
O	in
O	poverty
O	and
C	Grim
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	to
O	feed
O	all
O	his
O	family
O	For
C	Havelok
O	he
O	had
O	great
O	dread
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	strong
O	and
O	lusty
O	and
O	would
O	eat
O	more
O	than
O	he
O	could
O	earn
O	And
O	soon
O	the
O	fish
O	in
O	the
O	sea
O	also
O	began
O	to
O	fail
O	them
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	sore
O	straits
O	But
C	Grim
O	cared
O	more
O	for
C	Havelok
O	than
O	for
O	all
O	his
O	own
O	familw
O	all
O	his
O	thoughts
O	ran
O	on
C	Havelok
O	Dear

C	Havelok
O	he
O	said
O	at

O	hence
O	and
O	strive
O	for

O	only
O	and

O	us
O	here
O	You

O	you
O	a
O	cloak
O	of

O	cut
O	it
O	up
O	rudely
O	into
O	a
O	cloak
O	for
C	Havelok
O	Then
C	Havelok
O	bade
O	him
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	and
O	came
O	in
O	time

O	porters
O	hither
O	quickly
O	He
O	sprang
O	forward
O	like

O	a
O	great
O	train
O	of

O	so
O	that

O	one
O	day

O	ten

O	play
O	together
O	near
O	where
C	Havelok
O	was
O	at
O	worw
O	they
O	fell
O	to
O	throwing
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	huge
O	and
O	heavy
O	He
O	must
O	needs
O	be
O	a
O	stout
O	man
O	who
O	could
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	lift
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	knee
O	But
O	those
O	who
O	threw
O	it
O	now
O	were
O	champions
O	and
O	could
O	cast
O	it
O	many
O	a
O	foot
C	Havelok
O	looked
O	on
O	and
O	longed
O	to

O	and
O	poised
O	it
O	welw
O	and
O	at
O	the

O	and
O	if

O	I
O	should
O	keep
O	my
O	word
O	to

O	in
O	some

O	secretly
O	Anon
O	he
O	sent

O	and
O	brought
O	her
O	to

O	At
O	her
O	coming

O	there
O	was

O	I
O	will

O	shall
O	you
O	be
O	wedded
O	to
O	him
O	Goldborough
O	wept
O	and
O	prayed
O	his
O	mercy
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	of
O	no
O	avail
O	On
O	the
O	morrow
O	the
O	was
O	rung
O	and
C	Godrich
O	sent
O	for
C	Havelok
O	Master
O	are
O	you
O	minded
O	to
O	marry
O	he
O	asked
O	Nay
O	by
O	my
O	life
O	quoth
C	Havelok
O	What
O	should
O	I
O	do
O	with
O	a
O	wife
O	I
O	cannot
O	feed
O	her
O	or
O	clothe
O	hew
O	I
O	have
O	no
O	house
O	and
O	no
O	possessions
O	The
O	very
O	clothes
O	I
O	wear
O	are
O	the
O	cook
O	s
O	and
O	I
O	am
O	his
O	servant
O	If
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	take
O	to
O	wife
O	her
O	whom
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	you
O	said
C	Godrich
O	I
O	will
O	hang
O	you
O	high
O	aloft
O	or
O	thrust
O	out
O	your
O	eyes
O	At
O	that
C	Havelok
O	was
O	sore
O	afraid
O	and
O	granted
O	all
O	that
C	Godrich
O	bade
O	Then
C	Godrich
O	sent
O	for
O	Goldborough
O	You
O	will
O	take
O	this
O	man
O	for
O	husband
O	he
O	said
O	or
O	you
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	gallows
O	unless
O	rather
O	I
O	burn
O	you
O	at
O	the
O	stake
O	She
O	was
O	afraid
O	at
O	his
O	threats
O	and
O	dared
O	not
O	refuse
O	though
O	she
O	liked
O	it
O	ill
O	So
O	they
O	two
O	were
O	wedded
O	perforce
O	and
O	neither
O	took
O	joy
O	in
O	it
O	I
O	designed
O	after
O	my
O	first
O	voyage
O	to
O	spend
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	my
O	days
O	at
O	Bagdad
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	ere
O	I
O	grew
O	weary
O	of
O	an
O	indolent
O	life
O	and
O	I
O	put
O	to
O	sea
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	with
C	merchants
O	of
O	known
O	probity
O	We
O	embarked
O	on
O	board
O	a
O	good
O	ship
O	and
O	after
O	recommending
O	ourselves
O	to
O	God
O	set
O	sail
O	We
O	traded
O	from
O	island
O	to
O	island
O	and
O	exchanged
O	commodities
O	with
O	great
O	profit
O	One
O	day
O	we
O	landed
O	on
O	an
O	island
O	covered
O	with
O	several
O	sorts
O	of
O	but
O	we
O	could
O	see
O	neither
O	man
O	nor
O	animal
O	We
O	walked
O	in
O	the
O	meadows
O	along
O	the
O	streams
O	that
O	watered
O	them
O	While
O	some
O	diverted
O	themselves
O	with
O	gathering
O	flowers
O	and
O	others
O	fruits
O	I
O	took
O	my
O	wine
O	and
O	provisions
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	near
O	a
O	stream
O	between
O	two
O	high
O	trees
O	which
O	formed
O	a
O	thick
O	shade
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	good
O	meal
O	and
O	afterward
O	fell
O	asleep
O	I
O	cannot
O	tell
O	how
O	long
O	I
O	slept
O	but
O	when
O	I
O	awoke
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	gone
O	In
O	this
O	sad
O	condition
O	I
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	die
O	with
O	grief
O	I
O	cried
O	out
O	in
O	agony
O	beat
O	my
O	head
O	and
O	breast
O	and
O	threw
O	myself
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	where
O	I
O	lay
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	despair
O	I
O	upbraided
O	myself
O	a
O	hundred
O	times
O	for
O	not
O	being
O	content
O	with
O	the
O	produce
O	of
O	my
O	first
O	voyage
O	that
O	might
O	have
O	sufficed
O	me
O	all
O	my
O	life
O	But
O	all
O	this
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	and
O	my
O	repentance
O	came
O	too
O	late
O	At
O	last
O	I
O	resigned
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	God
O	Not
O	knowing
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	I
O	climbed
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	lofty
O	tree
O	from
O	which
O	I
O	looked
O	about
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	I
O	could
O	discover
O	anything
O	that
O	could
O	give
O	me
O	hopes
O	When
O	I
O	gazed
O	toward
O	the
O	sea
O	I
O	could
O	see
O	nothing
O	but
O	sky
O	and
O	water
O	but
O	looking
O	over
O	the
O	land
O	I
O	beheld
O	something
O	white
O	and
O	coming
O	down
O	I
O	took
O	what
O	provision
O	I
O	had
O	left
O	and
O	went
O	toward
O	it
O	the
O	distance
O	being
O	so
O	great
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	distinguish
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	As
O	I
O	approached
O	I
O	thought
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	white
O	dome
O	of
O	a
O	prodigious
O	height
O	and
O	extent
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	it
O	I
O	touched
O	it
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	smooth
O	I
O	went
O	round
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	open
O	on
O	any
O	side
O	but
O	saw
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	and
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	climbing
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	smooth
O	It
O	was
O	at
O	least
O	fifty
O	paces
O	round
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	set
O	and
O	all
O	of
O	a
O	sudden
O	the
O	sky
O	became
O	as
O	dark
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	covered
O	with
O	a
O	thick
O	cloud
O	I
O	was
O	much
O	astonished
O	at
O	this
O	sudden
O	darkness
O	but
O	much
O	more
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	it
O	occasioned
O	by
O	a
O	bird
O	of
O	a
O	monstrous
O	size
O	that
O	came
O	flying
O	toward
O	me
O	I
O	remembered
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	often
O	heard
O	mariners
O	speak
O	of
O	a
O	miraculous
O	bird
O	called
O	the
C	roc
O	and
O	conceived
O	that
O	the
O	great
O	dome
O	which
O	I
O	so
O	much
O	admired
O	must
O	be
O	its
O	egg
O	In
O	short
O	the
O	bird
O	alighted
O	and
O	sat
O	over
O	the
O	egg
O	As
O	I
O	perceived
O	her
O	coming
O	I
O	crept
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	egg
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	before
O	me
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	legs
O	of
O	the
O	bird
O	which
O	was
O	as
O	big
O	as
O	the
O	trunk
O	of
O	a
O	tree
O	I
O	tied
O	myself
O	strongly
O	to
O	it
O	with
O	my
O	turban
O	in
O	hopes
O	that
O	the
C	roc
O	next
O	morning
O	would
O	carry
O	me
O	with
O	her
O	out
O	of
O	this
O	desert
O	island
O	After
O	having
O	passed
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	this
O	condition
O	the
O	bird
O	flew
O	away
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	daylight
O	and
O	carried
O	me
O	so
O	high
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	discern
O	the
O	earth
O	she
O	afterward
O	descended
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	rapidity
O	that
O	I
O	lost
O	my
O	senses
O	But
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	I
O	speedily
O	untied
O	the
O	knot
O	and
O	had
O	scarcely
O	done
O	so
O	when
O	the
C	roc
O	having
O	taken
O	up
O	a
O	serpent
O	of
O	monstrous
O	length
O	in
O	her
O	bill
O	flew
O	away
O	The
O	spot
O	where
O	it
O	left
O	me
O	was
O	encompassed
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	by
O	mountains
O	that
O	seemed
O	to
O	reach
O	above
O	the
O	clouds
O	and
O	so
O	steep
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	possibility
O	of
O	getting
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	new
O	perplexity
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	I
O	compared
O	this
O	place
O	with
O	the
O	desert
O	island
O	from
O	which
O	the
C	roc
O	had
O	brought
O	me
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	gained
O	nothing
O	by
O	the
O	change
O	As
O	I
O	walked
O	through
O	this
O	valley
O	I
O	perceived
O	it
O	was
O	strewn
O	with
O	diamonds
O	some
O	of
O	which
O	were
O	of
O	a
O	surprising
O	bigness
O	I
O	took
O	pleasure
O	in
O	looking
O	upon
O	them
O	but
O	shortly
O	saw
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	such
O	objects
O	as
O	greatly
O	diminished
O	my
O	satisfaction
O	and
O	which
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	view
O	without
O	terror
O	namely
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	serpents
O	so
O	monstrous
O	that
O	the
O	least
O	of
O	them
O	was
O	capable
O	of
O	swallowing
O	an
O	elephant
O	They
O	retired
O	in
O	the
O	daytime
O	to
O	their
O	dens
O	where
O	they
O	hid
O	themselves
O	from
O	the
C	roc
O	their
O	enemy
O	and
O	came
O	out
O	only
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	I
O	spent
O	the
O	day
O	in
O	walking
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	resting
O	myself
O	at
O	times
O	in
O	such
O	places
O	as
O	I
O	thought
O	most
O	convenient
O	When
O	night
O	came
O	on
O	I
O	went
O	into
O	a
O	cave
O	where
O	I
O	thought
O	I
O	might
O	repose
O	in
O	safety
O	I
O	secured
O	the
O	entrance
O	which
O	was
O	low
O	and
O	narrow
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	to
O	preserve
O	me
O	from
O	the
O	serpents
O	but
O	not
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	to
O	exclude
O	the
O	light
O	I
O	supped
O	on
O	part
O	of
O	my
O	provisions
O	but
O	the
O	serpents
O	which
O	began
O	hissing
O	round
O	me
O	put
O	me
O	into
O	such
O	extreme
O	fear
O	that
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	sleep
O	When
O	day
O	appeared
O	the
O	serpents
O	retired
O	and
O	I
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	cave
O	trembling
O	I
O	can
O	justly
O	say
O	that
O	I
O	walked
O	upon
O	diamonds
O	without
O	feeling
O	any
O	inclination
O	to
O	touch
O	them
O	At
O	last
O	I
O	sat
O	down
O	and
O	notwithstanding
O	my
O	apprehensions
O	not
O	having
O	closed
O	my
O	eyes
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	fell
O	asleep
O	after
O	having
O	eaten
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	of
O	my
O	provisions
O	But
O	I
O	had
O	scarcely
O	shut
O	my
O	eyes
O	when
O	something
O	that
O	fell
O	by
O	me
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	awaked
O	me
O	This
O	was
O	a
O	large
O	piece
O	of
O	raw
O	meat
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	I
O	saw
O	several
O	others
O	fall
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	rocks
O	in
O	different
O	places
O	I
O	had
O	always
O	regarded
O	as
O	fabulous
O	what
O	I
O	had
O	heard
O	sailors
O	and
O	others
O	relate
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	of
O	diamonds
O	and
O	of
O	the
O	stratagems
O	employed
O	by
C	merchants
O	to
O	obtain
O	jewels
O	from
O	thence
O	but
O	now
O	I
O	found
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	stated
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	truth
O	For
O	the
O	fact
O	is
O	that
O	the
C	merchants
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	neighborhood
O	of
O	this
O	valley
O	when
O	the
C	eagles
O	have
O	young
O	ones
O	and
O	throwing
O	great
O	joints
O	of
O	meat
O	into
O	the
O	valley
O	the
O	diamonds
O	upon
O	whose
O	points
O	they
O	fall
O	stick
O	to
O	them
O	the
C	eagles
O	which
O	are
O	stronger
O	in
O	this
O	country
O	than
O	anywhere
O	else
O	pounce
O	with
O	great
O	force
O	upon
O	those
O	pieces
O	of
O	meat
O	and
O	carry
O	them
O	to
O	their
O	nests
O	on
O	the
O	precipices
O	of
O	the
O	rocks
O	to
O	feed
O	their
O	young
O	the
C	merchants
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	run
O	to
O	their
O	nests
O	disturb
O	and
O	drive
O	off
O	the
C	eagles
O	by
O	their
O	shouts
O	and
O	take
O	away
O	the
O	diamonds
O	that
O	stick
O	to
O	the
O	meat
O	I
O	perceived
O	in
O	this
O	device
O	the
O	means
O	of
O	my
O	deliverance
O	Having
O	collected
O	together
O	the
O	largest
O	diamonds
O	I
O	could
O	find
O	and
O	put
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	leather
O	bag
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	used
O	to
O	carry
O	my
O	provisions
O	I
O	took
O	the
O	largest
O	of
O	the
O	pieces
O	of
O	meat
O	tied
O	it
O	close
O	round
O	me
O	with
O	the
O	cloth
O	of
O	my
O	turban
O	and
O	then
O	laid
O	myself
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	with
O	my
O	face
O	downward
O	the
O	bag
O	of
O	diamonds
O	being
O	made
O	fast
O	to
O	my
O	girdle
O	I
O	had
O	scarcely
O	placed
O	myself
O	in
O	this
O	posture
O	when
O	one
O	of
O	the
C	eagles
O	having
O	taken
O	me
O	up
O	with
O	the
O	piece
O	of
O	meat
O	to
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	fastened
O	carried
O	me
O	to
O	his
O	nest
O	on
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	The
C	merchants
O	immediately
O	began
O	their
O	shouting
O	to
O	frighten
O	the
C	eagles
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	obliged
O	them
O	to
O	quit
O	their
O	prey
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	nest
O	where
O	I
O	was
O	He
O	was
O	much
O	alarmed
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	me
O	but
O	recovering
O	himself
O	instead
O	of
O	inquiring
O	how
O	I
O	came
O	thither
O	began
O	to
O	quarrel
O	with
O	me
O	and
O	asked
O	why
O	I
O	stole
O	his
O	goods
O	You
O	will
O	treat
O	me
O	replied
O	I
O	with
O	more

O	when
O	you
O	know
O	me
O	better
O	Do
O	not
O	be
O	uneasy
O	I
O	have
O	diamonds
O	enough
O	for
O	you
O	and
O	myself
O	more
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	other
C	merchants
O	together
O	Whatever
O	they
O	have
O	they
O	owe
O	to
O	chance
O	but
O	I
O	selected
O	for
O	myself
O	in
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	those
O	which
O	you
O	see
O	in
O	this
O	bag
O	I
O	had
O	scarcely
O	done
O	speaking
O	when
O	the
O	other
C	merchants
O	came
O	crowding
O	about
O	us
O	much
O	astonished
O	to
O	see
O	me
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	much
O	more
O	surprised
O	when
O	I
O	told
O	them
O	my
O	story
O	They
O	conducted
O	me
O	to
O	their
O	encampment
O	and
O	there
O	having
O	opened
O	my
O	bag
O	they
O	were
O	surprised
O	at
O	the
O	largeness
O	of
O	my
O	diamonds
O	and
O	confessed
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	any
O	of
O	such
O	size
O	and
O	perfection
O	I
O	prayed
O	the
C	merchant
O	who
O	owned
O	the
O	nest
O	to
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	been

O	to
O	take
O	as
O	many
O	for
O	his
O	share
O	as
O	he
O	pleased

O	contented
O	himself
O	with
O	one
O	and
O	that
O	too
O	the
O	least
O	of
O	them
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	pressed
O	him
O	to
O	take
O	more
O	without
O	fear
O	of
O	doing
O	me
O	any
O	injury
O	No

O	he
O	I
O	am
O	very
O	well
O	satisfied
O	with
O	this
O	which
O	is
O	valuable
O	enough
O	to
O	save
O	me
O	the
O	trouble
O	of
O	making
O	any
O	more
O	voyages
O	and
O	will
O	raise
O	as
O	great
O	a
O	fortune
O	as
O	I
O	desire
O	I
O	spent
O	the
O	night
O	with
O	the
C	merchants
O	to
O	whom
O	I
O	related
O	my
O	story
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	for
O	the
O	satisfaction
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	had
O	not
O	heard
O	it
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	moderate
O	my
O	joy
O	when
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	delivered
O	from
O	the
O	danger
O	I
O	have
O	mentioned
O	I
O	thought
O	myself
O	in
O	a
O	dream
O	and
O	could
O	scarcely
O	believe
O	myself
O	out
O	of
O	danger
O	The
C	merchants
O	had
O	thrown
O	their
O	pieces
O	of
O	meat
O	into
O	the
O	valley
O	for
O	several
O	days
O	and
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	being
O	satisfied
O	with
O	the
O	diamonds
O	that
O	had
O	fallen
O	to
O	his
O	lot
O	we
O	left
O	the
O	place
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	and
O	travelled
O	near
O	high
O	mountains
O	where
O	there
O	were
O	serpents
O	of
O	a
O	prodigious
O	length
O	which
O	we
O	had
O	the
O	to
O	escape
O	We
O	took
O	shipping
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	port
O	we
O	reached
O	and
O	touched
O	at
O	the
O	isle
O	of
O	Roha
O	where
O	the
O	trees
O	grow
O	that
O	yield

O	tree
O	is
O	so
O	large

O	so

O	easily
O	sit
O	under

O	to
O	a
O	consistency

O	but
O	it
O	was
O	too
O	late
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	but
O	to
O	work
O	at
O	some
O	trade
O	to
O	support
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	child
O	For
O	all
O	this
O	the
O	lady
C	Graciana
O	never
O	found
O	fault
O	with
O	him
O	but
O	still
O	loved
O	her
O	husband
O	the
O	same
O	as
O	before
O	saying
O	Dear
C	Theodorus
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	to
O	work
O	at
O	any
O	trade
O	but
O	if
O	I
O	can
O	not
O	help
O	you
O	in
O	earning
O	money
O	I
O	will
O	help
O	you
O	to
O	save
O	it
O	So
C	Theodorus
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	and
O	though
O	the
O	lady
C	Graciana
O	had
O	always
O	been
O	used
O	only
O	to
O	ring
O	her
O	bell
O	for
O	everything
O	that
O	she
O	wanted
O	she
O	now
O	scoured
O	the
O	kettles
O	and
O	washed
O	the
O	clothes
O	with
O	her
O	own
O	hands
O	They
O	went
O	on
O	in
O	this
O	manner
O	till
C	Fortunatus
O	was
O	sixteen
O	years
O	of
O	age
O	When
O	that
O	time
O	came
O	one
O	day
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	sitting
O	at
O	dinner
C	Theodorus
O	fixed
O	his
O	eyes
O	on
O	his
O	son
O	and
O	sighed
O	deeply
O	What
O	is
O	the
O	matter
O	with
O	you
O	father
O	said
C	Fortunatus
O	Ah
O	my
O	child
O	said
C	Theodorus
O	I
O	have
O	reason
O	enough
O	to
O	be
O	sorry
O	when
O	I
O	think
O	of
O	the
O	noble
O	fortune
O	which
O	I
O	have
O	spent
O	and
O	that
O	my
O	folly
O	will
O	force
O	you
O	to
O	labour
O	for
O	your
O	living
O	Father
O	replied
C	Fortunatus
O	do
O	not
O	grieve
O	about
O	it
O	I
O	have
O	often
O	thought
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	time
O	I
O	should
O	do
O	something
O	for
O	myself
O	and
O	though
O	I
O	have
O	not
O	been
O	brought
O	up
O	to
O	any
O	trade
O	yet
O	I
O	hope
O	I
O	can
O	contrive
O	to
O	support
O	myself
O	somehow
O	When
C	Fortunatus
O	had
O	done
O	his
O	dinner
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	hat
O	and
O	walked
O	to
O	the
O	thinking
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	be
O	no
O	longer
O	a
O	burden
O	to
O	his
O	parents
O	Just
O	as
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	the
C	Earl
O	of
O	Flanders
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	to
O	Jerusalem
O	was
O	embarking
O	on
O	board
O	his
O	ship
O	with
O	all
O	his
C	servants
O	to
O	set
O	sail
O	for
O	Flanders
C	Fortunatus
O	now
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	offer
O	himself
O	to
O	be
O	the
C	Earl
O	s
O	page
O	When
O	the
C	Earl
O	saw
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	lad
O	and
O	heard
O	the
O	quick
O	replies
O	which
O	he
O	made
O	to
O	his
O	questions
O	he
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	his
O	service
O	so
O	at
O	once
O	they
O	all
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	On
O	their
O	way
O	the
O	ship
O	stopped
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	at
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	Venice
O	where
C	Fortunatus
O	saw
O	many
O	strange
O	things
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	wish
O	still
O	more
O	to
O	travel
O	and
O	taught
O	him
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	before
O	Soon
O	after
O	this
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	Flanders
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	long
O	on
O	shore
O	before
O	the
C	Earl
O	his
O	master
O	was
O	married
O	to
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Cleves
O	The
O	wedding
O	was
O	kept
O	with
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	public
O	feasting
O	and
O	games
O	on
O	horseback
O	called
O	tilts
O	which
O	lasted
O	many
O	days
O	and
O	among
O	the
O	rest
O	the
C	Earl
O	s
O	lady
O	gave
O	two
O	jewels
O	as
O	prizes
O	to
O	be
O	played
O	for
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	a
O	hundred
O	crowns
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	was
O	won
O	by
C	Fortunatus
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	by
C	Timothy
O	a
O	servant
O	of
O	the
O	Duke
O	of
O	Burgundy
O	who
O	afterwards
O	ran
O	another
O	tilt
O	with
C	Fortunatus
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	winner
O	was
O	to
O	have
O	both
O	the
O	jewels
O	So
O	they
O	tilted
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	fourth
O	course
C	Fortunatus
O	hoisted
C	Timothy
O	a
O	full
O	spear
O	s
O	length
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	thus
O	won
O	both
O	the
O	jewels
O	which
O	pleased
O	the
C	Earl
O	and
C	Countess
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	they
O	praised
C	Fortunatus
O	and
O	thought
O	better
O	of
O	him
O	than
O	ever
O	At
O	this
O	time
O	also
C	Fortunatus
O	had
O	many
O	rich
O	presents
O	given
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	lords
O	and
O	ladies
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	But
O	the
O	high
O	favour
O	shown
O	him
O	made
O	his
O	jealous
O	and
O	one
O	named
C	Robert
O	who
O	had
O	always
O	pretended
O	a
O	great
O	friendship
O	for
C	Fortunatus
O	made
O	him
O	believe
O	that
O	for
O	all
O	his
O	seeming
O	kindness
O	the
C	Earl
O	in
O	secret
O	envied
O	him
O	his
O	great
O	skill
O	in
O	tilting
C	Robert
O	said
O	too
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	the
C	Earl
O	give
O	private
O	orders
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	his
C	servants
O	to
O	find
O	some
O	way
O	of
O	killing
O	him
O	next
O	day
O	while
O	they
O	should
O	all
O	be
O	out
O	hunting
C	Fortunatus
O	thanked
O	the
O	wicked
C	Robert
O	for
O	what
O	he
O	thought
O	a
O	great
O	kindness
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	at
O	daybreak
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	swiftest
O	horse
O	in
O	the
C	Earl
O	s
O	stables
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	country
O	When
O	the
C	Earl
O	heard
O	that
C	Fortunatus
O	had
O	gone
O	away
O	in
O	a
O	hurry
O	he
O	was
O	much
O	surprised
O	and
O	asked
O	all
O	his
C	servants
O	what
O	they
O	knew
O	about
O	the
O	matter
O	but
O	they
O	all
O	denied
O	knowing
O	anything
O	of
O	it
O	or
O	why
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	them
O	The
C	Earl
O	then
O	said
C	Fortunatus
O	was
O	a
O	lad
O	for
O	whom
O	I
O	had
O	a
O	great
O	esteem
O	I
O	am
O	sure
O	some
O	of
O	you
O	must
O	have
O	given
O	him
O	an
O	affront
O	if
O	I
O	discover
O	it
O	I
O	shall
O	not
O	fail
O	to
O	punish
O	the
O	guilty
O	person
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
C	Fortunatus
O	when
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	out
O	of
O	the
C	Earl
O	s
O	country
O	stopped
O	at
O	an
O	inn
O	to
O	refresh
O	himself
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	reckon
O	how
O	much
O	he
O	had
O	about
O	him
O	He
O	took
O	out
O	all
O	his
O	fine
O	clothes
O	and
O	jewels
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	putting
O	them
O	on
O	He
O	then
O	looked
O	at
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	glass
O	and
O	thought
O	that
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	a
O	fine
O	smart
O	fellow
O	Next
O	he
O	took
O	out
O	his
O	purse
O	and
O	counted
O	the
O	money
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	given
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	lords
O	and
O	ladies
O	of
O	the
C	Earl
O	s
O	court
O	He
O	found
O	that
O	in
O	all
O	he
O	had
O	five
O	hundred
O	crowns
O	so
O	he
O	bought
O	a
O	horse
O	and
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	send
O	back
O	the
O	one
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	from
O	the
C	Earl
O	s
O	stable
O	He
O	then
O	set
O	off
O	for
O	Calais
O	crossed
O	the
O	Channel
O	landed
O	safely
O	at
O	Dover
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	to
O	London
O	where
O	he
O	soon
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	into
O	genteel
O	company
O	and
O	had
O	once
O	the
O	honour
O	to
O	dance
O	with
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	a
O	Duke
O	at
O	the
O	Lord
O	Mayor
O	s
O	ball
O	This
O	sort
O	of
O	life
O	as
O	anybody
O	may
O	well
O	think
O	soon
O	made
O	away
O	with
O	his
O	little
O	stock
O	of
O	money
O	When
C	Fortunatus
O	found
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	a
O	penny
O	left
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	going
O	back
O	again
O	to
O	France
O	and
O	soon
O	after
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	a
O	ship
O	bound
O	to
O	Picardy
O	He
O	landed
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	but
O	finding
O	no
O	employment
O	he
O	set
O	off
O	for
O	Brittany
O	when
O	he
O	lost
O	his
O	way
O	in
O	crossing
O	a
O	wood
O	and
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	stay
O	in
O	it
O	all
O	night
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	he
O	was
O	little
O	better
O	off
O	for
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	no
O	path
O	So
O	he
O	walked
O	about
O	from
O	one
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	to
O	another
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	on
O	the
O	evening
O	of
O	the
O	second
O	day
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	spring
O	at
O	which
O	he
O	drank
O	very
O	heartily
O	but
O	still
O	he
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	die
O	with
O	hunger
O	When
O	night
O	came
O	on
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	growling
O	of
O	wild
O	beasts
O	so
O	he
O	climbed
O	up
O	a
O	high
O	tree
O	for
O	safety
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	hardly
O	seated
O	himself
O	in
O	it
O	before
O	a
O	lion
O	walked
O	fiercely
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	spring
O	to
O	drink
O	This
O	made
O	him
O	very
O	much
O	afraid
O	When
O	the
O	lion
O	had
O	gone
O	away
O	a
O	bear
O	came
O	to
O	drink
O	also
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	moon
O	shone
O	very
O	bright
O	the
O	beast
O	looked
O	up
O	and
O	saw
C	Fortunatus
O	and
O	straightway
O	began
O	to
O	climb
O	up
O	the
O	tree
O	to
O	get
O	at
O	him
C	Fortunatus
O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	and
O	sat
O	quiet
O	till
O	the
O	bear
O	was
O	come
O	within
O	arm
O	s
O	length
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	ran
O	him
O	through
O	the
O	body
O	This
O	drove
O	the
O	bear
O	so
O	very
O	savage
O	that
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	great
O	spring
O	to
O	get
O	at
O	him
O	but
O	the
O	bough
O	broke
O	and
O	down
O	he
O	fell
O	and
O	lay
O	sprawling
O	and
O	howling
O	on
O	the
O	ground
C	Fortunatus
O	now
O	looked
O	around
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	no
O	more
O	wild
O	beasts
O	near
O	he
O	thought
O	this
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	good
O	time
O	to
O	get
O	rid
O	of
O	the
O	bear
O	at
O	once
O	so
O	down
O	he
O	came
O	and
O	killed
O	him
O	at
O	a
O	single
O	blow
O	Being
O	almost
O	starved
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	food
O	the
O	poor
O	youth
O	stooped
O	down
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	suck
O	the
O	blood
O	of
O	the
O	bear
O	but
O	looking
O	round
O	once
O	more
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	any
O	wild
O	beasts
O	were
O	coming
O	he
O	on
O	a
O	sudden
O	beheld
O	a
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	standing
O	by
O	his
O	side
O	with
O	a
O	bandage
O	over
O	her
O	eyes
O	leaning
O	upon
O	a
O	wheel
O	and
O	looking
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	going
O	to
O	speak
O	which
O	she
O	soon
O	did
O	in
O	these
O	words
O	Know

O	that
O	my
O	name

C	Fortune
O	I

O	not
O	a
O	moment
O	before
O	he
O	answered
O	Good
O	lady
O	I
O	wish
O	to
O	have
O	riches
O	in
O	such
O	plenty
O	that
O	I
O	may
O	never
O	again
O	know
O	what
O	it
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	hungry
O	as
O	I
O	now
O	find
O	myself
O	The
O	lady
O	then
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	purse
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	countries
O	where
O	he
O	might
O	happen
O	to

O	only
O	put
O	his
O	hand
O	into
O	the
O	purse
O	as
O	often
O	as
O	he
O	pleased
O	and
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	sure
O	to
O	find
O	in
O	it
O	ten
O	pieces
O	of
O	gold
O	that
O	the
O	purse
O	should
O	never
O	fail
O	of
O	yielding
O	the
O	same
O	sum
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	kept
O	by
O	him
O	and
O	his
O	children
O	but
O	that
O	when
O	he
O	and
O	his
O	children
O	should
O	be
O	dead
O	then
O	the
O	purse
O	would
O	lose
O	its

C	Fortunatus
O	now
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	himself
O	for
O	joy
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	thank
O	the
O	lady
O	very
O	much
O	but
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	better
O	think
O	of
O	making
O	his
O	way
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	She
O	then
O	directed
O	him
O	which
O	path
O	to
O	take
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	farewell
O	He
O	walked
O	by
O	the
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	moon
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	his
O	weakness
O	and
O	fatigue
O	would
O	let
O	him
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	near
O	an
O	inn
O	But
O	before
O	he
O	went
O	into
O	it
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	best
O	to
O	see
O	whether
O	the
C	Lady
C	Fortune
O	had
O	been
O	as
O	good
O	as
O	her
O	word
O	so
O	he
O	put
O	his
O	hand
O	into
O	his
O	purse
O	and
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	joy
O	he
O	counted
O	ten
O	pieces
O	of
O	gold
O	Having
O	nothing
O	to
O	fear
C	Fortunatus
O	walked
O	boldly
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	inn
O	and
O	called
O	for
O	the
O	best
O	supper
O	they
O	could
O	get
O	ready
O	in
O	a
O	minute
O	For

O	he
O	I
O	must
O	wait
O	till
O	before
O	I
O	am
O	very
O	nice
O	I
O	am
O	so
O	hungry
O	now
O	that
O	almost
O	anything
O	will
O	do
C	Fortunatus
O	very
O	soon
O	ate
O	quite
O	enough
O	and
O	then
O	called
O	for
O	every
O	sort
O	of
O	wine
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	drank
O	his
O	fill
O	After
O	supper
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	what
O	sort
O	of
O	life
O	he
O	should
O	lead
O	For
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	himself
O	I
O	shall
O	now
O	have
O	money
O	enough
O	for
O	everything
O	I
O	can
O	desire

O	that
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	very
O	best
O	bed
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	he
O	ordered
O	the
O	finest
O	victuals
O	of
O	all
O	kinds
O	When
O	he
O	rang
O	his

O	all
O	the

O	tried
O	who

O	run
O	the
O	fastest
O	to

O	him
O	what
O	he
O	pleased
O	to

O	when

C	Fortunatus
O	asked
O	the
O	landlord
O	whether
O	any
O	fine
O	horses
O	could
O	be
O	got
O	near
O	at

O	the

O	with
O	both
O	As
O	he
O	had
O	now
O	got

O	he
O	took
O	the

O	house
O	that

O	for
O	about
O	a
O	year
O	when

O	began
O	to
O	think
O	of

O	to
O	Famagosta
O	to
O	visit
O	his
O	parents
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	very
O	poor
O	But
O	thought
C	Fortunatus
O	as
O	I
O	am
O	young
O	and
O	have
O	not
O	seen
O	much
O	of
O	the

O	I
O	should
O	like
O	to
O	meet
O	with
O	some
O	person
O	of
O	more
O	knowledge
O	than
O	I
O	have
O	who
O	would
O	make
O	my
O	journey
O	both
O	useful
O	and
O	pleasing
O	to
O	me
O	Soon
O	after

O	he
O	met
O	with
O	an
O	old
O	gentleman
O	called
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	native
O	of

O	a
O	great
O	many
O	years
O	ago
O	in

O	to
O	better
O	his
O	fortune

O	now
O	owing
O	to
O	many
O	accidents
O	was
O	poorer
O	than
O	ever
O	and
O	had
O	not
O	money
O	enough
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	family
O	When
O	found
O	how
O	much
C	Fortunatus
O	wished
O	to
O	obtain
O	knowledge
O	he
O	told
O	him
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	strange
O	adventures
O	he
O	had
O	met
O	with
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	countries
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	in

O	This
O	is
O	the
O	very
O	man
O	I
O	stand
O	in
O	need

O	at
O	once
O	he
O	made
O	him
O	a
O	good
O	offer
O	which
O	the
O	old
O	gentleman
O	agreed
O	to
O	but
O	made
O	the
O	bargain
O	that

O	might
O	first
O	go
O	and
O	visit
O	his

O	And
O	said
O	he
O	as
O	I
O	am
O	a
O	little
O	tired
O	of
O	being
O	always
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	such
O	noisy
O	pleasures
O	as
O	we
O	find

O	in
O	all
O	the
O	journey

O	not
O	once
O	wish
O	to
O	change
O	his

O	ever
O	beheld
O	When
O	they
O	were

C	Lord
O	how
O	happy
O	I
O	am
O	to

O	to
O	think
O	of
O	leaving
O	us
O	again
O	to
O	get
O	riches
O	only
O	because
O	we
O	have
O	a
O	noble
O	title
C	Fortunatus
O	heard
O	this
O	with
O	great
O	surprise
O	What
O	said
O	he

O	coming
O	back
O	he
O	took

O	and
O	so
O	came
O	again
O	to
O	Alexandria
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	fortune
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	same
O	ship
O	that
O	had
O	brought

O	were
O	all

O	to
O	pay
O	a
O	visit
O	to
O	his
O	old
O	friend
O	the
O	sultan
O	to

O	he
O	again
O	made
O	a
O	handsome
O	present
O	and
O	was
O	invited
O	to
O	dine
O	at
O	his
O	palace
O	After
O	dinner
O	the
O	sultan
O	said
O	It
O	must
O	be
O	vastly
O	amusing
C	Fortunatus
O	to
O	hear
O	an
O	account

O	favour
O	me
O	with
O	a
O	history
O	of
O	your
O	travels
C	Fortunatus
O	did
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	desired
O	and
O	pleased
O	the
O	sultan
O	very
O	much
O	by
O	telling
O	him
O	the
O	many
O	odd
O	adventures
O	he
O	had
O	met
O	with
O	and
O	above

O	the
O	manner
O	of
O	his
O	first
O	becoming
O	known
O	to
O	the
C	Lord
O	and
O	the
O	desire
O	of
O	that
O	lord
O	to
O	maintain
O	the
O	honours
O	of
O	his
O	family
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	ended
O	the

O	he
O	was
O	greatly
O	pleased
O	with
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	possessed
O	a
O	more
O	curious
O	thing
O	than
O	any
C	Fortunatus
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	of

O	then
O	led
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	room
O	almost
O	filled
O	with
O	jewels
O	opened
O	a
O	large
O	closet
O	and
O	took
O	out
O	a
O	cap
O	which
O	he
O	said
O	was
O	of
O	greater
O	value
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	rest
C	Fortunatus
O	thought
O	the
O	sultan
O	was
O	joking
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	many
O	a
O	better
O	cap
O	than
O	that
O	Ah
O	said
O	the
O	sultan
O	that
O	is
O	because
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	its
O	value

O	puts
O	this
O	cap
O	on
O	his

O	to
O	be
O	in

O	himself
O	there

O	and
O	pray
O	is
O	the
O	man
O	living
O	who
O	made
O	it
O	I

O	took
O	up
O	the

O	on
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	could
O	not

O	wishing
O	himself
O	on
O	board
O	the
O	ship
O	that
O	was
O	going
O	back
O	to
O	Famagosta
O	In
O	less
O	than
O	a
O	moment
O	he
O	was
O	carried
O	on
O	board
O	of
O	her
O	just
O	as

O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	sail
O	and
O	there
O	being
O	a
O	brisk
O	gale
O	they
O	were
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	in
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	before
O	the
O	sultan
O	had
O	even
O	time
O	to
O	repent
O	of
O	his
O	folly
O	for
O	letting
C	Fortunatus
O	try
O	the
O	cap
O	on
O	his
O	head
O	The
O	ship
O	came
O	safe
O	to
O	Famagosta
O	after
O	a
O	happy
O	passage
O	and
C	Fortunatus
O	found
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	children
O	well
O	but
C	Lord
O	and
O	his
O	lady
O	had
O	died
O	of
O	old
O	age
O	and
O	were
O	buried
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	grave
C	Fortunatus
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	take
O	great
O	pleasure
O	in
O	teaching
O	his
O	two
O	boys
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	useful
O	learning
O	and
O	also
O	such
O	manly
O	sports
O	as
O	wrestling
O	and
O	tilting
O	Now
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	thought
O	about
O	the
O	curious
O	cap
O	which
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	home
O	and
O	then
O	would
O	wish
O	he
O	could
O	just
O	take
O	a
O	peep
O	at
O	what
O	was
O	passing
O	in
O	other
O	countries
O	which
O	wish
O	was
O	always
O	fulfilled
O	but
O	he
O	never
O	stayed
O	there
O	more
O	than
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	two
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	Lady
C	Cassandra
O	did
O	not
O	miss
O	him
O	and
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	made
O	uneasy
O	by
O	his
O	love
O	of
O	travelling
O	At
O	last
C	Fortunatus
O	began
O	to
O	grow
O	old
O	and
O	the
O	Lady
C	Cassandra
O	fell
O	sick
O	and
O	died
O	The
O	loss
O	of
O	her
O	caused
O	him
O	so
O	much
O	grief
O	that
O	soon
O	after
O	he
O	fell
O	sick
O	too
O	As
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	long
O	to
O	live
O	he
O	called
O	his
O	two
O	sons
O	to
O	his
O	bedside
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	the
O	secrets
O	of
O	the
O	purse
O	and
O	the
O	cap
O	which
O	he
O	begged
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	on
O	any
O	account
O	make
O	known
O	to
O	others
O	Follow
O	my
O	example
O	said
O	he
O	I
O	have
O	had
O	the
O	purse
O	these
O	forty
O	years
O	and
O	no
O	living
O	person
O	knew
O	from
O	what
O	source
O	I
O	obtained
O	my
O	riches
O	He
O	then
O	told
O	them
O	to
O	make
O	use
O	of
O	the
O	purse
O	between
O	them
O	and
O	to
O	live
O	together
O	in
O	friendship
O	and
O	embracing
O	them

O	soon
O	after
C	Fortunatus

O	great
O	pomp
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of

O	so

O	At

O	I
O	had
O	strength
O	enough
O	to

O	a

O	I
O	made
O	the

O	But

O	changed
O	the

O	and
O	turning
O	toward

O	asked

O	What

O	do
O	you
O	follow
O	Are
O	you
O	of
O	any
O	trade
O	At
O	this
O	question
O	the
O	youth
O	hung
O	down
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	little
O	abashed
O	when
O	his
O	mother
O	answered
C	Aladdin
O	is
O	an
O	idle
O	fellow
O	His
O	father
O	when
O	alive
O	strove
O	all
O	he
O	could
O	to
O	teach
O	him
O	his

O	but
O	could
O	not
O	succeed
O	and
O	since
O	his
O	death
O	notwithstanding
O	all
O	I
O	can
O	say
O	to
O	him
O	he
O	does
O	nothing
O	but
O	idle
O	away
O	his
O	time
O	in
O	the
O	streets
O	as
O	you
O	saw
O	him
O	without
O	considering
O	he
O	is
O	no
O	longer
O	a
O	child
O	and
O	if
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	make
O	him
O	ashamed
O	of
O	it
O	I
O	despair
O	of
O	his
O	ever
O	coming
O	to
O	any
O	good
O	For
O	my
O	part
O	I
O	am
O	resolved
O	one
O	of
O	these
O	days
O	to
O	turn
O	him
O	out
O	of
O	doors
O	and
O	let
O	him
O	provide
O	for
O	himself
O	After
O	these
O	words
C	Aladdin
C	s
C	mother
O	burst
O	into
O	tears
O	and
O	the
C	magician
O	said
O	This
O	is
O	not
O	well
O	nephew
O	you
O	must
O	think
O	of
O	helping
O	yourself
O	and
O	getting
O	your
O	livelihood
O	There
O	are
O	many
O	sorts
O	of
O	trades
O	Perhaps
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	like
O	your
O	father
O	s
O	and
O	would
O	prefer
O	another
O	I
O	will
O	endeavor
O	to
O	help
O	you
O	If
O	you
O	have
O	no
O	mind
O	to
O	learn

O	I
O	will

O	it
O	with
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	fine

O	and
O	then
O	with
O	the
O	money
O	you
O	make
O	of
O	them
O	you
O	can
O	lay
O	in
O	fresh
O	goods
O	and
O	live

O	an
O	honorable
O	way
O	Tell

O	freely
O	what
O	you
O	think
O	of
O	my
O	proposal
O	you
O	shall
O	always
O	find
O	me
O	ready
O	to
O	keep
O	my
O	word
O	This
O	plan
O	just
O	suited
C	Aladdin
O	who
O	hated
O	work
O	He
O	told
O	the
C	magician
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	greater
O	inclination
O	to
O	that
O	business
O	than
O	to
O	any
O	other
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	much
O	obliged
O	to
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	kindness
O	Well
O	then
O	said
O	the
C	African
C	magician
O	I
O	will
O	carry
O	you
O	with
O	me
O	clothe
O	you
O	as
O	handsomely
O	as
O	the
O	best
O	merchants
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	and
O	afterward
O	we
O	will
O	open
O	a
O	shop
O	as
O	I
O	mentioned
O	The
O	widow
O	after
O	his
O	promises
O	of
O	kindness
O	to
O	her
O	son
O	no
O	longer
O	doubted
O	that
O	the
C	magician
O	was
O	her
O	husband
O	s
O	brother
O	She
O	thanked
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	good
O	intentions
O	and
O	after
O	having
O	exhorted
C	Aladdin
O	to
O	render
O	himself
O	worthy
O	of
O	his
O	uncle
O	s
O	favor
O	served
O	up
O	supper
O	at
O	which
O	they
O	talked
O	of
O	several
O	indifferent
O	matters
O	and
O	then
O	the
C	magician
O	took
O	his
O	leave
O	and
O	retired
O	He
O	came
O	again
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	promised
O	and
O	took
C	Aladdin
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	merchant
O	who
O	sold
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	clothes
O	for
O	different
O	ages
O	and
O	ranks
O	ready
O	made
O	and
O	a
O	variety
O	of
O	fine
O	stuffs
O	and
O	bade
C	Aladdin
O	choose
O	those
O	he
O	preferred
O	which
O	he
O	paid
O	for
O	When
C	Aladdin
O	found
O	himself
O	so
O	handsomely
O	equipped
O	he
O	returned
O	his
O	uncle
O	thanks
O	who
O	thus
O	addressed
O	him
O	As
O	you
O	are
O	soon
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	merchant
O	it
O	is
O	proper
O	you
O	should
O	frequent
O	these
O	shops
O	and
O	be
O	acquainted
O	with
O	them
O	He
O	then
O	showed
O	him
O	the
O	largest
O	and
O	finest
O	mosques
O	carried
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	khans
O	or
O	inns
O	where
O	the
O	merchants
O	and
O	travellers
O	lodged
O	and
O	afterward
O	to
O	the
C	sultan
O	s
O	palace
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	free
O	access
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	brought
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	khan
O	where
O	meeting
O	with
O	some
O	merchants
O	he
O	had
O	become
O	acquainted
O	with
O	since
O	his
O	arrival
O	he
O	gave
O	them
O	a
O	treat
O	to
O	make
O	them
O	and
O	his
O	pretended
O	nephew
O	acquainted
O	This
O	entertainment
O	lasted
O	till
O	night
O	when
C	Aladdin
O	would
O	have
O	taken
O	leave
O	of
O	his
O	uncle
O	to
O	go
O	home
O	the
C	magician
O	would
O	not
O	let
O	him
O	go
O	by
O	himself
O	but
O	conducted
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	who
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	she
O	saw
O	him
O	so
O	well
O	dressed
O	was
O	transported
O	with
O	joy
O	and
O	bestowed
O	a
O	thousand
O	blessings
O	upon
O	the
C	magician
O	Early
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	the
C	magician
O	called
O	again
O	for
C	Aladdin
O	and
O	said
O	he
O	would
O	take
O	him
O	to
O	spend
O	that
O	day
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	next
O	he
O	would
O	purchase
O	the
O	shop
O	He
O	then
O	led
O	him
O	out
O	at
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	the
O	city
O	to
O	some
O	magnificent
O	palaces
O	to
O	each
O	of
O	which
O	belonged
O	beautiful
O	gardens
O	into
O	which
O	anybody
O	might
O	enter
O	At
O	every
O	building
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	he
O	asked
C	Aladdin
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	think
O	it
O	fine
O	and
O	the
O	youth
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	answer
O	when
O	any
O	one
O	presented
O	itself
O	crying
O	out
O	Here
O	is
O	a
O	finer
O	house
O	uncle
O	than
O	any
O	we
O	have
O	yet
O	seen
O	By
O	this
O	artifice
O	the
O	cunning
C	magician
O	led
C	Aladdin
O	some
O	way
O	into
O	the
O	country
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	meant
O	to
O	carry
O	him
O	further
O	to
O	execute
O	his
O	design
O	he
O	took
O	an
O	opportunity
O	to
O	sit
O	down
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	gardens
O	on
O	the
O	brink
O	of
O	a

O	the

O	caught
O	hold
O	of

O	him
O	such
O	a

O	him
O	evil
O	The
O	truth
O	was
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	learned
O	from
O	his
O	magic
O	books
O	the
O	secret
O	and
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	this
O	wonderful
O	lamp
O	the
O	owner
O	of
O	which
O	would
O	be
O	made
O	richer
O	than
O	any
O	earthly
O	ruler
O	and
O	hence
O	his
O	journey
O	to
O	China
O	His
O	art
O	had
O	also
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	permitted
O	to
O	take
O	it
O	himself
O	but
O	must
O	receive
O	it
O	as
O	a
O	voluntary
O	gift
O	from
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	another
O	person
O	Hence
O	he
O	employed
O	young
C	Aladdin
O	and
O	hoped
O	by
O	a
O	mixture
O	of
O	kindness
O	and
O	authority
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	obedient
O	to
O	his
O	word
O	and
O	will
O	When
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	his
O	attempt
O	had
O	failed
O	he
O	set
O	out
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	Africa
O	but
O	avoided
O	the
O	town
O	lest
O	any
O	person
O	who
O	had
O	seen
O	him
O	leave
O	in
O	company
O	with
C	Aladdin
O	should
O	make
O	inquiries
O	after
O	the
O	youth
C	Aladdin
O	being
O	suddenly
O	enveloped
O	in
O	darkness
O	cried
O	and
O	called
O	out
O	to
O	his
O	uncle
O	to
O	tell
O	him
O	he
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	lamp
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	since
O	his
O	cries
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	heard
O	He
O	descended
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	steps
O	with
O	a
O	design
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	the
O	palace
O	but
O	the
O	door
O	which
O	was
O	opened
O	before
O	by
O	enchantment
O	was
O	now
O	shut
O	by
O	the
O	same
O	means
O	He
O	then
O	redoubled
O	his
O	cries
O	and
O	tears
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	steps
O	without
O	any
O	hopes
O	of
O	ever
O	seeing
O	light
O	again
O	and
O	in
O	an
O	expectation
O	of
O	passing
O	from
O	the
O	present
O	darkness
O	to
O	a
O	speedy
O	death
O	In
O	this
O	great
O	emergency
O	he
O	said
O	There
O	is
O	no
O	strength
O	or
O	power
O	but
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	and
O	high
O	God
O	and
O	in
O	joining
O	his
O	hands
O	to
O	pray
O	he
O	rubbed
O	the
O	ring
O	which
O	the
C	magician
O	had
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	finger
O	Immediately
O	a
C	genie
O	of
O	frightful
O	aspect
O	appeared
O	and
O	said
O	What
O	wouldst
O	thou
O	have
O	I
O	am
O	ready
O	to
O	obey
O	thee
O	I
O	serve
O	him
O	who
O	possesses
O	the
O	ring
O	on
O	thy
O	finger
O	I
O	and
O	the
O	other
C	slaves
O	of
O	that
O	ring
O	At
O	another
O	time
C	Aladdin
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	frightened
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	so
O	extraordinary
O	a
O	figure
O	but
O	the
O	danger
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	made
O	him
O	answer
O	without
O	hesitation
O	Whoever
O	thou
O	art
O	deliver
O	me
O	from
O	this
O	place
O	He
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	spoken
O	these
O	words
O	than
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	spot
O	where
O	the
C	magician
O	had
O	last
O	left
O	him
O	and
O	no
O	sign
O	of
O	cave
O	or
O	opening
O	nor
O	disturbance
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	Returning
O	God
O	thanks
O	to
O	find
O	himself
O	once
O	more
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	he
O	made
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	home
O	When
O	he
O	got
O	within
O	his
O	mother
O	s
O	door
O	the
O	joy
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	and
O	his
O	weakness
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	sustenance
O	made
O	him
O	so
O	faint
O	that
O	he
O	remained
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	as
O	dead
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	recovered
O	he
O	related
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	happened
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	both
O	very
O	vehement
O	in
O	their
O	complaints
O	of
O	the
O	cruel
C	magician
C	Aladdin
O	slept
O	very
O	soundly
O	till
O	late
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	when
O	the
O	first
O	thing
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	was
O	that
O	he
O	wanted
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	wished
O	she
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	his
O	breakfast
O	Alas
O	child
O	said
O	she
O	I
O	have
O	not
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	bread
O	to
O	give
O	you
O	you
O	ate
O	up
O	all
O	the
O	provisions
O	I
O	had
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	yesterday
O	but
O	I
O	have
O	a
O	little
O	cotton
O	which
O	I
O	have
O	spun
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	and
O	sell
O	it
O	and
O	buy
O	bread
O	and
O	something
O	for
O	our
O	dinner
O	Mother
O	replied
C	Aladdin
O	keep
O	your
O	cotton
O	for
O	another
O	time
O	and
O	give
O	me
O	the
O	lamp
O	I
O	brought
O	home
O	with
O	me
O	yesterday
O	I

O	it
O	and
O	the
O	money
O	I
O	shall

O	serve
O	both
O	for
O	breakfast
O	and
O	dinner
O	and
O	perhaps
O	supper
O	too
C	Aladdin
C	s
C	mother
O	took
O	the
O	lamp
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	son
O	Here
O	it
O	is
O	but
O	it
O	is
O	very
O	dirty
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	cleaner
O	I
O	believe
O	it
O	would
O	bring
O	something
O	more
O	She
O	took
O	some
O	fine
O	sand
O	and
O	water
O	to
O	clean
O	it
O	but
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	begun
O	to
O	rub
O	it
O	than
O	in
O	an
O	instant
O	a
O	hideous
C	genie
O	of
O	gigantic
O	size
O	appeared
O	before
O	her
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	in
O	a
O	voice
O	of
O	thunder
O	What
O	wouldst
O	thou
O	have
O	I
O	am

O	those
O	who
O	have
O	that
O	lamp
O	in

O	the
O	other
C	slaves
O	of
O	the
O	lamp
C	Aladdin
C	s
C	mother
O	terrified
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	the
C	genie
O	fainted
O	when
C	Aladdin
O	who
O	had
O	seen
O	such
O	a
O	phantom
O	in
O	the
O	cavern
O	snatched
O	the
O	lamp
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	mother
O	s
O	hand
O	and
O	said
O	to

C	genie
O	boldly
O	I
O	am
O	hungry
O	bring
O	me
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	The
C	genie
O	disappeared
O	immediately
O	and
O	in
O	an
O	instant
O	returned
O	with
O	a
O	large
O	silver
O	tray
O	holding
O	twelve
O	covered
O	dishes
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	metal
O	which
O	contained
O	the
O	most
O	delicious
O	viands
O	six
O	large
O	white
O	bread
O	cakes
O	on
O	two

O	two
O	flagons
O	of

O	and
O	two
O	silver
O	cups
O	All
O	these
O	he
O	placed
O	upon
O	a
O	carpet
O	and
O	disappeared
O	this
O	was
O	done
O	before
C	Aladdin
C	s
C	mother
O	recovered
O	from
O	her
O	swoon
C	Aladdin
O	had
O	fetched
O	some
O	water
O	and
O	sprinkled
O	it
O	in
O	her
O	face
O	to
O	recover
O	her
O	Whether
O	that
O	or
O	the
O	smell

O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	herself

O	in
O	heart
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	satisfy
O	my
O	extreme
O	hunger
O	His
O	mother
O	was
O	much
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	great
O	tray
O	twelve
O	dishes
O	six
O	loaves
O	the
O	two

O	the
O	savory
O	odor
O	which
O	exhaled
O	from
O	the
O	dishes
O	Child
O	said
O	she
O	to
O	whom
O	are
O	we
O	obliged
O	for
O	this
O	great
O	plenty
O	and
O	liberality
O	Has
O	the
C	sultan
O	been
O	made
O	acquainted
O	with

O	poverty
O	and
O	had
O	compassion
O	on
O	us
O	It
O	is
O	no

O	mother
O	said
C	Aladdin
O	let
O	us
O	sit
O	down
O	and
O	eat
O	for
O	you
O	have
O	almost
O	as
O	much
O	need
O	of
O	a
O	good
O	breakfast
O	as
O	myself
O	when
O	we
O	have
O	done
O	I
O	will
O	tell
O	you
O	Accordingly
O	both
O	mother
O	and
O	son
O	sat
O	down
O	and
O	ate
O	with
O	the
O	better
O	relish
O	as
O	the
O	table
O	was
O	so
O	well
O	furnished
O	But
O	all
O	the
O	time
C	Aladdin
C	s
C	mother
O	could
O	not
O	forbear
O	looking
O	at
O	and
O	admiring
O	the
O	tray
O	and
O	dishes
O	though
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	judge
O	whether
O	they
O	were
O	silver
O	or
O	any
O	other
O	metal
O	and
O	the
O	novelty
O	more
O	than
O	the
O	value
O	attracted
O	her
O	attention
O	The
O	mother
O	and
O	son
O	sat
O	at
O	breakfast
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	dinner
O	time
O	and
O	then
O	they
O	thought
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	best
O	to
O	put
O	the
O	two
O	meals
O	together
O	yet
O	after
O	this
O	they
O	found
O	they
O	should
O	have
O	enough
O	left
O	for
O	supper
O	and
O	two
O	meals
O	for
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	When
C	Aladdin
C	s
C	mother
O	had
O	taken
O	away
O	and
O	set
O	by
O	what
O	was
O	left
O	she
O	went
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	by
O	her
O	son
O	on
O	the
O	sofa
O	saying
O	I
O	expect
O	now
O	that
O	you
O	should
O	satisfy
O	my
O	impatience
O	and
O	tell
O	me
O	exactly
O	what
O	passed
O	between
O	the
C	genie
O	and
O	you
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	swoon
O	which
O	he
O	readily
O	complied
O	with
O	She
O	was
O	in
O	as
O	great
O	amazement
O	at
O	what
O	her
O	son
O	told
O	her
O	as
O	at
O	the
O	appearance
O	of
O	the
C	genie
O	and
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	But
O	son
O	what
O	have
O	we
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	genies
O	I
O	never
O	heard

C	genie
O	to

O	himself
O	to

O	If
O	you
O	remember

O	first

O	now
O	take
O	care
O	how
O	I
O	sell
O	a
O	lamp
O	which
O	may
O	be
O	so
O	serviceable
O	both
O	to
O	you
O	and
O	me
O	That
O	false
O	and
O	wicked
C	magician
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	undertaken
O	so
O	long
O	a
O	journey
O	to
O	secure
O	this
O	wonderful
O	lamp
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	known
O	its
O	value
O	to
O	exceed
O	that
O	of
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	And
O	since
O	we
O	have
O	honestly
O	come
O	by
O	it
O	let
O	us
O	make
O	a
O	profitable
O	use
O	of
O	it
O	without
O	making
O	any
O	great
O	show
O	and
O	exciting
O	the
O	envy
O	and
O	jealousy
O	of
O	our
O	neighbors
O	However
O	since
O	the
O	genies
O	frighten
O	you
O	so
O	much
O	I
O	will
O	take
O	it
O	out
O	of
O	your
O	sight
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	where
O	I
O	may
O	find
O	it
O	when
O	I
O	want
O	it
O	The
O	ring
O	I
O	cannot
O	resolve
O	to
O	part
O	with
O	for
O	without
O	that
O	you

O	never

O	me
O	again
O	and
O	though
O	I
O	am
O	alive
O	now
O	perhaps
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	gone
O	I
O	might
O	not

O	so
O	some
O	moments
O	hence
O	therefore
O	I
O	hope
O	you
O	will
O	give
O	me
O	leave

C	Aladdin
C	s
C	mother
O	replied
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	do
O	what
O	he
O	pleased
O	for
O	her
O	part
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	genies
O	and
O	never
O	say
O	anything
O	more
O	about
O	them
O	By
O	the
O	next
O	night
O	they
O	had
O	eaten
O	all
O	the
O	provisions
O	the
C	genie
O	had
O	brought
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
C	Aladdin
O	who
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	hunger
O	putting
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	silver
O	dishes
O	under
O	his
O	vest
O	went
O	out
O	early
O	to
O	sell
O	it
O	and
O	addressing
O	himself
O	to
O	a
O	Jew
O	whom
O	he
O	met
O	in
O	the
O	streets
O	took
O	him
O	aside
O	and
O	pulling
O	out
O	the
O	plate
O	asked
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	buy
O	it
O	The
O	cunning
O	Jew
O	took
O	the
O	dish
O	examined
O	it
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	good
O	silver
O	asked
C	Aladdin
O	at
O	how
O	much
O	he
O	valued
O	it
C	Aladdin
O	who
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	used
O	to
O	such
O	traffic
O	told
O	him
O	he
O	would
O	trust
O	to
O	his
O	judgment
O	and
O	honor
O	The
O	Jew
O	was
O	somewhat
O	confounded
O	at
O	this
O	plain
O	dealing
O	and
O	doubting
O	whether
C	Aladdin
O	understood
O	the
O	material
O	or
O	the
O	full
O	value
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	offered
O	to
O	sell
O	took
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	gold
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	purse
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	him
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	but
O	the
O	sixtieth
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	worth
O	of
O	the
O	plate
C	Aladdin
O	taking
O	the
O	money
O	very
O	eagerly
O	retired
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	haste
O	that
O	the
O	Jew
O	not
O	content
O	with
O	the
O	exorbitancy
O	of
O	his
O	profit
O	was
O	vexed
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	penetrated
O	into
O	his
O	ignorance
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	run
O	after
O	him
O	to
O	endeavor
O	to
O	get
O	some
O	change
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	piece
O	of
O	gold
O	but
O	he
O	ran
O	so
O	fast
O	and
O	had
O	got
O	so
O	far
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	impossible
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	overtake
O	him
O	Before
C	Aladdin
O	went
O	home
O	he
O	called
O	at
O	a
O	baker
O	s
O	bought
O	some
O	cakes
O	of
O	bread
O	changed
O	his
O	money
O	and
O	on
O	his
O	return
O	gave
O	the
O	rest
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	who
O	went
O	and
O	purchased
O	provisions
O	enough
O	to
O	last
O	them
O	some
O	time
O	After
O	this
O	manner
O	they
O	lived
O	till
C	Aladdin
O	had
O	sold
O	the
O	twelve
O	dishes
O	singly
O	as
O	necessity
O	pressed
O	to
O	the
O	Jew
O	for
O	the
O	same
O	money
O	who
O	after
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	durst
O	not
O	offer
O	him
O	less
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	losing
O	so
O	good
O	a
O	bargain
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	sold
O	the
O	last
O	dish
O	he
O	had
O	recourse
O	to
O	the
O	tray
O	which
O	weighed
O	ten
O	times
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	the
O	dishes
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	carried
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	old
O	purchaser
O	but
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	too
O	large
O	and
O	cumbersome
O	therefore
O	he
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	bring
O	him
O	home
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	s
O	where
O	after
O	the
O	Jew
O	had
O	examined
O	the
O	weight
O	of
O	the
O	tray
O	he
O	laid
O	down
O	ten
O	pieces
O	of
O	gold
O	with
O	which
C	Aladdin
O	was
O	very
O	well
O	satisfied
O	When
O	all
O	the
O	money
O	was
O	spent
C	Aladdin
O	had
O	recourse
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	lamp
O	He
O	took
O	it
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	looked
O	for
O	that
O	part
O	where
O	his
O	mother
O	had
O	rubbed
O	it
O	with
O	the
O	sand
O	rubbed
O	it
O	also
O	when
O	the
C	genie
O	immediately
O	appeared
O	and
O	said
O	What
O	wouldst
O	thou
O	have
O	I
O	am
O	ready
O	to
O	obey
O	thee
O	as
O	thy
C	slave
O	and
O	the
C	slave
O	of
O	all
O	those
O	who
O	have
O	that
O	lamp
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	I
O	and
O	the
O	other
C	slaves
O	of
O	the
O	lamp
O	I
O	am
O	hungry
O	said
C	Aladdin
O	bring
O	me
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	The
C	genie
O	disappeared
O	and
O	presently
O	returned
O	with
O	a
O	tray
O	the
O	same
O	number
O	of
O	covered
O	dishes
O	as
O	before
O	set
O	them
O	down
O	and
O	vanished
O	As
O	soon
O	as
C	Aladdin
O	found
O	that
O	their
O	provisions
O	were
O	again
O	expended
O	he
O	took
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	dishes
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	his
O	Jew
O	chapman
O	but
O	passing
O	by
O	a
O	goldsmith
O	s
O	shop
O	the
O	goldsmith
O	perceiving
O	him
O	called
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	said
O	My
O	lad
O	I
O	imagine
O	that
O	you
O	have
O	something
O	to
O	sell
O	to
O	the
O	Jew
O	whom
O	I
O	often
O	see
O	you
O	visit
O	but
O	perhaps
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	the
O	greatest
O	rogue
O	even
O	among
O	the
O	Jews
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	you
O	the
O	full
O	worth
O	of
O	what
O	you
O	have
O	to
O	sell
O	or
O	I
O	will
O	direct
O	you
O	to
O	other
O	merchants
O	who
O	will
O	not
O	cheat
O	you
O	This
O	offer
O	induced
C	Aladdin
O	to
O	pull
O	his
O	plate
O	from
O	under
O	his
O	vest
O	and
O	show
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	goldsmith
O	who
O	at
O	first
O	sight
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	made
O	of
O	the
O	finest
O	silver
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	sold
O	such
O	as
O	that
O	to
O	the
O	Jew
O	when
C	Aladdin
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	sold
O	him
O	twelve
O	such
O	for
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	gold
O	each
O	What
O	a
O	villain
O	cried
O	the
O	goldsmith
O	But
O	added
O	he
O	my
O	son
O	what
O	is
O	past
O	cannot
O	be
O	recalled
O	By
O	showing
O	you
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	this
O	plate
O	which
O	is
O	of
O	the
O	finest
O	silver
O	we
O	use
O	in
O	our
O	shops
O	I
O	will
O	let
O	you
O	see
O	how
O	much
O	the
O	Jew
O	has
O	cheated
O	you
O	The
O	goldsmith
O	took
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	scales
O	weighed
O	the
O	dish
O	and
O	assured
O	him
O	that
O	his
O	plate
O	would
O	fetch
O	by
O	weight
O	sixty
O	pieces
O	of
O	gold
O	which
O	he
O	offered
O	to
O	pay
O	down
O	immediately
C	Aladdin
O	thanked
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	fair
O	dealing
O	and
O	never
O	after
O	went
O	to
O	any
O	other
O	person
O	Though
C	Aladdin
O	and
O	his
O	mother
O	had
O	an
O	inexhaustible
O	treasure
O	in
O	their
O	lamp
O	and
O	might
O	have
O	had
O	whatever
O	they
O	wished
O	for
O	yet
O	they
O	lived
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	frugality
O	as
O	before
O	and
O	it
O	may
O	easily
O	be
O	supposed
O	that
O	the
O	money
O	for
O	which
C	Aladdin
O	had
O	sold
O	the
O	dishes
O	and
O	tray
O	was
O	sufficient
O	to
O	maintain
O	them
O	some
O	time
O	During
O	this
O	interval
C	Aladdin
O	frequented
O	the
O	shops
O	of
O	the
O	principal
O	merchants
O	where
O	they
O	sold
O	cloth
O	of
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	linens
O	silk
O	stuffs
O	and
O	jewelry
O	and
O	oftentimes
O	joining
O	in
O	their
O	conversation
O	acquired
O	a
O	knowledge
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	and
O	a
O	desire
O	to
O	improve
O	himself
O	By
O	his
O	acquaintance
O	among
O	the
O	jewellers
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	know
O	that
O	the
O	fruits
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	gathered
O	when
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	lamp
O	were
O	instead
O	of
O	colored
O	glass
O	stones
O	of
O	inestimable
O	value
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	the
O	prudence
O	not
O	to
O	mention
O	this
O	to
O	anyone
O	not
O	even
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	One
O	day
O	as
C	Aladdin
O	was
O	walking
O	about
O	the
O	town
O	he
O	heard
O	an
O	order
O	proclaimed
O	commanding
O	the
O	people
O	to
O	shut
O	up
O	their
O	shops
O	and
O	houses
O	and
O	keep
O	within
O	doors
O	while
O	the
C	Princess
C	Buddir
C	al
C	Buddoor
O	the
C	sultan
O	s
O	daughter
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	bath
O	and
O	returned
O	This
O	proclamation
O	inspired
C	Aladdin
O	with
O	an
O	eager
O	desire
O	to
O	see
O	the
C	Princess
O	s
O	face
O	which
O	he
O	determined
O	to
O	gratify
O	by
O	placing
O	himself
O	behind
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	bath
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	fail
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	face
C	Aladdin
O	had
O	not
O	long
O	concealed
O	himself
O	before
O	the
C	Princess
O	came
O	She
O	was
O	attended
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	crowd
O	of
O	ladies
C	slaves
O	and
O	mutes
O	who
O	walked
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	and
O	behind
O	her
O	When
O	she
O	came
O	within
O	three
O	or
O	four
O	paces
O	of
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	bath
O	she
O	took
O	off
O	her
O	veil
O	and
O	gave
C	Aladdin
O	an
O	opportunity
O	of
O	a
O	full
O	view
O	of
O	her
O	face
O	The
C	Princess
O	was
O	a
O	noted
O	beauty
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	large
O	lively
O	and
O	sparkling
O	her
O	smile
O	bewitching
O	her
O	nose
O	faultless
O	her
O	mouth
O	small
O	her
O	lips
O	vermilion
O	It
O	is
O	not
O	therefore
O	surprising
O	that
C	Aladdin
O	who
O	had
O	never
O	before
O	seen
O	such
O	a
O	blaze
O	of
O	charms
O	was
O	dazzled
O	and
O	enchanted
O	After
O	the
C	Princess
O	had
O	passed
O	by
O	and
O	entered
O	the
O	bath
C	Aladdin
O	quitted
O	his
O	and
O	went
O	home
O	His
O	mother
O	perceived
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	more
O	thoughtful
O	and
O	melancholy
O	than
O	usual
O	and
O	asked
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	so
O	or
O	if
O	he
O	was

O	He
O	then
O	told
O	his
O	mother
O	all
O	his

O	by
O	declaring
O	I

O	retire
O	and
O	all
O	the

O	judged
O	rightly
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	sit
O	again
O	that
O	day
O	and
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	home
O	and
O	on
O	her
O	arrival
O	said
O	with
O	much
O	simplicity
O	Son
O	I
O	have
O	seen
O	the
C	sultan
O	and
O	am
O	very
O	well
O	persuaded
O	he
O	has
O	seen
O	me
O	too
O	for
O	I
O	placed
O	myself
O	just
O	before
O	him
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	taken
O	up
O	with
O	those
O	who
O	attended
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	of
O	him
O	that
O	I
O	pitied
O	him
O	and
O	wondered
O	at
O	his
O	patience
O	At
O	last
O	I
O	believe
O	he
O	was
O	heartily
O	tired
O	for
O	he
O	rose
O	up
O	suddenly
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	hear
O	a
O	great
O	many
O	who
O	were
O	ready
O	prepared
O	to
O	speak
O	to
O	him
O	but
O	went
O	away
O	at
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	well
O	pleased
O	for
O	indeed
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	lose
O	all
O	patience
O	and
O	was
O	extremely
O	fatigued
O	with
O	staying
O	so
O	long
O	But
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	harm
O	done
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	again
O	tomorrow
O	perhaps
O	the
C	sultan
O	may
O	not
O	be
O	so
O	busy
O	The

O	went
O	six
O	times
O	afterward

O	may
O	hear
O	what
O	she
O	has
O	to
O	say
O	The
O	grand
O	vizier
O	made
O	answer
O	by
O	lowering
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	then
O	lifting
O	it
O	up
O	above
O	his
O	head
O	signifying
O	his
O	willingness
O	to
O	lose
O	it
O	if
O	he
O	failed
O	On
O	the
O	next

O	to
O	the
C	sultan
O	The
C	sultan
O	s
O	amazement
O	and
O	surprise
O	were
O	inexpressible

O	so
O	many
O	large
O	beautiful
O	and
O	valuable
O	jewels
O	collected
O	in
O	the

O	lost
O	in
O	admiration
O	At

O	was
O	made
O	to

O	Good

O	it

O	Where
O	said
O	she

O	It

O	inquiries
O	conducted

O	to
O	the
O	grand
O	saloon
O	where
O	the
C	sultan
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	surprise
O	found
O	the
O	window
O	which
O	was
O	left
O	imperfect
O	to
O	correspond
O	exactly
O	with
O	the
O	others
O	He
O	fancied
O	at
O	first
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	mistaken
O	and
O	examined
O	the
O	two
O	windows
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	and
O	afterward
O	all
O	the
O	four
O	and
O	twenty
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	convinced
O	that
O	the
O	window
O	which
O	several
O	workmen
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	long
O	about
O	was
O	finished
O	in
O	so
O	short
O	a
O	time

O	embraced
C	Aladdin
O	and
O	kissed
O	him
O	between
O	his
O	eyes
O	My
O	son
O	said
O	he
O	what
O	a
O	man
O	you
O	are
O	to
O	do
O	such
O	surprising
O	things
O	always
O	in
O	the
O	twinkling
O	of

O	I
O	know

O	admire
O	you
O	The
C	sultan
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	and
O	after
O	this
O	went
O	frequently
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	to
O	contemplate
O	and
O	admire
O	the
O	wonderful
O	palace
O	of
O	his
C	Aladdin
O	did
O	not
O	confine
O	himself
O	in
O	his
O	palace
O	but
O	went
O	with
O	much
O	state
O	sometimes
O	to
O	one
O	mosque
O	and
O	sometimes
O	to
O	another
O	to
O	prayers
O	or
O	to
O	visit
O	the
O	grand
O	vizier
O	or
O	the
O	principal
O	lords
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	Every
O	time
O	he
O	went
O	out
O	he
O	caused
O	two
C	slaves
O	who
O	walked
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of
O	his
O	horse
O	to
O	throw
O	handfuls
O	of
O	money
O	among
O	the
O	people
O	as
O	he
O	passed
O	through
O	the
O	streets
O	and
O	squares
O	This
O	generosity
O	gained
O	him
O	the
O	love
O	and
O	blessings
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	common
O	for

O	to
O	swear
O	by

O	Thus
C	Aladdin
O	while
O	he
O	paid
O	all
O	respect
O	to
O	the
C	sultan
O	won
O	by
O	his
O	affable
O	behavior
O	and
O	liberality
O	the
O	affections
O	of
O	the

C	Aladdin
O	had
O	conducted
O	himself
O	in
O	this
O	manner
O	several
O	years
O	when

O	lamp
O	On
O	the
O	very
O	next
O	day
O	the
C	magician
O	set
O	out
O	and
O	travelled
O	with
O	the
O	utmost
O	haste
O	to
O	the
O	capital
O	of
O	China
O	where

O	he
O	took
O	up
O	his
O	lodging
O	in
O	a
O	khan
O	He
O	then
O	quickly
O	learned

O	and
O	splendid
O	palace
O	of
O	Prince
C	Aladdin
O	Directly
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	wonderful
O	fabric
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	none
O	but
O	the
O	genies
O	the
C	slaves
O	of
O	the
O	lamp
O	could
O	have
O	performed
O	such
O	wonders
O	and
O	piqued
O	to
O	the
O	quick
O	at
O	Aladdin
O	s
O	high
O	estate
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	khan
O	On
O	his
O	return
O	he
O	had
O	recourse
O	to
O	an
O	operation
O	of
O	geomancy
O	to
O	find
O	out
O	where
O	the
O	lamp
O	was
O	whether
C	Aladdin
O	carried
O	it
O	about
O	with
O	him
O	or
O	where
O	he
O	left
O	it
O	The
O	result
O	of
O	his
O	consultation
O	informed
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	joy
O	that
O	the
O	lamp
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	Well
O	said
O	he
O	rubbing
O	his
O	hands
O	in
O	glee
O	I
O	shall
O	have
O	the
O	lamp
O	and
O	I
O	shall
O	make
C	Aladdin
O	return
O	to
O	his
O	original
O	mean
O	condition
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	the
C	magician
O	learned
O	from
O	the
O	chief
O	superintendent
O	of
O	the
O	khan
O	where
O	he
O	lodged
O	that
C	Aladdin
O	had
O	gone
O	on
O	a
O	hunting
O	expedition
O	which
O	was
O	to
O	last
O	for
O	eight
O	days
O	of
O	which
O	only
O	three
O	had
O	expired
O	The
C	magician
O	wanted
O	to
O	know
O	no
O	more
O	He
O	resolved
O	at
O	once
O	on
O	his
O	plans
O	He
O	went
O	to
O	a
O	coppersmith
O	and
O	asked
O	for
O	a
O	dozen
O	copper
O	lamps
O	the
O	master
O	of
O	the
O	shop
O	told
O	him
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	so
O	many
O	by
O	him
O	but
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	patience
O	till
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	them
O	ready
O	The
C	magician
O	appointed
O	his
O	time
O	and
O	desired
O	him
O	to
O	take
O	care
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	be
O	handsome
O	and
O	well
O	polished
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	the
C	magician
O	called
O	for
O	the
O	twelve
O	lamps
O	paid
O	the
O	man
O	his
O	full
O	price
O	put
O	them
O	into
O	a
O	basket
O	hanging
O	on
O	his
O	arm
O	and
O	went
O	directly
O	to
O	Aladdin
O	s
O	palace
O	As
O	he
O	approached
O	he
O	began
O	crying
O	Who
O	will
O	change
O	old
O	lamps
O	for
O	new
O	ones
O	As
O	he
O	went
O	along
O	a
O	crowd
O	of
O	children
O	collected
O	who
O	hooted
O	and
O	thought
O	him
O	as
O	did
O	all
O	who
O	chanced
O	to
O	be
O	passing
O	by
O	a
O	madman
O	or
O	a
O	fool
O	to
O	offer
O	to
O	change
O	new
O	lamps
O	for
O	old
O	ones
O	The
C	African
C	magician
O	regarded
O	not
O	their
O	scoffs
O	hootings
O	or
O	all
O	they
O	could
O	say
O	to
O	him
O	but
O	still
O	continued
O	crying
O	Who
O	will
O	change
O	old
O	lamps
O	for
O	new
O	ones
O	He
O	repeated
O	this
O	so
O	often
O	walking
O	backward
O	and
O	forward
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	that
O	the
C	Princess
O	who
O	was
O	then
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	with
O	the
O	windows
O	hearing
O	a
O	man
O	cry
O	something
O	and
O	seeing
O	a
O	great
O	mob
O	crowding
O	about
O	him
O	sent
O	one
O	of
O	her
C	women
C	slaves
O	to
O	know
O	what
O	he
O	cried
O	The
C	slave
O	returned
O	laughing
O	so
O	heartily
O	that
O	the
C	Princess
O	rebuked
O	her
O	Madam
O	answered
O	the
C	slave
O	laughing
O	still
O	who
O	can
O	forbear
O	laughing
O	to
O	see
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	with
O	a
O	basket
O	on
O	his
O	arm
O	full
O	of
O	fine
O	new
O	lamps
O	asking
O	to
O	change
O	them
O	for
O	old
O	ones
O	The
O	children
O	and
O	mob
O	crowding
O	about
O	him
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	can
O	hardly
O	stir
O	make
O	all
O	the
O	noise
O	they
O	can
O	in
O	derision
O	of
O	him
O	Another
O	female
C	slave
O	hearing
O	this
O	said
O	Now
O	you
O	speak
O	of
O	lamps
O	I
O	know
O	not
O	whether
O	the
C	Princess
O	may
O	have
O	observed
O	it
O	but
O	there
O	is
O	an
O	old
O	one
O	upon
O	a
O	shelf
O	of
O	the
O	Prince
O	Aladdin
O	s
O	and
O	whoever
O	owns
O	it
O	will
O	not
O	be
O	sorry
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	new
O	one
O	in
O	its
O	stead
O	If
O	the
C	Princess
O	chooses
O	she
O	may
O	have
O	the
O	pleasure
O	of
O	trying
O	if
O	this
O	old
O	man
O	is
O	so
O	silly
O	as
O	to
O	give
O	a
O	new
O	lamp
O	for
O	an
O	old
O	one
O	without
O	taking
O	anything
O	for
O	the
O	exchange
O	The
C	Princess
O	who
O	knew
O	not
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	this
O	lamp
O	and
O	the
O	interest
O	that
C	Aladdin
O	had
O	to
O	keep
O	it
O	safe
O	entered
O	into
O	the
O	pleasantry
O	and
O	commanded
O	a
C	slave
O	to
O	take
O	it
O	and
O	make
O	the
O	exchange
O	The
C	slave
O	obeyed
O	went
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	hall
O	and
O	no
O	sooner
O	got
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	gates
O	than
O	he
O	saw
O	the
C	African
C	magician
O	called
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	showing
O	him
O	the
O	old
O	lamp
O	said
O	Give
O	me
O	a
O	new
O	lamp
O	for
O	this
O	The
C	magician
O	never
O	doubted
O	but
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	lamp
O	he
O	wanted
O	There
O	could
O	be
O	no
O	other
O	such
O	in
O	this
O	palace
O	where
O	every
O	utensil
O	was
O	gold
O	or
O	silver
O	He
O	snatched
O	it
O	eagerly
O	out
O	of
O	the
C	slave
O	s
O	hand
O	and
O	thrusting
O	it
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	into
O	his
O	breast
O	offered
O	him
O	his
O	basket
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	choose
O	which
O	he
O	liked
O	best
O	The
C	slave
O	picked
O	out
O	one
O	and
O	carried
O	it
O	to
O	the
C	Princess
O	but
O	the
O	change
O	was
O	no
O	sooner
O	made
O	than
O	the

O	rung
O	with
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	children
O	deriding
O	the

O	folly
O	The
C	African
C	magician
O	stayed
O	no
O	longer
O	near
O	the
O	palace
O	nor
O	cried
O	any
O	more
O	New
O	lamps
O	for

O	but
O	made
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	his
O	khan
O	His
O	end
O	was
O	answered
O	and
O	by
O	his
O	silence
O	he
O	got
O	rid
O	of
O	the
O	children
O	and
O	the
O	mob
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	palaces
O	he
O	hastened
O	down
O	the
O	least
O	frequented
O	streets
O	and
O	having
O	no
O	more
O	occasion
O	for
O	his
O	lamps
O	or
O	basket
O	set
O	all
O	down
O	in
O	a
O	spot

O	Then
O	going
O	down
O	another
O	street
O	or

O	he
O	walked
O	till

O	city
O	gates
O	and
O	pursuing
O	his
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	suburbs
O	which
O	were
O	very
O	extensive
O	at
O	length
O	reached
O	a
O	lonely
O	spot
O	where
O	he
O	stopped
O	till
O	the
O	darkness
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	as
O	the
O	most
O	suitable
O	time
O	for

O	he
O	had
O	in
O	contemplation
O	When
O	it
O	became
O	quite
O	dark
O	he
O	pulled
O	the
O	lamp
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	breast
O	and
O	rubbed
O	it
O	At
O	that
O	summons
O	the
C	genie
O	appeared
O	and
O	said
O	What

O	which
O	thou
O	and
O	the

O	with
O	all

O	to

O	The

O	the
C	slaves
O	of
O	the

O	him
O	and
O	the
O	palace
O	entire
O	to
O	the
O	spot
O	whither
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	desired
O	to
O	convey
O	it
O	Early
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	when
O	the
C	sultan
O	according
O	to
O	custom
O	went
O	to
O	contemplate
O	and
O	admire
O	Aladdin
O	s
O	palace
O	his
O	amazement
O	was
O	unbounded
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	it
O	could
O	nowhere
O	be
O	seen
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	comprehend
O	how
O	so
O	large
O	a
O	palace
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	plainly
O	every
O	day
O	for
O	some
O	years
O	should
O	vanish
O	so
O	soon
O	and
O	not
O	leave
O	the
O	least
O	remains
O	behind
O	In
O	his
O	perplexity
O	he
O	ordered
O	the
O	grand
O	vizier
O	to
O	be
O	sent
O	for
O	with
O	expedition
O	The
O	grand
O	vizier
O	who
O	in
O	secret
O	bore
O	no
O	goodwill
O	to
C	Aladdin
O	intimated
O	his
O	suspicion
O	that
O	the
O	palace
O	was
O	built
O	by
O	magic
O	and
O	that
C	Aladdin
O	had
O	made
O	his
O	hunting
O	excursion
O	an
O	excuse
O	for
O	the
O	removal
O	of
O	his
O	palace
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	suddenness
O	with
O	which
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	erected
O	He
O	induced
O	the
C	sultan
O	to
O	send
O	a
O	detachment
O	of
O	his
O	guards
O	and
O	to
O	have
C	Aladdin
O	seized
O	as
O	a
O	prisoner
O	of
O	state
O	On
O	his
O	being
O	brought
O	before
O	him
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	hear
O	a
O	word
O	from
O	him
O	but
O	ordered
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	put
O	to
O	death
O	The
O	decree
O	caused
O	so
O	much
O	discontent
O	among
O	the
O	people
O	whose
O	affection
C	Aladdin
O	had
O	secured
O	by
O	his
O	largesses
O	and
O	charities
O	that
O	the
C	sultan
O	fearful
O	of
O	an
O	insurrection
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	grant
O	him
O	his
O	life
O	When
C	Aladdin
O	found
O	himself
O	at

O	he
O	again
O	addressed
O	the
C	sultan
O	Sire
O	I
O	pray
O	you
O	to
O	let
O	me
O	know
O	the

O	have
O	thus
O	lost
O	the
O	favor
O	of
O	thy
O	countenance
O	Your
O	crime
O	answered
O	the
C	sultan
O	wretched
O	man
O	do
O	you

O	s
O	palace
O	in
O	a
O	condition
O	of

O	For
O	three
O	days
O	he
O	wandered

O	exciting
O	the
O	wonder
O	and
O	compassion
O	of
O	the

O	by

O	and
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	approaching
O	a

O	he
O	fell
O	down
O	the

O	with
O	so
O	much
O	violence
O	that
O	he
O	rubbed
O	the

C	Aladdin
O	agreeably

O	I
O	caused

O	Your

O	I
O	am

O	then
O	replied
C	Aladdin
O	by
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	the

O	to
O	transport
O	me
O	to
O	the

O	it

O	be
O	These
O	words
O	were
O	no
O	sooner
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	mouth
O	than
O	the
C	genie
O	transported
O	him
O	into
O	Africa
O	to
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	a
O	large
O	plain
O	where
O	his
O	palace
O	stood
O	at
O	no
O	great
O	distance
O	from
O	a
O	city
O	and
O	placing
O	him
O	exactly
O	under
O	the
O	window
O	of
O	the
C	Princess
O	s
O	apartment
O	left
O	him
O	Now
O	it
O	so
O	happened
O	that
O	shortly
O	after
C	Aladdin
O	had
O	been
O	transported
O	by
O	the
C	slave
O	of
O	the
O	ring
O	to
O	the
O	neighborhood
O	of

O	of
O	the
O	Attendants
O	of
O	the
C	Princess
C	Buddir
C	al
C	Buddoor
O	looking
O	through
O	the
O	window
O	perceived
O	him
O	and
O	instantly
O	told
O	her
O	mistress
O	The
C	Princess
O	who
O	could
O	not
O	believe
O	the
O	joyful
O	tidings
O	hastened
O	herself
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	seeing
C	Aladdin
O	immediately
O	opened
O	it
O	The
O	noise
O	of
O	opening
O	the
O	window
O	made
C	Aladdin
O	turn
O	his
O	head
O	that
O	way
O	and
O	perceiving
O	the
C	Princess
O	he
O	saluted
O	her
O	with
O	an
O	air
O	that
O	expressed
O	his
O	joy
O	To
O	lose
O	no
O	time
O	said
O	she
O	to
O	him
O	I
O	have
O	sent
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	private
O	door
O	opened
O	for
O	you
O	Enter
O	and
O	come
O	up
O	The
O	private
O	door
O	which
O	was
O	just
O	under
O	the
C	Princess
O	s
O	apartment
O	was
O	soon
O	opened
O	and
C	Aladdin
O	conducted
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	chamber
O	It
O	is
O	impossible
O	to
O	express
O	the
O	joy
O	of
O	both
O	at
O	seeing
O	each
O	other
O	after
O	so
O	cruel
O	a
O	separation
O	After
O	embracing
O	and
O	shedding
O	tears
O	of
O	joy
O	they
O	sat
O	down
O	and
C	Aladdin
O	said
O	I
O	beg
O	of
O	you
C	Princess
O	to
O	tell
O	me
O	what
O	is
O	become
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	lamp
O	which
O	stood
O	upon
O	a
O	shelf
O	in
O	my
O	robing
O	chamber
O	Alas
O	answered
O	the
C	Princess
O	I
O	was
O	afraid
O	our
O	misfortune
O	might
O	be
O	owing
O	to
O	that
O	lamp
O	and
O	What
O	grieves
O	me
O	most
O	is
O	that
O	I
O	have
O	been
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	it
O	I
O	was
O	foolish
O	enough
O	to
O	change
O	the
O	old
O	lamp
O	for
O	a
O	new
O	one
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	I
O	found
O	myself
O	in
O	this
O	unknown
O	country
O	which
O	I
O	am
O	told
O	is
O	Africa
C	Princess
O	said
C	Aladdin
O	interrupting
O	her
O	you
O	have
O	explained
O	all
O	by
O	telling
O	me
O	we
O	are
O	in
O	Africa
O	I
O	desire
O	you
O	only
O	to
O	tell
O	me
O	if
O	you
O	know
O	where
O	the
O	old
O	lamp
O	now
O	is
O	The
C	African
C	magician
O	carries
O	it
O	carefully
O	wrapt
O	up
O	in
O	his
O	bosom
O	said
O	the
C	Princess
O	and
O	this
O	I
O	can
O	assure
O	you
O	because
O	he
O	pulled
O	it
O	out
O	before
O	me
O	and
O	showed
O	it
O	to
O	me
O	in
O	triumph
C	Princess
O	said
C	Aladdin
O	I
O	think
O	I
O	have
O	found
O	the
O	means
O	to
O	deliver
O	you
O	and
O	to
O	regain
O	possession
O	of
O	the

O	then

O	done
O	by
O	you
O	to
O	insure
O	success
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	I
O	shall
O	disguise
O	myself
O	and
O	I
O	beg
O	that
O	the
O	private
O	door
O	may
O	be
O	opened
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	knock
O	When

O	sides
O	and
O	perceiving
O	a
O	peasant
O	going
O	into

O	hastened
O	after
O	him
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	overtaken
O	him
O	made
O	a
O	proposal
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	change

O	which
O	the
O	man
O	agreed
O	to
O	When

O	had
O	made
O	the
O	exchange
O	the
O	countryman
O	went
O	about

O	and
C	Aladdin
O	entered
O	the
O	neighboring
O	city
O	After
O	traversing

O	Upon

O	You
O	have
O	killed
O	the

O	No

O	with
O	emotion
O	I
O	have
O	not

O	but
O	a
O	villain
O	who
O	would
O	have
O	assassinated
O	me
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	not

O	him
O	This
O	wicked

O	He
O	has
O	strangled
O	the

O	disguised
O	himself
O	in
O	her
O	clothes
O	with
O	intent
O	to
O	murder
O	me
C	Aladdin
O	then
O	informed
O	her
O	how
O	the

O	had
O	told
O	him
O	these

O	to
O	pieces
O	rather
O	than
O	not
O	succeed
O	in
O	walking
O	upon
O	it
O	He
O	went
O	immediately
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	his
O	fair
O	mistress
O	and
O	the
C	cat
O	the
O	animal
O	came
O	in
O	front
O	of
O	him
O	arching
O	its
O	back
O	in
O	anger
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	wont
O	to
O	do
O	The
C	king
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	foot
O	thinking
O	nothing
O	would
O	be
O	so
O	easy
O	as
O	to
O	tread
O	on
O	the
O	tail
O	but
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	mistaken
C	Minon
O	was
O	the
O	creature
O	s
O	name
O	twisted
O	itself
O	round
O	so
O	sharply
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	only
O	hurt
O	his
O	own
O	foot
O	by
O	stamping
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	For
O	eight
O	days
O	did
O	he
O	pursue
O	the
C	cat
O	everywhere
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	palace
O	he
O	was
O	after
O	it
O	from
O	morning
O	till
O	night
O	but
O	with
O	no
O	better
O	success
O	the
O	tail
O	seemed
O	made
O	of
O	quicksilver
O	so
O	very
O	lively
O	was
O	it
O	At
O	last
O	the
C	king
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	fortune
O	to
O	catch
C	Minon
O	sleeping
O	when
O	tramp
O	tramp
O	he
O	trod
O	on
O	the
O	tail
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	force
C	Minon
O	woke
O	up
O	mewed
O	horribly
O	and
O	immediately
O	changed
O	from
O	a
C	cat
O	into
O	a
O	large
O	man
O	who
O	regarded
O	the
C	king
O	with
O	flashing
O	eyes
O	You
O	must
O	marry
O	the
C	princess
O	cried
O	he
O	because
O	you
O	have
O	broken
O	the
O	enchantment
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	held
O	her
O	but
O	I
O	will
O	be
O	revenged
O	on
O	you
O	You
O	shall
O	have
O	a
O	son
O	with
O	a
O	nose
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	that
O	he
O	made
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	a
O	curve
O	of
O	half
O	a
O	foot
O	yet
O	he
O	shall
O	believe
O	it
O	is
O	just
O	like
O	all
O	other
O	noses
O	and
O	shall
O	be
O	always
O	unfortunate
O	till
O	he
O	has
O	found
O	out
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	And
O	if
O	you
O	ever
O	tell
O	anybody
O	of
O	this
O	threat
O	of
O	mine
O	you
O	shall
O	die
O	on
O	the
O	spot
O	So
O	saying
O	the
O	magician
O	disappeared
O	The
C	king
O	who
O	was
O	at
O	first
O	much
O	terrified
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	laugh
O	at
O	this
O	adventure
O	My
O	son
O	might
O	have
O	a
O	worse
O	misfortune
O	than
O	too
O	long
O	a
O	nose
O	thought
O	he
O	At
O	least
O	it
O	will
O	hinder
O	him
O	neither
O	in
O	seeing
O	nor
O	hearing
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	and
O	find
O	the
C	princess
O	and
O	marry
O	her
O	at
O	once
O	He
O	did
O	so
O	but
O	he
O	only
O	lived
O	a
O	few
O	months
O	after
O	and
O	died
O	before
O	his
O	little
O	son
O	was
O	born
O	so
O	that
O	nobody
O	knew
O	anything
O	about
O	the
O	secret
O	of
O	the
O	nose
O	The
O	little
C	Prince
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	wished
O	for
O	that
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	world
O	they
O	agreed
O	to
O	call
O	him
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	He
O	had
O	beautiful
O	blue
O	eyes
O	and
O	a
O	sweet
O	little
O	mouth
O	but
O	his
O	nose
O	was
O	so
O	big
O	that
O	it
O	covered
O	half
O	his
O	face
O	The
O	queen
O	his
O	mother
O	was
O	inconsolable
O	but
O	her
O	ladies
O	tried
O	to
O	satisfy
O	her
O	by
O	telling
O	her
O	that
O	the
O	nose
O	was
O	not
O	nearly
O	so
O	large
O	as
O	it
O	seemed
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	grow
O	smaller
O	as
O	the
C	Prince
O	grew
O	bigger
O	and
O	that
O	if
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	a
O	large
O	nose
O	was
O	indispensable
O	to
O	a
O	hero
O	All
O	great
O	soldiers
O	they
O	said
O	had
O	great
O	noses
O	as
O	everybody
O	knew
O	The
O	queen
O	was
O	so
O	very
O	fond
O	of
O	her
O	son
O	that
O	she
O	listened
O	eagerly
O	to
O	all
O	this
O	comfort
O	Shortly
O	she
O	grew
O	so
O	used
O	to
O	the
C	Prince
O	s
O	nose
O	that
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	seem
O	to
O	her
O	any
O	larger
O	than
O	ordinary
O	noses
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	where
O	in
O	process
O	of
O	time
O	everybody
O	with
O	a
O	long
O	nose
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	admired
O	and
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	people
O	who
O	had
O	only
O	snubs
O	were
O	taken
O	very
O	little
O	notice
O	of
O	Great
O	care
O	was
O	observed
O	in
O	the
O	education
O	of
O	the
C	Prince
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	speak
O	they
O	told
O	him
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	amusing
O	tales
O	in
O	which
O	all
O	the
O	bad
O	people
O	had
O	short
O	noses
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	good
O	people
O	had
O	long
O	ones
O	No
O	person
O	was
O	suffered
O	to
O	come
O	near
O	him
O	who
O	had
O	not
O	a
O	nose
O	of
O	more
O	than
O	ordinary
O	length
O	nay
O	to
O	such
O	an
O	extent
O	did
O	the
O	courtiers
O	carry
O	their
O	fancy
O	that
O	the
O	noses
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	little
O	babies
O	were
O	ordered
O	to
O	be
O	pulled
O	out
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	possible
O	several
O	times
O	a
O	day
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	make
O	them
O	grow
O	But
O	grow
O	as
O	they
O	would
O	they
O	never
O	could
O	grow
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	that
O	of
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	When
O	he
O	was
O	old
O	enough
O	his
O	tutor
O	taught
O	him
O	history
O	and
O	whenever
O	any
O	great
C	king
O	or
O	lovely
C	princess
O	was
O	referred
O	to
O	the
O	tutor
O	always
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	mention
O	that
O	he
O	or
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	long
O	nose
O	All
O	the
O	royal
O	apartments
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	pictures
O	and
O	portraits
O	having
O	this
O	peculiarity
O	so
O	that
O	at
O	last
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	began
O	to
O	regard
O	the
O	length
O	of
O	his
O	nose
O	as
O	his
O	greatest
O	perfection
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	had
O	it
O	an
O	inch
O	less
O	even
O	to
O	save
O	his
O	crown
O	When
O	he
O	was
O	twenty
O	years
O	old
O	his
O	mother
O	and
O	his
O	people
O	wished
O	him
O	to
O	marry
O	They
O	procured
O	for
O	him
O	the
O	likenesses
O	of
O	many
O	princesses
O	but
O	the
O	one
O	he
O	preferred
O	was
C	princess
C	Darling
O	daughter
O	of
O	a
O	powerful
O	monarch
O	and
O	heiress
O	to
O	several
O	kingdoms
O	Alas
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	beauty
O	this
C	princess
O	had
O	one
O	great
O	misfortune
O	a
O	little
O	nose
O	which
O	every
O	one
O	else
O	said
O	made
O	her
O	only
O	the
O	more
O	bewitching
O	But
O	here
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	the
O	courtiers
O	were
O	thrown
O	by
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	utmost
O	perplexity
O	They
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	laughing
O	at
O	all
O	small
O	noses
O	but
O	how
O	dared
O	they
O	make
O	fun
O	of
O	the
O	nose
O	of
C	princess
C	Darling
O	Two
O	unfortunate
O	gentlemen
O	whom
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	had
O	overheard
O	doing
O	so
O	were
O	ignominiously
O	banished
O	from
O	the
O	court
O	and
O	capital
O	After
O	this
O	the
O	courtiers
O	became
O	alarmed
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	correct
O	their
O	habit
O	of
O	speech
O	but
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	found
O	themselves
O	in
O	constant
O	difficulties
O	had
O	not
O	one
O	clever
O	person
O	struck
O	out
O	a
O	bright
O	idea
O	He
O	said
O	that
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	indispensably
O	necessary
O	for
O	a
O	man
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	great
O	nose
O	women
O	were
O	different
O	and
O	that
O	a
O	learned
O	man
O	had
O	discovered
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	old
O	manuscript
O	that
O	the
O	celebrated
O	Cleopatra
O	Queen
O	of
O	Egypt
O	the
O	beauty
O	of
O	the
O	ancient
O	world
O	had
O	a
O	nose
O	At
O	this
O	information
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	was
O	so
O	delighted
O	that
O	he
O	made
O	the
O	courtier
O	a
O	very
O	handsome
O	present
O	and
O	immediately
O	sent
O	off
O	ambassadors
O	to
O	demand
C	princess
C	Darling
O	in
O	marriage
O	She
O	accepted
O	his
O	offer
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	returned
O	with
O	the
O	ambassadors
O	He
O	made
O	all
O	haste
O	to
O	meet
O	and
O	welcome
O	her
O	but
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	only
O	three
O	leagues
O	distant
O	from
O	his
O	capital
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	time
O	even
O	to
O	kiss
O	her
O	hand
O	the
O	magician
O	who
O	had
O	once
O	assumed
O	the
O	shape
O	of
O	his
O	mother
O	s
C	cat
C	Minon
O	appeared
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	and
O	carried
O	her
O	off
O	before
O	the
O	lover
O	s
O	very
O	eyes
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	almost
O	beside
O	himself
O	with
O	grief
O	declared
O	that
O	nothing
O	should
O	induce
O	him
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	his
O	throne
O	and

O	till

O	none
O	of
O	his
O	courtiers
O	or
O	attendants
O	to
O	follow
O	him
O	but
O	bidding
O	them
O	all
O	adieu
O	mounted
O	a
O	good
O	horse
O	laid
O	the
O	reins
O	on
O	the
O	animal
O	s
O	neck
O	and
O	let
O	him
O	take
O	him
O	wherever
O	he
O	would
O	The
O	horse
O	entered
O	a
O	plain
O	and
O	trotted
O	on
O	steadily
O	the
O	whole
O	day
O	without
O	finding
O	a
O	single
O	house
O	Master
O	and
O	beast
O	began
O	almost
O	to
O	faint
O	with

O	and
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	might
O	have
O	wished

O	a
O	little

O	who
O	might

O	hundred
O	years

O	She
O	put
O	on
O	her
O	spectacles
O	the
O	better
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	the
O	stranger
O	and
O	he
O	noticed
O	that
O	her
O	nose
O	was
O	so
O	small
O	that
O	the
O	spectacles
O	would
O	hardly
O	stay
O	on
O	then
O	the

O	for
O	it
O	was
O	a
C	fairy
O	into
O	a
O	mutual
O	fit
O	of
O	laughter
O	What
O	a
O	funny
O	nose
O	cried
O	the
O	one
O	Not
O	so
O	funny
O	as
O	yours
O	madam
O	returned
O	the

O	pray
O	let
O	us
O	leave
O	our
O	noses
O	alone
O	and
O	be
O	good
O	enough
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	for
O	I

O	Although

O	you

O	I
O	was
O	young
O	how
O	much
O	I
O	used
O	to
O	be

O	was
O	fast
O	departing
O	You
O	are
O	right

O	the

O	your

C	Prince
C	Wish
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	exclaim
O	but
O	he
O	stopped
O	himself
O	and
O	only
O	observed
O	that
O	however
O	the
O	pleasure
O	of
O	her
O	conversation
O	might
O	make
O	him
O	forget
O	his

O	it

O	not
O	have
O	the
O	same
O	effect
O	upon

O	who
O	was
O	really
O	starving
O	The
C	fairy
O	pleased
O	at
O	his
O	civility
O	called
O	her
O	servants
O	and
O	bade
O	them
O	supply
O	him
O	at
O	once
O	with
O	all
O	he
O	needed
O	And
O	added
O	she
O	I
O	must
O	say
O	you
O	are
O	very
O	polite
O	and
O	very
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	your
O	nose
O	What
O	has
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	my
O	nose
O	thought
O	the
C	Prince
O	If
O	I
O	were
O	not
O	so
O	very
O	hungry
O	I
O	would
O	soon
O	show
O	her
O	what
O	she
O	is
O	a
O	regular
O	old
O	gossip
O	and
O	She
O	to
O	fancy
O	she
O	talks
O	little
O	indeed
O	One
O	must
O	be
O	very
O	foolish
O	not
O	to
O	know
O	one
O	s
O	own
O	defects
O	This
O	comes
O	of
O	being
O	born
O	a
C	princess
C	Flatterers
O	have
O	spoiled
O	her
O	and
O	persuaded
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	talks
O	little
O	Little
O	indeed
O	I
O	never
O	knew
O	anybody
O	chatter
O	so
O	much
O	While
O	the
C	Prince
O	thus
O	meditated
O	the
O	servants
O	were
O	laying
O	the
O	table
O	the
C	fairy
O	asking
O	them
O	a
O	hundred
O	unnecessary
O	questions
O	simply
O	for
O	the
O	pleasure
O	of
O	hearing
O	herself
O	talk
O	Well
O	thought
C	Wish
O	I
O	am
O	delighted
O	that
O	I
O	came
O	hither
O	if
O	only
O	to
O	learn
O	how
O	wise
O	I
O	have
O	been
O	in
O	never
O	listening
O	to
C	Flatterers
O	who
O	hide
O	from
O	us
O	our
O	faults
O	or
O	make
O	us
O	believe
O	they
O	are
O	perfections
O	But
O	they
O	could
O	never
O	deceive
O	me
O	I
O	know
O	all
O	my
O	own
O	weak
O	points
O	I
O	trust
O	As
O	truly
O	he
O	believed
O	he
O	did
O	So
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	eating
O	contentedly
O	nor
O	stopped
O	till
O	the
O	old
C	fairy
O	began
O	to
O	address
O	him
C	Prince
O	said
O	she
O	will
O	you
O	be
O	kind
O	enough
O	to
O	turn
O	a
O	little
O	Your
O	nose
O	casts
O	such
O	a
O	shadow
O	that
O	I
O	cannot
O	see
O	what
O	is
O	in
O	my
O	plate
O	And
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	saying
O	your
O	father
O	admired
O	me
O	and
O	always
O	made
O	me
O	welcome
O	at
O	court
O	What
O	is
O	the
O	court
O	etiquette
O	there
O	now
O	Do
O	the
O	ladies
O	still
O	go
O	to
O	assemblies
O	promenades
O	balls
O	I
O	beg
O	your
O	pardon
O	for
O	laughing
O	but
O	how
O	long
O	your
O	nose
O	is
O	I
O	wish
O	you
O	would
O	cease
O	to
O	speak
O	of
O	my
O	nose
O	said
O	the
C	Prince
O	becoming
O	annoyed
O	It
O	is
O	what
O	it
O	is
O	and
O	I
O	do
O	not
O	desire
O	it
O	any
O	shorter
O	Oh
O	I
O	see
O	that
O	I
O	have
O	vexed
O	you
O	returned
O	the
C	fairy
O	Nevertheless
O	I
O	am
O	one
O	of
O	your
O	best
O	friends
O	and
O	so
O	I
O	shall
O	take
O	the
O	liberty
O	of
O	She
O	would
O	doubtless
O	have
O	gone
O	on
O	talking
O	till
O	midnight
O	but
O	the
C	Prince
O	unable
O	to
O	bear
O	it
O	any
O	longer
O	here
O	interrupted
O	her
O	thanked
O	her
O	for
O	her
O	hospitality
O	bade
O	her
O	a
O	hasty
O	adieu
O	and
O	rode
O	away
O	He
O	travelled
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	half
O	over
O	the
O	world
O	but
O	he
O	heard
O	no
O	news
O	of
C	princess
C	Darling
O	However
O	in
O	each
O	place
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	he
O	heard
O	one
O	remarkable
O	fact
O	the
O	great
O	length
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	nose
O	The
O	little
O	boys
O	in
O	the
O	streets
O	jeered
O	at
O	him
O	the
O	peasants
O	stared
O	at
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	more
O	polite
O	ladies
O	and
O	gentlemen
O	whom
O	he
O	met
O	in
O	society
O	used
O	to
O	try
O	in
O	vain
O	to
O	keep
O	from
O	laughing
O	and
O	to
O	get
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	So
O	the
O	poor
C	Prince
O	became
O	gradually
O	quite
O	forlorn
O	and
O	solitary
O	he
O	thought
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	was
O	mad
O	but
O	still
O	he
O	never
O	thought
O	of
O	there
O	being
O	anything
O	queer
O	about
O	his
O	own
O	nose
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	old
C	fairy
O	who
O	though
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	was
O	very
O	saw
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	almost
O	breaking
O	his
O	heart
O	She
O	felt
O	sorry
O	for
O	him
O	and
O	wished
O	to
O	help
O	him
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	himself
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	the
O	enchantment
O	which
O	hid
O	from
O	him
O	the
C	princess
C	Darling
O	could
O	never
O	be
O	broken
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	discovered
O	his
O	own
O	defect
O	So
O	she
O	went
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	the
C	princess
O	and
O	being
O	more
O	powerful
O	than
O	the
O	magician
O	since
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	good
C	fairy
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	an
O	evil
O	magician
O	she
O	got
O	her
O	away
O	from
O	him
O	and
O	shut
O	her
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	palace
O	of
O	crystal
O	which
O	she
O	placed
O	on
O	the
O	road
O	which
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	had
O	to
O	pass
O	He
O	was
O	riding
O	along
O	very
O	melancholy
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	palace
O	and
O	at
O	its
O	entrance
O	was
O	a
O	room
O	made
O	of
O	the
O	purest
O	glass
O	in
O	which
O	sat
O	his
O	beloved
C	princess
O	smiling
O	and
O	beautiful
O	as
O	ever
O	He
O	leaped
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	ran
O	towards
O	her
O	She
O	held
O	out
O	her
O	hand
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	kiss
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	at
O	it
O	for
O	the
O	glass
O	Transported
O	with
O	eagerness
O	and
O	delight
O	he
O	dashed
O	his
O	sword
O	through
O	the
O	crystal
O	and
O	succeeded
O	in
O	breaking
O	a
O	small
O	opening
O	to
O	which
O	she
O	put
O	up
O	her
O	beautiful
O	rosy
O	mouth
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	vain
C	Prince
C	Wish
O	could
O	not
O	approach
O	it
O	He
O	twisted
O	his
O	neck
O	about
O	and
O	turned
O	his
O	head
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	till
O	at
O	length
O	putting
O	up
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	his
O	face
O	he
O	discovered
O	the
O	impediment
O	It
O	must
O	be
O	confessed
O	exclaimed
O	he
O	that
O	my
O	nose
O	too
O	long
O	That
O	moment
O	the
O	glass
O	walls
O	all
O	split
O	asunder
O	and
O	the
O	old
C	fairy
O	appeared
O	leading
C	princess
C	Darling
O	Avow
C	Prince
O	said
O	she
O	that
O	you
O	are
O	very
O	much
O	obliged
O	to
O	me
O	for
O	now
O	the
O	enchantment
O	is
O	ended
O	You
O	may
O	marry
O	the
O	object
O	of
O	your
O	choice
O	But
O	added
O	she
O	smiling
O	I
O	fear
O	I
O	might
O	have
O	talked
O	to
O	you
O	for
O	ever
O	on
O	the
O	subject
O	of
O	your
O	nose
O	and
O	you
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	believed
O	me
O	in
O	its
O	length
O	till
O	it
O	became
O	an
O	obstacle
O	to
O	your

O	inclinations
O	Now
O	behold
O	it
O	and
O	she
O	held
O	up
O	a
O	crystal
O	mirror
O	Are
O	you
O	satisfied
O	to
O	be
O	no
O	different
O	from

C	Prince
C	Wish
O	who
O	found
O	his

O	had
O	shrunk
O	to
O	an
O	ordinary
O	length
O	And
O	taking
O	the

C	Darling
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	he
O	kissed
O	her
O	courteously
O	affectionately
O	and
O	satisfactorily
O	Then
O	they
O	departed
O	to
O	their

O	country
O	and
O	lived
O	very
O	happy
O	all
O	their
O	days
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	royal
O	couple

O	so
O	grand
O	that

O	all
O	the
O	others
O	to

O	first
O	so
O	that

O	were
O	sure
O	to

O	true
O	The
O	fortunate
O	little
C	princess
O	was
O	to
O	grow
O	up
O	the
O	fairest
O	woman
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	temper
O	sweet
O	as
O	an
O	angel
O	to
O	be
O	perfectly
O	graceful
O	and
O	gracious
O	to
O	sing
O	like
O	a
O	nightingale
O	to
O	dance
O	like
O	a
O	leaf
O	on
O	a
O	tree
O	and
O	to
O	possess
O	every

O	under

O	Then
O	the
O	old
C	fairy
O	s
O	turn
O	came
O	Shaking
O	her
O	head
O	spitefully
O	she
O	uttered
O	the
O	wish
O	that
O	when
O	the

O	grew
O	up
O	into
O	a
O	young
O	lady
O	and
O	learned
O	to
O	spin
O	she
O	might
O	prick
O	her
O	finger
O	with
O	the
O	spindle
O	and
O	die
O	of
O	the

O	At
O	this
O	terrible
O	prophecy
O	all
O	the
O	guests
O	shuddered
O	and
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	more
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	The
O	lately
O	happy
O	parents
O	were
O	almost
O	out
O	of

O	with
O	grief
O	Upon
O	which
O	the
O	wise
O	young
C	fairy
O	appeared
O	from
O	behind
O	the
O	tapestry
O	saying
O	cheerfully
O	Your

O	may
O	comfort
O	yourselves
O	the

O	shall
O	not

O	wished
O	her
O	by
O	my
O	ancient
O	sister
O	her
O	finger
O	must
O	be
O	pierced
O	and
O	she
O	shall
O	then
O	sink
O	not
O	into
O	the
O	sleep
O	of
O	death
O	but
O	into
O	a
O	sleep
O	that
O	will
O	last
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	After
O	that
O	time

O	the

O	her
O	and

O	Immediately
O	all
O	the

O	vanished
O	The
C	king
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	avoiding
O	his
O	daughter
O	s
O	doom
O	issued
O	an
O	edict
O	forbidding
O	all

O	to
O	have
O	in
O	their
O	houses
O	on
O	pain
O	of
O	instant
O	death
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	One
O	day
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	just
O	fifteen
O	years
O	of
O	age
O	the
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	left
O	their
O	daughter
O	alone
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	their
O	castles
O	when
O	wandering
O	about
O	at
O	her
O	will
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	an
O	ancient
O	donjon
O	tower
O	climbed
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	there
O	found
O	a
O	very
C	old
C	woman
O	old
O	and
O	deaf
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	never
O	heard
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	s
O	edict
O	busy
O	with
O	her
O	wheel
O	What
O	are
O	you
O	doing
O	good
C	old
C	woman
O	said
O	the
C	princess
O	I
O	m
O	spinning
O	my
O	pretty
O	child
O	Ah
O	how
O	charming
O	Let
O	me
O	try
O	if
O	I
O	can
O	spin
O	also
O	She
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	taken
O	up
O	the
O	spindle
O	than
O	being
O	lively
O	and
O	obstinate
O	she
O	handled
O	it
O	so
O	awkwardly
O	and
O	carelessly
O	that
O	the
O	point
O	pierced
O	her
O	finger
O	Though
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	small
O	a
O	wound
O	she
O	fainted
O	away
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	dropped
O	silently
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	The
O	poor
O	frightened
C	old
C	woman
O	called
O	for
O	help
O	shortly
O	came
O	the
O	ladies
O	in
O	waiting
O	who
O	tried
O	every
O	means
O	to
O	restore
O	their
O	young
O	mistress
O	but
O	all
O	their
O	care
O	was
O	useless
O	She
O	lay
O	beautiful
O	as
O	an
O	angel
O	the
O	colour
O	still
O	lingering
O	in
O	her
O	lips
O	and
O	cheeks
O	her
O	fair
O	bosom
O	softly
O	stirred
O	with
O	her
O	only
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	fast
O	closed
O	When
O	the
C	king
O	her
O	father
O	and
O	the
C	queen
O	her
O	mother
O	beheld
O	her
O	thus
O	they
O	knew
O	regret
O	was
O	idle
O	all
O	had
O	happened
O	as
O	the
O	cruel
C	fairy
O	meant
O	But
O	they
O	also
O	knew
O	that
O	their
O	daughter
O	would
O	not
O	sleep
O	for
O	ever
O	though
O	after
O	one
O	hundred
O	years
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	likely
O	they
O	would
O	either
O	of
O	them
O	behold
O	her
O	awakening
O	Until
O	that
O	happy
O	hour
O	should
O	arrive
O	they
O	determined
O	to
O	leave
O	her
O	in
O	repose
O	They
O	sent
O	away
O	all
O	the
O	physicians
O	and
O	attendants
O	and
O	themselves
O	sorrowfully
O	laid
O	her
O	upon
O	a
O	bed
O	of
O	embroidery
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	elegant
O	apartment
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	There
O	she
O	slept
O	and
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	sleeping
O	angel
O	still
O	When
O	this
O	misfortune
O	happened
O	the
O	kindly
O	young
C	fairy
O	who
O	had
O	saved
O	the
C	princess
O	by
O	changing
O	her
O	sleep
O	of
O	death
O	into
O	this
O	sleep
O	of
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	was
O	twelve
O	thousand
O	leagues
O	away
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	Mataquin
O	But
O	being
O	informed
O	of
O	everything
O	she
O	arrived
O	speedily
O	in
O	a
O	chariot
O	of
O	fire
O	drawn
O	by
O	dragons
O	The
C	king
O	was
O	somewhat
O	startled
O	by
O	the
O	sight
O	but
O	nevertheless
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	his
O	palace
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	mournful
O	countenance
O	presented
O	her
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	descend
O	The
C	fairy
O	condoled
O	with
O	his
O	majesty
O	and
O	approved
O	of
O	all
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	Then
O	being
O	a
C	fairy
O	of
O	great
O	common
O	sense
O	and
O	foresight
O	she
O	suggested
O	that
O	the
C	princess
O	awakening
O	after
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	in
O	this
O	ancient
O	castle
O	might
O	be
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	embarrassed
O	especially
O	with
O	a
O	young
C	prince
O	by
O	her
O	side
O	to
O	find
O	herself
O	alone
O	Accordingly
O	without
O	asking
O	any
O	one
O	s
O	leave
O	she
O	touched
O	with
O	her
O	magic
O	wand
O	the
O	entire
O	population
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	except
O	the
C	king
O	and

O	governesses
O	ladies
O	of
O	honour
O	gentlemen
O	ushers
O	cooks

O	down
O	to

O	in
O	the
O	stables
O	and
O	the
O	grooms
O	that
O	attended
O	them
O	she
O	touched
O	each
O	and
O	all
O	Nay
O	with
O	kind
O	consideration
O	for
O	the
O	feelings
O	of
O	the
C	princess
O	she
O	even
O	touched
O	the
O	little
O	fat
C	Puffy
O	who
O	had
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	beside
O	his
O	mistress
O	on
O	her
O	splendid
O	bed
O	He
O	like
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	fell
O	fast
O	asleep
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	The
O	very
O	spits
O	that
O	were
O	before
O	the
O	ceased
O	turning
O	and
O	the
O	fire
O	itself
O	went
O	out
O	and
O	everything
O	became
O	as
O	silent
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	or
O	as
O	if
O	the

O	were
O	a
O	palace
O	of
O	the
O	dead
O	The
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	kissed
O	their
O	daughter
O	and
O	wept
O	over
O	her
O	a
O	little
O	but
O	not
O	much
O	she
O	looked
O	so
O	sweet
O	and
O	content
O	departed
O	from
O	the
O	castle
O	giving
O	orders
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	approached
O	no
O	more
O	The
O	command
O	was
O	unnecessary
O	for
O	in
O	one
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	there
O	sprung
O	up
O	around
O	it
O	a
O	wood
O	so
O	thick

O	thorny
O	that
O	neither

O	the

O	slept
O	A
O	great

O	and
O	his
O	throne
O	passed
O	into
O	another

O	So
O	entirely
O	was
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	the

O	forgotten
O	that

O	out
O	hunting
O	and
O	stopped
O	in
O	the

O	by
O	this
O	formidable
O	wood
O	inquired
O	what

O	an

O	to

O	father
O	that
O	in
O	this

O	was
O	a
C	princess
O	beautiful
O	as
O	the

O	who
O	was
O	doomed
O	to
O	sleep
O	there
O	for

O	At

O	the

O	for

O	Spurred
O	on
O	by
O	both
O	generosity
O	and
O	curiosity
O	he
O	leaped
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	force
O	his
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	thick
O	wood
O	To
O	his
O	amazement
O	the
O	stiff
O	branches
O	all
O	gave
O	way
O	and
O	the
O	ugly
O	thorns
O	sheathed
O	themselves
O	of
O	their
O	own
O	accord
O	and
O	the
O	brambles
O	buried
O	themselves
O	in
O	the
O	earth
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	pass
O	This
O	done
O	they
O	closed
O	behind

O	allowing
O	none
O	of

O	suite
O	to

O	ardent
O	and
O	young
O	he
O	went
O	boldly
O	on
O	alone
O	The
O	first
O	thing
O	he
O	saw
O	was
O	enough
O	to
O	smite
O	him
O	with
O	fear
O	Bodies
O	of
O	men
O	and
O	horses
O	lay
O	extended
O	on
O	the

O	but
O	the
O	men
O	had
O	faces
O	not
O	but
O	red
O	as
O	peonies
O	and
O	beside
O	them
O	were
O	glasses

O	filled
O	with
O	wine
O	showing
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	gone
O	to

O	drinking
O	Next
O	he
O	entered
O	a

O	paved
O	with

O	where
O	stood
O	rows
O	of

O	arms
O	but
O	motionless
O	as
O	if

O	he
O	passed
O	through

O	attention
O	to
O	the

O	Their
O	clothes
O	strange
O	to

O	So

O	climb
O	it
O	High
O	in

O	is
O	the

O	so
O	high
O	that

O	when
O	I
O	look
O	down
O	upon
O	the

O	and
O	the

O	And
O	the
O	last
O	piece
O	of

O	that

O	scarce
O	check
O	the

O	rush
O	of

O	galloping
O	horses
O	And
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	the

O	cried
C	Phaeton
O	Grant
O	that
O	for
O	one
O	day
O	only
O	I
O	drive
O	thy
O	steeds
O	Very
O	pitifully
C	Apollo
O	looked
O	at
O	him
O	and
O	for
O	a
O	little
O	space
O	he
O	was
O	silent
O	The
O	little
O	human
O	hands
O	he
O	said
O	at
O	length
O	the
O	little
O	human
O	frame
O	and
O	with
O	them
O	the
O	soul
O	of
O	a
O	god
O	The
O	pity
O	of
O	it
O	my
O	son
O	Dost
O	not
O	know
O	that
O	the
O	boon
O	that
O	thou
O	dost
O	crave
O	from
O	me
O	is
O	Death
O	Rather
O	Death
O	than
O	Dishonour
O	said
C	Phaeton
O	and
O	proudly
O	he
O	added
O	For
O	once
O	would
O	I
O	drive
O	like
O	the
O	god
O	my
O	father
O	I
O	have
O	no
O	fear
O	So
O	was
C	Apollo
O	vanquished
O	and
C	Phaeton
O	gained
O	his
O	heart
O	s
O	desire
O	From
O	the
O	courtyard
O	of
O	the
O	Palace
O	the
O	four
O	white
O	horses
O	were
O	led
O	and
O	they
O	pawed
O	the
O	air
O	and
O	neighed
O	aloud
O	in
O	the
O	glory
O	of
O	their
O	strength
O	They
O	drew
O	the
O	chariot
O	whose
O	axle
O	and
O	pole
O	and
O	wheels
O	were
O	of
O	gold
O	with
O	spokes
O	of
O	silver
O	while
O	inside
O	were
O	rows
O	of
O	diamonds
O	and
O	of
O	chrysolites
O	that
O	gave
O	dazzling
O	reflection
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	Then
C	Apollo
O	anointed
O	the
O	face
O	of
C	Phaeton
O	with
O	a
O	powerful
O	essence
O	that
O	might
O	keep
O	him
O	from
O	being
O	smitten
O	by
O	the
O	flames
O	and
O	upon
O	his
O	head
O	he
O	placed
O	the
O	rays
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	And
O	then
O	the
O	stars
O	went
O	away
O	even
O	to
O	the
O	Daystar
O	that
O	went
O	last
O	of
O	all
O	and
O	at
C	Apollo
O	s
O	signal
O	Aurora
O	the
O	threw
O	open
O	the
O	purple
O	gates
O	of
O	the
O	east
O	and
C	Phaeton
O	saw
O	a
O	path
O	of
O	pale
O	open
O	before
O	him
O	With
O	a
O	cry
O	of
O	exultation
O	the
O	boy
O	leapt
O	into
O	the
O	chariot
O	and
O	laid
O	hold
O	of
O	the
O	golden
O	reins
O	Barely
O	did
O	he
O	hear
C	Apollo
O	s
O	parting
O	Hold
O	fast
O	the
O	reins
O	and
O	spare
O	the
O	whip
O	All
O	thy
O	strength
O	will
O	be
O	wanted
O	to
O	hold
O	the

O	in
O	Go
O	not
O	too
O	high

O	The

O	Follow
O	if

O	canst
O	in
O	the
O	old
O	tracks
O	of

O	wheels
O	His
O	glad
O	voice
O	of
O	thanks
O	for
O	the
O	godlike
O	boon
O	rang
O	back
O	to
O	where
C	Apollo
O	stood
O	and
O	watched
O	him
O	vanishing
O	into
O	the
O	dawn
O	that
O	still
O	was
O	soft
O	in
O	hue
O	as
O	the
O	feathers
O	on
O	the
O	breast
O	of
O	a
O	dove
O	Uphill
O	at
O	first
O	the
O	white
O	steeds
O	made
O	their
O	way
O	and
O	the
O	fire
O	from
O	their
O	nostrils
O	tinged
O	with

O	dark
O	clouds
O	that
O	hung
O	over
O	the
O	land
O	and
O	the
O	sea
O	With
O	rapture
C	Phaeton
O	felt
O	that
O	truly
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	a
O	god
O	and
O	that
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	was
O	enjoying
O	his
O	heritage
O	The
O	day
O	for
O	which
O	through
O	all
O	his
O	short
O	life
O	he
O	had
O	longed
O	had
O	come
O	at
O	last
O	He
O	was
O	driving
O	the
O	chariot
O	whose
O	progress
O	even
O	now
O	was
O	awaking
O	the
O	sleeping
O	earth
O	The
O	radiance
O	from
O	its
O	wheels
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	rays
O	he
O	wore
O	round
O	his
O	head
O	was
O	painting
O	the
O	clouds
O	and
O	he
O	laughed
O	aloud
O	in
O	rapture
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	far
O	down
O	below
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	the
O	rivers
O	he
O	had
O	bathed
O	in
O	as
O	a
O	human
O	boy
O	mirroring
O	the
O	green
O	and
O	rose
O	and
O	purple
O	and
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	and
O	fierce
O	crimson
O	that
O	he
C	Phaeton
O	was
O	placing
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	The
O	grey
O	mist
O	rolled
O	from
O	the
O	mountain
O	tops
O	at

O	desire
O	The
O	white
O	fog
O	rolled
O	up
O	from
O	the
O	valleys
O	All
O	living
O	things
O	awoke
O	the
O	flowers
O	opened
O	their
O	petals
O	the
O	grain
O	grew
O	golden
O	the
O	fruit
O	grew
O	ripe
O	Could
O	but
C	Epaphos
O	see
O	him
O	now
O	Surely
O	he
O	must
O	see
O	him
O	and
O	realise
O	that
O	not
C	Apollo
O	but
C	Phaeton
O	was
O	guiding
O	the
O	horses
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	driving
O	the
O	chariot
O	of
O	the
O	Sun
O	Quicker
O	and
O	yet
O	more
O	quick
O	grew
O	the
O	pace
O	of
O	the
O	steeds
O	Soon
O	they
O	left
O	the
O	morning
O	breezes
O	behind
O	and
O	very
O	soon
O	they
O	knew
O	that
O	these
O	were
O	not
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	god
O	their
O	master
O	that
O	held
O	the
O	golden
O	reins
O	Like
O	an
O	without
O	its
O	accustomed
O	ballast
O	the
O	chariot
O	rolled
O	unsteadily
O	and
O	not
O	only
O	the
O	boy
O	s
O	light
O	weight
O	but
O	his
O	light
O	hold
O	on
O	their
O	bridles
O	made
O	them
O	grow
O	mad
O	with
O	a
O	lust
O	for
O	speed
O	The
O	white
O	foam
O	flew
O	from
O	their
O	mouths
O	like
O	the
O	spume
O	from
O	the
O	giant
O	waves
O	of
O	a
O	furious
O	sea
O	and
O	their
O	pace
O	was
O	swift
O	as
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	bolt
O	that
O	is
O	cast
O	by
O	the
O	arm
O	of
O	Zeus
O	Yet
C	Phaeton
O	had
O	no
O	fear
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	heard
O	him
O	shout
O	in
O	rapture
O	Quicker
O	still
O	brave
O	ones
O	more
O	swiftly
O	still
O	it
O	made
O	them
O	speed
O	onwards
O	madly
O	blindly
O	with
O	the
O	headlong
O	rush
O	of
O	a
O	storm
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	hope
O	for
O	them
O	to
O	keep
O	on
O	the
O	beaten
O	track
O	and
O	soon
C	Phaeton
O	had
O	his
O	rapture
O	checked
O	by
O	the
O	terrible
O	realisation
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	strayed
O	far
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	course
O	and
O	that
O	his
O	hands
O	were
O	not
O	strong
O	enough
O	to
O	guide
O	them
O	Close
O	to
O	the
O	Great
O	Bear
O	and
O	the
O	Little
O	Bear
O	they
O	passed
O	and
O	these
O	were
O	scorched
O	with
O	heat
O	The
O	Serpent
O	which
O	torpid
O	chilly
O	and
O	harmless
O	lies
O	coiled
O	round
O	the
O	North
O	Pole
O	felt
O	a
O	warmth
O	that
O	made
O	it
O	grow
O	fierce
O	and
O	harmful
O	again
O	Downward
O	ever
O	downward
O	galloped
O	the
O	maddened
O	horses
O	and
O	soon
C	Phaeton
O	saw
O	the
O	sea
O	as
O	a
O	shield
O	of
O	molten
O	brass
O	and
O	the
O	earth
O	so
O	near
O	that
O	all
O	things
O	on
O	it
O	were
O	visible
O	When
O	they
O	passed
O	the
O	Scorpion
O	and
O	only
O	just
O	missed
O	destruction
O	from
O	its
O	menacing
O	fangs
O	fear
O	entered
O	into
O	the
O	boy
O	s
O	heart
O	His
O	mother
O	had
O	spoken
O	truth
O	He
O	was
O	only
O	partly
O	a

O	upon

O	a

O	a

O	who
O	presided
O	at

O	assured

O	that

O	would
O	never

O	At
O	this
O	the

O	was
O	a
O	little
O	comforted
O	and
O	became
O	still
O	more
O	so
O	when
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	speak
O	the
O	infant
O	began
O	to
O	say
O	such
O	pretty
O	and
O	clever
O	things
O	that
O	everybody
O	was
O	charmed
O	with
O	him
O	I
O	forgot
O	to
O	mention
O	that
O	his
O	name
O	was
C	Riquet
O	with
O	the
O	Tuft
O	because
O	he
O	was

O	tuft
O	of
O	hair
O	on
O	the

O	of

O	head
O	Seven
O	or
O	eight
O	years
O	after
O	this
O	the
C	queen
O	of
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	country
O	had
O	two
O	little
O	daughters
O	twins
O	at
O	whose
O	birth
O	the
O	same
C	fairy
O	presided
O	The
O	elder
O	twin
O	was
O	more
O	beautiful
O	than
O	the
O	day
O	the
O	younger
O	so
O	extremely
O	ugly
O	that
O	the
O	mother
O	s
O	extravagant
O	joy
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	was
O	all
O	turned
O	to

O	about
O	the
O	second
O	So
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	calm
O	her
O	feelings
O	the
C	fairy
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	the
O	one
O	daughter
O	should
O	be
O	as
O	stupid
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	pretty
O	while
O	the
O	other
O	would
O	grow
O	up
O	so
O	clever
O	and
O	charming
O	that
O	nobody
O	would
O	miss
O	her
O	want
O	of

O	Heaven
O	grant
O	it
O	sighed
O	the
C	queen
O	but
O	are
O	there
O	no
O	means
O	of
O	giving
O	a
O	little
O	sense
O	to
O	the
O	one
O	who
O	is
O	so
O	beautiful
O	I
O	can
O	do
O	nothing
O	for
O	her
O	madam
O	returned
O	the
C	fairy
O	nothing
O	as
O	regards
O	her
O	own
O	fortunes
O	but
O	I
O	grant
O	her
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	making
O	the
O	person
O	who
O	best
O	pleases
O	her
O	as
O	handsome
O	as

O	Accordingly

O	the
O	young
C	princesses
O	grew
O	up
O	their

O	grew
O	with

O	spoken
O	of

O	beauty
O	of
O	the
O	elder
O	and
O	the
O	wit
O	of
O	the
O	younger
O	True
O	their
O	faults
O	increased
O	equally
O	the
O	one
O	became
O	uglier
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	more
O	stupid
O	day
O	by
O	day
O	Unlucky
O	fair
O	one
O	she
O	never
O	had
O	a

O	to

O	or
O	else
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	silliest
O	word
O	imaginable
O	and

O	was
O	so
O	awkward
O	that

O	in

O	the

O	was
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	off
O	so
O	long
O	that
O	it

O	as
O	if
O	it

O	not
O	come
O	at
O	all
O	or
O	something
O	might
O	happen

O	such
O	a
O	longing

O	found
O	she
O	could

O	say
O	anything
O	she
O	chose
O	and
O	say
O	it
O	in

O	way
O	She
O	began
O	a
O	lively
O	conversation
O	with
C	Prince
C	Riquet
O	and
O	chattered
O	so
O	fast
O	and
O	so
O	wittily
O	that
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	be
O	afraid
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	so
O	much
O	cleverness

O	uttered
O	now
O	charmed

O	pleasantness

O	exceeding
O	good
O	sense
O	The
O	king

O	began
O	to

O	advice
O	in

C	princess
O	who
O	was
O	as
O	clever

O	she
O	was
O	beautiful
O	but
O	she
O	found
O	none
O	to
O	suit
O	her
O	probably
O	because
O	the
O	more

O	or
O	the

O	was

O	not

O	This
O	master
O	was

O	thus
O	I

C	Thomas
O	was
O	so

C	Mother

O	When
O	I
O	was
O	a

O	rejoined
O	the

O	my

C	Mother
C	Thomas
O	who
O	was
O	rather
O	inclined
O	to

O	made
O	the

O	to
O	the
O	cottage
O	and
O	seeing
O	them
O	so
O	united
O	and
O	industrious
O	encouraged
O	the
O	trade
O	of
O	the
O	wooden
O	shoes
O	which
O	increased
O	their
O	comforts
O	without

O	A
O	flock
O	of

O	they
O	devoured
O	either
O	helpless

O	with
O	a

O	had
O	been
O	broken
O	into
O	during
O	the

O	How
O	lucky
O	that
O	we
O	did

O	They
O	approached

O	richly
O	dressed
O	wearing
O	on
O	her
O	head
O	a
O	cluster

O	which
O	shone
O	like
O	a
O	star
O	She
O	appeared
O	very
O	young
O	and
O	was
O	trembling
O	with
O	cold
O	Much
O	rain
O	had
O	fallen
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	and

O	The

O	had
O	a

O	round
O	his
O	body
O	and

O	and
O	now
O	the

O	were
O	instantly
O	turned
O	into
O	three

O	of
O	the
O	lady
O	who
O	slowly
O	returned
O	to

O	My

O	bowed
O	down
O	to

O	only
O	requested
O	the

O	to

O	what
O	you
O	have
O	all
O	resolved
O	on
O	during
O	the
O	night
C	Mother
C	Thomas
O	was
O	very
O	uneasy
O	in
O	thinking
O	how
O	she
O	could
O	accommodate
O	the
C	fairy
O	for
O	neither
O	her
O	children
O	s
O	beds
O	nor
O	her
O	own
O	were
O	worthy
O	of
O	offering
O	to
O	such
O	a
O	grand
O	lady
O	but
C	Coquette
O	desired
O	her
O	to
O	feel
O	at
O	ease
O	as
O	she
O	would
O	provide
O	everything
O	needful
O	She
O	then
O	drew
O	forth
O	some
O	grains
O	of
O	sand
O	which
O	she
O	scattered
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	Instantly
O	there
O	arose
O	on
O	the
O	spot
O	a
O	bed
O	of
O	three
O	feet
O	high
O	the
O	bolster
O	was
O	of
O	violets
O	heartsease
O	and
O	orange
O	flowers
O	all
O	breathing
O	delicious
O	perfumes
O	and
O	the
O	counterpane
O	entirely
O	composed
O	of
O	butterflies
O	wings
O	exhibited
O	colours
O	so
O	brilliant
O	and
O	varied
O	that
O	one
O	could
O	never
O	be
O	weary
O	of
O	examining
O	it
O	The
O	three
O	lambs
O	which
O	had
O	followed
O	the
C	fairy
O	lay
O	down
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	room
O	was
O	rather
O	damp
O	they
O	gently
O	warmed
O	it
O	with
O	their
O	breath
O	with
O	a
O	care
O	and
O	intelligence
O	almost
O	human
O	The
O	woodcutter
O	and
O	his
O	sons
O	felt
O	so
O	surprised
O	at
O	all
O	these
O	wonders
O	that
O	they
O	imagined
O	themselves
O	dreaming
C	Coquette
O	warned
C	Mother
C	Thomas
O	that
O	if
O	she
O	should
O	speak
O	once
O	to
O	her
O	husband
O	before
O	she
O	again
O	saw
O	her
O	the
O	wishes
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	realized
O	The
O	strictest
O	injunctions
O	were
O	indeed
O	necessary
O	to
O	prevent
O	their
O	communicating
O	on
O	a
O	subject
O	which
O	interested
O	both
O	so
O	deeply
O	When
O	day
O	appeared
C	Coquette
O	summoned
O	them
O	to
O	her
O	presence
O	The
O	woodcutter
O	first
O	came
O	and
O	said
O	with
O	his
O	usual
O	simplicity
O	that
O	he
O	never
O	could
O	have
O	believed
O	it
O	so
O	difficult
O	to
O	form
O	a
O	wish
O	Till
O	that
O	moment
O	he
O	had
O	considered
O	himself
O	happy
O	but
O	now
O	finding
O	it
O	possible
O	to
O	obtain
O	one
O	thing
O	he
O	desired
O	a
O	thousand
O	Wearied
O	with
O	the
O	fatigue
O	of
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	fallen
O	asleep
O	without
O	coming
O	to
O	a
O	determination
O	but
O	seeing
O	in
O	his
O	dreams
O	five
O	purses
O	filled
O	with
O	gold
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	one
O	were
O	for
O	him
O	one
O	for
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	one
O	for
O	each
O	of
O	his
O	children
O	Well
O	said
O	the
C	Coquette
O	these
O	purses
O	are
O	apparently
O	your
O	desire
O	go
O	then
O	to
O	the
O	bin
O	where
O	you
O	deposit
O	your
O	bread
O	and
O	you
O	will
O	find
O	them
O	Only
O	say
O	how
O	many
O	pounds
O	you
O	wish
O	them
O	to
O	contain
O	Oh
O	if
O	there
O	were
O	but
O	a
O	hundred
O	pounds
O	in
O	each
O	replied
C	Thomas
O	that
O	would
O	be
O	sufficient
O	to
O	extend
O	our
O	little
O	commerce
O	and
O	send
O	our
O	wooden
O	shoes
O	to
O	China
O	itself
O	Your
O	wish
O	is
O	accomplished
O	said
O	the
C	fairy
O	go
O	away
O	and
O	permit
O	your
O	wife
O	to
O	come
O	in
O	her
O	turn
O	The
O	good
O	dame
O	had
O	also
O	passed
O	a
O	sleepless
O	night
O	and
O	had
O	never
O	before
O	been
O	so
O	much
O	agitated
O	or
O	so
O	unhappy
O	sometimes
O	she
O	wished
O	for
O	riches
O	and
O	then
O	thought
O	riches
O	would
O	not
O	prevent
O	her
O	from
O	dying
O	so
O	she
O	had
O	better
O	wish
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	live
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	Now
O	one
O	idea
O	filled
O	her
O	mind
O	now
O	another
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	the
C	fairy
O	should
O	have
O	given
O	her
O	at
O	least
O	a
O	month
O	to
O	deliberate
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	suddenly
O	said
C	Madam
C	fairy
O	I
O	am
O	very
O	old
O	and
O	what
O	I
O	desire
O	most
O	is
O	a
C	daughter
O	to
O	assist
O	me
O	in
O	household
O	management
O	and
O	to
O	keep
O	me
O	company
O	my
O	husband
O	almost
O	lives
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	and
O	leaves
O	me
O	at
O	break
O	of
O	day
O	my
O	sons
O	also
O	go
O	about
O	their
O	business
O	we
O	are
O	without
O	neighbours
O	and
O	I
O	have
O	nobody
O	to
O	speak
O	to
O	Be
O	it
O	so
O	said
O	the
C	fairy
O	you
O	shall
O	have
O	the
O	prettiest
C	daughter
O	imaginable
O	and
O	she
O	shall
O	speak
O	from
O	her
O	birth
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	no
O	time
O	may
O	be
O	lost
O	Call
O	your
O	husband
O	and
O	sons
O	I
O	hope
O	to
O	find
O	all
O	parties
O	content
O	The
O	little
O	family
O	assembled
O	but
O	harmony
O	was
O	not
O	the
O	result
O	of
O	their
O	communications
O	The
O	young
O	men
O	thought
O	their
O	father
O	s
O	wish
O	quite
O	pitiful
O	and
O	the
O	woodcutter
O	by
O	no
O	means
O	relished
O	the
O	idea
O	of
O	another
O	child
O	The
C	fairy
O	however
O	provided
O	an
O	excellent
O	breakfast
O	and
O	the
O	wine
O	reanimated
O	his
O	spirits
O	Now
O	I
O	promise
O	said
C	Coquette
O	that
O	you
O	shall
O	have
O	a
C	daughter
O	who
O	at
O	the
O	moment
O	of
O	her
O	birth
O	will
O	be
O	endowed
O	with
O	the
O	figure
O	and
O	the
O	intelligence
O	of
O	twelve
O	years
O	old
O	Call
O	her
C	Rose
O	for
O	her
O	complexion
O	shall
O	shame
O	the
O	flower
O	which
O	bears
O	that
O	name
O	And
O	pronounce
O	that
O	she
O	shall
O	also
O	be
O	as
O	black
O	as
O	ebony
O	and
O	become
O	before
O	the
O	age
O	of
O	fifteen
O	the
O	wife
O	of
O	a
O	great
C	king
O	said
O	a
O	very
O	strong
O	voice
O	in
O	clear
O	and
O	distinct
O	accents
O	accompanied
O	by
O	shouts
O	of
O	laughter
O	which
O	evidently
O	proceeded
O	from
O	a
O	great
O	pitcher
O	placed
O	at
O	the
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	chimney
O	The
C	Fairy
C	Coquette
O	turned
O	pale
O	and
O	consternation
O	was
O	general
O	but
O	the
O	woodcutter
O	now
O	merry
O	with
O	wine
O	joined
O	in
O	the
O	laugh
O	Ah
O	how
O	droll
O	said
O	he
O	red
O	and
O	black
O	roses
O	A
O	likely
O	story
O	indeed
O	that
O	a
O	great
C	king
O	would
O	come
O	to
O	a
O	woodcutter
O	s
C	daughter
O	Only
O	a
O	pitcher
O	could
O	invent
O	such
O	nonsense
O	and
O	I
O	shall
O	teach
O	it
O	to
O	utter
O	no
O	more
O	Thus
O	saying
O	he
O	gave
O	the
O	pitcher
O	a
O	great
O	kick
O	and
O	broke
O	it
O	in
O	pieces
O	when
O	there
O	issued
O	from
O	it
O	a
O	smoke
O	thick
O	and
O	black
O	and
O	so
O	stifling
O	that
C	Coquette
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	use
O	two
O	bottles
O	of
O	essence
O	to
O	dissipate
O	its
O	noxious
O	effects
O	Ah
O	cruel
O	Barabapatapouf
O	cried
O	she
O	must
O	your
O	malignity
O	then
O	extend
O	even
O	to
O	those
O	whom
O	I
O	wish
O	to
O	benefit
O	I
O	indeed
O	recognise
O	my
O	enemy
O	said
O	she
O	to
O	the
O	woodcutter
O	beware
O	of
O	him
O	and
O	believe
O	that
O	it
O	is
O	with
O	no
O	good
O	intention
O	he
O	destines
O	your
C	daughter
O	for
O	the
O	bride
O	of
O	a
C	king
O	Some
O	mystery
O	is
O	here
O	concealed
O	foreboding
O	evil
O	Every
O	one
O	was
O	rendered
O	quite
O	melancholy
O	by
O	this
O	adventure
O	and
C	Coquette
O	beginning
O	to
O	weary
O	of
O	these
O	poor
O	foresters
O	opened
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	disappeared
O	A
O	great
O	quarrel
O	then
O	arose
O	between
O	the
O	woodcutter
O	and
O	his
O	sons
O	who
O	forgetting
O	that
O	respect
O	in
O	which

O	had
O	never

O	them
O	all
O	happy
O	We

O	from

O	the

O	of
O	a

O	of
O	twelve

O	forming
O	a
O	complete

O	with

O	appeared
O	a
O	little
O	smart
O	petticoat

O	fashion
O	Her

O	but
O	both
O	the

O	so

O	that
O	any

O	in

O	might
O	have
O	been
O	proud
O	to

O	Her

O	so
O	much
O	intelligence
O	that

O	by
O	instinct
O	that
O	her
O	birth
O	was
O	displeasing
O	to

O	sought
O	to

C	Mother

O	soon
O	rose
O	likewise

O	But
O	what
O	was
O	her
O	horror
O	on
O	beholding
O	her
C	daughter
O	s
O	face
O	black
O	as
O	ebony
O	her
O	hair
O	woolly
O	and
O	crisped
O	like
O	a
O	negro
O	s
O	As
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	mirror
O	in
O	the
O	cottage
C	Rose
O	could
O	not
O	understand
O	what
O	had
O	so
O	alarmed
O	her
C	Mother
O	she
O	asked
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	involuntarily
O	had
O	the
O	misfortune
O	to
O	give
O	offence
O	No
O	no
O	said
O	the
O	old
O	dame
O	weeping
O	shouldst
O	thou
O	remain
O	all
O	thy
O	life
O	as
O	black
O	as
O	ink
O	I
O	shall
O	not
O	love
O	thee
O	less
O	but
O	I
O	cannot
O	without
O	pain
O	recall
O	thy
O	beauties
O	of
O	yesterday
O	Thou
O	wilt
O	be
O	laughed
O	at
O	and
O	us
O	too
O	Still
O	we
O	will
O	keep
O	thee
O	thou
O	must
O	never
O	leave
O	us
C	Rose
O	readily
O	promised
O	she
O	never
O	would
O	But
O	when
O	her
O	brothers
O	returned
O	they
O	considered
O	the
O	change
O	in
O	her
O	quite
O	as
O	a
O	matter
O	of
O	course
O	They
O	recollected
O	the
O	prediction
O	of
O	the
O	pitcher
O	and
O	seemed
O	quite
O	delighted
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	since
O	it
O	was
O	fulfilled
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	instance
O	they
O	might
O	yet
O	become
O	the
O	brothers
O	of
O	a
C	queen
O	Meanwhile
O	they
O	lived
O	on
O	better
O	terms
O	with
C	Rose
O	hoping
O	that
O	one
O	day
O	she
O	might
O	be
O	of
O	service
O	to
O	them
O	Far
O	from
O	listening
O	to
O	the
O	counsels
O	of
O	their
O	father
O	they
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	awaken
O	in
O	her
O	mind
O	the
O	seeds
O	of
O	ambition
O	and
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	further
O	views
O	interested
O	and
O	selfish
O	flattered
O	her
O	beauty
O	her
O	talents
O	and
O	her
O	sense
O	rendering
O	the
O	future
C	queen
O	the
O	most
O	respectful
O	homage
O	which
O	diverted
O	her
O	exceedingly
O	But
O	strange
O	to
O	say
C	Rose
O	was
O	not
O	always
O	black
O	every
O	second
O	day
O	she
O	recovered
O	her
O	natural
O	beauty
O	from
O	whence
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	concluded
O	that

O	influence
O	of
O	the
C	fairy
O	and
O	the
C	Enchanter
C	Barabapatapouf
O	operated
O	alternately
O	The
O	woodcutter
O	s
O	family
O	grew
O	gradually
O	accustomed
O	to
O	these
O	successions
O	and
O	as
O	habit

O	people
O	to
O	all
O	things
O	each
O	colour
O	became
O	indifferent
O	to
O	them
C	Thomas
O	was
O	too
O	old
O	to
O	change
O	his
O	mode
O	of
O	life
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	hear
O	of
O	going
O	to
O	live
O	in
O	town
O	although
O	they
O	had
O	money
O	sufficient
O	for
O	that
O	purpose
O	he
O	also
O	still
O	continued
O	the
O	making
O	of
O	wooden
O	shoes
O	Those
O	which
C	Rose
O	wore
O	in
O	winter
O	were
O	trimmed
O	with
O	lamb
O	which
O	she
O	wrought
O	very
O	dexterously
O	she
O	was
O	clever
O	and
O	ingenious
O	but
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	confessed
O	a
O	little
O	imperious
O	and
O	was
O	sometimes
O	surprised
O	sighing
O	like
O	a
O	person
O	indulging
O	in
O	visionary
O	wishes
O	and
O	languishing
O	under
O	some
O	secret
O	chagrin
O	A
O	year
O	passed
C	Rose
O	grew
O	tall
O	and
O	her
O	brothers
O	weary
O	of
O	waiting
O	for
O	an
O	event
O	so
O	uncertain
O	as
O	her
O	marriage
O	with
O	a
C	king
O	executed
O	a
O	crime
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	long
O	meditated
O	Seeing
O	that
O	their
O	father
O	had
O	touched
O	but
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	purses
O	they
O	easily
O	obtained
O	possession
O	of
O	the
O	rest
O	and
O	rising
O	with
O	the
O	dawn
O	all
O	three
O	departed
O	saying
O	to
O	satisfy
O	their
O	consciences
O	that
O	these
O	purses
O	must
O	be
O	finally
O	theirs
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	meanwhile
O	turn
O	them
O	to
O	advantage
O	When
O	they
O	should
O	become
O	very
O	rich
O	they
O	would
O	come
O	back
O	to
O	their
O	parents
O	and
O	take
O	care
O	of
O	their
O	latter
O	days
O	Each
O	of
O	them
O	made
O	a
O	belt
O	in

O	concealed
O	his
O	gold
O	and
O	with
O	perfect
O	concord
O	more
O	frequently
O	found
O	amongst

O	than
O	honest
O	men
O	they
O	travelled
O	a
O	hundred
O	leagues
O	in
O	eight
O	days
O	The
O	woodcutter
O	and
O	his

O	did
O	not
O	at
O	first
O	comprehend
O	the
O	extent
O	of
O	their
O	misfortune
O	They
O	thought
O	their
O	children
O	must
O	have
O	gone
O	astray
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	wandered
O	everywhere
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	them
O	But
O	when
O	he
O	observed
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	the
O	purses
O	the
O	truth
O	was
O	revealed
O	and
O	he
O	felt

O	he
O	thou

O	brave
O	and

O	boys
O	they
O	were
O	poor
O	but
O	virtuous
O	they
O	are
O	now

O	and
O	will
O	meet
O	punishment
O	from
O	either
O	man
O	or
O	God
O	Thus
O	saying
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	remaining

O	it
O	into
O	the

O	so
O	much
O	irritated
O	and
O	troubled
O	that

O	her
O	When
O	his
O	reason
O	cleared
O	a
O	little
O	however
O	he
O	felt

O	had
O	committed
O	an
O	error
O	in
O	parting
O	with
O	his

O	sold
O	some

O	But
O	poverty
O	was

O	was
O	the

O	sting
O	How

O	this
O	then
O	augmented
O	when
O	some

O	and
O	announced
O	that

O	or
O	a

O	replied
C	Rose
O	I
O	am
O	the
C	daughter
O	of
O	a
O	poor
O	woodcutter
O	who
O	lives
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	it
O	is
O	late
O	and
O	I
O	beg
O	you
O	will
O	not
O	detain
O	me
O	You
O	are
O	a
O	wayward
O	beauty
O	indeed
O	replied
O	the
C	prince
O	for
O	so
O	he
O	was
O	but
O	as
O	my
O	way
O	lies
O	in
O	that
O	direction
O	I
O	hope
O	you
O	will
O	permit
O	me
O	to
O	see
O	you
O	home
O	It
O	is
O	not
O	in
O	my
O	power
O	to
O	prevent
O	you
O	said
C	Rose
O	without
O	raising
O	her
O	eyes
O	The
C	prince
O	at
O	this
O	moment
O	remarked
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	weeping
O	and
O	delighted
O	to
O	have
O	an
O	opportunity
O	of
O	offering
O	sympathy
O	and
O	consolation
O	entreated
O	her
O	to
O	impart
O	her
O	grief
O	to
O	him
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	actuated
O	by
O	mere
O	curiosity
O	added
O	he
O	I
O	never
O	can
O	behold
O	a
O	woman
O	in
O	tears
O	without
O	feeling
O	moved
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	my
O	soul
O	Tell
O	me
O	your
O	distress
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	neither
O	sleep
O	nor
O	eat
O	till
O	I
O	have
O	aided
O	you
C	Rose
O	timidly
O	raised
O	her
O	lovely
O	blue
O	eyes
O	to
O	see
O	whether
O	the
O	countenance
O	of
O	the
C	prince
O	harmonised
O	with
O	his
O	discourse
O	but
O	although
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	actually
O	ugly
O	his
O	features
O	wore
O	an
O	expression
O	too
O	stern
O	and
O	hypocritical
O	to
O	invite
O	her
O	confidence
O	She
O	therefore
O	walked
O	silently
O	forward
O	and
O	when
O	near
O	the
O	cottage
O	felt
O	so
O	uneasy
O	that
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	she
O	invented
O	a
O	lie
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	get
O	rid
O	of
O	him
O	You
O	seem
O	to
O	compassionate
O	my
O	sorrows
O	said
O	she
O	meanwhile
O	you
O	only
O	increase
O	them
O	When
O	my
C	Mother
O	sees
O	me
O	accompanied
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	gentleman
O	like
O	you
O	she
O	will
O	beat
O	me
O	and
O	not
O	believe
O	that
O	you
O	have
O	followed
O	me
O	against
O	my
O	will
O	This
O	reasoning
O	appeared
O	so
O	just
O	to
O	the
C	prince
O	who
O	felt
O	himself
O	affected
O	by
O	a
O	passion
O	such
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	before
O	experienced
O	that
O	he
O	consented
O	to
O	retire
O	entreating
C	Rose
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	the
O	next
O	evening
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	hour
O	She
O	refused
O	to
O	give
O	a
O	decisive
O	answer
O	and
O	returned
O	home
O	much
O	dejected
O	recalling
O	all
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	the
O	stranger
O	and
O	almost
O	reproaching
O	herself
O	for
O	having
O	behaved
O	so
O	harshly
O	to
O	him
O	The
O	following
O	day
C	Rose
O	took
O	mechanically
O	the
O	same
O	route
O	going
O	always
O	in
O	the
O	path
O	by
O	which
O	her
O	parents
O	might
O	be
O	expected
O	Her
O	provisions
O	being
O	nearly
O	exhausted
O	she
O	feared
O	to
O	die
O	of
O	hunger
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	this
O	gentleman
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	repulsed
O	so
O	rudely
O	could
O	perhaps
O	obtain
O	news
O	of
O	her
O	family
O	Suddenly
O	beholding
O	him
O	leaning
O	against
O	a
O	tree
O	looking
O	very
O	melancholy
O	and
O	dejected
O	she
O	threw
O	herself
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	bathed
O	in
O	tears
O	and
O	Sir
O	a
O	wretch
O	who
O	has
O	lost
O	everything
O	dear
O	supplicates
O	your
O	compassion
O	You
O	are
O	so
O	kind
O	so
O	What
O	does
O	the
O	vile
O	creature
O	want
O	exclaimed
O	the
C	prince
O	with
O	a
O	savage
O	expression
O	How
O	dare
O	you
O	have
O	the
O	impertinence
O	to
O	address
O	me
O	I
O	wonder
O	what
O	prevents
O	me
O	from
O	shooting
O	you
O	I
O	lost
O	my
O	sport
O	all
O	yesterday
O	in
O	following
O	a
O	pretty
O	girl
O	here
O	is
O	game
O	of
O	a
O	new
O	description
C	Rose
O	started
O	up
O	overwhelmed
O	with
O	terror
O	while
O	the
C	prince
O	laughed
O	most
O	brutally
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	till
O	that
O	moment
O	she
O	recollected
O	that
O	this
O	her
O	black
O	day
O	which
O	accounted
O	for
O	his
O	not
O	recognising
O	her
O	Ah
O	thought
O	she
O	this
O	is
O	the
O	humane
O	man
O	who
O	could
O	not
O	behold
O	a
O	woman
O	weep
O	because
O	my
O	colour
O	displeases
O	him
O	he
O	is
O	ready
O	to
O	take
O	my
O	life
O	No
O	hope
O	now
O	remains
O	for
O	me
O	my
O	misfortunes
O	are
O	at
O	their
O	height
C	Rose
O	wept
O	all
O	night
O	yet
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	prevent
O	herself
O	from
O	returning
O	to
O	the
O	same
O	spot
O	on
O	the
O	following
O	day
O	she
O	felt
O	irresistibly
O	led
O	thither
O	dreading
O	and
O	yet
O	wishing
O	to
O	meet
O	the
C	prince
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	already
O	waiting
O	above
O	an
O	hour
O	and
O	accosted
O	her
O	with
O	a
O	degree
O	of
O	respect
O	quite
O	unusual
O	for
O	him
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	love
O	and
O	love
O	makes
O	the
O	worst
O	of
O	people
O	better
O	for
O	the
O	time
O	Cruel
O	beauty
O	said
O	he
O	in
O	a
O	style
O	to
O	which
C	Rose
O	was
O	little
O	accustomed
O	what
O	have
O	I
O	not
O	suffered
O	during
O	your
O	absence
O	I
O	even
O	remained
O	all
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	in
O	expectation
O	of
O	you
O	and
O	the
C	queen
O	my
C	Mother
O	despatched
O	messengers
O	everywhere
O	fearing
O	some
O	accident
O	had
O	befallen
O	me
O	The
C	queen
O	your
C	Mother
O	exclaimed
C	Rose
O	Are
O	you
O	then
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	a
C	queen
O	I
O	have
O	betrayed
O	myself
O	said
O	the
C	prince
O	striking
O	his
O	forehead
O	in
O	a
O	theatrical
O	manner
O	Yes
O	it
O	is
O	true
O	I
O	have
O	that
O	misfortune
O	You
O	will
O	now
O	fear
O	me
O	and
O	what
O	we
O	fear
O	we
O	never
O	love
O	The
O	wicked
O	alone
O	are
O	to
O	be
O	feared
O	answered
C	Rose
O	I
O	am
O	very
O	glad
O	to
O	hear
O	that
O	you
O	are
O	a
C	king
O	for
O	I
O	know
O	that
O	you
O	will
O	be
O	my
O	husband
O	The
C	prince
O	who
O	little
O	guessed
O	the
O	enchanter
O	s
O	communication
O	was
O	confounded
O	by
O	the
O	unembarrassed
O	freedom
O	of
O	her
O	manner
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	far
O	from
O	displeasing
O	to
O	him
O	You
O	are
O	ambitious
O	said
O	he
O	smiling
O	but
O	there
O	is
O	nothing
O	to
O	which
O	beauty
O	may
O	not
O	pretend
O	Tell
O	me
O	only
O	how
O	I
O	can
O	have
O	the
O	happiness
O	of
O	serving
O	you
O	and
O	you
O	shall
O	see
O	that
O	everything
O	is
O	possible
O	to
O	love
C	Rose
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	grass
O	and
O	related
O	in
O	very
O	simple
O	terms
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	the
O	purse
O	confessed
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	deceived
O	him
O	and
O	that
O	so
O	far
O	from
O	being
O	severely
O	treated
O	at
O	home
O	she
O	was
O	now
O	weeping
O	her
C	Mother
O	s
O	loss
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	must
O	take
O	measures
O	for
O	the
O	discovery
O	and
O	liberation
O	of
O	her
O	family
O	before
O	he
O	could
O	hope
O	to
O	win
O	her
O	affections
O	or
O	pretend
O	to
O	her
O	hand
O	The
O	enamoured
O	monarch
O	vowed
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	lose
O	a
O	moment
O	and
O	although
O	she
O	behaved
O	with
O	much
O	dignity
O	her
O	every
O	word
O	and
O	look
O	was
O	adorable
O	in
O	his
O	eyes
C	Rose
O	thought
O	all
O	night
O	of
O	the
O	fine
O	fortune
O	of
O	being
O	a
C	queen
O	she
O	would
O	then
O	no
O	longer
O	wear
O	wooden
O	shoes
O	and
O	above
O	all
O	might
O	have
O	an
O	opportunity
O	of
O	being
O	useful
O	to
O	her
O	dear
O	parents
O	These
O	meetings
O	continued
O	every
O	alternate
O	day
O	during
O	a
O	week
O	and
O	the
C	queen
O	dowager
O	was
O	informed
O	that
O	her
O	son
O	neglected
O	all
O	business
O	and
O	thought
O	of
O	nothing
O	but
O	making
O	love
O	She
O	was
O	in
O	despair
O	This
C	prince
O	was
O	surnamed
O	the
C	Terrible
O	by
O	reason
O	of
O	his
O	ferocity
O	to
O	women
O	till
O	that
O	moment
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	loved
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	frequently
O	made
O	pretence
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	when
O	successful
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	unusual
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	cut
O	out
O	the
O	poor
O	ladies
O	tongues
O	put
O	out
O	their
O	eyes
O	or
O	even
O	throw
O	them
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	The
O	least
O	pretext
O	sufficed
O	for
O	this
O	and
O	the
C	queen
O	who
O	was
O	of
O	a
O	kind
O	disposition
O	lamented
O	that
O	yet
O	another
O	victim
O	was
O	preparing
O	The
O	courtiers
O	begged
O	her
O	to
O	be
O	tranquil
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	nothing
O	more
O	than
O	the
C	daughter
O	of
O	a
O	poor
O	woodcutter
O	whom
O	his
O	majesty
O	now
O	admired
O	and
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	kill
O	her
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	of
O	little
O	consequence
O	But
O	the
O	courtiers
O	and
O	the
C	queen
O	dowager
O	herself
O	were
O	altogether
O	bewildered
O	when
O	the
C	king
O	having
O	liberated
O	the
O	woodcutter
O	and
O	his
O	family
O	brought
C	Rose
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	as
O	his
O	wife
O	She
O	was
O	not
O	at
O	all
O	abashed
O	or
O	out
O	of
O	countenance
O	she
O	behaved
O	with
O	the
O	utmost
O	respect
O	to
O	the
C	queen
O	and
O	with
O	affability
O	to
O	all
O	It
O	was
O	universally
O	remarked
O	The
C	king
O	has
O	committed
O	a
O	folly
O	but
O	that
O	charming
O	girl
O	is
O	his
O	excuse
O	and
O	no
O	man
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	wiser
O	under
O	similar
O	circumstances
O	A
O	grand
O	ball
O	was
O	given
O	in
O	the
O	evening
C	Rose
O	danced
O	well
O	enough
O	for
O	a
C	queen
O	and
O	she
O	yielded
O	herself
O	up
O	entirely
O	to
O	the
O	enchantment
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	happy
O	day
O	The
C	prince
O	ever
O	eager
O	to
O	be
O	near
O	her
O	was
O	figuring
O	away
O	in
O	a
O	quadrille
O	when
O	twelve
O	o
O	clock
O	struck
O	great
O	then
O	was
O	his
O	astonishment
O	while
O	gazing
O	passionately
O	on
O	his
O	partner
O	he
O	beheld
O	a
O	negress
O	What
O	metamorphosis
O	is
O	this
O	cried
O	he
O	rudely
O	seizing
O	her
O	arm
O	where
O	is
O	the

O	I

C	Rose
O	bent
O	her

O	in
O	confusion

O	and
O	her

O	Wretched
O	hideous

O	cried
O	the
C	king
O	none
O	shall

O	me
O	with
O	impunity
O	He
O	then
O	drew
O	a
O	poniard
O	and
O	was
O	preparing
O	to
O	take
O	instant
O	vengeance
O	when
O	recollecting
O	I
O	do
O	thee
O	too

O	cut
O	thee
O	in
O	pieces
O	to

O	a

O	they
O	were
O	the
O	male
O	and
O	female
O	parents
O	of
O	the
O	roc
O	and
O	pressed
O	us
O	to
O	embark
O	with
O	all
O	speed
O	to
O	prevent
O	the
O	misfortune
O	which
O	he
O	saw
O	would
O	otherwise
O	befall
O	us
O	The
O	two
O	rocs
O	approached
O	with
O	a
O	frightful
O	noise
O	which
O	they
O	redoubled
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	egg
O	broken
O	and
O	their
O	young
O	one
O	gone
O	They
O	flew
O	back
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	and
O	disappeared
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	while
O	we
O	made
O	all
O	the
O	sail
O	we
O	could
O	to
O	endeavor
O	to
O	prevent
O	that
O	which
O	unhappily
O	befell
O	us
O	They
O	soon
O	returned
O	and
O	we
O	observed
O	that
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	carried
O	between
O	its
O	talons
O	an
O	enormous
O	rock
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	directly
O	over
O	my
O	ship
O	they
O	hovered
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	let
O	go
O	his
O	rock
O	but
O	by
O	the
O	dexterity
O	of
O	the
O	steersman
O	it
O	missed
O	us
O	and
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	The
O	other
O	so
O	exactly
O	hit
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	as
O	to
O	split
O	it
O	into
O	pieces
O	The
O	mariners
O	and
O	passengers
O	were
O	all
O	crushed
O	to
O	death
O	or
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	I
O	myself
O	was
O	of
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	the
O	latter
O	but
O	as
O	I
O	came
O	up
O	again
O	I
O	fortunately
O	caught
O	hold
O	of
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	the
O	wreck
O	and
O	swimming
O	sometimes
O	with
O	one
O	hand
O	and
O	sometimes
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	but
O	always
O	holding
O	fast
O	the
O	plank
O	the
O	wind
O	and
O	the
O	tide
O	favoring
O	me
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	an
O	island
O	and
O	got
O	safely
O	ashore
O	I
O	sat
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	grass
O	to
O	recover
O	myself
O	from
O	my
O	fatigue
O	after
O	which
O	I
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	island
O	to
O	explore
O	it
O	It
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	delicious
O	garden
O	I
O	found
O	trees
O	everywhere
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	bearing
O	green
O	and
O	others
O	ripe
O	fruits
O	and
O	streams
O	of
O	fresh
O	pure
O	water
O	I
O	ate
O	of
O	the
O	fruits
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	excellent
O	and
O	drank
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	which
O	was
O	very
O	light
O	and
O	good
O	When
O	I
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	advanced
O	into
O	the
O	island
O	I
O	saw
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	who
O	appeared
O	very
O	weak
O	and
O	infirm
O	He
O	was
O	sitting
O	on
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	a
O	stream
O	and
O	at
O	first
O	I
O	took
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	one
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	shipwrecked
O	like
O	myself
O	I
O	went
O	toward
O	him
O	and
O	saluted
O	him
O	but
O	he
O	only
O	slightly
O	bowed
O	his
O	head
O	I
O	asked
O	him
O	why
O	he
O	sat
O	so
O	still
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	answering
O	me
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	upon
O	my
O	back
O	and
O	carry
O	him
O	over
O	the
O	brook
O	I
O	believed
O	him
O	really
O	to
O	stand
O	in
O	need
O	of
O	my
O	assistance
O	took
O	him
O	upon
O	my
O	back
O	and
O	having
O	carried
O	him
O	over
O	bade
O	him
O	get
O	down
O	and
O	for
O	that
O	end
O	stooped
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	get
O	off
O	with
O	ease
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	doing
O	so
O	which
O	I
O	laugh
O	at
O	every
O	time
O	I
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	who
O	to
O	me
O	appeared
O	quite
O	decrepit
O	threw
O	his
O	legs
O	nimbly
O	about
O	my
O	neck
O	He
O	sat
O	astride
O	upon
O	my
O	shoulders
O	and
O	held
O	my
O	throat
O	so
O	tight
O	that
O	I
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	strangled
O	me
O	and
O	I
O	fainted
O	away
O	Notwithstanding
O	my
O	fainting
O	the
O	old
O	fellow
O	still
O	kept
O	his
O	seat
O	upon
O	my
O	neck
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	recovered
O	my
O	breath
O	he
O	thrust
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	feet
O	against
O	my
O	side
O	and
O	struck
O	me
O	so
O	rudely
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	that
O	he
O	forced
O	me
O	to
O	rise
O	up
O	against
O	my
O	will
O	Having
O	arisen
O	he
O	made
O	me
O	carry
O	him
O	under
O	the
O	trees
O	and
O	forced
O	me
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	stop
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	gather
O	and
O	eat
O	fruit
O	He
O	never
O	left
O	his
O	seat
O	all
O	day
O	and
O	when
O	I
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	rest
O	at
O	night
O	he
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	with
O	me
O	holding
O	still
O	fast
O	about
O	my
O	neck
O	Every
O	morning
O	he
O	pinched
O	me
O	to
O	make
O	me
O	awake
O	and
O	afterward
O	obliged
O	me
O	to
O	get
O	up
O	and
O	walk
O	and
O	spurred
O	me
O	with
O	his
O	feet
O	One
O	day
O	I
O	found
O	several
O	dry
O	calabashes
O	that
O	had
O	fallen
O	from
O	a
O	tree
O	I
O	took
O	a
O	large
O	one
O	and
O	after
O	cleaning
O	it
O	pressed
O	into
O	it
O	some
O	juice
O	of
O	grapes
O	which
O	abounded
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	having
O	filled
O	the
O	calabash
O	I
O	put
O	it
O	by
O	in
O	a
O	convenient
O	place
O	and
O	going
O	thither
O	again
O	some
O	days
O	after
O	I
O	tasted
O	it
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	wine
O	so
O	good
O	that
O	it
O	gave
O	me
O	new
O	vigor
O	and
O	so
O	exhilarated
O	my
O	spirits
O	that
O	I
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	and
O	dance
O	as
O	I
O	carried
O	my
O	burden
O	The
O	old
O	man
O	perceiving
O	the
O	effect
O	which
O	this
O	had
O	upon
O	me
O	and
O	that
O	I
O	carried
O	him
O	with
O	more
O	ease
O	than
O	before
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	sign
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	some
O	of
O	it
O	I
O	handed
O	him
O	the
O	calabash
O	and
O	the
O	liquor
O	pleasing
O	his
O	palate
O	he
O	drank
O	it
O	off
O	There
O	being
O	a
O	considerable
O	quantity
O	of
O	it
O	he
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	and
O	to
O	move
O	about
O	from
O	side
O	to
O	side
O	in
O	his
O	seat
O	upon
O	my
O	shoulders
O	and
O	by
O	degrees
O	to
O	loosen
O	his
O	legs
O	from
O	about
O	me
O	Finding
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	press
O	me
O	as
O	before
O	I
O	threw
O	him
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	without
O	motion
O	I
O	then
O	took
O	up
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	and
O	slew
O	him
O	I
O	was
O	extremely
O	glad
O	to
O	be
O	thus
O	freed
O	for
O	ever
O	from
O	this
O	troublesome
O	fellow
O	I
O	now
O	walked
O	toward
O	the
O	beach
O	where
O	I
O	met
O	the
O	crew
O	of
O	a
O	ship
O	that
O	had
O	cast
O	anchor
O	to
O	take
O	in
O	water
O	they
O	were
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	me
O	but
O	more
O	so
O	at
O	hearing
O	the
O	particulars
O	of
O	my
O	adventures
O	You
O	fell
O	said
O	they
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	Old
O	Man
O	of
O	the
O	Sea
O	and
O	are
O	the
O	first
O	who
O	ever
O	escaped
O	strangling
O	by
O	his
O	malicious
O	embraces
O	He
O	never
O	quitted
O	those
O	he
O	had
O	once
O	made
O	himself
O	master
O	of
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	destroyed
O	them
O	and
O	he
O	has
O	made
O	this
O	island
O	notorious
O	by
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	men
O	he
O	has
O	slain
O	They
O	carried
O	me
O	with
O	them
O	to
O	the
C	captain
O	who
O	received
O	me
O	with
O	great
O	kindness
O	He
O	put
O	out
O	again
O	to
O	sea
O	and
O	after
O	some
O	days
O	sail
O	we
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	harbor
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	city
O	the
O	houses
O	of
O	which
O	overhung
O	the
O	sea
O	One
O	of
O	the
C	merchants
O	who
O	had
O	taken
O	me
O	into
O	his
O	friendship
O	invited
O	me
O	to
O	go
O	along
O	with
O	him
O	He
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	large
O	sack
O	and
O	having
O	recommended
O	me
O	to
O	some
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	who
O	used
O	to
O	gather
O	cocoanuts
O	desired
O	them
O	to
O	take
O	me
O	with
O	them
O	Go
O	said
O	he
O	follow
O	them
O	and
O	act
O	as
O	you
O	see
O	them
O	do
O	but
O	do
O	not
O	separate
O	from
O	them
O	otherwise
O	you
O	may
O	endanger
O	your
O	life
O	Having
O	thus
O	spoken
O	he
O	gave
O	me
O	provisions
O	for
O	the
O	journey
O	and
O	I
O	went
O	with
O	them
O	We
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	thick
O	forest
O	of
O	cocoa
O	trees
O	very
O	lofty
O	with
O	trunks
O	so
O	smooth
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	possible
O	to
O	climb
O	to
O	the
O	branches
O	that
O	bore
O	the
O	fruit
O	When
O	we
O	entered
O	the
O	forest
O	we
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	apes
O	of
O	several
O	sizes
O	who
O	fled
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	perceived
O	us
O	and
O	climbed
O	to
O	the
O	tops
O	of
O	the
O	trees
O	with
O	amazing
O	swiftness
O	The
C	merchants
O	with
O	whom
O	I
O	was
O	gathered
O	stones
O	and
O	threw
O	them
O	at
O	the
O	apes
O	on
O	the
O	trees
O	I
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	and
O	the
O	apes
O	out
O	of
O	revenge
O	threw
O	coconuts
O	at
O	us
O	so
O	fast
O	and
O	with
O	such
O	gestures
O	as
O	sufficiently
O	testified
O	their
O	anger
O	and
O	resentment
O	We
O	gathered
O	up
O	the
O	cocoanuts
O	and
O	from
O	time
O	to
O	time
O	threw
O	stones
O	to
O	provoke
O	the
O	apes
O	so
O	that
O	by
O	this
O	stratagem
O	we
O	filled
O	our
O	bags
O	with
O	cocoanuts
O	I
O	thus
O	gradually
O	collected
O	as
O	many
O	cocoanuts
O	as
O	produced
O	me
O	a
O	considerable
O	sum
O	Having
O	laden
O	our
O	vessel
O	with
O	cocoanuts
O	we
O	set
O	sail
O	and
O	passed
O	by
O	the
O	islands
O	where
O	pepper
O	grows
O	in
O	great
O	plenty
O	From
O	thence
O	we
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	Isle
O	of
O	Comari
O	where
O	the
O	best
O	species
O	of
O	wood
O	of
O	aloes
O	grows
O	I
O	exchanged
O	my
O	cocoa
O	in
O	those
O	two
O	islands
O	for
O	pepper
O	and
O	wood
O	of
O	aloes
O	and
O	went
O	with
O	other
C	merchants
O	I
O	hired
O	divers
O	who
O	brought
O	me
O	up
O	some
O	that
O	were
O	very
O	large
O	and
O	pure
O	I
O	embarked
O	in
O	a
O	vessel
O	that
O	happily
O	arrived
O	at
O	Bussorah
O	from
O	thence
O	I
O	returned
O	to
O	Bagdad
O	where
O	I
O	realized
O	vast
O	sums
O	from
O	my
O	pepper
O	wood
O	of
O	aloes
O	and
O	pearls
O	I
O	gave
O	the
O	tenth
O	of
O	my
O	gains
O	in
O	alms
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	done
O	upon
O	my
O	return
O	from
O	my
O	other
O	voyages
O	and
O	rested
O	from
O	my
O	fatigues
C	Sindbad
O	here
O	ordered
O	one
O	hundred
O	sequins
O	to
O	be
O	given
O	to
C	Hindbad
O	and
O	requested
O	him
O	and
O	the

O	guests
O	to
O	dine
O	with
O	him
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	to
O	hear
O	the
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	sixth
O	voyage
O	Once
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	village
O	maiden
O	the

O	likewise
O	The
O	old

O	made
O	for

O	a

O	hood
O	which
O	became
O	the
O	damsel
O	so
O	well
O	that
O	ever
O	after
O	she
O	went
O	by
O	the

O	One
O	day
O	when
O	her

C	Little
O	was
O	delighted
O	to
O	go
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	walk
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	child

O	Passing
O	through
O	a

O	was
O	most
O	eager
O	to

O	busy
O	hard
O	by
O	So
O	he
O	only
O	came
O	and
O	asked

O	politely
O	where
O	she
O	was
O	going
O	The
O	poor
O	child
O	who
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	dangerous
O	it
O	is
O	to
O	stop

O	Is
O	it
O	very
O	far
O	from
O	hence
O	asked
O	the

O	Well
O	said
O	the

O	I
O	will

O	as
O	ever
O	he
O	could
O	taking
O	the
O	shortest

O	took
O	the
O	longest
O	for
O	she
O	stopped
O	to
O	pluck

O	ate
O	her
O	up
O	in
O	less
O	than
O	no

O	tough
O	as

O	he
O	had
O	not

O	so
O	but
O	to
O	please

C	grandmother
O	she
O	undressed
O	herself
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	get
O	ready
O	for
O	bed
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	astonished
O	to
O	find
O	how
O	different
O	the
O	old
O	woman
O	looked
O	from
O	ordinary
C	grandmother
O	what
O	great
O	arms
O	you
O	have
O	That
O	is
O	to
O	hug
O	you
O	the
O	better
O	my
O	dear
C	grandmother
O	what
O	great
O	ears
O	you
O	have
O	That
O	is
O	to
O	hear
O	you
O	the
O	better
O	my
O	dear
C	grandmother
O	what
O	great
O	eyes
O	you
O	have
O	That
O	is
O	to
O	see
O	you
O	the
O	better
O	my
O	dear
C	grandmother
O	what
O	a
O	great
O	mouth
O	you
O	have
O	That
O	is
O	to
O	eat
O	you
O	up
O	cried
O	the
O	wicked
C	wolf
O	and
O	immediately
O	he
O	fell
O	upon
O	poor
C	Little
O	and
O	ate
O	her
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	moment
O	My
C	father
O	was
O	a
O	rich
O	merchant
O	He
O	bequeathed
O	me
O	a
O	large
O	estate
O	which
O	I
O	wasted
O	in
O	riotous
O	living
O	I
O	quickly
O	perceived
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	misspending
O	my
O	time
O	which
O	is
O	of
O	all
O	things
O	the
O	most
O	valuable
O	I
O	remembered
O	the
O	saying
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	Solomon
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	frequently
O	heard
O	from
O	my
C	father
O	A
O	good
O	name
O	is
O	better
O	than
O	precious
O	ointment
O	and
O	again
O	Wisdom
O	is
O	good
O	with
O	an
O	inheritance
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	walk
O	in
O	my
O	father
O	s
O	ways
O	and
O	I
O	entered
O	into
O	a
O	contract
O	with
O	some
O	merchants
O	and
O	embarked
O	with
O	them
O	on
O	board
O	a
O	ship
O	we
O	had
O	fitted
O	out
O	in
O	partnership
O	We
O	set
O	sail
O	and
O	steered
O	our
O	course
O	toward
O	the
O	Indies
O	through
O	the
O	Persian
O	Gulf
O	At
O	first
O	I
O	was
O	troubled
O	with
O	but
O	speedily
O	recovered
O	my
O	health
O	In
O	our
O	voyage
O	we
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	islands
O	where
O	we
O	sold
O	or
O	exchanged
O	our
O	goods
O	One
O	day
O	we
O	were
O	becalmed
O	near
O	a
O	small
O	island
O	but
O	little
O	elevated
O	above
O	the
O	level
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	and
O	resembling
O	a
O	green
O	meadow
O	The
C	captain
O	ordered
O	his
O	sails
O	to
O	be
O	furled
O	and
O	permitted
O	such
O	persons
O	as
O	were
O	so
O	inclined
O	to
O	land
O	While
O	we
O	were
O	enjoying
O	ourselves
O	eating
O	and
O	drinking
O	and
O	recovering
O	from
O	the
O	fatigue
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	a
O	sudden
O	trembled
O	and
O	shook
O	us
O	terribly
O	The
O	trembling
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	noticed
O	on
O	board
O	ship
O	and
O	we
O	were
O	called
O	upon
O	to
O	speedily
O	lest
O	we
O	should
O	all
O	be
O	lost
O	for
O	what
O	we
O	took
O	for
O	an
O	island
O	proved
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	back
O	of
O	a
O	sea
O	monster
O	The
O	nimblest
O	got
O	into
O	the
O	sloop
O	others
O	betook
O	themselves
O	to
O	swimming
O	but
O	as
O	for
O	myself
O	I
O	was
O	still
O	upon
O	the
O	island
O	when
O	it
O	disappeared
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	I
O	had
O	only
O	time
O	to
O	catch
O	hold
O	of
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	wood
O	that
O	we
O	had
O	brought
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	fire
O	Meanwhile
O	the
C	captain
O	having
O	received
O	on
O	board
O	those
O	who
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	sloop
O	and
O	taken
O	up
O	some
O	of
O	those
O	that
O	swam
O	resolved
O	to
O	take
O	advantage
O	of
O	the
O	favorable
O	gale
O	that
O	had
O	just
O	risen
O	and
O	hoisting
O	his
O	sails
O	pursued
O	his
O	voyage
O	Thus
O	was
O	I
O	exposed
O	to
O	the
O	mercy
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	that
O	day
O	and
O	the
O	following
O	night
O	By
O	this
O	time
O	I
O	found
O	my
O	strength
O	gone
O	and
O	despaired
O	of
O	saving
O	my
O	life
O	when
O	happily
O	a
O	wave
O	threw
O	me
O	on
O	an
O	island
O	The
O	bank
O	was
O	high
O	and
O	rugged
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	scarcely
O	have
O	got
O	up
O	had
O	it
O	not
O	been
O	for
O	some
O	roots
O	of
O	trees
O	which
O	I
O	found
O	within
O	reach
O	When
O	the
O	sun
O	arose
O	I
O	was
O	very
O	feeble
O	I
O	found
O	some
O	herbs
O	fit
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	luck
O	to
O	discover
O	a
O	spring
O	of
O	excellent
O	water
O	After
O	this
O	I
O	advanced
O	further
O	into
O	the
O	island
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	reached
O	a
O	fine
O	plain
O	where
O	I
O	perceived
O	some
O	horses
O	feeding
O	On
O	my
O	way
O	toward
O	them
O	I
O	heard
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	asked
O	me
O	who
O	I
O	was
O	I
O	related
O	to
O	him
O	my
O	adventure
O	after
O	which
O	taking
O	me
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	he
O	led
O	me
O	into
O	a
O	cave
O	where
O	there
O	were
O	several
O	other
O	people
O	no
O	less
O	amazed
O	to
O	see
O	me
O	than
O	I
O	was
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	I
O	partook
O	of
O	some
O	provisions
O	which
O	they
O	offered
O	me
O	and
O	asked
O	them
O	what
O	they
O	did
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	desert
O	place
O	to
O	which
O	they
O	answered
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	grooms
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
O	sovereign
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	and
O	that
O	every
O	year
O	they
O	brought
O	thither
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	horses
O	for
O	pasturage
O	They
O	were
O	to
O	return
O	home
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
O	and
O	had
O	I
O	been
O	one
O	day
O	later
O	I
O	must
O	have
O	perished
O	because
O	the
O	inhabited
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	distance
O	off
O	and
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	impossible
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	have
O	reached
O	it
O	without
O	a
O	guide
O	Next
O	morning
O	they
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	capital
O	of
O	the
O	island
O	took
O	me
O	with
O	them
O	and
O	presented
O	me
O	to
O	their
C	king
O	He
O	asked
O	me
O	who
O	I
O	was
O	and
O	by
O	what
O	adventure
O	I
O	had
O	come
O	into
O	his
O	dominions
O	After
O	I
O	had
O	satisfied
O	him
O	he
O	ordered
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	want
O	for
O	nothing
O	Being
O	a
O	merchant
O	I
O	frequented

O	a
O	pleasant

O	pleased
O	to
O	listen
O	to
O	the
O	adventures
O	of
O	my
O	second
O	voyage
O	They
O	deserve
O	your
O	attention
O	even
O	more
O	than
O	those
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	Upon
O	which
O	every
O	one
O	held
O	his
O	peace
O	and
C	Sindbad
O	proceeded
O	A
O	powerful
O	and
O	wealthy
C	king
O	having
O	lost
O	his
O	wife
O	was
O	so
O	inconsolable
O	that
O	he
O	shut
O	himself
O	up
O	for
O	eight
O	entire
O	days
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	cabinet
O	where
O	he
O	spent
O	his
O	time
O	in
O	knocking
O	his
O	head
O	against
O	the
O	wall
O	until
O	the
O	courtiers
O	were
O	afraid
O	he
O	would
O	kill
O	himself
O	They
O	accordingly
O	placed
O	stuffed
O	mattresses
O	over
O	every
O	wall
O	and
O	allowed
O	all
O	his
O	subjects
O	who
O	desired
O	to
O	pay
O	him
O	a
O	visit
O	trusting
O	that
O	something
O	would
O	be
O	said
O	to
O	alleviate
O	his
O	grief
O	But
O	neither
O	grave
O	nor
O	lively
O	discourse
O	made
O	any
O	impression
O	upon
O	him
O	he
O	scarcely
O	heard
O	what
O	was
O	spoken
O	At
O	last
O	there
O	presented
O	herself
O	before
O	him
O	a
O	lady
O	covered
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
O	in
O	a
O	long
O	crape
O	veil
O	who
O	wept
O	and
O	sobbed
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	noticed
O	her
O	She
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	come
O	like
O	the
O	rest
O	to
O	console
O	him
O	but
O	rather
O	to
O	encourage
O	his
O	grief
O	She
O	herself
O	had
O	lost
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	husbands
O	and
O	here
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	so
O	profusely
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	wonder
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	not
O	melted
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	head
O	The
C	king
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	in
O	company
O	and
O	to
O	talk
O	to
O	her
O	of
O	his
O	dear
O	wife
O	she
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	of
O	her
O	dear
O	husband
O	in
O	fact
O	they
O	talked
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	they
O	talked
O	their
O	sorrow
O	quite
O	away
O	Then
O	lifting
O	up
O	her
O	veil
O	she
O	showed
O	lovely
O	blue
O	eyes
O	and
O	dark
O	eyelashes
O	The
C	king
O	noticed
O	her
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	he
O	spoke
O	less
O	and
O	less
O	of
O	the
O	departed
C	queen
O	by
O	and
O	by
O	he
O	ceased
O	to
O	speak
O	of
O	her
O	at
O	all
O	The
O	end
O	was
O	that
O	he
O	courted
O	the
O	inconsolable
O	lady
O	in
O	the
O	black
O	veil
O	and
O	married
O	her
O	By
O	his
O	first
O	marriage
O	he
O	had
O	one
O	daughter
O	called
C	Florina
O	or
O	the
O	little
O	Flora
O	because
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	fresh
O	and
O	lovely
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	his
O	second
O	marriage
O	she
O	was
O	quite
O	fifteen
O	years
O	old
O	The
O	new
C	queen
O	also
O	had
O	a
O	daughter
O	who
O	was
O	being
O	brought
O	up
O	by
O	her
O	godmother
O	the
C	fairy
C	Soussio
O	name
O	was
C	Troutina
O	because
O	her
O	complexion
O	was
O	all
O	spotted
O	like
O	a
O	trout
O	s
O	back
O	Indeed
O	she
O	was
O	altogether
O	ugly
O	and
O	disagreeable
O	and
O	when
O	contrasted
O	with
C	Florina
O	the
O	difference
O	between
O	the
O	two
O	made
O	the
O	mother
O	so
O	envious
O	that
O	she
O	and
C	Troutina
O	spared
O	no
O	pains
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	princess
O	s
O	life
O	unhappy
O	and
O	to
O	speak
O	ill
O	of
O	her
O	to
O	her
O	father
O	One
O	day
O	the
C	king
O	observed
O	that
O	both
O	girls
O	were
O	now
O	old
O	enough
O	to
O	be
O	married
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	intended
O	to
O	choose
O	for
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	the
O	first
O	prince
O	who
O	visited
O	his
O	court
O	Be
O	it
O	so
O	said
O	the
C	queen
O	and
O	as
O	my
O	daughter
O	is
O	older
O	handsomer
O	and
O	more
O	amiable
O	than
O	yours
O	she
O	shall
O	have
O	the
O	first
O	choice
O	The
C	king
O	disputed
O	nothing
O	indeed
O	he
O	never
O	did
O	the
C	queen
O	ruled
O	him
O	in
O	all
O	things
O	Some
O	time
O	after
O	news
O	came
O	that
C	King
C	Charming
O	would
O	shortly
O	arrive
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	charming
O	as
O	his
O	name
O	When
O	the
C	queen
O	heard
O	this
O	news
O	she
O	sent
O	for
O	milliners
O	dressmakers
O	jewellers
O	and
O	decked
C	Troutina
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
O	but
O	to
C	Florina
O	she
O	allowed
O	not
O	a
O	single
O	new
O	frock
O	The
O	poor
O	princess
O	had
O	to
O	put
O	on
O	her
O	old
O	one
O	which
O	was
O	very
O	old
O	and
O	shabby
O	indeed
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	ashamed
O	of
O	it
O	that
O	she
O	hid
O	herself
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	saloon
O	lest
C	King
C	Charming
O	should
O	see
O	her
O	But
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	being
O	overwhelmed
O	with
O	the
O	ceremonious
O	reception
O	given
O	him
O	by
O	the
C	queen
O	who
O	presented
O	to
O	him
C	Troutina
O	all
O	blazing
O	with
O	jewels
O	yet
O	so
O	ugly
O	that
C	King
C	Charming
O	involuntarily
O	turned
O	away
O	his
O	eyes
O	But
O	madam
O	is
O	there
O	not
O	another
O	princess
O	called
C	Florina
O	They
O	pointed
O	to
O	the
O	corner
O	where
C	Florina
O	was
O	hidden
O	and
O	she
O	came
O	out
O	blushing
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	the
O	young
C	king
O	was
O	dazzled
O	with
O	her
O	beauty
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	her
O	shabby
O	gown
O	He
O	rose
O	and
O	made
O	her
O	a
O	profound
O	reverence
O	paying
O	her
O	besides
O	so
O	many
O	elegant
O	compliments
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	became
O	very
O	much
O	displeased
C	King
C	Charming
O	took
O	no
O	heed
O	but
O	conversed
O	with
C	Florina
O	for
O	three
O	hours
O	without
O	stopping
O	Indeed
O	his
O	admiration
O	of
O	her
O	was
O	so
O	plain
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	and
C	Troutina
O	begged
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	be
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	tower
O	during
O	the
O	whole
O	time
O	of
O	his
O	visit
O	so
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	returned
O	to
O	her
O	apartment
O	four
O	men
O	in
O	masks
O	entered
O	and
O	carried
O	her
O	off
O	leaving
O	her
O	in
O	a
O	dark
O	cell
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	utmost
O	desolation
O	Meantime
C	King
C	Charming
O	eagerly
O	awaited
O	her
O	but
O	he
O	saw
O	her
O	no
O	more
O	and
O	by
O	the
C	queen
O	s
O	orders
O	every
O	one
O	about
O	him
O	spoke
O	all
O	the
O	evil
O	they
O	could
O	of
O	poor
C	Florina
O	but
O	he
O	refused
O	to
O	believe
O	one
O	word
O	No
O	said
O	he
O	nature
O	could
O	not

O	united
O	a
O	base
O	nature
O	to
O	such
O	a
O	sweet
O	innocent
O	face
O	I
O	will
O	rather
O	suppose
O	that
O	she
O	is
O	maligned
O	by
O	her
O	stepmother
O	and
O	by
C	Troutina
O	who
O	is
O	so
O	ugly
O	herself
O	that
O	no
O	wonder
O	she
O	bears
O	envy
O	towards
O	the
O	fairest
O	woman
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	Meanwhile
C	Florina
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	her
O	tower
O	lamented
O	bitterly
O	Ah
O	would
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	sent
O	here
O	before
O	I
O	saw
O	this
O	amiable
O	prince
O	who
O	was
O	so
O	kind
O	to
O	me
O	It
O	is
O	to
O	prevent
O	my
O	meeting
O	him
O	again
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	treats
O	me
O	so
O	cruelly
O	Alas
O	the
O	little
O	beauty
O	I
O	have
O	has
O	cost
O	me
O	sore
O	The
C	queen
O	to
O	win
C	King
C	Charming
O	for
O	her
O	daughter
O	made
O	him
O	many
O	presents
O	among
O	the
O	rest
O	an
O	order
O	of
O	knighthood
O	a
O	golden
O	heart
O	enamelled
O	in

O	with

O	pierced
O	by
O	one
O	only

O	was
O	made
O	of

O	as
O	big
O	as
O	an

O	When
O	the
O	young
C	king

O	present
O	he
O	was
O	much
O	perplexed
O	until

O	it
O	came
O	from
O	the
O	princess
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	lately

O	he
O	enchanted
O	No
C	Troutina
O	Then
O	I
O	am
O	sorry
O	I
O	cannot
O	accept
O	the
O	honour
O	replied
C	King

O	A

O	is
O	surely
O	at
O	liberty
O	to

O	his

O	I
O	know
O	what
O	is
O	a
O	knight
O	s
O	duty
O	to
O	his
O	lady
O	and
O	should
O	wish
O	to
O	fulfil
O	it
O	as
O	I
O	cannot
O	fulfil
O	it
O	to
C	Troutina
O	I
O	would
O	rather
O	decline
O	the
O	favour
O	she
O	offers
O	me
O	than
O	become
O	unworthy
O	of
O	it
O	Civil
O	as
O	this
O	answer
O	was
O	it
O	irritated
O	the
C	queen
O	and
O	her
O	daughter
O	exceedingly
O	and
O	when
O	since
O	in
O	all
O	his
O	audiences
O	with
O	their
O	majesties
O	he
O	never

O	inquired
O	where
O	the
O	younger
O	princess
O	was
O	the
C	queen
O	answered
O	fiercely
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	prison
O	and
O	would
O	remain
O	there
O	till
C	Troutina
O	was

O	And
O	for

O	the
C	queen
O	more
O	angrily
O	than
O	ever
O	so
O	that
C	King
C	Charming
O	quitted
O	her
O	presence
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	ever
O	he
O	could
O	When
O	he
O	was
O	alone
O	he
O	sent
O	for
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	attendants
O	whom
O	he
O	trusted
O	very
O	much
O	and
O	begged
O	him
O	to
O	gain
O	information
O	from
O	some
O	court
O	lady
O	about
O	the
O	princess
C	Florina
O	This
O	scheme
O	succeeded
O	so
O	well
O	that
C	Florina
O	was
O	persuaded
O	to
O	promise
O	she
O	would
O	speak
O	to
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	next

O	from
O	a
O	small
O	window
O	at
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	tower
O	But
O	the
O	faithless
O	betrayed
O	her
O	to
O	the
C	queen
O	who
O	locked
O	her
O	up
O	in
O	her
O	chamber
O	and
O	determined
O	to
O	send
O	her
O	own
O	daughter
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	instead
O	The
O	night
O	was
O	so
O	dark
O	that
C	King
C	Charming
O	never
O	found
O	out
O	the
O	difference
O	but
O	made
O	to
C	Troutina
O	all
O	the
O	tender
O	speeches
O	that
O	he
O	meant
O	for
C	Florina
O	offering
O	her
O	his
O	crown
O	and
O	his
O	heart
O	and
O	ending
O	by
O	placing
O	his
O	own
O	ring
O	on
O	her
O	finger
O	as
O	a
O	pledge
O	of
O	eternal
O	fidelity
O	He
O	also
O	made
O	her
O	agree
O	to
O	fly
O	with
O	him
O	next
O	night
O	in
O	a
O	chariot
O	drawn
O	by

O	a

O	magician
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	friends
O	had
O	made
O	him
O	a
O	present
O	He
O	thought
O	she
O	talked
O	very
O	little
O	and
O	that
O	little
O	not
O	in
O	quite
O	so
O	pleasant
O	a
O	voice
O	as
O	formerly
O	still
O	he
O	was
O	too
O	much
O	in

O	to
O	notice
O	much
O	and
O	departed
O	very
O	joyful
O	in

O	promise
O	Next
O	night
C	Troutina
O	thickly

O	her
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	vowed
O	to
O	love
O	her
O	for

O	Then
O	he
O	lifted
O	her
O	into
O	the
C	fairy
O	chariot
O	and
O	they
O	sailed
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	for
O	some
O	hours
O	But
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	likely
O	to
O	wish
O	to
O	sail
O	about
O	for

O	he
O	at

O	proposed
O	that
O	they
O	should
O	descend
O	to
O	earth
O	and
O	be
O	married
C	Troutina
O	agreed
O	with
O	all

O	be
O	performed
O	at
O	her
O	godmother
O	s

O	So
O	they
O	entered
O	together
O	into

O	Meantime
O	the

O	so
O	thin

O	in

O	lamentations
O	Adorable
O	princess
O	said
O	he
O	why
O	do
O	you

O	Your

O	Who

O	so
O	gently
O	asked
O	she
O	A
C	king
O	who
O	loves
O	you
O	and
O	will
O	never

O	So
O	saying
O	he
O	flew
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	at
O	first
O	frightened
O	the
O	princess
O	very
O	much
O	for
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	understand
O	such
O	an
O	extraordinary
O	thing
O	as
O	a
O	bird
O	who
O	talked
O	in
O	words
O	like
O	a
O	man
O	yet
O	kept
O	still
O	the
O	piping
O	voice
O	of
O	a
O	nightingale
O	But
O	soon
O	she
O	began
O	stroking
O	his
O	beautiful
O	plumage
O	and
O	caressing
O	him
O	Who
O	are
O	you
O	charming
O	bird
O	You
O	have
O	spoken
O	my
O	name
O	I
O	am
C	King
C	Charming
O	condemned
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	bird
O	for
O	seven
O	years
O	because
O	I
O	will
O	not

O	you
O	Ah
O	do
O	not
O	deceive
O	me
O	I
O	know
O	you
O	have
O	married
C	Troutina
O	She
O	came
O	to
O	visit
O	me
O	with
O	your
O	diamonds
O	on
O	her
O	neck
O	and
O	your
O	ring
O	on
O	her
O	finger
O	wearing
O	the
O	golden
O	crown
O	and
O	royal
O	mantle
O	which
O	you
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	while
O	I
O	was
O	laden
O	with
O	iron
O	chains
O	It
O	is
O	all
O	false
O	sang
O	the
C	Blue
C	Bird
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	his
O	whole
O	story
O	which
O	comforted
O	her
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	she
O	thought
O	no
O	more
O	of
O	her
O	misfortunes
O	They
O	conversed
O	till
O	daybreak
O	and
O	promised
O	faithfully
O	every
O	night
O	to
O	meet
O	again
O	thus
O	Meantime
O	the
O	princess
O	could
O	not
O	sleep
O	for
O	thinking
O	of
O	her
C	Blue
C	Bird
O	Suppose
O	sportsmen
O	should
O	shoot
O	him
O	or
O	eagles
O	and
O	kites
O	attack
O	him
O	and
O	vultures
O	devour
O	him
O	just
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	a
O	mere
O	bird
O	and
O	not
O	a
O	great
C	king
O	What
O	should
O	I
O	do
O	if
O	I
O	saw
O	his
O	poor
O	feathers
O	scattered
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	knew
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	no
O	more
O	So
O	she
O	grieved
O	all
O	day
O	long
O	The
O	beautiful
C	Blue
C	Bird
O	hid
O	in
O	a
O	hollow
O	tree
O	spent
O	the
O	hours
O	in
O	thinking
O	of
O	his
O	princess
O	How
O	happy
O	I
O	am
O	to
O	have
O	found
O	her
O	again
O	and
O	found
O	her
O	so
O	engaging
O	and
O	so
O	sweet
O	And
O	as
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	pay
O	her
O	all
O	the
O	attentions
O	that
O	a
O	lover
O	delights
O	in
O	he
O	flew
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	kingdom
O	entered
O	his
O	palace
O	by
O	an
O	open
O	window
O	and
O	sought
O	for
O	some
O	diamond
O	which
O	he
O	brought
O	back
O	in
O	his
O	beak
O	and
O	when
O	night
O	came
O	offered
O	them
O	to
C	Florina
O	So
O	night
O	after
O	night
O	he
O	brought
O	her
O	something
O	beautiful
O	and
O	they
O	talked
O	together
O	till
O	day
O	when
O	he
O	flew
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	hollow
O	tree
O	where
O	he
O	sang
O	her
O	praises
O	in
O	a
O	voice
O	so
O	sweet
O	that
O	the
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	bird
O	but
O	a
O	spirit
O	Rumours
O	went
O	about
O	that
O	the
O	place
O	was
O	haunted
O	and
O	no
O	one
O	would
O	go
O	near
O	the
O	spot
O	Thus
O	for
O	two
O	years
C	Florina
O	spent
O	her
O	time
O	and
O	never
O	once
O	regretted
O	her
O	captivity
O	Her
C	Blue
C	Bird
O	visited
O	her
O	every
O	night
O	and
O	they
O	loved
O	one
O	another
O	dearly
O	And
O	though
O	she
O	saw
O	nobody
O	and
O	he
O	lived
O	in
O	the
O	hollow
O	of
O	a
O	tree
O	they
O	always
O	found
O	plenty
O	to
O	say
O	to
O	one
O	another
O	The
O	malicious
C	queen
O	tried
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	might
O	to
O	get
C	Troutina
O	married
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	Nobody
O	would
O	have
O	her
O	If
O	it
O	were
C	Florina
O	now
O	said
O	the
O	kings
O	or
O	the
O	kings
O	ambassadors
O	we
O	should
O	be
O	most
O	happy
O	to
O	sign
O	the
O	contract
O	That
O	girl
O	thwarts
O	us
O	still
O	said
O	the
C	queen
O	She
O	must
O	have
O	some
O	secret
O	correspondence
O	with
O	foreign
O	suitors
O	But
O	we
O	will
O	find
O	her
O	out
O	and
O	punish
O	her
O	The
O	mother
O	and
O	daughter
O	finished
O	talking
O	so
O	late
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	midnight
O	before
O	they
O	reached
C	Florina
O	s
O	apartment
O	She
O	had
O	dressed
O	herself
O	as
O	usual
O	with
O	the
O	utmost
O	care
O	to
O	please
O	her
C	Blue
C	Bird
O	who
O	liked
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	lovely
O	and
O	she
O	had
O	adorned
O	herself
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	pretty
O	things
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	He
O	perched
O	on
O	the
O	and
O	she
O	sat
O	at
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	singing
O	together
O	a
O	duet
O	which
O	the
C	queen
O	heard
O	outside
O	She
O	burst
O	the
O	door
O	open
O	and
O	rushed
O	into
O	the
O	chamber
O	The
O	first
O	thing
C	Florina
O	did
O	was
O	to
O	open
O	her
O	little
O	window
O	that
O	the
C	Blue
C	Bird
O	might
O	fly
O	away
O	But
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	He
O	had
O	seen
O	the
C	queen
O	and
C	Troutina
O	and
O	though
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	defend
O	his
O	princess
O	he
O	refused
O	to
O	leave
O	her
O	The
O	two
O	rushed
O	upon
O	her
O	like
O	furies
O	Her
O	wonderful
O	beauty
O	and
O	her
O	splendid
O	jewels
O	startled
O	them
O	Whence
O	came
O	all
O	these
O	ornaments
O	cried
O	they
O	I
O	found
O	them
O	replied
C	Florina
O	and
O	refused
O	to
O	answer
O	more
O	Some
O	one
O	has
O	given
O	them
O	to
O	you
O	that
O	you
O	might
O	join
O	in
O	treason
O	against
O	your
O	father
O	and
O	the
O	kingdom
O	Am
O	I
O	likely
O	to
O	do
O	this
O	I
O	a
O	poor
O	princess
O	kept
O	in
O	captivity
O	for
O	two
O	years
O	with
O	you
O	as
O	my
O	gaoler
O	In
O	captivity
O	repeated
O	the
C	queen
O	Why
O	then
O	do
O	you
O	dress
O	yourself
O	so
O	fine
O	and
O	adorn
O	your
O	chamber
O	with
O	flowers
O	I
O	have
O	leisure
O	enough
O	I
O	may
O	just
O	as
O	well
O	spend
O	some
O	of
O	it
O	in
O	adorning
O	myself
O	instead
O	of
O	bemoaning
O	my
O	misfortune
O	innocent
O	as
O	I
O	am
O	Innocent
O	indeed
O	cried
O	the
C	queen
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	search
O	the
O	room
O	In
O	it
O	she
O	found

O	but
O	your
O	father
O	shall
O	judge
O	you
O	and
O	very
O	much
O	frightened
O	the
C	queen
O	left
O	her
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	hold
O	counsel
O	with
C	Troutina
O	as
O	to
O	what
O	was
O	to
O	be

O	They
O	agreed
O	to
O	put

O	from
O	morning
O	till
O	night
O	When
O	the
O	princess
O	learnt
O	this
O	she
O	was
O	in
O	great
O	grief
O	Alas
O	cried
O	she
O	I
O	can
O	no

O	with
O	my
O	bird
O	who
O	loved

O	What
O	will

O	do
O	What

O	do
O	And
O	she
O	melted
O	into
O	floods
O	of
O	tears
O	She
O	dared
O	not
O	open
O	the
O	window
O	though
O	she
O	heard
O	continually
O	his
O	wings
O	fluttering
O	round
O	it
O	For
O	more
O	than
O	a

O	a

O	talked
O	together
O	till

O	Next
O	night
O	it
O	happened
O	the
O	same
O	till
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	hope
O	that
O	the
O	who
O	seemed
O	to
O	enjoy

O	sleep
O	so

C	Florina
O	sitting

O	The
O	spy
O	listened
O	and
O	heard
O	all
O	their
O	conversation
O	very
O	much
O	astonished
O	that
O	a
O	princess
O	could
O	be
O	so
O	fond
O	of
O	a
O	mere
O	bird
O	When
O	day
O	came
O	she
O	related
O	all
O	to
O	the

C	King
C	Charming
O	They

O	The

O	died
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	who
O	knew
O	she
O	was
O	his

O	began
O	to

O	where

O	and

O	fled
O	away
O	to
O	the

O	a
O	council
O	and
O	arrange
O	all
O	the
O	affairs
O	of

C	Blue

O	The

O	to
O	the
C	fairy
C	Soussio
O	whom
O	he
O	knew
O	for
O	they
O	had
O	quarrelled
O	and
O	made
O	it
O	up
O	again
O	as
O	fairies
O	and
O	magicians
O	do
O	many
O	times
O	within
O	the
O	last
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	hundred
O	years
O	She
O	received
O	him
O	civilly
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	what
O	he
O	wanted
O	He
O	tried
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	bargain
O	with
O	her
O	but
O	could
O	effect
O	nothing
O	unless
C	King
C	Charming
O	would
O	consent
O	to
O	marry
C	Troutina
O	The
O	enchanter
O	found
O	this
O	bride
O	so
O	ugly
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	advise
O	Still
O	the
C	Blue
C	Bird
O	had
O	run
O	so
O	many
O	risks
O	in
O	his
O	cage
O	the
O	nail
O	it
O	was
O	hung
O	upon
O	had
O	broken
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	suffered
O	much
O	in
O	the
O	fall
O	Minetta
O	the
O	cat
O	had
O	glowered
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	her
O	green
O	eyes
O	the
O	attendants
O	had
O	forgotten
O	his
O	and
O	his
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	half
O	dying
O	of
O	hunger
O	and
O	thirst
O	and
O	a
O	monkey
O	had
O	plucked
O	at
O	his
O	feathers
O	through
O	the
O	wires
O	as
O	disrespectfully
O	as
O	if
O	instead
O	of
O	a

O	he
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	linnet
O	or
O	a
O	jay
O	Worse
O	than
O	all
O	his
O	next
O	heir
O	spread
O	reports
O	of
O	his
O	death
O	and
O	threatened
O	to
O	seize
O	on
O	his
O	throne
O	Under
O	these
O	circumstances
O	the
O	magician
O	thought
O	it
O	best
O	to
O	agree
O	with
C	Soussio
O	that
C	King
C	Charming
O	should
O	be
O	restored
O	to
O	his
O	kingdom
O	and
O	his
O	natural
O	shape
O	for
O	six
O	months
O	on
O	condition
O	that
C	Troutina
O	should
O	remain
O	in
O	his
O	palace
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	try
O	to
O	like
O	her
O	and
O	marry
O	her
O	If
O	not
O	he
O	was
O	to
O	become
O	again
O	a
C	Blue
C	Bird
O	So
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	once
O	more
C	King
C	Charming
O	and
O	as
O	charming
O	as
O	ever
O	but
O	he
O	would
O	rather
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	bird
O	and
O	near
O	his
O	beloved
O	than
O	a
C	king
O	in
O	the
O	society
O	of
C	Troutina
O	The
O	enchanter
O	gave
O	him
O	the
O	best
O	reasons
O	for
O	what
O	had
O	been
O	done
O	and
O	advised
O	him
O	to
O	occupy
O	himself
O	with
O	the
O	affairs
O	of
O	his
O	kingdom
O	and
O	people
O	but
O	he
O	thought
O	less
O	of
O	these
O	things
O	than
O	how
O	to
O	escape
O	from
O	the
O	horror
O	of
O	marrying
C	Troutina
O	Meanwhile
O	the
C	queen
C	Florina
O	in
O	a
O	peasant
O	s
O	dress
O	with
O	a
O	straw

O	on
O	her
O	head
O	and
O	a
O	canvas
O	sack
O	on
O	her
O	shoulder
O	began
O	her
O	journey
O	sometimes
O	on
O	horseback
O	sometimes
O	on
O	foot
O	sometimes
O	by
O	sea
O	sometimes
O	by
O	land
O	wandering
O	evermore
O	after
O	her
O	beloved
C	King
C	Charming
O	One
O	day
O	stopping
O	beside
O	a
O	fountain
O	she
O	let
O	her
O	hair
O	fall
O	loose
O	and
O	dipped
O	her
O	weary
O	feet
O	in
O	the
O	cool
O	water
O	when
O	an
O	old
O	woman
O	bent
O	and
O	leaning
O	on
O	a
O	stick
O	came
O	by
O	My
O	pretty
O	maiden
O	what
O	are
O	you
O	doing
O	here
O	all
O	alone
O	Good
O	mother
O	replied
O	the
C	queen
O	I
O	have
O	too
O	many
O	troubles
O	to
O	be
O	pleasant
O	company
O	for
O	anybody
O	Tell
O	me
O	your
O	troubles
O	and
O	I
O	may
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	soften
O	them
C	Florina
O	obeyed
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	whole
O	history
O	and
O	how
O	she
O	was
O	travelling
O	over
O	the
O	world
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	the
C	Blue
C	Bird
O	The
O	little
O	woman
O	listened
O	attentively
O	and
O	then
O	in
O	the
O	twinkling
O	of
O	an
O	eye
O	became
O	instead
O	of
O	an
O	old
O	woman
O	a
O	beautiful
C	fairy
O	Incomparable
C	Florina
O	the
C	king
O	you
O	seek
O	is
O	no
O	longer
O	a
O	bird
O	my
O	sister
C	Soussio
O	has
O	restored
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	proper
O	shape
O	and
O	he
O	reigns
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	kingdom
O	Do
O	not
O	afflict
O	yourself
O	happiness
O	will
O	yet
O	be
O	yours
O	Take
O	these
O	four
O	eggs
O	and
O	whenever
O	you
O	are
O	in
O	trouble
O	break
O	them
O	and
O	see
O	what
O	ensues
O	So
O	saying
O	the
C	fairy
O	vanished
C	Florina
O	greatly
O	comforted
O	put
O	the
O	eggs
O	in
O	her
O	sack
O	and
O	turned
O	her
O	steps
O	towards
O	the
O	country
O	of
C	King
C	Charming
O	She
O	walked
O	eight
O	days
O	and
O	nights
O	without
O	stopping
O	and
O	then
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	mountain
O	made
O	entirely
O	of
O	ivory
O	and
O	nearly
O	perpendicular
O	Despairing
O	of
O	ever
O	climbing
O	it
O	she
O	sank
O	down
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	prepared
O	to
O	die
O	there
O	when
O	she
O	bethought
O	herself
O	of
O	the
O	eggs
O	Let
O	me
O	see
O	said
O	she
O	if
O	the
C	fairy
O	has
O	deceived
O	me
O	or
O	not
O	So
O	she
O	broke
O	one
O	and
O	inside
O	it
O	were
O	little
O	hooks
O	of
O	gold
O	which
O	she
O	fitted
O	on
O	her
O	feet
O	and
O	hands
O	and
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	which
O	she
O	climbed
O	the
O	mountain
O	with
O	ease
O	Arrived
O	at
O	the
O	summit
O	she
O	found
O	new
O	difficulties
O	for
O	the
O	valley
O	below
O	was
O	one
O	large
O	smooth
O	mirror
O	in
O	which
O	sixty
O	thousand
O	women
O	stood
O	admiring
O	themselves
O	They
O	had
O	need
O	for
O	the
O	charm
O	of
O	the
O	mirror
O	was
O	that
O	each
O	saw
O	herself
O	therein
O	not
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	but
O	as
O	she
O	wished
O	to
O	be
O	and
O	the
O	grimaces
O	they
O	made
O	were
O	enough
O	to
O	cause
O	a
O	person
O	to
O	die
O	of
O	laughter
O	Not
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	ever
O	gained
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	saw
C	Florina
O	there
O	they
O	all
O	burst
O	into
O	angry
O	outcries
O	How
O	has
O	this
O	woman
O	got
O	up
O	the
O	hill
O	If
O	she
O	descends
O	upon
O	our
O	mirror
O	her
O	first
O	footstep
O	will
O	crack
O	it
O	into
O	a
O	thousand
O	pieces
O	The
C	queen
O	uncertain
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	broke
O	the
O	second
O	egg
O	and
O	there
O	flew
O	out
O	two
O	pigeons
O	harnessed
O	to
O	a
O	fine
O	chariot
O	in
O	which
C	Florina
O	mounted
O	and
O	descended
O	lightly
O	over
O	the
O	mirror
O	to
O	the
O	valley
O	s
O	foot
O	Now
O	my
O	pretty

O	will
O	you
O	convey

O	to
O	the

O	of
C	King
C	Charming
O	The
O	obedient
O	pigeons
O	did
O	so
O	flying
O	day
O	and
O	night
O	till
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	city
O	gates
O	when
O	the
C	queen
O	dismissed
O	them
O	with
O	a
O	sweet
O	kiss
O	which
O	was
O	worth
O	more
O	than
O	her
O	crown
O	How
O	her
O	heart
O	beat
O	as
O	she
O	entered
O	and
O	begged
O	to
O	see
O	the

O	You

O	She
O	neither

O	through

O	she
O	more

C	Troutina
O	exclaimed

O	that
O	who
O	dares
O	approach
O	so
O	near
O	my
O	golden

O	And
O	she

O	the

O	bracelets
O	which
O	the
C	Blue
C	Bird
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	These
O	are
O	pretty
O	trinkets
O	said
C	Troutina
O	and
O	going
O	up
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	she
O	asked
O	him
O	what
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	them
O	At
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	ornaments
O	he

O	these
O	said
C	Troutina
O	but
C	Florina
O	refused
O	to
O	sell
O	them
O	for
O	money
O	the

O	she
O	asked

O	permission
O	to
O	sleep
O	a
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	Chamber
O	of
O	Echoes
O	As
O	you
O	will
O	your
O	bargains
O	are
O	cheap
O	enough
O	replied
C	Troutina
O	laughing
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	laughed
O	she
O	showed
O	teeth
O	like
O	the
O	tusks
O	of
O	a
O	wild
O	boar
O	Now
O	the
C	king
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	a
C	Blue
C	Bird
O	had
O	informed
C	Florina
O	about
O	this
O	Chamber
O	of
O	Echoes
O	where
O	every
O	word
O	spoken
O	could
O	be
O	heard
O	in
O	his

O	chamber
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	have
O	chosen
O	a
O	better
O	way
O	of
O	reproaching
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	infidelity
O	But
O	vain
O	were
O	her
O	sobs
O	and
O	complainings
O	the
C	king
O	had
O	taken
O	opium
O	to
O	lull
O	his
O	grief
O	he
O	slept
O	soundly
O	all
O	night
O	long
O	Next
O	day
C	Florina
O	was
O	in
O	great
O	disquietude
O	Could
O	he
O	have
O	really
O	heard
O	her
O	and
O	been
O	indifferent
O	to
O	her
O	sorrow
O	or
O	had
O	he
O	not
O	heard
O	her
O	at
O	all
O	She
O	determined
O	to
O	buy
O	another
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	Chamber
O	of
O	Echoes
O	but
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	more
O	jewels
O	to
O	tempt
C	Troutina
O	so
O	she
O	broke
O	the
O	third
O	egg
O	Out
O	of
O	it
O	came
O	a
O	chariot
O	of
O	polished
O	steel
O	inlaid
O	with
O	gold
O	drawn
O	by
O	six
O	green
O	mice
O	the

O	being
O	a

O	a
O	grey
O	one
O	Inside
O	the
O	carriage
O	sat
O	little
O	puppets
O	who
O	behaved
O	themselves
O	just
O	like
O	live
O	ladies
O	and
O	gentlemen
O	When
C	Troutina
O	went
O	to
O	walk
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	garden
C	Florina
O	awaited
O	her
O	in
O	a
O	green
O	alley
O	and
O	made
O	the
O	mice
O	gallop
O	and
O	the
O	ladies
O	and
O	gentlemen
O	bow
O	till
O	the

O	was
O	delighted
O	and
O	ready
O	to
O	buy
O	the
O	curiosity
O	at
O	any
O	price
O	Again
C	Florina
O	exacted
O	permission
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	Chamber
O	of
O	Echoes
O	and
O	again
O	the
C	king
O	undisturbed
O	by
O	her
O	lamentation
O	slept
O	without
O	waking
O	till
O	dawn
O	The
O	third
O	day
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	valets
O	passing
O	her
O	by
O	said
O	You
O	stupid
O	it
O	is
O	well
O	the
C	king
O	takes
O	opium
O	every
O	night
O	or
O	you
O	would
O	disturb
O	him
O	by
O	that
O	terrible
O	sobbing
O	of
O	yours
O	Does
O	he
O	so
O	said
O	the
C	queen
O	now
O	comprehending
O	all
O	Then
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	promise
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	opium
O	cup
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	these
O	pearls
O	and
O	diamonds
O	and
O	she
O	took
O	a

O	of
O	them
O	from
O	her
O	sack
O	shall
O	assuredly
O	be
O	yours
O	The
O	valet
O	promised
O	and
O	then
C	Florina
O	broke
O	her
O	fourth
O	egg
O	out
O	of
O	which
O	came
O	a
O	pie
O	composed
O	of
O	birds
O	which
O	though
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	plucked
O	baked
O	and
O	made
O	ready
O	for
O	the

O	sang
O	as
O	beautifully
O	as
O	birds
O	that
O	are
O	alive
C	Troutina
O	charmed
O	with
O	this
O	marvellous
O	novelty
O	bought
O	it
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	price
O	as
O	the
O	rest
O	adding
O	generously
O	a
O	small
O	piece
O	of
O	gold
O	When
O	all
O	the

O	were
O	asleep
C	Florina
O	for
O	the

O	time
O	hoping
C	King
C	Charming
O	would
O	hear
O	her
O	called
O	upon
O	him
O	with
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	tender
O	expressions
O	reminding
O	him
O	of
O	their
O	former
O	vows
O	and
O	their
O	two
O	years
O	of
O	happiness
O	What
O	have
O	I
O	done
O	to
O	thee
O	that
O	thou
O	shouldst
O	forget
O	me
O	and
O	marry
C	Troutina
O	sobbed
O	she
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	who
O	this
O	time
O	was
O	wide
O	awake
O	heard
O	her
O	He
O	could
O	not
O	make
O	out
O	whose
O	voice
O	it
O	was
O	or
O	whence
O	it
O	came
O	but
O	it
O	somehow
O	reminded
O	him
O	of
O	his
O	dearest
C	Florina
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	ceased
O	to
O	love
O	He
O	called
O	his
O	valet
O	inquired
O	who
O	was
O	sleeping
O	in
O	the
O	Chamber
O	of
O	Echoes
O	and
O	heard
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	little
O	who
O	had
O	sold
O	to
C	Troutina
O	the
O	emerald
O	bracelet
O	Then
O	he
O	rose
O	up
O	dressed
O	himself
O	hastily
O	and
O	went
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	her
O	She
O	was
O	sitting
O	mournfully
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	with
O	her
O	hair
O	hiding
O	her
O	face
O	and
O	her
O	eyes
O	swollen
O	with
O	tears
O	but
O	he
O	knew
O	at
O	once
O	his
O	faithful
C	Florina
O	He
O	fell
O	on
O	his
O	knees
O	before
O	her
O	covered
O	her
O	hands
O	with
O	kisses
O	and
O	they
O	embraced
O	and
O	wept
O	together
O	For
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	good
O	of
O	all
O	their
O	love
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	still
O	in
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	the
C	fairy
C	Soussio
O	But
O	at
O	this
O	moment
O	appeared
O	the
O	friendly
O	enchanter
O	with
O	a
C	fairy
O	still
O	greater
O	than
C	Soussio
O	the
O	one
O	who
O	had
O	given
C	Florina
O	the
O	four
O	eggs
O	They
O	declared
O	that
O	their
O	united
O	power
O	was
O	stronger
O	than
C	Soussio
O	s
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	lovers
O	should
O	be
O	married
O	without
O	further
O	delay
O	When
O	this
O	news
O	reached
C	Troutina
O	she
O	ran
O	to
O	the
O	Chamber
O	of
O	Echoes
O	and
O	there
O	beheld
O	her
O	beautiful
O	rival
O	whom
O	she
O	had
O	so
O	cruelly
O	afflicted
O	But
O	the
O	moment
O	she
O	opened
O	her
O	mouth
O	to
O	speak
O	her
O	wicked
O	tongue
O	was
O	silenced
O	for
O	ever
O	for
O	the
O	magician
O	turned

O	into
O	a

O	The

O	they

C	Fairyfoot
O	At
O	first
O	it

O	this

O	by
O	the

O	or
O	his
O	ministers
O	the

O	concluded
O	it
O	was
O	no

O	and
O	the

O	never

O	another
O	name
O	throughout
O	the
O	pastures
O	At
O	court
O	it
O	was

O	to

O	of
O	him
O	at
O	all
O	They
O	did

O	and
O	he
O	was
O	never
O	sent

O	at
O	Christmas
O	because
O	the
C	queen
O	and
O	her
O	ladies
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	the
O	sight
O	Once
O	a
O	year
O	the

O	cross
O	it
O	was
O	said
O	he
O	had
O	thoughts
O	of
O	disowning
O	him
O	So
C	Fairyfoot
O	grew
O	in
C	Fleecefold
O	s
O	cottage
O	Perhaps
O	the
O	country
O	air
O	made
O	him
O	fair
O	and
O	all
O	agreed
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	handsome
C	boy
O	but
O	for
O	his

O	with
O	which
O	nevertheless
O	he
O	learned
O	to
O	walk
O	and
O	in

O	to
O	run
O	and
O	to
O	jump
O	thereby

O	everybody
O	for

O	among

O	The

O	thought
O	him
O	unlucky
O	the

C	Fleecefold
O	was

O	but
O	he
O	durst
O	not

O	the

O	Moreover
C	Blackthorn
O	wore
O	most
O	of
O	the
O	clothes
O	brought
O	by
O	the
O	scullion
O	At
O	last
C	Rough
C	Ruddy
O	found
O	out
O	that
O	the

O	of
O	such
O	horrid
O	jumping
O	would
O	make
O	her

O	vulgar
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	old
O	enough
O	she
O	sent
C	Fairyfoot
O	every

O	to

O	some

O	sheep
O	that

O	wild
O	weedy
O	pasture
O	hard
O	by
O	the

O	Poor
C	Fairyfoot
O	was
O	often
O	lonely
O	and
O	sorrowful
O	many
O	a
O	time
O	he
O	wished
O	his

O	larger
O	or
O	that

O	notice
O	them
O	so
O	much
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	comfort
O	he
O	had
O	was
O	running
O	and
O	jumping
O	by
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	wild
O	pasture
O	and
O	thinking
O	that
O	none
O	of
O	the
O	shepherds
O	children
O	could
O	do
O	the
O	like
O	for
O	all
O	their

O	of
O	their
O	great

O	Tired
O	of
O	this

O	he

O	one
O	warm
O	summer
O	s

O	a
C	robin
O	pursued
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	hawk
O	flew
O	into
O	the

O	velvet
O	cap
O	which
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	beside

C	Fairyfoot
O	covered
O	it
O	up
O	and
O	the

O	frightened
O	by
O	his
O	shout
O	flew
O	away
O	Now
O	you
O	may
O	go
O	poor
C	robin
O	he
O	said
O	opening
O	the
O	cap
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	the
O	bird
O	out
O	sprang
O	a
O	little
O	man
O	dressed
O	in
O	and
O	looking
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	an
O	hundred
O	years
O	old
C	Fairyfoot
O	could
O	not
O	speak
O	for

O	but
O	the

O	man
O	Thank
O	you
O	for
O	your
O	shelter
O	and
O	be
O	sure
O	I

O	off
O	he
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	in
O	an
O	instant
O	For
O	days
O	the
C	boy
O	wondered
O	who
O	that
O	little
O	man
O	could
O	be
O	but
O	he
O	told
O	nobody
O	for
O	the
O	little
O	man
O	s
O	feet
O	were
O	as
O	small
O	as
O	his
O	own
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	clear
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	no
O	favourite
O	in
O	Stumpinghame
C	Fairyfoot
O	kept
O	the
O	story
O	to
O	himself
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	midsummer
O	came
O	That
O	evening
O	was
O	a
O	feast
O	among
O	the
O	shepherds
O	There
O	were
O	bonfires
O	on
O	the
O	hills
O	and
O	fun
O	in
O	the
O	villages
O	But
C	Fairyfoot
O	sat
O	alone
O	beside
O	his
O	sheepfold
O	for
O	the
O	children
O	of
O	his

O	to
O	let
O	him
O	dance
O	with
O	them
O	about
O	the
O	bonfire
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	gone
O	there
O	to
O	bewail
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	his
O	feet
O	which
O	came
O	between

O	and
O	so
O	many
O	good
O	things
C	Fairyfoot
O	had
O	never
O	felt
O	so
O	lonely
O	in
O	all
O	his

O	and
O	remembering
O	the

O	plucked
O	up
O	spirit
O	and
O	Ho
C	Robin
C	Goodfellow
O	Here
O	I
O	am
O	said
O	a
O	shrill
O	voice
O	at
O	his
O	elbow
O	and
O	there
O	stood
O	the
O	little
O	man
O	himself
O	I
O	am
O	very
O	lonely
O	and
O	no
O	one
O	will
O	play
O	with
O	me
O	because
O	my
O	feet
O	are
O	not
O	large
O	enough
O	said
C	Fairyfoot
O	Come
O	then
O	and
O	play
O	with
O	us

O	man
O	We
O	lead
O	the

O	lives
O	in
O	the

O	and
O	there
O	are
O	two
O	things
O	you

O	among

O	first
O	do
O	as
O	you

O	you
O	may

O	or
O	see
O	for
O	we

O	ever
O	since

O	I

O	over
O	the

O	into
O	the

O	and
O	along
O	a
O	mossy
O	path
O	among
O	old

O	wreathed
O	with
O	ivy
O	he
O	never

O	how
O	far
O	till
O	they
O	heard
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	music
O	and
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	meadow
O	where
O	the
O	moon
O	shone
O	as
O	bright
O	as
O	day
O	and

O	There

O	some
O	clad
O	in

O	colour
O	but
O	far
O	more
O	in
O	green
O	dancing
O	round
O	a
O	little
O	well
O	as
O	clear
O	as
O	crystal
O	And
O	under
O	great
O	which
O	grew
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	in
O	the

O	companies
O	were
O	sitting
O	round
O	low

O	covered
O	with

O	of
O	the

O	and
O	Drink
O	to
O	the
O	good

O	Wine
O	was
O	not
O	very
O	common
O	among
O	the
O	shepherds
O	of
O	Stumpinghame
O	and
O	the
C	boy
O	had
O	never
O	tasted
O	such

O	as
O	that
O	before
O	for
O	scarcely
O	had
O	it
O	gone
O	down
O	when
O	he
O	forgot
O	all
O	his
C	Blackthorn
O	and
C	Brownberry
O	wore
O	his

O	how
C	Rough

O	sent

O	and
O	the

O	would
O	not

O	with

O	in
O	short
O	he
O	forgot
O	the
O	whole
O	misfortune
O	of
O	his
O	feet
O	and
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	his

O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
C	king
C	s

O	and

O	Nobody
O	in
O	the
O	cottage
O	had
O	missed
O	him
O	and
O	he
O	went
O	out
O	with
O	the
O	sheep
O	as
O	usual
O	but
O	every
O	night
O	all
O	that
O	summer
O	when
O	the
O	shepherds
O	were
O	safe
O	in
O	bed
O	the
O	little
O	man
O	came
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	away
O	to
O	dance
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	Now
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	care
O	to
O	play
O	with
O	the
O	shepherds
O	children
O	nor
O	grieve
O	that
O	his
C	father
O	and
C	mother
O	had
O	forgotten
O	him
O	but
O	watched
O	the
O	sheep
O	all
O	day
O	singing
O	to
O	himself
O	or
O	plaiting
O	rushes
O	The
O	wonder
O	was
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	never
O	tired
O	nor
O	sleepy
O	as
O	people
O	are
O	apt
O	to
O	be
O	who
O	dance
O	all
O	night
O	but
O	before
O	the
O	summer
O	was
O	ended
C	Fairyfoot
O	found
O	out
O	the
O	reason
O	One
O	night
O	when
O	the
O	moon
O	was
O	full
O	and
O	the
O	last
O	of
O	the
O	ripe
O	corn
O	rustling
O	in
O	the
O	fields
C	Robin
C	Goodfellow
O	came
O	for
O	him
O	as
O	usual
O	and
O	away
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	flowery
O	green
O	The
O	fun
O	there
O	was
O	high
O	and
C	Robin
O	was
O	in
O	haste
O	So
O	he
O	only
O	pointed
O	to
O	the
O	carved
O	cup
O	from
O	which
C	Fairyfoot
O	every
O	night
O	drank
O	the
O	clear
O	red
O	wine
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	thirsty
O	and
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	use
O	losing
O	time
O	thought
O	the
C	boy
O	to
O	himself
O	and
O	he
O	joined
O	the
O	dance
O	but
O	never
O	in
O	all
O	his
O	life
O	did
C	Fairyfoot
O	find
O	such
O	hard
O	work
O	as
O	to
O	keep
O	pace
O	with
O	the
O	company
O	Their
O	feet
O	seemed
O	to
O	move
O	like
O	lightning
O	the
O	swallows
O	did
O	not
O	fly
O	so
O	fast
O	or
O	turn
O	so
O	quickly
C	Fairyfoot
O	did
O	his
O	best
O	for
O	he
O	never
O	gave
O	in
O	easily
O	but
O	at
O	length
O	his
O	breath
O	and
O	strength
O	being
O	spent
O	the
C	boy
O	was
O	glad
O	to
O	steal
O	away
O	and
O	sit
O	down
O	behind
O	a
O	mossy
O	oak
O	where
O	his
O	eyes
O	closed
O	for
O	very
O	weariness
O	When
O	he
O	awoke
O	the
O	dance
O	was
O	nearly
O	over
O	but
O	two
O	little
O	ladies
O	clad
O	in
O	green
O	talked
O	close
O	beside
O	him
O	What
O	a
O	beautiful
C	boy
O	said
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	He
O	is
O	worthy
O	to
O	be
O	a
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	Only
O	see
O	what
O	handsome
O	feet
O	he
O	has
O	Yes
O	said
O	the
O	other
O	with
O	a
O	laugh
O	that
O	sounded
O	spiteful
O	they
O	are
O	just
O	like
O	the
O	feet
C	Princess
C	Maybloom
O	had
O	before
O	she
O	washed
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	Growing
O	Well
O	Her
C	father
O	has
O	sent
O	far
O	and
O	wide
O	throughout
O	the
O	whole
O	country
O	searching
O	for
O	a
O	doctor
O	to
O	make
O	them
O	small
O	again
O	but
O	nothing
O	in
O	this
O	world
O	can
O	do
O	it
O	except
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	the
O	Fair
O	Fountain
O	and
O	none
O	but
O	I
O	and
O	the
O	nightingales
O	know
O	where
O	it
O	is
O	One
O	would
O	not
O	care
O	to
O	let
O	the
O	like
O	be
O	known
O	said
O	the
O	first
O	little
O	lady
O	there
O	would
O	come
O	such
O	crowds
O	of
O	these
O	great
O	coarse
O	creatures
O	of
O	mankind
O	nobody
O	would
O	have
O	peace
O	for
O	leagues
O	round
O	But
O	you
O	will
O	surely
O	send
O	word
O	to
O	the
O	sweet
C	Princess
O	was
O	so
O	kind
O	to
O	our
O	birds
O	and
O	butterflies
O	and
O	danced
O	so
O	like
O	one
O	of
O	ourselves
O	Not
O	I
O	indeed
O	said
O	the
O	spiteful
O	fairy
O	Her
O	old
O	skinflint
O	of
O	a
C	father
O	cut
O	down
O	the
O	cedar
O	which
O	I
O	loved
O	best
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	forest
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	chest
O	of
O	it
O	to
O	hold
O	his
O	money
O	in
O	besides
O	I
O	never
O	liked
O	the
O	praised
O	her
O	so
O	But
O	come
O	we
O	shall
O	be
O	too
O	late
O	for
O	the
O	last
O	dance
O	When
O	they
O	were
O	gone
C	Fairyfoot
O	could
O	sleep
O	no
O	more
O	with
O	astonishment
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	wonder
O	at
O	the
O	fairies
O	admiring
O	his
O	feet
O	because
O	their
O	own
O	were
O	much
O	the
O	same
O	but
O	it
O	amazed
O	him
O	that
O	Princess
O	Maybloom
O	s
C	father
O	should
O	be
O	troubled
O	at
O	hers
O	growing
O	large
O	Moreover
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	same
C	Princess
O	and
O	her
O	country
O	since
O	there
O	were
O	really
O	other
O	places
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	than
O	Stumpinghame
O	When
C	Robin
C	Goodfellow
O	came
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	home
O	as
O	usual
O	he
O	durst
O	not
O	let
O	him
O	know
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	overheard
O	anything
O	but
O	never
O	was
O	the
C	boy
O	so
O	unwilling
O	to
O	get
O	up
O	as
O	on
O	that
O	morning
O	and
O	all
O	day
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	weary
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
C	Fairyfoot
O	fell
O	asleep
O	with
O	his
O	head
O	on
O	a
O	clump
O	of
O	rushes
O	It
O	was
O	seldom
O	that
O	any
O	one
O	thought
O	of
O	looking
O	after
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	sickly
O	sheep
O	but
O	it
O	so
O	happened
O	that
O	towards
O	evening
O	the
O	old
C	shepherd
C	Fleecefold
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	see
O	how
O	things
O	went
O	on
O	in
O	the
O	pastures
O	The
C	shepherd
O	had
O	a
O	bad
O	temper
O	and
O	a
O	thick
O	staff
O	and
O	no
O	sooner
O	did
O	he
O	catch
O	sight
O	of
C	Fairyfoot
O	sleeping
O	and
O	his
O	flock
O	straying
O	away
O	than
O	shouting
O	all
O	the
O	ill
O	names
O	he
O	could
O	remember
O	in
O	a
O	voice
O	which
O	woke
O	up
O	the
C	boy
O	he
O	ran
O	after
O	him
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	his
O	great
O	feet
O	would
O	allow
O	while
C	Fairyfoot
O	seeing
O	no
O	other
O	shelter
O	from
O	his
O	fury
O	fled
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	never
O	stopped
O	nor
O	stayed
O	till
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	stream
O	Thinking
O	it
O	might
O	lead
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	fairies
O	he
O	followed
O	that
O	stream
O	for
O	many
O	an
O	hour
O	but
O	it
O	wound
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	flowing
O	through
O	dells
O	falling
O	over
O	mossy
O	rocks
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	leading
C	Fairyfoot
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	tired
O	and
O	the
O	night
O	had
O	fallen
O	to
O	a
O	grove
O	of
O	great
O	with
O	the
O	moon
O	shining
O	on
O	it
O	as
O	bright
O	as
O	day
O	and
O	thousands
O	of
O	nightingales
O	singing
O	in
O	the
O	branches
O	In
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	that
O	grove
O	was
O	a
O	clear
O	spring
O	bordered
O	with
O	banks
O	of
O	lilies
O	and
C	Fairyfoot
O	sat
O	down
O	by
O	it
O	to
O	rest
O	himself
O	and
O	listen
O	The
O	singing
O	was
O	so
O	sweet
O	he
O	could
O	have
O	listened
O	for
O	ever
O	but
O	as
O	he
O	sat
O	the
O	nightingales
O	left
O	off
O	their
O	songs
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	talk
O	together
O	in
O	the
O	silence
O	of
O	the
O	What
C	boy
O	is
O	that
O	said
O	one
O	on
O	a
O	branch
O	above
O	him
O	who
O	sits
O	so
O	lonely
O	by
O	the
O	Fair
O	Fountain
O	He
O	cannot
O	have
O	come
O	from
O	Stumpinghame
O	with
O	such
O	small
O	and
O	handsome
O	feet
O	No
O	I
O	ll
O	warrant
O	you
O	said
O	another
O	he
O	has
O	come
O	from
O	the
O	west
O	country
O	How
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	did
O	he
O	find
O	the
O	way
O	How
O	simple
O	you
O	are
O	said
O	a
O	third
O	nightingale
O	What
O	had
O	he
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	follow
O	the
O	which
O	grows
O	over
O	height
O	and
O	hollow
O	bank
O	and
O	bush
O	from
O	the
O	lowest
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	kitchen
O	garden
O	to
O	the
O	root
O	of
O	this
O	He
O	looks
O	a
O	wise
C	boy
O	and
O	I
O	hope
O	he
O	will
O	keep
O	the
O	secret
O	or
O	we
O	shall
O	have
O	all
O	the
O	west
O	country
O	here
O	dabbling
O	in
O	our
O	fountain
O	and
O	leaving
O	us
O	no
O	rest
O	to
O	either
O	talk
O	or
O	sing
C	Fairyfoot
O	sat
O	in
O	great
O	astonishment
O	at
O	this
O	discourse
O	but
O	by
O	and
O	by
O	when
O	the
O	talk
O	ceased
O	and
O	the
O	songs
O	began
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	might
O	be
O	as
O	well
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	follow
O	the
O	and
O	see
O	the
C	Princess
C	Maybloom
O	not
O	to
O	speak
O	of
O	getting
O	rid
O	of
C	Rough
C	Ruddy
O	the
O	sickly
O	sheep
O	and
O	the
O	crusty
O	old
C	shepherd
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	journey
O	but
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	eating
O	wild
O	berries
O	by
O	day
O	sleeping
O	in
O	the
O	hollows
O	of
O	old
O	trees
O	by
O	night
O	and
O	never
O	losing
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	which
O	led
O	him
O	over
O	height
O	and
O	hollow
O	bank
O	and
O	bush
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	along
O	a
O	noble
O	high
O	road
O	with
O	fields
O	and
O	villages
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	city
O	and
O	a
O	low
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	which
O	was
O	thought
O	too
O	mean
O	for
O	the
O	scullions
O	and
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	opened
O	for
O	seven
O	years
O	There
O	was
O	no
O	use
O	gate
O	was
O	overgrown
O	with
O	tall
O	weeds
O	and
O	moss
O	so
O	being
O	an
O	active
C	boy
O	he
O	climbed
O	over
O	and
O	walked
O	through
O	the
O	garden
O	till
O	a
O	white
O	fawn
O	came
O	frisking
O	by
O	and
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	soft
O	voice
O	saying
O	Come
O	back
O	come
O	back
O	my
O	fawn
O	I
O	cannot
O	run
O	and
O	play
O	with
O	you
O	now
O	my
O	feet
O	have
O	grown
O	so
O	heavy
O	and
O	looking
O	round
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	loveliest
O	young
C	Princess
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	dressed
O	in
O	and
O	wearing
O	a
O	wreath
O	of
O	roses
O	on
O	her
O	golden
O	hair
O	but
O	walking
O	slowly
O	as
O	the
O	great
O	people
O	did
O	in
O	Stumpinghame
O	for
O	her
O	feet
O	were
O	as
O	large
O	as
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	them
O	After
O	her
O	came
O	six
O	young
O	ladies
O	dressed
O	in
O	white
O	and
O	walking
O	slowly
O	for
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	go
O	before
O	the
C	Princess
O	but
C	Fairyfoot
O	was
O	amazed
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	their
O	feet
O	were
O	as
O	small
O	as
O	his
O	own
O	At
O	once
O	he
O	guessed
O	that
O	this
O	must
O	be
O	the
C	Princess
C	Maybloom
O	and
O	made
O	her
O	an
O	humble
O	bow
O	Royal
C	Princess
O	I
O	have
O	heard
O	of
O	your
O	trouble
O	because
O	your
O	feet
O	have
O	grown
O	large
O	in
O	my
O	country
O	that
O	s
O	all
O	the
O	fashion
O	For
O	seven
O	years
O	past
O	I
O	have
O	been
O	wondering
O	what
O	would
O	make
O	mine
O	grow
O	to
O	no
O	purpose
O	but
O	I
O	know
O	of
O	a
O	certain
O	fountain
O	that
O	will
O	make
O	yours
O	smaller
O	and
O	finer
O	than
O	ever

O	gives
O	you
O	leave
O	to
O	come
O	with
O	me
O	accompanied
O	by
O	two
O	of
O	your
O	maids
O	that
O	are
O	the

O	given
O	to
O	talking
O	and
O	the
O	most
O	prudent
O	officer
O	in
O	all
O	his
O	household
O	for
O	it
O	would
O	grievously
O	offend
O	the
O	fairies
O	and
O	the
O	nightingales
O	to
O	make
O	that
O	fountain
O	known
O	When
O	the
C	Princess
O	heard
O	that
O	she
O	danced
O	for
O	joy
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	her
O	large
O	feet
O	and
O	she
O	and
O	her
O	six
O	maids
O	brought
C	Fairyfoot
O	before
O	the
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	where
O	they
O	sat
O	in
O	their
O	palace
O	hall
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	courtiers
O	paying
O	their
O	morning
O	compliments
O	The
O	lords
O	were
O	very
O	much
O	astonished
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	ragged
C	boy
O	brought
O	in
O	among
O	them
O	and
O	the
O	ladies
O	thought
C	Princess
C	Maybloom
O	must
O	have
O	gone
O	mad
O	but
C	Fairyfoot
O	making
O	an
O	humble
O	reverence
O	told
O	his
O	message
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	and
O	offered
O	to
O	set
O	out
O	with
O	the
C	Princess
O	that
O	very
O	day
O	At
O	first
O	the
C	king
O	would
O	not
O	believe
O	that
O	there
O	could
O	be
O	any
O	use
O	in
O	his
O	offer
O	because
O	so
O	many
O	great
O	physicians
O	had
O	failed
O	to
O	give
O	any
O	relief
O	The
O	courtiers
O	laughed
C	Fairyfoot
O	to
O	scorn
O	the
O	pages
O	wanted
O	to
O	turn
O	him
O	out
O	for
O	an
O	impudent
O	impostor
O	and
O	the
O	said
O	he
O	ought
O	to
O	be
O	put
O	to
O	death
O	for
C	Fairyfoot
O	wished
O	himself
O	safe
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	again
O	or
O	even
O	keeping
O	the
O	sickly
O	sheep
O	but
O	the
C	queen
O	being
O	a
O	prudent
O	woman
O	I
O	pray
O	your
O	majesty
O	to
O	notice
O	what
O	fine
O	feet
O	this
C	boy
O	has
O	There
O	may
O	be
O	some
O	truth
O	in
O	his
O	story
O	For
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	our
O	only
O	daughter
O	I
O	will
O	choose
O	two
O	maids
O	who
O	talk
O	the
O	least
O	of
O	all
O	our
O	train
O	and
O	my
O	chamberlain
O	who
O	is
O	the
O	most
O	discreet
O	officer
O	in
O	our
O	household
O	Let
O	them
O	go
O	with
O	the
C	Princess
O	who
O	knows
O	but
O	our
O	sorrow
O	may
O	be
O	lessened
O	After
O	some
O	persuasion
O	the
C	king
O	consented
O	though
O	all
O	his
O	councillors
O	advised
O	the
O	contrary
O	So
O	the
O	two
O	silent
O	maids
O	the
O	discreet
O	chamberlain
O	and
O	her
O	fawn
O	which
O	would
O	not
O	stay
O	behind
O	were
O	sent
O	with
C	Princess
C	Maybloom
O	and
O	they
O	all
O	set
O	out
O	after
O	dinner
C	Fairyfoot
O	had
O	hard
O	work
O	guiding
O	them
O	along
O	the
O	track
O	of
O	the
O	The
O	maids
O	and
O	the
O	chamberlain
O	did
O	not
O	like
O	the
O	brambles
O	and
O	rough
O	roots
O	of
O	the
O	thought
O	it
O	hard
O	to
O	eat
O	berries
O	and
O	sleep
O	in
O	hollow
O	trees
O	but
O	the
C	Princess
O	went
O	on
O	with
O	good
O	courage
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	grove
O	of
O	and
O	the
O	spring
O	bordered
O	with
O	lilies
O	The
O	chamberlain
O	though
O	his
O	hair
O	had
O	been
O	grey
O	and
O	his
O	face
O	wrinkled
O	the
O	young
O	courtiers
O	envied
O	his
O	beauty
O	for
O	years
O	after
O	The
O	maids
O	from
O	that
O	day
O	they
O	were
O	esteemed
O	the
O	fairest
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	palace
O	Lastly
O	the
C	Princess
O	washed
O	could
O	make
O	her
O	no
O	fairer
O	but
O	the
O	moment
O	her
O	feet
O	touched
O	the
O	water
O	they
O	grew
O	less
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	washed
O	and
O	dried
O	them
O	three
O	times
O	they
O	were
O	as
O	small
O	and
O	as
O	Fairyfoot
O	s
O	own
O	There
O	was
O	great
O	joy
O	among
O	them
O	but
O	the
C	boy
O	said
O	Oh
O	if
O	there
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	well
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	to
O	make
O	my
O	feet
O	large
O	my
C	father
O	and
C	mother
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	cast
O	me
O	off
O	nor
O	sent
O	me
O	to
O	live
O	among
O	the
O	shepherds
O	Cheer
O	up
O	your
O	heart
O	said
O	the
C	Princess
C	Maybloom
O	if
O	you
O	want
O	large
O	feet
O	there
O	is
O	a
O	well
O	in
O	this
O	forest
O	that
O	will
O	do
O	it
O	Last
O	summer
O	time
O	I
O	came
O	with
O	my
C	father
O	and
O	his
O	foresters
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	great
O	cedar
O	cut
O	down
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	meant
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	money
O	chest
O	While
O	they
O	were
O	busy
O	with
O	the
O	cedar
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	bramble
O	branch
O	covered
O	with
O	berries
O	Some
O	were
O	ripe
O	and
O	some
O	were
O	green
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	longest
O	bramble
O	that
O	ever
O	grew
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	the
O	berries
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	to
O	its
O	root
O	which
O	grew
O	hard
O	by
O	a
O	well
O	with
O	banks
O	of
O	dark
O	green
O	moss
O	in
O	the
O	deepest
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	The
O	day
O	was
O	warm
O	and
O	dry
O	and
O	my
O	feet
O	were
O	sore
O	with
O	the
O	rough
O	ground
O	so
O	I
O	took
O	off
O	my
O	scarlet
O	shoes
O	and
O	washed
O	my
O	feet
O	in
O	the
O	well
O	but
O	as
O	I
O	washed
O	they
O	grew
O	larger
O	every
O	minute
O	and
O	nothing
O	could
O	ever
O	make
O	them
O	less
O	again
O	I
O	have
O	seen
O	the
O	bramble
O	this
O	day
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	far
O	off
O	and
O	as
O	you
O	have
O	shown
O	me
O	the
O	Fair
O	Fountain
O	I
O	will
O	show
O	you
O	the
O	Growing
O	Well
O	Up
O	rose
C	Fairyfoot
O	and
C	Princess
C	Maybloom
O	and
O	went
O	together
O	till
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	bramble
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	where
O	its
O	root
O	grew
O	hard
O	by
O	the
O	well
O	with
O	banks
O	of
O	dark
O	green
O	moss
O	in
O	the
O	deepest
O	dell
O	of
O	the
O	forest
C	Fairyfoot
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	wash
O	but
O	at
O	that
O	minute
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	sound
O	of
O	music
O	and
O	knew
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	fairies
O	going
O	to
O	their
O	dancing
O	ground
O	If
O	my
O	feet
O	grow
O	large
O	said
O	the
C	boy
O	to
O	himself
O	how
O	shall
O	I
O	dance
O	with
O	them
O	So
O	rising
O	quickly
O	he
O	took
O	the
C	Princess
C	Maybloom
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	The
O	fawn
O	followed
O	them
O	the
O	maids
O	and
O	the
O	chamberlain
O	followed
O	it
O	and
O	all
O	followed
O	the
O	music
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	At
O	last
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	flowery
O	green
C	Robin
C	Goodfellow
O	welcomed
O	the
O	company
O	for
O	Fairyfoot
O	s
O	sake
O	and
O	gave
O	every
O	one
O	a
O	drink
O	of
O	the
O	fairies
O	wine
O	So
O	they
O	danced
O	there
O	from
O	sunset
O	till
O	the
O	grey
O	morning
O	and
O	nobody
O	was
O	tired
O	but
O	before
O	the
O	lark
O	sang
C	Robin
C	Goodfellow
O	took
O	them
O	all
O	safe
O	home
O	as
O	he
O	used
O	to
O	take
C	Fairyfoot
O	There
O	was
O	great
O	joy
O	that
O	day
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	because
O	Princess
O	Maybloom
O	s
O	feet
O	were
O	made
O	small
O	again
O	The
C	king
O	gave
C	Fairyfoot
O	all
O	manner
O	of
O	fine
O	clothes
O	and
O	rich
O	jewels
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	heard
O	his
O	wonderful
O	story
O	he
O	and
O	the
C	queen
O	asked
O	him
O	to
O	live
O	with
O	them
O	and
O	be
O	their
O	son
O	In
O	process
O	of
O	time
C	Fairyfoot
O	and
C	Princess
C	Maybloom
O	were
O	married
O	and
O	still
O	live
O	happily
O	When
O	they
O	go
O	to
O	visit
O	at
O	Stumpinghame
O	they
O	always
O	wash
O	their
O	feet
O	in
O	the
O	Growing
O	Well
O	lest
O	the
O	royal
O	family
O	might
O	think
O	them
O	a
O	disgrace
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	come
O	back
O	they
O	make
O	haste
O	to
O	the
O	Fair
O	Fountain
O	and
O	the
O	fairies
O	and
O	the
O	nightingales
O	are
O	great
O	friends
O	to
O	them
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	maids
O	and
O	the
O	chamberlain
O	because
O	they
O	have
O	told
O	nobody
O	about
O	it
O	and
O	there
O	is
O	peace
O	and
O	quiet
O	yet
O	in
O	the
O	grove
O	of
C	Gareth
O	was
O	the
O	youngest
O	of
O	the
O	sons
O	of
C	Lot
O	and
C	Bellicent
O	and
O	had
O	grown
O	up
O	long
O	after
C	Gawain
O	and
C	Mordred
O	left
O	their
O	home
O	for
C	King
C	Arthur
C	s
C	court
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	before
O	the
C	King
O	all
O	humbly
O	attired
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	known
O	even
O	by
O	his
O	own
O	brothers
C	King
C	Arthur
O	was
O	keeping
O	Pentecost
O	at
O	Kink
O	Kenadon
O	on
O	the
O	Welsh
O	border
O	and
O	as
O	his
O	custom
O	was
O	waited
O	to
O	begin
O	the
O	feast
O	until
O	some
O	adventure
O	should
O	befall
O	Presently
O	there
O	was
O	seen
O	approaching
O	a
O	youth
O	who
O	to
O	the
O	wonderment
O	of
O	all
O	that
O	saw
O	leaned
O	upon
O	the
O	shoulders
O	of
O	two
O	men
O	his
O	companions
O	and
O	yet
O	as
O	he
O	passed
O	up
O	the
O	hall
O	he
O	seemed
O	a
O	goodly
O	youth
O	tall
O	and
O	When
O	he
O	stood
O	before
O	the
C	King
O	suddenly
O	he
O	drew
O	himself
O	up
O	and
O	after
O	due
O	greeting
O	said
C	Sir
C	King
O	I
O	would
O	ask
O	of
O	you
O	three
O	boons
O	one
O	to
O	be
O	granted
O	now
O	and
O	two
O	hereafter
O	when
O	I
O	shall
O	require
O	them
O	And
C	Arthur
O	looking
O	upon
O	him
O	was
O	pleased
O	for
O	his
O	countenance
O	was
O	open
O	and
O	honest
O	So
O	he
O	made
O	answer
O	Fair
O	son
O	ask
O	of
O	me
O	aught
O	that
O	is
O	honorable
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	grant
O	it
O	Then
O	the
O	youth
O	said
O	For
O	this
O	present
O	I
O	ask
O	only
O	that
O	ye
O	will
O	give
O	me
O	meat
O	and
O	drink
O	for
O	a
O	year
O	and
O	a
O	day
O	Ye
O	might
O	have
O	asked
O	and
O	had
O	a
O	better
O	gift
O	replied
O	the
C	King
O	tell
O	me
O	now
O	your
O	name
O	At
O	this
O	time
O	I
O	may
O	not
O	tell
O	it
O	said
O	the
O	youth
O	Now
C	King
C	Arthur
O	trusted
O	every
O	man
O	until
O	he
O	proved
O	himself
O	unworthy
O	and
O	in
O	this
O	youth
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	saw
O	one
O	who
O	should
O	do
O	nobly
O	and
O	win
O	renown
O	so
O	laughing
O	he
O	bade
O	him
O	keep
O	his
O	own
O	counsel
O	since
O	so
O	he
O	would
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	in
O	charge
O	to
C	Sir
C	Kay
O	the
O	seneschal
O	Now
C	Sir
C	Kay
O	was
O	but
O	harsh
O	to
O	those
O	whom
O	he
O	liked
O	not
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	first
O	he
O	scorned
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	For
O	none
O	said
O	he
O	but
O	a
O	lout
O	would
O	crave
O	meat
O	and
O	drink
O	when
O	he
O	might
O	have
O	asked
O	for
O	a
O	horse
O	and
O	arms
O	But
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	and
C	Sir
C	Gawain
O	took
O	the
O	youth
O	s
O	part
O	Neither
O	knew
O	him
O	for
C	Gareth
O	of
O	the
O	Orkneys
O	but
O	both
O	believed
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	youth
O	of
O	good
O	promise
O	who
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	reasons
O	would
O	pass
O	in
O	disguise
O	for
O	a
O	season
O	So
C	Gareth
O	lived
O	the
O	year
O	among
O	the
O	kitchen
O	boys
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	mocked
O	and
O	scorned
O	by
C	Sir
C	Kay
O	who
O	called
O	him
O	Fairhands
O	because
O	his
O	hands
O	were
O	white
O	and
O	shapely
O	But
C	Launcelot
O	and
C	Gawain
O	showed
O	him
O	all
O	courtesy
O	and
O	failed
O	not
O	to
O	observe
O	how
O	in
O	all
O	trials
O	of
O	strength
O	he
O	excelled
O	his
O	comrades
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	ever
O	present
O	to
O	witness
O	the
O	feats
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	in
O	the
O	tournaments
O	So
O	the
O	year
O	passed
O	and
O	again
C	King
C	Arthur
O	was
O	keeping
O	the
O	feast
O	of
O	Pentecost
O	with
O	his
O	knights
O	when
O	a
O	damsel
O	entered
O	the
O	hall
O	and
O	asked
O	his
O	aid
O	For
O	said
O	she
O	my
C	sister
O	is
O	closely
O	besieged
O	in
O	her
O	castle
O	by
O	a
O	strong
C	Knight
O	who
O	lays
O	waste
O	all
O	her
O	lands
O	And
O	since
O	I
O	know
O	that
O	the
O	knights
O	of
O	your
O	court
O	be
O	the
O	most
O	renowned
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	I
O	have
O	come
O	to
O	crave
O	help
O	of
O	your
O	mightiest
O	What
O	is
O	your
O	sister
O	s
O	name
O	and
O	who
O	is
O	he
O	that
O	oppresses
O	her
O	asked
O	the
C	King
O	The
C	Red
C	Knight
O	he
O	is
O	called
O	replied
O	the
O	damsel
O	As
O	for
O	my
C	sister
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	say
O	her
O	name
O	only
O	that
O	she
O	is
O	a
C	Lady
O	and
O	owns
O	broad
O	lands
O	Then
O	the
C	King
O	frowned
O	and
O	said
O	Ye
O	would
O	have
O	aid
O	but
O	will
O	say
O	no
O	name
O	I
O	may
O	not
O	ask
C	Knight
O	of
O	mine
O	to
O	go
O	on
O	such
O	an
O	errand
O	Then
O	forth
O	stepped
C	Gareth
O	from
O	among
O	the
O	at
O	the
O	hall
O	end
O	and
O	said
C	Sir
C	King
O	I
O	have
O	eaten
O	of
O	your
O	meat
O	in
O	your
O	kitchen
O	this
O	twelvemonth
O	since
O	and
O	now
O	I
O	crave
O	my
O	other
O	two
O	boons
O	Ask
O	and
O	have
O	replied
O	the
C	King
O	Grant
O	me
O	then
O	the
O	adventure
O	of
O	this
O	damsel
O	and
O	bid
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	ride
O	after
O	me
O	to
C	Knight
O	me
O	at
O	my
O	desire
O	for
O	of
O	him
O	alone
O	would
O	I
O	be
O	made
C	Knight
O	It
O	shall
O	be
O	so
O	answered
O	the
C	King
O	What
O	cried
O	the
O	damsel
O	I
O	ask
O	for
O	a
C	Knight
O	and
O	ye
O	give
O	me
O	a
O	Shame
O	on
O	you
C	Sir
C	King
O	And
O	in
O	great
O	wrath
O	she
O	fled
O	from
O	the
O	hall
O	mounted
O	her
O	palfrey
O	and
O	rode
O	away
C	Gareth
O	but
O	waited
O	to
O	array
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	armor
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	kept
O	ever
O	in
O	readiness
O	for
O	the
O	time
O	when
O	he
O	should
O	need
O	it
O	and
O	mounting
O	his
O	horse
O	rode
O	after
O	the
O	damsel
O	But
O	when
C	Sir
C	Kay
O	knew
O	what
O	had
O	happened
O	he
O	was
O	wroth
O	and
O	got
O	to
O	horse
O	to
O	ride
O	after
C	Gareth
O	and
O	bring
O	him
O	back
O	Even
O	as
C	Gareth
O	overtook
O	the
O	damsel
O	so
O	did
C	Kay
O	come
O	up
O	with
O	him
O	and
O	cried
O	Turn
O	back
O	Fairhands
O	What
C	Sir
O	do
O	ye
O	not
O	know
O	me
O	Yes
O	answered
C	Gareth
O	I
O	know
O	you
O	for
O	the
O	most
O	discourteous
C	Knight
O	in
C	Arthur
O	s
O	court
O	Then
C	Sir
C	Kay
O	rode
O	upon
O	him
O	with
O	his
O	lance
O	but
C	Gareth
O	turned
O	it
O	aside
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	and
O	pierced
C	Sir
C	Kay
O	through
O	the
O	side
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	lay
O	there
O	without
O	motion
O	So
C	Gareth
O	took
C	Sir
O	Kay
O	s
O	shield
O	and
O	spear
O	and
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	ride
O	away
O	when
O	seeing
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	draw
O	near
O	he
O	called
O	upon
O	him
O	to
O	joust
O	At
O	the
O	first
O	encounter
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	unhorsed
C	Gareth
O	but
O	quickly
O	helped
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	feet
O	Then
O	at
C	Gareth
O	s
O	desire
O	they
O	fought
O	together
O	with
O	swords
O	and
C	Gareth
O	did
O	knightly
O	till
O	at
O	length
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	said
O	laughing
O	Why
O	should
O	we
O	fight
O	any
O	longer
O	Of
O	a
O	truth
O	ye
O	are
O	a
O	stout
C	Knight
O	If
O	that
O	is
O	indeed
O	your
O	thought
O	I
O	pray
O	you
O	make
O	me
C	Knight
O	cried
C	Gareth
O	So
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	knighted
C	Gareth
O	who
O	bidding
O	him
O	farewell
O	hastened
O	after
O	the
O	damsel
O	for
O	she
O	had
O	ridden
O	on
O	again
O	while
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	talked
O	When
O	she
O	saw
O	him
O	coming
O	she
O	cried
O	Keep
O	off
O	ye
O	smell
O	of
O	the
O	kitchen
O	Damsel
O	said
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	I
O	must
O	follow
O	until
O	I
O	have
O	fulfilled
O	the
O	adventure
O	Till
O	ye
O	accomplish
O	the
O	adventure
O	Your
O	part
O	in
O	it
O	shall
O	soon
O	be
O	ended
O	I
O	can
O	only
O	do
O	my
O	best
O	answered
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	Now
O	as
O	they
O	rode
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	they
O	met
O	with
O	a
C	Knight
O	sore
O	beset
O	by
O	six
O	thieves
O	and
O	him
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	rescued
O	The
C	Knight
O	then
O	bade
C	Gareth
O	and
O	the
O	damsel
O	rest
O	at
O	his
O	castle
O	and
O	entertained
O	them
O	right
O	gladly
O	until
O	the
O	morn
O	when
O	the
O	two
O	rode
O	forth
O	again
O	Presently
O	they
O	drew
O	near
O	to
O	a
O	deep
O	river
O	where
O	two
O	knights
O	kept
O	the
O	ford
O	How
O	now
O	kitchen
O	knave
O	Will
O	ye
O	fight
O	or
O	escape
O	while
O	ye
O	may
O	cried
O	the
O	damsel
O	I
O	would
O	fight
O	though
O	there
O	were
O	six
O	instead
O	of
O	two
O	replied
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	Therewith
O	he
O	encountered
O	the
O	one
C	Knight
O	in
O	midstream
O	and
O	struck
O	him
O	such
O	a
O	blow
O	on
O	the
O	head
O	that
O	he
O	fell
O	stunned
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	and
O	was
O	drowned
O	Then
O	gaining
O	the
O	land
C	Gareth
O	cleft
O	in
O	two
O	helmet
O	and
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	other
C	Knight
O	and
O	turned
O	to
O	the
O	damsel
O	saying
O	Lead
O	on
O	I
O	follow
O	But
O	the
O	damsel
O	mocked
O	him
O	saying
O	What
O	a
O	mischance
O	is
O	this
O	that
O	a
O	kitchen
O	boy
O	should
O	slay
O	two
O	noble
O	knights
O	Be
O	not
O	overproud
O	It
O	was
O	but
O	luck
O	if
O	indeed
O	ye
O	did
O	not
O	attack
O	one
C	Knight
O	from
O	behind
O	Say
O	what
O	you
O	will
O	I
O	follow
O	said
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	So
O	they
O	rode
O	on
O	again
O	the
O	damsel
O	in
O	front
O	and
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	behind
O	till
O	they
O	reached
O	a
O	wide
O	meadow
O	where
O	stood
O	many
O	fair
O	pavilions
O	and
O	one
O	the
O	largest
O	was
O	all
O	of
O	blue
O	and
O	the
O	men
O	who
O	stood
O	about
O	it
O	were
O	clothed
O	in
O	blue
O	and
O	bore
O	shields
O	and
O	spears
O	of
O	that
O	color
O	and
O	of
O	blue
O	too
O	were
O	the
O	trappings
O	of
O	the
O	horses
O	Then
O	said
O	the
O	damsel
O	Yonder
O	is
O	the
C	Blue
C	Knight
O	the
O	goodliest
O	that
O	ever
O	ye
O	have
O	looked
O	upon
O	and
O	five
O	hundred
O	knights
O	own
O	him
O	lord
O	I
O	will
O	encounter
O	him
O	said
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	for
O	if
O	he
O	be
O	good
C	Knight
O	and
O	true
O	as
O	ye
O	say
O	he
O	will
O	scarce
O	set
O	on
O	me
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	following
O	and
O	man
O	to
O	man
O	I
O	fear
O	him
O	not
O	Fie
O	said
O	the
O	damsel
O	for
O	a
O	dirty
O	knave
O	ye
O	brag
O	loud
O	And
O	even
O	if
O	ye
O	overcome
O	him
O	his
O	might
O	is
O	as
O	nothing
O	to
O	that
O	of
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	who
O	besieges
O	my
C	Lady
C	sister
O	So
O	get
O	ye
O	gone
O	while
O	ye
O	may
O	Damsel
O	said
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	ye
O	are
O	but
O	ungentle
O	so
O	to
O	rebuke
O	me
O	for
C	Knight
O	or
O	knave
O	I
O	have
O	done
O	you
O	good
O	service
O	nor
O	will
O	I
O	leave
O	this
O	guest
O	while
O	life
O	is
O	mine
O	Then
O	the
O	damsel
O	ashamed
O	and
O	looking
O	curiously
O	at
C	Gareth
O	she
O	said
O	I
O	would
O	gladly
O	know
O	what
O	manner
O	of
O	man
O	ye
O	are
O	For
O	I
O	heard
O	you
O	call
O	yourself
O	kitchen
O	knave
O	before
O	Arthur
O	s
O	self
O	but
O	ye
O	have
O	ever
O	answered
O	patiently
O	though
O	I
O	have
O	chidden
O	you
O	shamefully
O	and
O	courtesy
O	comes
O	only
O	of
O	gentle
O	blood
O	Thereat
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	but
O	laughed
O	and
O	said
O	He
O	is
O	no
C	Knight
O	whom
O	a
O	maiden
O	can
O	anger
O	by
O	harsh
O	words
O	So
O	talking
O	they
O	entered
O	the
O	field
O	and
O	there
O	came
O	to
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	a
O	messenger
O	from
O	the
C	Blue
C	Knight
O	to
O	ask
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	came
O	in
O	peace
O	or
O	in
O	war
O	As
O	your
O	lord
O	pleases
O	said
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	So
O	when
O	the
O	messenger
O	had
O	brought
O	back
O	this
O	word
O	the
C	Blue
C	Knight
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	took
O	his
O	spear
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	rode
O	upon
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	At
O	their
O	first
O	encounter
O	their
O	lances
O	shivered
O	to
O	pieces
O	and
O	such
O	was
O	the
O	shock
O	that
O	their
O	horses
O	fell
O	dead
O	So
O	they
O	rushed
O	on
O	each
O	other
O	with
O	swords
O	and
O	shield
O	cutting
O	and
O	slashing
O	till
O	the
O	armor
O	was
O	hacked
O	from
O	their
O	bodies
O	but
O	at
O	last
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	smote
O	the
C	Blue
C	Knight
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	Then
O	the
C	Blue
C	Knight
O	yielded
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	damsel
O	s
O	entreaty
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	spared
O	his
O	life
O	So
O	they
O	were
O	reconciled
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	request
O	of
O	the
C	Blue
C	Knight
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	and
O	the
O	damsel
O	abode
O	that
O	night
O	in
O	his
O	tents
O	As
O	they
O	sat
O	at
O	table
O	the
C	Blue
C	Knight
O	said
O	Fair
O	damsel
O	are
O	ye
O	not
O	called
C	Linet
O	Yes
O	answered
O	she
O	and
O	I
O	am
O	taking
O	this
O	noble
C	Knight
O	to
O	the
O	relief
O	of
O	my
C	sister
O	the
C	Lady
C	Liones
O	God
O	speed
O	you
C	Sir
O	said
O	the
C	Blue
C	Knight
O	for
O	he
O	is
O	a
O	stout
C	Knight
O	whom
O	ye
O	must
O	meet
O	Long
O	ago
O	might
O	he
O	have
O	taken
O	the
C	Lady
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	hoped
O	that
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	or
O	some
O	other
O	of
O	Arthur
O	s
O	most
O	famous

C	Gareth
O	I

O	me
O	worthily
O	as
O	one
O	whom
O	the
O	great
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	made
C	Knight
O	So
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	they
O	bade
O	farewell
O	to
O	the
C	Blue
C	Knight
O	who
O	vowed
O	to
O	carry
O	to
C	King
C	Arthur
O	word
O	of
O	all
O	that
C	Gareth
O	had
O	achieved
O	and
O	they
O	rode
O	on
O	till
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	ruined
O	hermitage
O	where
O	there
O	awaited
O	them
O	a
C	dwarf
O	sent
O	by
O	the
C	Lady
C	Liones
O	with
O	all
O	manner
O	of
O	meats
O	and
O	other
O	store
O	In
O	the
O	morning
O	the
C	dwarf
O	set
O	out
O	again
O	to
O	bear
O	word
O	to
O	his
C	Lady
O	that
O	her
O	rescuer
O	was
O	come
O	As
O	he
O	drew
O	near
O	the
O	castle
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	stopped
O	him
O	demanding
O	whence
O	he
O	came
C	Sir
O	said
O	the
C	dwarf
O	I
O	have
O	been
O	with
O	my
C	Lady
O	s
C	sister
O	who
O	brings
O	with
O	her
O	a
C	Knight
O	to
O	the
O	rescue
O	of
O	my
C	Lady
O	It
O	is
O	lost
O	labor
O	said
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	even
O	though
O	she
O	brought
C	Launcelot
O	or
C	Tristram
O	I
O	hold
O	myself
O	a
O	match
O	for
O	them
O	He
O	is
O	none
O	of
O	these
O	said
O	the
C	dwarf
O	but
O	he
O	has
O	overthrown
O	the
O	knights
O	who
O	kept
O	the
O	ford
O	and
O	the
C	Blue
C	Knight
O	yielded
O	to
O	him
O	Let
O	him
O	come
O	said
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	I
O	shall
O	soon
O	make
O	an
O	end
O	of
O	him
O	and
O	a
O	shameful
O	death
O	shall
O	he
O	have
O	at
O	my
O	hands
O	as
O	many
O	a
O	better
C	Knight
O	has
O	had
O	So
O	saying
O	he
O	let
O	the
C	dwarf
O	go
O	Presently
O	there
O	came
O	riding
O	toward
O	the
O	castle
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	and
O	the
O	damsel
C	Linet
O	and
C	Gareth
O	marvelled
O	to
O	see
O	hang
O	from
O	the
O	trees
O	some
O	forty
O	knights
O	in
O	goodly
O	armor
O	their
O	shields
O	reversed
O	beside
O	them
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	inquired
O	of
O	the
O	damsel
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	how
O	these
O	were
O	the
O	bodies
O	of
O	brave
O	knights
O	who
O	coming
O	to
O	the
O	rescue
O	of
O	the
C	Lady
C	Liones
O	had
O	been
O	overthrown
O	and
O	shamefully
O	done
O	to
O	death
O	by
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	Then
O	was
C	Gareth
O	shamed
O	and
O	angry
O	and
O	he
O	vowed
O	to
O	make
O	an
O	end
O	of
O	these
O	evil
O	practices
O	So
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	drew
O	near
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	walls
O	and
O	saw
O	how
O	the
O	plain
O	around
O	was
O	covered
O	with
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	s
O	tents
O	and
O	the
O	noise
O	was
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	army
O	Hard
O	by
O	was
O	a
O	tall
O	sycamore
O	tree
O	and
O	from
O	it
O	hung
O	a
O	mighty
O	horn
O	made
O	of
O	an
O	elephant
O	s
O	tusk
O	Spurring
O	his
O	horse
C	Gareth
O	rode
O	to
O	it
O	and
O	blew
O	such
O	a
O	blast
O	that
O	those
O	on
O	the
O	castle
O	walls
O	heard
O	it
O	the
O	knights
O	came
O	forth
O	from
O	their
O	tents
O	to
O	see
O	who
O	blew
O	so
O	bold
O	a
O	blast
O	and
O	from
O	a
O	window
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	the
C	Lady
C	Liones
O	looked
O	forth
O	and
O	waved
O	her
O	hand
O	to
O	her
O	champion
O	Then
O	as
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	made
O	his
O	reverence
O	to
O	the
C	Lady
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	called
O	roughly
O	to
O	him
O	to
O	leave
O	his
O	courtesy
O	and
O	look
O	to
O	himself
O	For
O	said
O	he
O	she
O	is
O	mine
O	and
O	to
O	have
O	her
O	I
O	have
O	fought
O	many
O	a
O	battle
O	It
O	is
O	but
O	vain
O	labor
O	said
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	since
O	she
O	loves
O	you
O	not
O	Know
O	too
C	Sir
C	Knight
O	that
O	I
O	have
O	vowed
O	to
O	rescue
O	her
O	from
O	you
O	So
O	did
O	many
O	another
O	who
O	now
O	hangs
O	on
O	a
O	tree
O	replied
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	and
O	soon
O	ye
O	shall
O	hang
O	beside
O	them
O	Then
O	both
O	laid
O	their
O	spears
O	in
O	rest
O	and
O	spurred
O	their
O	horses
O	At
O	the
O	first
O	encounter
O	each
O	smote
O	the
O	other
O	full
O	in
O	the
O	shield
O	and
O	the
O	girths
O	of
O	the
O	saddles
O	bursting
O	they
O	were
O	borne
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	where
O	they
O	lay
O	for
O	a
O	while
O	as
O	if
O	dead
O	But
O	presently
O	they
O	rose
O	and
O	setting
O	their
O	shields
O	before
O	them
O	rushed
O	upon
O	each
O	other
O	with
O	their
O	swords
O	cutting
O	and
O	hacking
O	till
O	the
O	armor
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	in
O	fragments
O	So
O	they
O	fought
O	till
O	noon
O	and
O	then
O	rested
O	but
O	soon
O	they
O	renewed
O	the
O	battle
O	and
O	so
O	furiously
O	they
O	fought
O	that
O	often
O	they
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	together
O	Then
O	when
O	the
O	bells
O	sounded
O	for
O	evensong
O	the
O	knights
O	rested
O	again
O	unlacing
O	their
O	helms
O	to
O	breathe
O	the
O	evening
O	air
O	But
O	looking
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	windows
C	Gareth
O	saw
O	the
C	Lady
C	Liones
O	gazing
O	earnestly
O	upon
O	him
O	then
O	he
O	caught
O	up
O	his
O	helmet
O	and
O	calling
O	to
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	bade
O	him
O	make
O	ready
O	for
O	the
O	battle
O	And
O	this
O	time
O	said
O	he
O	we
O	will
O	make
O	an
O	end
O	of
O	it
O	So
O	be
O	it
O	said
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	Then
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	smote
C	Gareth
O	on
O	the
O	hand
O	so
O	that
O	his
O	sword
O	flew
O	from
O	his
O	grasp
O	and
O	with
O	another
O	blow
O	he
O	brought
O	him
O	grovelling
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	At
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	this
C	Linet
O	cried
O	aloud
O	and
O	hearing
O	her
C	Gareth
O	with
O	a
O	mighty
O	effort
O	threw
O	off
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	leaped
O	to
O	his
O	sword
O	and
O	got
O	it
O	again
O	within
O	his
O	hand
O	Then
O	he
O	pressed
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	harder
O	than
O	ever
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	last
O	bore
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	and
O	unlacing
O	his
O	helm
O	made
O	ready
O	to
O	slay
O	him
O	but
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	cried
O	aloud
O	Mercy
O	I
O	yield
O	At
O	first
O	remembering
O	the
O	evil
O	deaths
O	of
O	the
O	forty
O	good
O	knights
C	Gareth
O	was
O	unwilling
O	to
O	spare
O	him
O	but
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	besought
O	him
O	to
O	have
O	mercy
O	telling
O	him
O	how
O	against
O	his
O	will
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	bound
O	by
O	a
O	vow
O	to
O	make
O	war
O	on
O	Arthur
O	s
O	knights
O	So
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	relented
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	set
O	forth
O	at
O	once
O	for
O	Kink
O	Kenadon
O	and
O	entreat
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	pardon
O	for
O	his
O	evil
O	past
O	And
O	this
O	the
C	Red
C	Knight
O	promised
O	to
O	do
O	Then
O	amid
O	much
O	rejoicing
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	was
O	borne
O	into
O	the
O	castle
O	There
O	his
O	wounds
O	were
O	dressed
O	by
O	the
C	Lady
C	Liones
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	rested
O	until
O	he
O	recovered
O	his
O	strength
O	And
O	having
O	won
O	her
O	love
O	when
C	Gareth
O	returned
O	to
C	Arthur
C	s
C	court
O	the
C	Lady
C	Liones
O	rode
O	with
O	him
O	and
O	they
O	two
O	were
O	wed
O	with
O	great
O	pomp
O	in
O	the
O	presence
O	of
O	the
O	whole
O	fellowship
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	the
C	King
O	rejoicing
O	much
O	that
O	his
O	nephew
O	had
O	done
O	so
O	valiantly
O	So
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	lived
O	happily
O	with
O	Dame
O	Liones
O	winning
O	fame
O	and
O	the
O	love
O	of
O	all
O	true
O	knights
O	As
O	for
C	Linet
O	she
O	came
O	again
O	to
C	Arthur
C	s
C	court
O	and
O	wedded
C	Sir
C	Gareth
O	s
O	younger
O	brother
C	Sir
C	Gaheris
O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	a
C	king
O	hunting
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	forest
O	chased
O	a
O	wild
O	boar
O	so
O	eagerly
O	that
O	none
O	of
O	his
O	people
O	could
O	follow
O	him
O	When
O	evening
O	came
O	he
O	stopped
O	to
O	look
O	about
O	him
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	lost
O	himself
O	He
O	sought
O	everywhere
O	for
O	a
O	way
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	but
O	could
O	find
O	none
O	Then
O	he
O	perceived
O	coming
O	towards
O	him
O	an
C	old
C	woman
O	whose
O	head
O	kept
O	constantly
O	shaking
O	She
O	was
O	a
C	witch
O	My
O	good
O	woman
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	her
O	cannot
O	you
O	show
O	me
O	the
O	way
O	through
O	the
O	wood
O	O
O	yes
O	your
O	majesty
O	answered
O	she
O	that
O	I
O	can
O	but
O	only
O	on
O	one
O	condition
O	and
O	if
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	agree
O	to
O	it
O	you
O	will
O	never
O	get
O	out
O	and
O	must
O	die
O	here
O	of
O	hunger
O	What
O	is
O	the
O	condition
O	asked
O	the
C	king
O	I
O	have
O	an
O	only
O	daughter
O	said
O	the
C	old
C	woman
O	she
O	is
O	as
O	beautiful
O	as
O	any
O	one
O	you
O	could
O	find
O	in
O	the
O	wide
O	world
O	and
O	well
O	deserves
O	to
O	be
O	your
O	wife
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	make
O	her
O	your
C	queen
O	I
O	will
O	show
O	you
O	the
O	way
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	The
C	king
O	in
O	the
O	fear
O	of
O	his
O	heart
O	consented
O	and
O	the
C	old
C	woman
O	led
O	him
O	to
O	her
O	house
O	where
O	her
O	daughter
O	sat
O	by
O	the
O	fire
O	She
O	received
O	the
C	king
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	expected
O	him
O	and
O	he
O	saw
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	very
O	beautiful
O	but
O	still
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	please
O	him
O	and
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	look
O	at
O	her
O	without
O	a
O	secret
O	shudder
O	After
O	he
O	had
O	lifted
O	up
O	the
O	maiden
O	beside
O	him
O	on
O	his
O	horse
O	the
C	old
C	woman
O	showed
O	him
O	the
O	way
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	arrived
O	again
O	at
O	his
O	royal
O	castle
O	where
O	the
O	wedding
O	was
O	celebrated
O	He
O	had
O	been
O	married
O	once
O	before
O	and
O	had
O	by
O	his
O	first
O	wife
O	seven
O	children
O	six
O	boys
O	and
O	a
O	girl
O	whom
O	he
O	loved
O	more
O	than
O	anything
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	But
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	afraid
O	that
O	the
C	stepmother
O	might
O	not
O	treat
O	them
O	well
O	or
O	might
O	even
O	do
O	them
O	some
O	harm
O	he
O	took
O	them
O	to
O	a
O	lonely
O	castle
O	which
O	stood
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	a
O	wood
O	It
O	was
O	so
O	hidden
O	and
O	the
O	road
O	was
O	so
O	difficult
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	he
O	himself
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	found
O	it
O	if
O	a
O	wise
O	woman
O	had
O	not
O	given
O	him
O	a
O	wonderful
O	skein
O	of
O	thread
O	which
O	when
O	he
O	threw
O	it
O	down
O	before
O	him
O	unrolled
O	of
O	itself
O	and
O	showed
O	him
O	the
O	way
O	The
C	king
O	went
O	out
O	so
O	often
O	to
O	his
O	dear
O	children
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	noticed
O	his
O	absence
O	and
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	curiosity
O	to
O	know
O	what
O	business
O	took
O	him
O	thus
O	alone
O	to
O	the
O	wood
O	So
O	she
O	gave
O	his
O	servants
O	a
O	sum
O	of
O	money
O	and
O	they
O	told
O	her
O	the
O	secret
O	and
O	also
O	told
O	her
O	of
O	the
O	skein
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	thing
O	that
O	could
O	show
O	the
O	way
O	After
O	that
O	she
O	never
O	rested
O	till
O	she
O	had
O	found
O	out
O	where
O	the
C	king
O	kept
O	the
O	skein
O	Then
O	she
O	made
O	some
O	little
O	white
O	silk
O	shirts
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	learned
O	witchcraft
O	from
O	her
C	mother
O	she
O	sewed
O	a
O	spell
O	into
O	every
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	And
O	one
O	day
O	when
O	the
C	king
O	was
O	gone
O	out
O	to
O	hunt
O	she
O	took
O	the
O	little
O	shirts
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	the
O	skein
O	showed
O	her
O	the
O	way
O	The
O	six
C	brothers
O	who
O	saw
O	some
O	one
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	thought
O	their
O	dear
O	father
O	was
O	coming
O	and
O	ran
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	full
O	of
O	joy
O	As
O	they
O	approached
O	the
C	queen
O	threw
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	shirts
O	over
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	shirts
O	touched
O	their
O	bodies
O	they
O	were
O	changed
O	into
C	swans
O	and
O	flew
O	away
O	over
O	the
O	wood
O	The
O	witch
O	s
O	daughter
O	went
O	home
O	quite
O	happy
O	and
O	thought
O	she
O	had
O	got
O	rid
O	of
O	all
O	her
O	stepchildren
O	but
O	the
O	one
O	little
O	girl
O	had
O	not
O	run
O	out
O	with
O	her
C	brothers
O	and
O	the
C	queen
O	knew
O	nothing
O	about
O	her
O	Next
O	day
O	the
C	king
O	came
O	joyfully
O	to
O	visit
O	his
O	children
O	but
O	he
O	found
O	nobody
O	except
O	the
O	little
O	sister
O	Where
O	are
O	your
C	brothers
O	asked
O	he
O	Oh
O	dear
O	father
O	she
O	answered
O	they
O	are
O	gone
O	and
O	have
O	left
O	me
O	alone
O	and
O	then
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	all
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	seen
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	window
O	how
O	her
C	brothers
O	were
O	turned
O	into
C	swans
O	and
O	had
O	flown
O	away
O	over
O	the
O	wood
O	she
O	also
O	showed
O	him
O	the
O	feathers
O	which
O	they
O	had
O	dropped
O	into
O	the
O	courtyard
O	and
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	picked
O	up
O	The
C	king
O	was
O	grieved
O	but
O	he
O	never
O	thought
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	had
O	done
O	this
O	wicked
O	deed
O	however
O	because
O	he
O	dreaded
O	lest
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	would
O	be
O	stolen
O	from
O	him
O	likewise
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	take
O	her
O	away
O	with
O	him
O	But
O	she
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	the
C	stepmother
O	and
O	begged
O	the
C	king
O	to
O	let
O	her
O	stay
O	one
O	night
O	more
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	The
O	poor
O	little
O	girl
O	thought
O	I
O	cannot
O	rest
O	here
O	any
O	longer
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	and
O	look
O	for
O	my
C	brothers
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	night
O	came
O	she
O	ran
O	away
O	and
O	went
O	straight
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	She
O	went
O	on
O	all
O	through
O	the
O	night
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	too
O	till
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	tired
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	go
O	no
O	further
O	Then
O	she
O	saw
O	a
O	little
O	house
O	and
O	went
O	in
O	and
O	found
O	a
O	room
O	with
O	six
O	little
O	beds
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	dare
O	to
O	lie
O	down
O	in
O	any
O	but
O	crept
O	under
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	laid
O	herself
O	on
O	the
O	hard
O	floor
O	and
O	meant
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	night
O	there
O	But
O	when
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	just
O	going
O	to
O	set
O	she
O	heard
O	a
O	rustling
O	and
O	saw
O	six
C	swans
O	come
O	flying
O	in
O	at
O	the
O	window
O	They
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	and
O	blew
O	at
O	one
O	another
O	and
O	blew
O	all
O	their
O	feathers
O	off
O	and
O	took
O	off
O	their
O	swan
O	like
O	shirts
O	Then
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	saw
O	them
O	and
O	recognised
O	her
C	brothers
O	and
O	was
O	very
O	glad
O	and
O	crept
O	out
O	from
O	under
O	the
O	bed
O	The
C	brothers
O	were
O	not
O	less
O	rejoiced
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	their
O	little
O	sister
O	but
O	their
O	joy
O	did
O	not
O	last
O	long
O	You
O	cannot
O	stop
O	here
O	said
O	they
O	to
O	her
O	this
O	is
O	a
O	house
O	belonging
O	to
O	robbers
O	if
O	they
O	come
O	home
O	and
O	find
O	you
O	they
O	will
O	kill
O	you
O	Cannot
O	you
O	protect
O	me
O	asked
O	the
O	little
O	sister
O	No
O	answered
O	they
O	we
O	can
O	only
O	take
O	off
O	our
O	swan
O	for
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	every
O	evening
O	and
O	have
O	our
O	natural
O	shape
O	for
O	that
O	time
O	but
O	afterwards
O	we
O	are
O	turned
O	into
C	swans
O	again
O	The
O	little
O	sister
O	cried
O	and
O	said
O	Cannot
O	you
O	be
O	released
O	Oh
O	no
O	answered
O	they
O	the
O	conditions
O	are
O	too
O	hard
O	You
O	must
O	not
O	speak
O	or
O	laugh
O	for
O	six
O	years
O	and
O	must
O	make
O	for
O	us
O	six
O	shirts
O	out
O	of
O	stitchweed
O	during
O	that
O	time
O	If
O	while
O	you
O	are
O	making
O	them
O	a
O	single
O	word
O	comes
O	from
O	your
O	mouth
O	all
O	your
O	work
O	will
O	be
O	of
O	no
O	use
O	When
O	her
C	brothers
O	had
O	said
O	this
O	the
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	was
O	over
O	and
O	they
O	turned
O	into
C	swans
O	again
O	and
O	flew
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	But
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	made
O	a
O	firm
O	resolution
O	to
O	release
O	her
C	brothers
O	even
O	if
O	it
O	cost
O	her
O	her
O	life
O	She
O	left
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	climbed
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	tree
O	and
O	spent
O	the
O	night
O	there
O	Next
O	morning
O	she
O	got
O	down
O	collected
O	a
O	quantity
O	of
O	stitchweed
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	sew
O	She
O	could
O	not
O	speak
O	to
O	any
O	one
O	and
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	want
O	to
O	laugh
O	so
O	she
O	sat
O	and
O	only
O	looked
O	at
O	her
O	work
O	When
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	there
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	of
O	the
O	country
O	was
O	hunting
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	his
O	hunters
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	tree
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	sat
O	They
O	called
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	said
O	Who
O	are
O	you
O	But
O	she
O	gave
O	them
O	no
O	answer
O	Come
O	down
O	to
O	us
O	said
O	they
O	we
O	will
O	not
O	do
O	you
O	any
O	harm
O	But
O	she
O	only
O	shook
O	her
O	head
O	As
O	they
O	kept
O	teasing
O	her
O	with
O	their
O	questions
O	she
O	threw
O	them
O	down
O	her
O	gold
O	necklace
O	and
O	thought
O	they
O	would
O	be
O	satisfied
O	with
O	that
O	But
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	leave
O	off
O	so
O	she
O	threw
O	her
O	sash
O	down
O	to
O	them
O	and
O	as
O	that
O	was
O	no
O	good
O	she
O	threw
O	down
O	her
O	garters
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	everything
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	on
O	and
O	could
O	spare
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	nothing
O	left
O	but
O	her
O	shift
O	But
O	the
O	hunters
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	sent
O	away
O	and
O	climbed
O	up
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	brought
O	down
O	the
O	little
O	girl
O	and
O	took
O	her
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	The
C	king
O	asked
O	Who
O	are
O	you
O	what
O	were
O	you
O	doing
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	But
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	answer
O	He
O	asked
O	it
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	languages
O	that
O	he
O	knew
O	but
O	she
O	remained
O	as
O	dumb
O	as
O	a
O	fish
O	But
O	because
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	beautiful
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	heart
O	was
O	moved
O	and
O	he
O	fell
O	deeply
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	her
O	He
O	wrapped
O	his
O	cloak
O	round
O	her
O	took
O	her
O	before
O	him
O	on
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	brought
O	her
O	to
O	his
O	castle
O	Then
O	he
O	had
O	her
O	dressed
O	in
O	rich
O	clothes
O	and
O	she
O	shone
O	in
O	her
O	beauty
O	like
O	bright
O	sunshine
O	but
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	a
O	word
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	He
O	set
O	her
O	by
O	him
O	at
O	the
O	table
O	and
O	her
O	modest
O	look
O	and
O	proper
O	behaviour
O	pleased
O	him
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	said
O	I
O	will
O	marry
O	her
O	and
O	no
O	one
O	else
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	he
O	was
O	married
O	to
O	her
O	But
O	the
C	king
O	had
O	a
O	wicked
C	mother
O	who
O	was
O	not
O	pleased
O	with
O	this
O	marriage
O	and
O	spoke
O	ill
O	of
O	the
O	young
C	queen
O	Who
O	knows
O	where
O	the
O	girl
O	comes
O	from
O	said
O	she
O	she
O	cannot
O	speak
O	she
O	is
O	not
O	good
O	enough
O	for
O	a
C	king
O	A
O	year
O	after
O	when
O	the
C	queen
O	brought
O	her
O	first
O	child
O	into
O	the
O	world
O	the
O	old
C	mother
O	took
O	it
O	away
O	and
O	smeared
O	her
O	mouth
O	with
O	blood
O	while
O	she
O	was
O	asleep
O	Then
O	she
O	went
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	and
O	accused
O	her
O	of
O	eating
O	her
O	child
O	The
C	king
O	would
O	not

O	it
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	let
O	anyone
O	do
O	her
O	any
O	harm
O	And
O	she
O	always
O	sat
O	and
O	sewed
O	the
O	shirts
O	and
O	took
O	no
O	notice
O	of
O	anything
O	else
O	Next
O	time
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	another
O	beautiful
O	baby
O	the
O	wicked
C	stepmother
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	as
O	before
O	but
O	the
C	king
O	could
O	not
O	resolve
O	to
O	believe
O	what
O	she
O	said
O	He
O	said
O	My
O	wife
O	is
O	too
O	pious
O	and
O	good
O	to
O	do
O	such
O	a
O	thing
O	if

O	time
O	the
C	old
C	woman
O	took
O	away

O	handsome
O	brave
O	and
O	noble
O	of
O	heart
O	Nevertheless
O	some
O	wicked
O	courtiers
O	made
O	their
O	father
O	believe
O	they
O	were
O	eager
O	to
O	wear
O	his
O	crown
O	which
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	old
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	mind
O	to
O	resign
O	He
O	therefore
O	invented
O	a
O	plan
O	to
O	get
O	them
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	and
O	prevent
O	their
O	carrying
O	out
O	any
O	undutiful
O	projects
O	Sending
O	for
O	them
O	to
O	a
O	private
O	audience
O	he
O	conversed
O	with
O	them
O	kindly
O	and
O	said
O	You
O	must
O	be
O	sensible
O	my
O	dear
O	children
O	that
O	my
O	great
O	age
O	prevents
O	me
O	from
O	attending
O	so
O	closely
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	hitherto
O	done
O	to
O	state
O	affairs
O	I
O	fear
O	this
O	may
O	be
O	injurious
O	to
O	my
O	subjects
O	I
O	therefore
O	desire
O	to
O	place
O	my
O	crown
O	on
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	one
O	of
O	you
O	but
O	it
O	is
O	no
O	more
O	than
O	just
O	that
O	in
O	return
O	for
O	such
O	a
O	present
O	you
O	should
O	procure
O	me
O	some
O	amusement
O	in
O	my
O	retirement
O	before
O	I
O	leave
O	the
O	capital
O	for
O	ever
O	I
O	cannot
O	help
O	thinking
O	that
O	a
O	little
C	dog
O	handsome
O	faithful
O	and
O	engaging
O	would
O	be
O	the
O	very
O	thing
O	to
O	make
O	me
O	happy
O	so
O	that
O	without
O	bestowing
O	a
O	preference
O	on
O	either
O	of
O	you
O	I
O	declare
O	that
O	he
O	who
O	brings
O	me
O	the
O	most
O	perfect
O	little
C	dog
O	shall
O	be
O	my
O	successor
O	The
O	princes
O	were
O	much
O	surprised
O	at
O	the
O	fancy
O	of
O	their
O	father
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	little
C	dog
O	yet
O	they
O	accepted
O	the
O	proposition
O	with
O	pleasure
O	and
O	accordingly
O	after
O	taking
O	leave
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	who
O	presented
O	them
O	with
O	abundance
O	of
O	money
O	and

O	and
O	appointed
O	that

O	for

O	they
O	set
O	off
O	on
O	their
O	travels
O	Before
O	separating
O	however
O	they
O	took
O	some
O	refreshment
O	together
O	in
O	an
O	old
O	palace
O	about
O	three
O	miles
O	out
O	of
O	town
O	where
O	they
O	mutually
O	agreed
O	to
O	meet
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	place
O	on
O	that
O	day
O	twelvemonth
O	and
O	go
O	all
O	together
O	with
O	their
O	presents
O	to

O	They
O	also
O	agreed
O	to
O	change
O	their
O	names
O	and
O	travel
O	incognito
O	Each
O	took
O	a
O	different
O	road
O	but
O	it
O	is
O	intended
O	to
O	relate
O	the
O	adventures
O	of
O	only
O	the
O	youngest
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	amiable
O	and
O	accomplished
C	prince
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	As
O	he
O	travelled
O	from
O	town
O	to
O	town
O	he
O	bought
O	all
O	the
O	handsome
O	dogs
O	that
O	fell
O	in
O	his
O	way
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	one
O	that
O	was
O	handsomer
O	than
O	those
O	he
O	had
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	present
O	of
O	the
O	rest
O	for
O	twenty
O	servants
O	would
O	scarcely
O	have
O	been
O	sufficient
O	to
O	take
O	care
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	dogs
O	he
O	was
O	continually
O	purchasing
O	At
O	length
O	wandering
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	whither
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	forest
O	night
O	suddenly
O	came
O	on
O	and
O	with
O	it
O	a
O	violent
O	storm
O	of
O	thunder
O	lightning
O	and
O	rain
O	to
O	add
O	to
O	his
O	perplexity
O	he
O	lost
O	his
O	way
O	After
O	he
O	had
O	groped
O	about
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	he
O	perceived
O	a
O	light
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	suppose
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	far
O	from
O	some
O	house
O	he
O	accordingly
O	pursued
O	his
O	way
O	towards
O	it
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	found
O	himself
O	at
O	the
O	gates
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	magnificent
O	palace
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	beheld
O	The
O	was
O	of
O	gold
O	covered
O	with
O	sapphires
O	which
O	shone
O	so
O	that
O	scarcely
O	could
O	the
O	strongest
O	eyesight
O	bear
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	it
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	light
O	the
C	prince
O	had
O	seen
O	from
O	the
O	forest
O	The
O	walls
O	were
O	of
O	transparent
O	porcelain
O	variously
O	coloured
O	and
O	represented
O	the
O	history
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	fairies
O	that
O	had
O	existed
O	from
O	the
O	beginning
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	The
C	prince
O	coming
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	golden
O	door
O	observed
O	a
O	deer
O	s
O	foot
O	fastened
O	to
O	a
O	chain
O	of
O	diamonds
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	wondering
O	at
O	the
O	magnificence
O	he
O	beheld
O	and
O	the
O	security
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	seemed
O	to
O	live
O	For
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	himself
O	nothing
O	could
O	be
O	easier
O	than
O	for
O	thieves
O	to
O	steal
O	this
O	chain
O	and
O	as
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	as
O	would
O	make
O	their
O	fortunes
O	He
O	pulled
O	the
O	chain
O	and
O	heard
O	a
O	bell
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	exquisite
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	the
O	door
O	was
O	opened
O	yet
O	he
O	perceived
O	nothing
O	but
O	twelve
O	hands
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	each
O	holding
O	a
O	torch
O	The
C	prince
O	was
O	so
O	astonished
O	that
O	he
O	durst
O	not
O	move
O	a
O	step
O	when
O	he
O	felt
O	himself
O	gently
O	pushed
O	on
O	by
O	some
O	other
O	hands
O	from
O	behind
O	him
O	He
O	walked
O	on
O	in
O	great
O	perplexity
O	till
O	he
O	entered
O	a
O	vestibule
O	inlaid
O	with
O	porphyry
O	and
O	where
O	the
O	most
O	melodious
O	voice
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	heard
O	chanted
O	the
O	following
O	words
O	Welcome
C	prince
O	no
O	danger
O	fear
O	Mirth
O	and
O	love
O	attend
O	you
O	here
O	You
O	shall
O	break
O	the
O	magic
O	spell
O	That
O	on
O	a
O	beauteous
O	lady
O	fell
O	Welcome
C	prince
O	no
O	danger
O	fear
O	Mirth
O	and
O	love
O	attend
O	you
O	here
O	The
C	prince
O	now
O	advanced
O	with
O	confidence
O	wondering
O	what
O	these
O	words
O	could
O	mean
O	the
O	hands
O	moved
O	him
O	forward
O	towards
O	a
O	large
O	door
O	of
O	coral
O	which
O	opened
O	of
O	itself
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	admittance
O	into
O	a
O	splendid
O	apartment
O	built
O	of
O	through
O	which
O	he
O	passed
O	into
O	others
O	so
O	richly
O	adorned
O	with
O	paintings
O	and
O	jewels
O	and
O	so
O	resplendently
O	lighted
O	with
O	thousands
O	of
O	lamps
O	girandoles
O	and
O	lustres
O	that
O	he
O	imagined
O	he
O	must
O	be
O	in
O	an
O	enchanted
O	palace
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	passed
O	through
O	sixty
O	apartments
O	all
O	equally
O	splendid
O	he
O	was
O	stopped
O	by
O	the
O	hands
O	and
O	a
O	large
O	easy
O	chair
O	advanced
O	of
O	itself
O	towards
O	the
O	fireplace
O	then
O	the
O	hands
O	which
O	he
O	observed
O	were
O	extremely
O	white
O	and
O	delicate
O	took
O	off
O	his
O	wet
O	clothes
O	and
O	supplied
O	their
O	place
O	with
O	the
O	finest
O	linen
O	imaginable
O	adding
O	a
O	comfortable
O	embroidered
O	with
O	gold
O	and
O	pearls
O	The
O	hands
O	next
O	brought
O	him
O	an
O	elegant
O	and
O	combed
O	his
O	hair
O	so
O	very
O	gently
O	that
O	he
O	scarcely
O	felt
O	their
O	touch
O	They
O	held
O	before
O	him
O	a
O	beautiful
O	basin
O	filled
O	with
O	perfumes
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	wash
O	his
O	face
O	and
O	hands
O	and
O	afterwards
O	took
O	off
O	the
O	and
O	dressed
O	him
O	in
O	a
O	suit
O	of
O	clothes
O	of
O	still
O	greater
O	splendour
O	When
O	his
O	toilet
O	was
O	complete
O	they
O	conducted
O	him
O	to
O	an
O	apartment
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	yet
O	seen
O	and
O	which
O	also
O	was
O	magnificently
O	furnished
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	table

O	of
O	the
O	purest
O	gold
O	adorned
O	with

O	The
C	prince
O	observed
O	there
O	were
O	two
O	covers
O	set
O	and
O	was
O	wondering
O	who
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	his
O	companion
O	when
O	his
O	attention
O	was
O	suddenly
O	caught
O	by
O	a
O	small
O	figure
O	not
O	a

O	high
O	which
O	just
O	then
O	entered
O	the

O	and
O	advanced
O	towards
O	him
O	It
O	had
O	on
O	a
O	long
O	black
O	veil
O	and
O	was
O	supported
O	by
O	two
O	cats
O	dressed
O	in
O	mourning
O	and
O	with
O	swords
O	by

O	were
O	followed
O	by
O	a
O	numerous
O	retinue
O	of
O	cats
O	some
O	carrying
O	cages
O	full
O	of
O	rats
O	and
O	others
O	full
O	of
O	mice
O	The
C	prince
O	was
O	at
O	a
O	loss
O	what
O	to
O	think
O	The
O	little
O	figure
O	now
O	approached
O	and
O	throwing
O	aside
O	her
O	veil
O	he
O	beheld
O	a
O	most
O	beautiful
C	white
C	cat
O	she
O	seemed
O	young
O	and
O	melancholy
O	and
O	addressing
O	herself
O	to
O	him
O	she
O	said
O	My

O	you
O	are
O	welcome
O	your
O	presence
O	affords
O	me
O	the
O	greatest
O	pleasure
O	Madam
O	replied
O	he
O	I
O	would
O	fain
O	thank
O	you
O	for
O	your
O	generosity
O	nor
O	can
O	I
O	help
O	observing
O	that

O	must
O	be
O	an
O	extraordinary
O	creature
O	to
O	possess
O	with
O	your

O	form
O	the
O	gift
O	of

O	and
O	the
O	most
O	magnificent
O	palace
O	I
O	have
O	ever
O	seen
O	All
O	this
O	is
O	very
O	true
O	answered
O	the
O	beautiful
O	cat
O	but
C	prince
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	fond
O	of

O	and
O	least
O	of
O	all
O	do
O	I
O	like
O	compliments
O	let
O	us
O	therefore
O	sit
O	down
O	to
O	supper
O	The
O	trunkless
O	hands
O	then
O	placed
O	the
O	dishes
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	and
O	the
C	prince
O	and
C	white
C	cat
O	seated
O	themselves
O	at
O	it
O	The
O	first
O	dish
O	was
O	a
O	pie
O	made
O	of
O	young
O	pigeons
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	was
O	a
O	fricassee
O	of
O	the
O	fattest
O	mice
O	The
O	view
O	of
O	the
O	one
O	made
O	the
C	prince
O	almost
O	afraid
O	to
O	taste
O	the
O	other
O	till
O	the
C	white
C	cat
O	who
O	guessed
O	his
O	thoughts
O	assured
O	him
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	certain
O	dishes
O	at
O	table
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	dressed
O	on
O	purpose
O	for

O	there
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	morsel
O	of
O	either
O	rat
O	or
O	mouse
O	accordingly
O	he
O	ate
O	heartily
O	of
O	such
O	as
O	she
O	recommended
O	When
O	supper
O	was
O	over
O	he
O	perceived
O	that
O	the
C	white
C	cat
O	had
O	a
O	portrait
O	set
O	in
O	gold
O	hanging
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	feet
O	He
O	begged
O	her
O	permission
O	to
O	look
O	at
O	it
O	when
O	to
O	his
O	astonishment
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	portrait
O	of
O	a
O	handsome
O	young
O	man
O	who
O	exactly
O	resembled
O	himself
O	He
O	thought
O	there
O	was
O	something
O	most
O	extraordinary
O	in
O	all
O	this
O	yet
O	as
O	the
C	white
C	cat
O	sighed
O	and
O	looked
O	very
O	sorrowful
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	venture
O	to
O	ask
O	any
O	questions
O	He
O	conversed
O	with
O	her
O	on

O	The

O	busily
O	employed

O	the

O	to

O	The

O	willingly
O	acceded

O	richly
O	caparisoned

O	The

O	faster
O	than

O	and

O	any
O	they

O	out
O	to

O	immediately
O	exchanged
O	her
O	dragoon
O	s
O	cap
O	for
O	the

O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	supper
O	with
O	the
C	prince
O	who
O	being
O	very
O	hungry
O	ate
O	heartily
O	and
O	afterwards
O	partook
O	with
O	her
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	delicious
O	wines
O	He
O	then
O	was
O	conducted
O	to
O	his
O	chamber
O	as
O	before
O	and
O	wakened
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	to
O	renew
O	the
O	same
O	sort
O	of
O	life
O	which
O	day
O	after
O	day
O	became
O	so
O	pleasant
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	no
O	longer
O	thought
O	of
O	anything
O	but
O	of
O	pleasing
O	the
O	sweet
O	little
O	creature
O	who
O	received
O	him
O	so
O	courteously
O	accordingly
O	every
O	day
O	was
O	spent
O	in
O	new
O	amusements
O	The
C	prince
O	had
O	almost
O	forgotten
O	his
O	country
O	and
O	relations
O	and
O	sometimes
O	even
O	regretted
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	cat
O	so
O	great
O	was
O	his
O	affection
O	for
O	his
O	mewing
O	companions
O	Alas
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	the
C	white
C	cat
O	how
O	will
O	it
O	afflict
O	me
O	to
O	leave
O	you
O	whom
O	I
O	love
O	so
O	much
O	Either
O	make
O	yourself
O	a
O	lady
O	or
O	make
O	me
O	a
O	cat
O	She
O	smiled
O	at
O	the
O	prince
O	s
O	wish
O	but
O	offered
O	no
O	reply
O	At
O	length
O	the
O	twelvemonth
O	was
O	nearly
O	expired
O	the
C	white
C	cat
O	who
O	knew
O	the
O	very
O	day
O	when
O	the
C	prince
O	was
O	to
O	reach
O	his
O	father
O	s
O	palace
O	reminded
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	but
O	three
O	days
O	longer
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	a
O	perfect
O	little
C	dog
O	The
C	prince
O	astonished
O	at
O	his
O	own
O	forgetfulness
O	began
O	to
O	afflict
O	himself
O	when
O	the
O	cat
O	told
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	sorrowful
O	since
O	she
O	would
O	not
O	only
O	provide
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	little
C	dog
O	but
O	also
O	with
O	a
O	wooden
O	horse
O	which
O	should
O	convey
O	him
O	safely
O	home
O	in
O	less
O	than
O	twelve
O	hours
O	Look
O	here
O	said
O	she
O	showing
O	him
O	an
O	acorn
O	this
O	contains
O	what
O	you
O	desire
O	The
C	prince
O	put
O	the
O	acorn
O	to
O	his
O	ear
O	and
O	heard
O	the
O	barking
O	of
O	a
O	little
C	dog
O	Transported
O	with
O	joy
O	he
O	thanked
O	the
O	cat
O	a
O	thousand
O	times
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	bidding
O	her
O	tenderly
O	adieu
O	he
O	set
O	out
O	on
O	his
O	return
O	The
C	prince
O	arrived
O	first
O	at
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	rendezvous
O	and
O	was
O	soon
O	joined
O	by
O	his
C	brothers
O	they
O	mutually
O	embraced
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	give
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	their
O	success
O	when
O	the
O	youngest
O	showed
O	them
O	only
O	a
O	little
O	mongrel
O	cur
O	telling
O	them
O	that
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	could
O	not
O	fail
O	to
O	please
O	the
C	king
O	from
O	its
O	extraordinary
O	beauty
O	The
C	brothers
O	trod
O	on
O	each
O	other
O	s
O	toes
O	under
O	the
O	table
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	to
O	say
O	We
O	have
O	little
O	to
O	fear
O	from
O	this
O	animal
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	they
O	went
O	together
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	The
O	dogs
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	elder
C	brothers
O	were
O	lying
O	on
O	cushions
O	and
O	so
O	curiously
O	wrapped
O	around
O	with
O	embroidered
O	quilts
O	that
O	one
O	would
O	scarcely
O	venture
O	to
O	touch
O	them
O	The
O	youngest
O	produced
O	his
O	cur
O	and
O	all
O	wondered
O	how
O	the
C	prince
O	could
O	hope
O	to
O	receive
O	a
O	crown
O	for
O	such
O	a
O	shabby
O	present
O	The
C	king
O	examined
O	the
O	two
O	little
O	dogs
O	of
O	the
O	elder
O	princes
O	and
O	declared
O	he
O	thought
O	them
O	so
O	equally
O	beautiful
O	that
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	to
O	which
O	with
O	justice
O	he
O	could
O	give
O	the
O	preference
O	They
O	accordingly
O	began
O	to
O	dispute
O	when
O	the
O	youngest
C	prince
O	taking
O	his
O	acorn
O	from
O	his
O	pocket
O	soon
O	ended
O	their
O	contention
O	for
O	a
O	little
C	dog
O	appeared
O	which
O	could
O	with
O	ease
O	go
O	through
O	the
O	smallest
O	ring
O	and
O	was
O	besides
O	a
O	miracle
O	of
O	beauty
O	The
C	king
O	could
O	not
O	possibly
O	hesitate
O	in
O	declaring
O	his
O	satisfaction
O	yet
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	more
O	inclined
O	than
O	the
O	year
O	before
O	to
O	part
O	with
O	his
O	crown
O	he
O	told
O	his
O	sons
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	extremely
O	obliged
O	to
O	them
O	for
O	the
O	pains
O	they
O	had
O	taken
O	and
O	since
O	they
O	had
O	succeeded
O	so
O	well
O	he
O	wished
O	they
O	would
O	make
O	a
O	second
O	attempt
O	he
O	therefore
O	begged
O	they
O	would
O	take
O	another
O	year
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	procure
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	cambric
O	fine
O	enough
O	to
O	be
O	drawn
O	through
O	the
O	eye
O	of
O	a
O	small
O	needle
O	The
O	three
O	princes
O	thought
O	this
O	very
O	hard
O	yet
O	they
O	set
O	out
O	in
O	obedience
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	s
O	command
O	The
O	two
O	eldest
O	took
O	different
O	roads
O	and
O	the
O	youngest
O	remounted
O	his
O	wooden
O	horse
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	his
O	beloved
C	white
C	cat
O	who
O	received
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	joy
O	while
O	the
O	trunkless
O	hands
O	helped
O	him
O	to
O	dismount
O	and
O	provided
O	him
O	with
O	immediate
O	refreshment
O	Afterwards
O	the
C	prince
O	gave
O	the
C	white
C	cat
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	admiration
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	bestowed
O	on
O	the
O	beautiful
O	little
C	dog
O	and
O	informed
O	her
O	of
O	the
O	further
O	injunction
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	Make
O	yourself
O	perfectly
O	easy
O	dear
C	prince
O	said
O	she
O	I
O	have
O	in
O	my
O	palace
O	some
O	cats
O	who
O	are
O	perfect
O	adepts
O	in
O	making
O	such
O	cambric
O	as
O	the
C	king
O	requires
O	so
O	you
O	have
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	the
O	pleasure
O	of
O	your
O	company
O	while
O	it
O	is
O	making
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	procure
O	you
O	all
O	the
O	amusement
O	possible
O	She
O	accordingly
O	ordered
O	the
O	most
O	curious
O	to
O	be
O	played
O	off
O	in
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	of
O	the
O	apartment
O	in
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	sitting
O	and
O	nothing
O	but
O	festivity
O	and
O	rejoicing
O	was
O	heard
O	throughout
O	the
O	palace
O	for
O	the
O	prince
O	s
O	return
O	As
O	the
C	white
C	cat
O	frequently
O	gave
O	proofs
O	of
O	an
O	excellent
O	understanding
O	the
C	prince
O	was
O	by
O	no
O	means
O	tired
O	of
O	her
O	company
O	she
O	talked
O	with
O	him
O	of
O	state
O	affairs
O	of
O	theatres
O	of
O	fashions
O	in
O	short
O	she
O	was
O	at
O	a
O	loss
O	on
O	no
O	subject
O	whatever
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	the
C	prince
O	was
O	alone
O	he
O	had
O	plenty
O	of
O	amusement
O	in
O	thinking
O	how
O	it
O	could
O	possibly
O	be
O	that
O	a
O	small
C	white
C	cat
O	could
O	be
O	endowed
O	with
O	all

O	attractions
O	of
O	the
O	very
O	best

O	The
O	twelvemonth
O	in
O	this
O	manner
O	again
O	passed
O	insensibly
O	away
O	but
O	the
O	cat
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	remind
O	the
C	prince
O	of
O	his
O	duty
O	in
O	proper
O	time
O	For
O	once
O	my
C	prince
O	said

O	I
O	will
O	have
O	the
O	pleasure
O	of
O	equipping
O	you
O	as
O	suits
O	your
O	high
O	rank
O	And
O	looking
O	into
O	the
O	courtyard
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	superb
O	car
O	ornamented
O	all
O	over
O	with
O	gold
O	silver
O	pearls
O	and

O	drawn
O	by
O	twelve

O	as

O	You
O	will
O	find
O	in
O	it
O	said

O	with

O	conveyed

C	prince
O	to

O	s
O	palace
O	where
O	his
C	brothers
O	had
O	just
O	arrived
O	before

O	They
O	embraced
O	each
O	other
O	and
O	demanded
O	an
O	immediate
O	audience
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	who
O	received
O	them
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	of
O	kindness
O	The
O	princes
O	hastened
O	to
O	place
O	at
O	the
O	feet
O	of
O	his
O	majesty
O	the
O	curious
O	present
O	he
O	had
O	required
O	them
O	to
O	procure
O	The
O	eldest
O	produced
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	cambric
O	so
O	extremely
O	fine
O	that
O	his
O	friends
O	had
O	no
O	doubt
O	of
O	its
O	passing
O	through
O	the
O	eye
O	of
O	a
O	needle
O	which
O	was
O	now
O	delivered
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	having
O	been
O	kept
O	locked
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	custody
O	of
O	his
O	majesty
O	s
O	treasurer
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	But
O	when
O	the
C	king
O	tried
O	to
O	draw
O	the
O	cambric
O	through
O	the
O	eye
O	of
O	the
O	needle
O	it
O	would
O	not
O	pass
O	though
O	it
O	failed
O	but
O	very
O	little
O	Then
O	came
O	the
O	second
C	prince
O	who
O	made
O	as
O	sure
O	of
O	obtaining
O	the
O	crown
O	as
O	his
O	brother
O	had
O	done
O	but
O	alas
O	with
O	no
O	better
O	success
O	for
O	though
O	his
O	piece
O	of
O	cambric
O	was
O	exquisitely
O	fine
O	yet
O	it
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	drawn
O	through
O	the
O	eye
O	of
O	the
O	needle
O	It
O	was
O	now
O	the
O	turn
O	of
O	the
O	youngest
C	prince
O	who
O	accordingly
O	advanced
O	and
O	opening
O	an
O	elegant
O	little
O	box
O	inlaid
O	with
O	jewels
O	took
O	out
O	a
O	walnut
O	and
O	cracked
O	the
O	shell
O	imagining
O	he
O	should
O	immediately
O	perceive
O	his
O	piece
O	of
O	cambric
O	but
O	what
O	was
O	his
O	astonishment
O	to
O	see
O	nothing
O	but
O	a
O	filbert
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	however
O	lose
O	his
O	hopes
O	he
O	cracked
O	the
O	filbert
O	and
O	it
O	presented
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	The
O	lords
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	who
O	had
O	assembled
O	to
O	witness
O	this
O	extraordinary
O	trial
O	could
O	not
O	any
O	more
O	than
O	the
O	princes
O	his
C	brothers
O	refrain
O	from
O	laughing
O	to
O	think
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	so
O	silly
O	as
O	to
O	claim
O	the
O	crown
O	on
O	no
O	better
O	pretensions
O	The
C	prince
O	however
O	cracked
O	the
O	which
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	a
O	kernel
O	he
O	divided
O	it
O	and
O	found
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	a
O	grain
O	of
O	wheat
O	and
O	in
O	that
O	a
O	grain
O	of
O	He
O	was
O	now
O	absolutely
O	confounded
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	muttering
O	between
O	his
O	teeth
O	O
C	white
C	cat
C	white
C	cat
O	thou
O	hast
O	deceived
O	me
O	At
O	this
O	instant
O	he
O	felt
O	his
O	hand
O	scratched
O	by
O	the
O	claw
O	of
O	a
O	cat
O	upon
O	which
O	he
O	again
O	took
O	courage
O	and
O	opening
O	the
O	grain
O	of
O	to
O	the
O	astonishment
O	of
O	all
O	present
O	he
O	drew
O	forth
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	cambric
O	four
O	hundred
O	yards
O	long
O	and
O	fine
O	enough
O	to
O	be
O	threaded
O	with
O	perfect
O	ease
O	through
O	the
O	eye
O	of
O	the
O	needle
O	When
O	the
C	king
O	found
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	pretext
O	left
O	for
O	refusing
O	the
O	crown
O	to
O	his
O	youngest
O	son
O	he
O	sighed
O	deeply
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	easy
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	sorry
O	for
O	the
O	prince
O	s
O	success
O	My
O	sons
O	said
O	he
O	it
O	is
O	so
O	gratifying
O	to
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	a
O	father
O	to
O	receive
O	proofs
O	of
O	his
O	children
O	s
O	love
O	and
O	obedience
O	that
O	I
O	cannot
O	refuse
O	myself
O	the
O	satisfaction
O	of
O	requiring
O	of
O	you
O	one
O	thing
O	more
O	You
O	must
O	undertake
O	another
O	expedition
O	That
O	one
O	of
O	you
O	who
O	by
O	the

O	most
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	shall
O	marry
O	her
O	and
O	obtain
O	my
O	crown
O	So
O	they
O	again
O	took
O	leave
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	and
O	of
O	each
O	other
O	and
O	set
O	out
O	without
O	delay
O	and
O	in
O	less
O	than
O	twelve
O	hours
O	our
O	young
C	prince
O	arrived
O	in
O	his

O	since
O	so
O	precious
O	a
O	life
O	is
O	at

O	we
O	consent
O	to

O	made
O	to

O	to
O	the
O	fairies
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	the
O	time
O	was
O	come
O	that
O	she
O	expected
O	my

O	she
O	grew
O	very
O	melancholy
O	till
O	at
O	length
O	being
O	pressed
O	by
O	the
C	king
O	she
O	declared
O	to
O	him
O	the
O	truth
O	Nothing
O	could
O	exceed
O	his
O	affliction
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	that
O	his
O	only
O	child
O	when
O	born
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	given
O	to
O	the

O	He
O	bore
O	it
O	however
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	adding
O	to
O	my
O	mother
O	s
O	grief
O	and
O	also
O	believing
O	he
O	should
O	find
O	some
O	means
O	of
O	keeping
O	me
O	in
O	a
O	place
O	of
O	safety
O	which
O	the
O	fairies
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	approach
O	As
O	soon
O	therefore
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	born
O	he
O	had
O	me
O	conveyed
O	to
O	a
O	tower
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	to
O	which
O	there
O	were
O	twenty
O	flights
O	of
O	stairs
O	and
O	a
O	door
O	to
O	each
O	of
O	which
O	my
O	father
O	kept
O	the
O	key
O	so
O	that
O	none
O	came
O	near
O	me
O	without
O	his
O	consent
O	When
O	the
O	fairies
O	heard
O	of
O	what
O	had
O	been
O	done
O	they
O	sent
O	first
O	to
O	demand
O	me
O	and
O	on
O	my
O	father
O	s
O	refusal
O	they
O	let
O	loose
O	a
O	monstrous
O	dragon
O	which
O	devoured
O	men
O	women
O	and
O	children
O	and
O	which
O	by
O	the
O	breath
O	of
O	its
O	nostrils
O	destroyed
O	everything
O	it
O	came
O	near
O	so
O	that
O	even
O	the
O	trees
O	and
O	plants
O	began
O	to
O	die
O	The
O	grief
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	was
O	excessive
O	and
O	finding
O	that
O	his
O	whole
O	kingdom
O	would
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	be
O	reduced
O	to
O	famine
O	he
O	consented
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	into
O	their
O	hands
O	I
O	was
O	accordingly
O	laid
O	in
O	a
O	cradle
O	of
O	ornamented
O	with
O	gold
O	and
O	jewels
O	and
O	carried
O	to
O	their
O	palace
O	when
O	the
O	dragon
O	immediately
O	disappeared
O	The
O	fairies
O	placed
O	me
O	in
O	a
O	tower
O	elegantly
O	furnished
O	but
O	to
O	which
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	door
O	so
O	that
O	whoever
O	approached
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	come
O	by
O	the
O	windows
O	which
O	were
O	a
O	great
O	height
O	from
O	the
O	ground
O	from
O	these
O	I
O	had
O	the
O	liberty
O	of
O	getting
O	out
O	into
O	a
O	delightful
O	garden
O	in
O	which
O	were
O	baths
O	and
O	every
O	sort
O	of
O	cooling
O	fruit
O	In
O	this
O	place
O	was
O	I
O	educated
O	by
O	the
O	fairies
O	who
O	behaved
O	to
O	me
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	kindness
O	my
O	clothes
O	were
O	splendid
O	and
O	I
O	was
O	instructed
O	in
O	every
O	kind
O	of
O	accomplishment
O	in
O	short
C	prince
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	anyone
O	but
O	themselves
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	remained
O	very
O	happy
O	One
O	day
O	however
O	as
O	I
O	was
O	talking
O	at
O	the
O	window
O	with
O	my
O	parrot
O	I
O	perceived
O	a
O	young
O	gentleman
O	who
O	was
O	listening
O	to
O	our
O	conversation
O	As
O	I
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	a
O	man
O	but
O	in
O	pictures
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	sorry
O	for
O	the
O	opportunity
O	of
O	gratifying
O	my
O	curiosity
O	I
O	thought
O	him
O	a
O	very
O	pleasing
O	object
O	and
O	he
O	at
O	length
O	bowed
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	respectful
O	manner
O	without
O	daring
O	to
O	speak
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	the
O	fairies
O	When
O	it
O	began
O	to
O	grow
O	dark
O	he
O	went
O	away
O	and
O	I
O	vainly
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	see
O	which
O	road
O	he
O	took
O	The
O	next
O	morning
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	light
O	I
O	again
O	placed
O	myself
O	at
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	had
O	the
O	pleasure
O	of
O	seeing
O	that
O	the
O	gentleman
O	had
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	same
O	place
O	He
O	now
O	spoke
O	to
O	me
O	through
O	a
O	and
O	informed
O	me
O	he
O	thought
O	me
O	a
O	most
O	charming
O	lady
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	very
O	unhappy
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	pass
O	his
O	life
O	in
O	my
O	company
O	I
O	resolved
O	to
O	find
O	some
O	means
O	of
O	escaping
O	from
O	my
O	tower
O	and
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	in
O	devising
O	the
O	means
O	for
O	the
O	execution
O	of
O	my
O	project
O	I
O	begged
O	the
O	fairies
O	to
O	bring
O	me
O	a
O	a
O	mesh
O	and
O	some
O	cord
O	saying
O	I
O	wished
O	to
O	make
O	some
O	nets
O	to
O	amuse
O	myself
O	with
O	catching
O	birds
O	at
O	my
O	window
O	This
O	they
O	readily
O	complied
O	with
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	I
O	completed
O	a
O	ladder
O	long
O	enough
O	to
O	reach
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	I
O	now
O	sent
O	my
O	parrot
O	to
O	the
C	prince
O	to
O	beg
O	he
O	would
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	usual
O	place
O	as
O	I
O	wished
O	to
O	speak
O	with
O	him
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	fail
O	and
O	finding
O	the
O	ladder
O	mounted
O	it
O	and
O	quickly
O	entered
O	my
O	tower
O	This
O	at
O	first
O	alarmed
O	me
O	but
O	the
O	charms
O	of
O	his
O	conversation
O	had
O	restored
O	me
O	to
O	tranquillity
O	when
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	the
O	window
O	opened
O	and
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Violent
O	mounted
O	on
O	the
O	dragon
O	s
O	back
O	rushed
O	into
O	the
O	tower
O	My
O	beloved
C	prince
O	thought
O	of
O	nothing
O	but
O	how
O	to
O	defend
O	me
O	from
O	their
O	fury
O	for
O	I
O	had
O	had
O	time
O	to
O	relate
O	to
O	him
O	my
O	story
O	previous
O	to
O	this
O	cruel
O	interruption
O	but
O	their
O	numbers
O	overpowered
O	him
O	and
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Violent
O	had
O	the
O	barbarity
O	to
O	command
O	the
O	dragon
O	to
O	devour
O	my
O	lover
O	before
O	my
O	eyes
O	In
O	my
O	despair
O	I
O	would
O	have
O	thrown
O	myself
O	also
O	into
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	horrible
O	monster
O	but
O	this
O	they
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	prevent
O	saying
O	my
O	life
O	should
O	be
O	preserved
O	for
O	greater
O	punishment
O	The
C	fairy
O	then
O	touched
O	me
O	with
O	her
O	wand
O	and
O	I
O	instantly
O	became
O	a
C	white
C	cat
O	She
O	next
O	conducted
O	me
O	to
O	this
O	palace
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	my
O	father
O	and
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	train
O	of
O	cats
O	for
O	my
O	attendants
O	together
O	with
O	the
O	twelve
O	hands
O	that
O	waited
O	on
O	your
O	highness
O	She
O	then
O	informed
O	me
O	of
O	my
O	birth
O	and
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	my
O	parents
O	and
O	pronounced
O	upon
O	me
O	what
O	she
O	imagined
O	the
O	greatest
O	of
O	maledictions
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	not
O	be
O	restored
O	to
O	my
O	natural
O	figure
O	until
O	a
O	young
C	prince
O	the
O	perfect
O	resemblance
O	of
O	him
O	I
O	had
O	lost
O	should
O	cut
O	off
O	my
O	head
O	and
O	tail
O	You
O	are
O	that
O	perfect
O	resemblance
O	and
O	accordingly
O	you
O	ended
O	the
O	enchantment
O	I
O	need
O	not
O	add
O	that
O	I
O	already
O	love
O	you
O	more
O	than
O	my
O	life
O	let
O	us
O	therefore
O	hasten
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	your
O	father
O	and
O	obtain
O	his
O	approbation
O	to
O	our
O	marriage
O	The
C	prince
O	and
O	princess
O	accordingly
O	set
O	out
O	side
O	by
O	side
O	in
O	a
O	car
O	of
O	still
O	greater
O	splendour
O	than
O	before
O	and
O	reached
O	the
O	palace
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	two
C	brothers
O	had
O	arrived
O	with
O	two
O	beautiful
O	princesses
O	The
C	king
O	hearing
O	that
O	each
O	of
O	his
O	sons
O	had
O	succeeded
O	in
O	finding
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	required

O	to
O	think
O	of
O	some
O	new
O	expedient
O	to
O	delay
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	his
O	resigning
O	the
O	crown
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	whole
O	court
O	were
O	with
O	the
C	king
O	assembled
O	to
O	pass
O	judgment
O	the
O	princess
O	who
O	accompanied
O	the
O	youngest
O	perceiving
O	his
O	thoughts
O	by
O	his
O	countenance
O	stepped
O	majestically
O	forward
O	and
O	thus
O	addressed
O	him
O	It
O	is
O	a
O	pity
O	that
O	your
O	majesty
O	who
O	is
O	so
O	capable
O	of
O	governing
O	should
O	think
O	of

O	the
O	crown
O	I
O	am
O	fortunate
O	enough
O	to
O	have
O	six
O	kingdoms
O	in
O	my
O	possession
O	permit
O	me
O	to
O	bestow
O	one
O	on
O	each
O	of
O	the
O	eldest
O	princes
O	and
O	to
O	enjoy
O	the
O	remaining
O	four
O	in
O	the
O	society
O	of
O	the
O	youngest
O	And
O	may
O	it
O	please
O	your
O	majesty
O	to
O	keep
O	your
O	own
O	kingdom
O	and

O	concerning
O	the

O	of
O	three
O	princesses
O	who

O	of
O	the

O	the
O	young
C	prince
O	and

O	and
O	next
O	their
C	brothers

O	the
O	three
O	weddings

O	were
O	remarkable
O	for
O	the
O	following
O	peculiarity
O	They
O	seldom
O	seriously
O	quarrelled
O	but
O	they
O	never
O	agreed
O	about
O	anything
O	It
O	is
O	hard
O	to
O	say
O	whether
O	it
O	were
O	more
O	painful
O	for
O	their
O	friends
O	to

O	couple

O	began
O	to
O	rain
O	at
O	noon
O	A
O	eleven
O	my
O	dear
O	Mr
O	Skratdj
O	s
O	voice
O	would
O	be
O	heard
O	to
O	say
O	from
O	several
O	chairs
O	down
O	in
O	the
O	corrective
O	tones
O	of
O	a
O	husband
O	and
O	father
O	and
O	really
O	my
O	dear
O	so
O	far
O	from
O	being
O	a
O	promising
O	morning
O	I
O	must
O	say
O	it
O	looked
O	about
O	as
O	threatening
O	as
O	it
O	well
O	could
O	Your
O	memory
O	is
O	not
O	always
O	accurate
O	in
O	small
O	matters
O	my
O	love
O	But
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	a
O	wife
O	and
O	a
O	mother
O	for
O	fifteen
O	years
O	to
O	be
O	snuffed
O	out
O	at
O	one
O	snap
O	of
O	the
O	marital
O	snuffers
O	As
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	leaned
O	forward
O	in
O	his
O	chair
O	she
O	leaned
O	forward
O	in
O	hers
O	and
O	defended
O	herself
O	across
O	the
O	intervening
O	couples
O	Why
O	my
O	dear
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	you
O	said
O	yourself
O	the
O	weather
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	so
O	promising
O	for
O	a
O	week
O	What
O	I
O	said
O	my
O	dear
O	pardon
O	me
O	was
O	that
O	the
O	barometer
O	was
O	higher
O	than
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	for
O	a
O	week
O	But
O	as
O	you
O	might
O	have
O	observed
O	if
O	these
O	details
O	were
O	in
O	your
O	line
O	my
O	love
O	which
O	they
O	are
O	not
O	the
O	rise
O	was
O	extraordinarily
O	rapid
O	and
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	surer
O	sign
O	of
O	unsettled
O	weather
O	But
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	is
O	apt
O	to
O	forget
O	these
O	unimportant
O	trifles
O	he
O	added
O	with
O	a
O	comprehensive
O	smile
O	round
O	the
O	her
O	thoughts
O	are
O	very
O	properly
O	absorbed
O	by
O	the
O	more
O	important
O	domestic
O	questions
O	of
O	the
O	nursery
O	Now
O	I
O	think
O	that
O	s
O	rather
O	unfair
O	on
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	s
O	part
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	would
O	chirp
O	with
O	a
O	smile
O	quite
O	as
O	affable
O	and
O	as
O	general
O	as
O	her
O	husband
O	s
O	I
O	m
O	sure
O	he
O	s
O	as
O	forgetful
O	and
O	inaccurate
O	as
O	am
O	And
O	I
O	don
O	t
O	think
O	memory
O	is
O	at
O	a
O	bad
O	one
O	You
O	forgot
O	the
O	when
O	we
O	were
O	going
O	out
O	to
O	dine
O	last
O	week
O	nevertheless
O	said
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	And
O	you
O	couldn
O	t
O	help
O	me
O	when
O	I
O	asked
O	you
O	was
O	the
O	sprightly
O	retort
O	And
O	I
O	m
O	sure
O	it
O	s
O	not
O	like
O	you
O	to
O	forget
O	anything
O	about
O	my
O	dear
O	The
O	letter
O	was
O	addressed
O	to
O	you
O	said
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	I
O	sent
O	it
O	to
O	you
O	by
O	Jemima
O	said
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	I
O	didn
O	t
O	read
O	it
O	said
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	Well
O	you
O	burnt
O	it
O	said
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	and
O	as
O	I
O	always
O	say
O	there
O	s
O	nothing
O	more
O	foolish
O	than
O	burning
O	a
O	letter
O	of
O	invitation
O	before
O	the
O	day
O	for
O	one
O	is
O	certain
O	to
O	forget
O	I
O	ve
O	no
O	doubt
O	you
O	always
O	do
O	say
O	it
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	remarked
O	with
O	a
O	smile
O	but
O	I
O	certainly
O	never
O	remember
O	to
O	have
O	heard
O	the
O	observation
O	from
O	your
O	lips
O	my
O	love
O	Whose
O	memory
O	s
O	in
O	fault
O	there
O	asked
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	triumphantly
O	and
O	as
O	at
O	this
O	point
O	the
O	ladies
O	rose
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	had
O	the
O	last
O	word
O	Indeed
O	as
O	may
O	be
O	gathered
O	from
O	this
O	conversation
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	was
O	quite
O	able
O	to
O	defend
O	herself
O	When
O	she
O	was
O	yet
O	a
O	bride
O	and
O	young
O	and
O	timid
O	she
O	used
O	to
O	collapse
O	when
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	contradicted
O	her
O	statements
O	and
O	set
O	her
O	stories
O	straight
O	in
O	public
O	Then
O	she
O	hardly
O	ever
O	opened
O	her
O	lips
O	without
O	disappearing
O	under
O	the
O	domestic
O	extinguisher
O	But
O	in
O	the
O	course
O	of
O	fifteen
O	years
O	she
O	had
O	learned
O	that
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	s
O	bark
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	worse
O	than
O	his
O	bite
O	If
O	indeed
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	bite
O	at
O	all
O	Thus
O	snubs
O	that
O	made
O	other
O	people
O	s
O	ears
O	tingle
O	had
O	no
O	effect
O	whatever
O	on
O	the
O	lady
O	to
O	whom
O	they
O	were
O	addressed
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	exactly
O	what
O	they
O	were
O	worth
O	and
O	had
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	become
O	fairly
O	adept
O	at
O	snapping
O	in
O	return
O	In
O	the
O	days
O	when
O	she
O	succumbed
O	she
O	was
O	occasionally
O	unhappy
O	but
O	now
O	she
O	and
O	her
O	husband
O	understood
O	each
O	other
O	and
O	having
O	agreed
O	to
O	differ
O	they
O	unfortunately
O	agreed
O	also
O	to
O	differ
O	in
O	public
O	Indeed
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	bystanders
O	who
O	had
O	the
O	worst
O	of
O	it
O	on
O	these
O	occasions
O	To
O	the
O	worthy
O	couple
O	themselves
O	the
O	habit
O	had
O	become
O	second
O	nature
O	and
O	in
O	no
O	way
O	affected
O	the
O	friendly
O	tenor
O	of
O	their
O	domestic
O	relations
O	They
O	would
O	interfere
O	with
O	each
O	other
O	s
O	conversation
O	contradicting
O	assertions
O	and
O	disputing
O	conclusions
O	for
O	a
O	whole
O	evening
O	and
O	then
O	when
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	thought
O	that
O	these
O	ceaseless
O	sparks
O	of
O	bickering
O	must
O	blaze
O	up
O	into
O	a
O	flaming
O	quarrel
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	alone
O	they
O	would
O	bowl
O	amicably
O	home
O	in
O	a
O	cab
O	criticizing
O	the
O	friends
O	who
O	were
O	commenting
O	upon
O	them
O	and
O	as
O	little
O	agreed
O	about
O	the
O	events
O	of
O	the
O	evening
O	as
O	about
O	the
O	details
O	of
O	any
O	other
O	events
O	whatever
O	Yes
O	the
O	bystanders
O	certainly
O	had
O	the
O	worst
O	of
O	it
O	Those
O	who
O	were
O	near
O	wished
O	themselves
O	anywhere
O	else
O	especially
O	when
O	appealed
O	to
O	Those
O	who
O	were
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	did
O	not
O	mind
O	so
O	much
O	A
O	domestic
O	squabble
O	at
O	a
O	certain
O	distance
O	is
O	interesting
O	like
O	an
O	engagement
O	viewed
O	from
O	a
O	point
O	beyond
O	the
O	range
O	of
O	guns
O	In
O	such
O	a
O	position
O	one
O	may
O	some
O	day
O	be
O	placed
O	oneself
O	Moreover
O	it
O	gives
O	a
O	touch
O	of
O	excitement
O	to
O	a
O	dull
O	evening
O	to
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	say
O	to
O	one
O	s
O	neighbor
O	Do
O	listen
O	The
O	Skratdjs
O	are
O	at
O	it
O	again
O	Their
O	unmarried
O	friends
O	thought
O	a
O	terrible
O	abyss
O	of
O	tyranny
O	and
O	aggravation
O	must
O	lie
O	beneath
O	it
O	all
O	and
O	blessed
O	their
O	stars
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	still
O	single
O	and
O	able
O	to
O	tell
O	a
O	tale
O	their
O	own
O	way
O	The
O	married
O	ones
O	had
O	more
O	idea
O	of
O	how
O	it
O	really
O	was
O	and
O	wished
O	in
O	the
O	name
O	of
O	common
O	sense
O	and
O	good
O	taste
O	that
O	Skratdj
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	would
O	not
O	make
O	fools
O	of
O	themselves
O	So
O	it
O	went
O	on
O	however
O	and
O	so
O	I
O	suppose
O	it
O	goes
O	on
O	still
O	for
O	not
O	many
O	bad
O	habits
O	are
O	cured
O	in
O	middle
O	age
O	On
O	certain
O	questions
O	of
O	comparative
O	speaking
O	their
O	views
O	were
O	never
O	identical
O	Such
O	as
O	the
O	temperature
O	being
O	hot
O	or
O	cold
O	things
O	being
O	light
O	or
O	dark
O	the
O	being
O	sweet
O	or
O	sour
O	So
O	one
O	day
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	rubbing
O	his
O	hands
O	and
O	planting
O	himself
O	at
O	the

O	with
O	Bitterly
O	cold
O	it

O	just
O	mentioned
O	The

O	Skratdjs
O	like
O	some

C	children
O	were
O	under
O	the
O	unfortunate

O	that
O	it

O	to

O	girls
O	snap
O	each
O	other
O	up
O	with

O	never

O	it

O	a

O	One

O	a

O	young
O	man
O	who
O	carried

O	The

O	had
O	been
O	crammed
O	rather

O	after
O	the
O	wont
O	of
O	bachelors
O	and
O	you
O	could
O	see
O	where
O	the

O	of
O	a

O	distended
O	the
O	leather
O	and

O	Now
O	the
C	gentleman
O	was
O	very
O	fond
O	of

O	and
O	had
O	borne
O	this
O	greeting
O	some
O	dozen
O	of
O	times
O	from
C	Snap
O	who
O	for

O	part
O	knew
O	the
O	visitor
O	quite
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	washerwoman
O	and
O	rather
O	better
O	than
O	the
O	butcher
O	s
O	boy
O	The
C	gentleman
O	had
O	good
O	sensible
O	dogs
O	of

O	own
O	and
O	was
O	greatly
O	disgusted
O	with
O	Snap
O	s
O	conduct
O	Nevertheless
O	he
O	spoke
O	kindly
O	to
O	him
O	and
C	Snap
O	who
O	had
O	had
O	many
O	a
O	bit
O	from

O	could
O	not
O	help
O	stopping
O	for
O	a
O	minute
O	to
O	lick
O	his
O	hand
O	But
O	no
O	sooner
O	did
O	the
C	gentleman
O	proceed
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	than
C	Snap
O	flew
O	at

O	heels
O	in
O	the

O	Yap
O	Yap
O	Yap
O	On

O	The

O	upon
O	a

O	and
O	was
O	smashed
O	The
O	heel
O	of
O	the
O	boot
O	caught
C	Snap
O	on
O	the
O	back
O	and
O	sent
O	him
O	squealing
O	to
O	the
O	kitchen
O	And
O	he
O	never
O	barked
O	at
O	that
C	gentleman
O	again
O	If
O	the
C	gentleman
O	disapproved
O	of
O	Snap
O	s
O	conduct
O	he
O	still
O	less
O	liked
O	the
O	continual
O	snapping
O	of
O	the
O	Skratdj
O	family
O	themselves
O	He
O	was
O	an
O	old
O	friend
O	of
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	and
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	however
O	and
O	knew
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	really
O	happy
O	together
O	and
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	a
O	bad
O	habit
O	which
O	made
O	them
O	constantly
O	contradict
O	each
O	other
O	It
O	was
O	in
O	allusion
O	to
O	their
O	real
O	affection
O	for
O	each
O	other
O	and
O	their
O	perpetual
O	disputing
O	that
O	he
O	called
O	them
O	the
O	Snapping
O	Turtles
O	When
O	the
O	war
O	of
O	words
O	waxed
O	hottest
O	at
O	the
O	between
O	his
O	host
O	and
O	hostess
O	he
O	would
O	drive
O	his
O	hands
O	through
O	his
O	shock
O	of
O	sandy
O	hair
O	and
O	say
O	with
O	a
O	comical
O	glance
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	umber
O	eyes
O	Don
O	t
O	flirt
O	my
O	friends
O	It
O	makes
O	a
O	bachelor
O	feel
O	awkward
O	And
O	neither
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	nor
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	could
O	help
O	laughing
O	With
O	the
O	little
O	Skratdjs
O	his
O	measures
O	were
O	more
O	vigorous
O	He
O	was
O	very
O	fond
O	of
C	children
O	and
O	a
O	good
O	friend
O	to
O	them
O	He
O	grudged
O	no
O	time
O	or
O	trouble
O	to
O	help
O	them
O	in
O	their
O	games
O	and
O	projects
O	but
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	tolerate
O	their
O	snapping
O	up
O	each
O	other
O	s
O	words
O	in
O	his
O	presence
O	He
O	was
O	much
O	more
O	truly
O	kind
O	than
O	many
O	visitors
O	who
O	think
O	it
O	polite
O	to
O	smile
O	at
O	the
O	sauciness
O	and
O	forwardness
O	which
O	ignorant
O	vanity
O	leads
C	children
O	so
O	often
O	to
O	show
O	off
O	before
O	strangers
O	These
O	civil
O	acquaintances
O	only
O	abuse
O	both
O	children
O	and
O	parents
O	behind
O	their
O	backs
O	for
O	the
O	very
O	bad
O	habits
O	which
O	they
O	help
O	to
O	encourage
O	The
O	gentleman
O	s
O	treatment
O	of
O	his
O	young
O	friends
O	was
O	very
O	different
O	One
O	day
O	he
O	was
O	talking
O	to
C	Polly
O	and
O	making
O	some
O	kind
O	inquiries
O	about
O	her
O	lessons
O	to
O	which
O	she
O	was
O	replying
O	in
O	a
O	quiet
O	and
O	sensible
O	fashion
O	when
O	up
O	came
C	Master
C	Harry
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	display
O	his
O	wit
O	by
O	comments
O	on
O	the
O	conversation
O	and
O	by
O	snapping
O	at
O	and
O	contradicting
O	his
O	sister
O	s
O	remarks
O	to
O	which
O	she
O	retorted
O	and
O	the
O	usual
O	went
O	on
O	as
O	usual
O	Then
O	you
O	like
O	music
O	said
O	the
C	gentleman
O	Yes
O	I
O	like
O	it
O	very
O	much
O	said
C	Polly
O	Oh
O	do
O	you
C	Harry
O	broke
O	in
O	Then
O	what
O	are
O	you
O	always
O	crying
O	over

O	sometimes
O	when

O	sticky
O	for

O	stuck
O	fast
O	Hold
O	your
O	tongue
O	said
O	the
C	gentleman
O	With
O	what
O	he
O	imagined
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	very
O	waggish
O	air
C	Harry
O	put
O	out
O	his
O	tongue
O	and
O	held
O	it
O	with
O	his
O	finger
O	and
O	thumb
O	It
O	was
O	unfortunate
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	time
O	to
O	draw
O	it
O	in
O	again
O	before
O	the
C	gentleman
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	stinging
O	box
O	on
O	the
O	ear
O	which
O	brought
O	his
O	teeth
O	rather
O	sharply
O	together
O	on
O	the
O	tip
O	of
O	his
O	tongue
O	which
O	was
O	bitten
O	in

O	they
O	are
O	very
O	good
O	judges
O	of

C	Harry
O	did
O	not
O	like
O	the
C	gentleman
O	a
O	bit
O	the
O	less
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	respect
O	and
O	obey
O	him
O	and
O	all
O	the

O	boisterously
O	when

O	that

O	It

C	Snap
O	who
O	forthwith

O	the

O	a
O	newspaper
O	By
O	and
O	by
C	Harry
O	and
C	Polly
O	came
O	in
O	and
O	they
O	were
O	soon
O	snapping
O	comfortably
O	over
O	their
O	own
O	affairs
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	The
O	gentleman
O	s
O	umber
O	eyes
O	had
O	been
O	looking
O	over
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	his
O	newspaper
O	at
O	them
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	before
O	he
O	called
C	Harry
O	my
O	boy
O	And
C	Harry
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	Show
O	me
O	your
O	tongue
C	Harry
O	said
O	he
O	What
O	for
O	said
C	Harry
O	you
O	re
O	not
O	a
O	doctor
O	Do
O	as
O	I
O	tell
O	you
O	said
O	the
C	gentleman
O	and
O	as
C	Harry
O	saw
O	his
O	hand
O	moving
O	he
O	put
O	his
O	tongue
O	out
O	with
O	all
O	possible
O	haste
O	The
C	gentleman
O	sighed
O	Ah
O	he
O	said
O	in
O	depressed
O	tones
O	I
O	thought
O	so
O	come
O	and
O	let
O	me
O	look
O	at
O	yours
C	Polly
O	who
O	had
O	crept
O	up
O	during
O	this
O	process
O	now
O	put
O	out
O	hers
O	But
O	the
C	gentleman
O	looked
O	gloomier
O	still
O	and
O	shook
O	his
O	head
O	What
O	is
O	it
O	cried
O	both
O	the
C	children
O	What
O	do
O	you
O	mean
O	And
O	they
O	seized
O	the
O	tips
O	of
O	their
O	tongues
O	in
O	their
O	fingers
O	to
O	feel
O	for

O	But
O	the
C	gentleman
O	went
O	slowly
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	without
O	answering
O	passing
O	his
O	hands
O	through
O	his
O	hair
O	and
O	saying
O	Ah
O	hum
O	and
O	nodding
O	with
O	an
O	air
O	of
O	grave
O	foreboding
O	Just
O	as
O	he
O	crossed
O	the
O	threshold
O	he
O	turned
O	back
O	and
O	put
O	his
O	head
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	Have
O	you
O	ever
O	noticed
O	that
O	your
O	tongues
O	are
O	growing
O	pointed
O	he
O	asked
O	No
O	cried
O	the
C	children
O	with
O	alarm
O	Are
O	they
O	If
O	ever
O	you
O	find
O	them
O	becoming
O	forked
O	said
O	the
C	gentleman
O	in
O	solemn
O	tones
O	let
O	me
O	know
O	With
O	which
O	he
O	departed
O	gravely
O	shaking
O	his
O	head
O	In
O	the
O	afternoon
O	the
C	children
O	attacked
O	him
O	again
O	tell
O	us
O	what
O	s
O	the
O	matter
O	with
O	our
O	tongues
O	You
O	were
O	snapping
O	and
O	squabbling
O	just
O	as
O	usual
O	this
O	morning
O	said
O	the
C	gentleman
O	Well
O	we
O	forgot
O	said
C	Polly
O	We
O	don
O	t
O	mean
O	anything
O	you
O	know
O	But
O	never
O	mind
O	that
O	now
O	please
O	Tell
O	us
O	about
O	our
O	tongues
O	What
O	is
O	going
O	to
O	happen
O	to
O	them
O	I
O	m
O	very
O	much
O	afraid
O	said
O	the
C	gentleman
O	in
O	solemn
O	measured
O	tones
O	that
O	you
O	are
O	both
O	of

O	suggested
C	Harry
O	who

O	learned
O	in

O	the

O	driving
O	his
O	hands
O	through
O	his
O	hair
O	Bless
O	your
O	life
O	no
O	Nothing
O	half
O	so
O	pleasant
O	That

O	were
O	like
C	Snap
O	which
O	mercifully
O	they
O	are
O	not
O	No
O	my
O	sad

O	that
O	you
O	are

O	not
O	another
O	word
O	would
O	the

O	say
O	on
O	the

O	In
O	the
O	course
O	of
O	a
O	few
O	hours
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	and
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	recovered
O	their
O	equanimity
O	The
O	punch
O	was
O	brewed
O	in
O	a
O	jug
O	and
O	tasted
O	quite
O	as
O	good
O	as
O	usual
O	The
O	evening
O	was
O	very
O	lively
O	There
O	were
O	a
O	Christmas
O	tree
O	Yule
O	cakes
O	log
O	and
O	candles
O	furmety
O	and
O	after
O	supper
O	When
O	the
O	company
O	were
O	tired
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	had
O	gained
O	an
O	appetite
O	by
O	the
O	hard
O	exercise
O	of
O	stretching
O	to
O	high
O	branches
O	blowing
O	out
O	dangerous
O	tapers
O	and
O	cutting
O	ribbon
O	and
O	in
O	all
O	directions
O	supper
O	came
O	with
O	its
O	welcome
O	cakes
O	and
O	furmety
O	and
O	punch
O	And
O	when
O	furmety
O	somewhat
O	palled
O	upon
O	the
O	taste
O	and
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	admitted
O	to
O	boast
O	more
O	sentiment
O	than
O	flavor
O	as
O	a
O	Christmas
O	dish
O	the
O	Yule
O	candles
O	were
O	blown
O	out
O	and
O	both
O	the
O	spirits
O	and
O	the
O	palates
O	of
O	the
O	party
O	were
O	stimulated
O	by
O	the
O	mysterious
O	and
O	pungent
O	pleasures
O	of
O	Then
O	as
O	the
C	gentleman
O	warmed
O	his
O	coat
O	tails
O	at
O	the
O	Yule
O	log
O	a
O	grim
O	smile
O	stole
O	over
O	his
O	features
O	as
O	he
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	sounds
O	in
O	the
O	room
O	In
O	the
O	darkness
O	the
O	blue
O	flames
O	leaped

O	the

O	were
O	snapped
O	and
O	snatched
O	from
O	hand
O	to
O	hand
O	scattering
O	fragments
O	of
O	flame
O	hither
O	and
O	thither
O	The
C	children
O	shouted
O	as
O	the
O	fiery
O	sweetmeats
O	burnt
O	away
O	the
O	mawkish
O	taste
O	of
O	the
O	furmety
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	cried
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	spoiling
O	the
O	carpet
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	complained
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	spilled
O	some
O	brandy
O	on
O	her
O	dress
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	retorted
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	not
O	wear
O	dresses
O	so
O	susceptible
O	of
O	damage
O	in
O	the
O	family
O	circle
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	recalled
O	an
O	old
O	speech
O	of
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	on
O	the
O	subject
O	of
O	wearing
O	one
O	s
O	nice
O	things
O	for
O	the
O	benefit
O	of
O	one
O	s
O	family
O	and
O	not
O	reserving
O	them
O	for
O	visitors
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	remembered
O	that
O	Mrs
O	Skratdj
O	s
O	excuse
O	for
O	buying
O	that
O	particular
O	dress
O	when
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	need
O	it
O	was
O	her
O	intention
O	of
O	keeping
O	it
O	for
O	the
O	next
O	year
O	The
C	children
O	disputed
O	as
O	to
O	the
O	credit
O	for
O	courage
O	and
O	the
O	amount
O	of
O	raisins
O	due
O	to
O	each
C	Snap
O	barked
O	furiously
O	at
O	the
O	flames
O	and
O	the
O	maids
O	hustled
O	each
O	other
O	for
O	good
O	places
O	in
O	the
O	doorway
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	allowed
O	the
O	man
O	servant
O	to
O	see
O	at
O	all
O	but
O	he
O	looked
O	over
O	their
O	heads
O	St
O	St
O	At
O	it
O	At
O	it
O	chuckled
O	the
C	gentleman
O	in
O	undertones
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	said
O	this
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	voices
O	of
C	Mr
C	Skratdj
O	and
C	Mrs
C	Skratdj
O	rose
O	higher
O	in
O	matrimonial
O	repartee
O	and
O	the
O	children
O	s
O	squabbles
O	became
O	louder
O	and
O	the
O	dog
O	yelped
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	mad
O	and
O	the
O	maids
O	contest
O	was
O	sharper
O	whilst
O	the
O	flames
O	leaped
O	up
O	and
O	up
O	and
O	blue
O	fire
O	flew
O	about
O	the
O	room
O	like
O	foam
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	raisins
O	were
O	finished
O	the
O	flames
O	were
O	all
O	put
O	out
O	and
O	the
O	company
O	withdrew
O	to
O	the
O	Only
C	Harry
O	lingered
O	Come
O	along
C	Harry
O	said
O	the
C	gentleman
O	Wait
O	a
O	minute
O	said
C	Harry
O	You
O	had
O	better
O	come
O	said
O	the
C	gentleman
O	Why
O	said
C	Harry
O	There
O	s
O	nothing
O	to
O	stop
O	for
O	The
O	raisins
O	are
O	eaten
O	the
O	brandy
O	is
O	burnt
O	out
O	No
O	it
O	s
O	not
O	said
C	Harry
O	Well
O	almost
O	It
O	would
O	be
O	better
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	quite
O	out
O	Now
O	come
O	It
O	s
O	dangerous
O	for
O	a
O	boy
O	like
O	you
O	to
O	be
O	alone
O	with
O	the
O	tonight
O	Fiddlesticks
O	said
C	Harry
O	Go
O	your
O	own
O	way
O	then
O	said
O	the
C	gentleman
O	and
O	he
O	bounced
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	and
C	Harry
O	was
O	left
O	alone
O	He
O	crept
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	table
O	where
O	one
O	little
O	pale
O	blue
O	flame
O	flickered
O	in
O	the
O	dish
O	What
O	a
O	pity
O	it
O	should
O	go
O	out
O	said
C	Harry
O	At
O	this
O	moment
O	the
O	brandy
O	bottle
O	on
O	the
O	sideboard
O	caught
O	his
O	eye
O	Just
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	murmured
C	Harry
O	to
O	himself
O	and
O	he
O	uncorked
O	the
O	bottle
O	and
O	poured
O	a
O	little
O	brandy
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	flame
O	Now
O	of
O	course
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	brandy
O	touched
O	the
O	fire
O	all
O	the
O	brandy
O	in
O	the
O	bottle
O	blazed
O	up
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	the
O	bottle
O	split
O	to
O	pieces
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	fortunate
O	for
C	Harry
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	get
O	seriously
O	hurt
O	A
O	little
O	of
O	the
O	hot
O	brandy
O	did
O	get
O	into
O	his
O	eyes
O	and
O	made
O	them
O	smart
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	shut
O	them
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	seconds
O	But
O	when
O	he
O	opened
O	them
O	again
O	what
O	a
O	sight
O	he
O	saw
O	All
O	over
O	the
O	room
O	the
O	blue
O	flames
O	leaped
O	and
O	danced
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	leaped
O	and
O	danced
O	in
O	the
O	with
O	the
O	raisins
O	And
C	Harry
O	saw
O	that
O	each
O	successive
O	flame
O	was
O	the
O	fold
O	in
O	the
O	long
O	body
O	of
O	a
C	Dragon
O	which
O	moved
O	like
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	a
O	snake
O	And
O	the
O	room
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	these
O	Dragons
O	In
O	the
O	face
O	they
O	were
O	like
O	the
O	dragons
O	one
O	sees
O	made
O	of
O	very
O	old
O	blue
O	and
O	white
O	china
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	forked
O	tongues
O	like
O	the
O	tongues
O	of
O	serpents
O	They
O	were
O	most
O	beautiful
O	in
O	color
O	being
O	Lobsters
O	who
O	have
O	just
O	changed
O	their
O	coats
O	are
O	very
O	handsome
O	but
O	the
O	violet
O	and
O	indigo
O	of
O	a
O	lobster
O	s
O	coat
O	is
O	nothing
O	to
O	the
O	brilliant
O	of
O	a
O	How
O	they
O	leaped
O	about
O	They
O	were
O	forever
O	leaping
O	over
O	each
O	other
O	like
O	seals
O	at
O	play
O	But
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	play
O	at
O	all
O	with
O	them
O	it
O	was
O	of
O	a
O	very
O	rough
O	kind
O	for
O	as
O	they
O	jumped
O	they
O	snapped
O	and
O	barked
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	and
O	their
O	barking
O	was
O	like
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	barking
O	Gnu
O	in
O	the
O	Zoological
O	Gardens
O	and
O	from
O	time
O	to

O	and
O	shot
O	out
O	his

O	the
O	dreadful
O	game
O	went
O	on
C	Harry
O	never

O	knew
O	Well
O	practised
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	snapping
O	in
O	the
O	nursery
O	he
O	often
O	failed
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	a
O	retort
O	and
O	paid
O	for
O	his
O	unreadiness
O	by
O	the

O	of

O	hair
O	Oh
O	how
O	foolish
O	and
O	wearisome
O	all
O	this
O	rudeness
O	and
O	snapping
O	now
O	seemed
O	to
O	him
O	But
O	on
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	go
O	wondering
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	how
O	near
O	it
O	was
O	to
O	twelve
O	o
O	clock
O	and

O	At
O	last
O	to
O	his
O	joy
O	it
O	became
O	evident
O	that
O	the
O	brandy
O	was
O	coming
O	to
O	an
O	end
O	The
O	Dragons
O	moved
O	slower
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	leap
O	so
O	high
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	go
O	out
O	Oh
O	if
O	they
O	only
O	all
O	of
O	them
O	get
O	away
O	before
O	twelve
O	thought
O	poor
C	Harry
O	At
O	last
O	there
O	was
O	only
O	one
O	He
O	and
C	Harry
O	jumped
O	about
O	and
O	snapped
O	and
O	barked
O	and
C	Harry
O	was
O	thinking
O	with
O	joy
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	last
O	when
O	the
O	clock
O	in
O	the
O	hall
O	gave
O	that
O	whirring
O	sound
O	which
O	clocks
O	do
O	before
O	they
O	strike
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	clearing
O	its
O	throat
O	Oh
O	go
O	screamed
C	Harry
O	in
O	despair
O	The
O	blue
C	Dragon
O	leaped
O	up
O	and
O	took
O	such
O	a
O	clawful
O	of
O	hair
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	boy
O	s
O	head
O	that
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	skin
O	went
O	too
O	But
O	that
O	leap
O	was
O	his
O	last
O	He
O	went
O	out
O	at
O	once
O	vanishing
O	before
O	the
O	first
O	stroke
O	of
O	twelve
O	And
C	Harry
O	was
O	left
O	on
O	his
O	face
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
O	When
O	his
O	friends
O	found
O	him
O	there
O	was
O	blood
O	on
O	his
O	forehead
C	Harry
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	where
O	the
C	Dragon
O	had
O	clawed
O	him
O	but
O	they
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	cut
O	from
O	a
O	fragment
O	of
O	the
O	broken
O	brandy
O	bottle
O	The
O	Dragons
O	had
O	disappeared
O	as
O	completely
O	as
O	the
O	brandy
C	Harry
O	was
O	cured
O	of
O	snapping
O	He
O	had
O	had
O	quite
O	enough
O	of
O	it
O	for
O	a
O	lifetime
O	and
O	the
O	catch
O	contradictions
O	of
O	the
O	household
O	now
O	made
O	him
O	shudder
C	Polly
O	had
O	not
O	had
O	the
O	benefit
O	of
O	his
O	experiences
O	and
O	yet
O	she
O	improved
O	also
O	In
O	the
O	first
O	place
O	snapping
O	like
O	other
O	kinds
O	of
O	quarrelling
O	requires
O	two
O	parties
O	to
O	it
O	and
C	Harry
O	would
O	never
O	be
O	a
O	party
O	to
O	snapping
O	any
O	more
O	And
O	when
O	he
O	gave
O	civil
O	and
O	kind
O	answers
O	to
C	Polly
O	s
O	smart
O	speeches
O	she
O	felt
O	ashamed
O	of
O	herself
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	repeat
O	them
O	In
O	the
O	second
O	place
O	she
O	heard
O	about
O	the
C	Harry
O	told
O	all
O	about
O	it
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	to
O	the
C	gentleman
O	Now
O	do
O	you
O	think
O	it
O	s
O	true
C	Polly
O	asked
O	the
C	gentleman
O	Hum
O	Ha
O	said
O	he

O	the

O	who

O	exceedingly

O	Never

O	from

O	the
O	little
C	Prince
O	became
O	really
O	ill
O	from
O	grief
O	and
O	the
C	King
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	alter

O	During

O	imprisonment
O	in
O	the

O	all
O	the

O	Though
O	this
O	was

O	all
O	the

O	changed
O	into

O	a

O	to

O	a

O	castle
O	for
O	them
O	As
O	the
C	Prince
O	s
O	birthday
O	drew
O	near
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	feel
O	very
O	sad
O	at
O	the
O	idea
O	of
O	having
O	to
O	stay
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	the

O	all
O	his

O	Though
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	brave
O	and
O	very
O	manly
O	young
O	man
O	he
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	his
O	couch
O	and
O	wept
O	in
O	sorrow
O	Suddenly
O	standing
O	with

O	forepaws
O	on
O	the
O	coverlet
O	Why
O	do
O	you
O	weep
O	dear

O	the
O	little
O	dog
O	At
O	my
O	fate
O	replied
O	the
O	poor
C	Prince
O	I
O	cannot
O	bear
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	I
O	may
O	have
O	to
O	spend
O	all
O	my
O	days
O	in
O	this
O	tower
O	and
O	never

O	The
C	poodle
O	was
O	silent
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	At
O	length
O	he
O	said
O	Dear
C	Prince
C	Rolandor
O	do
O	not
O	give
O	up
O	hope

O	He
O	has
O	a

O	in
O	his
O	palace
O	full
O	of
O	secrets
O	which
O	the
O	winds
O	have
O	overheard
O	and
O	perhaps
O	the
O	key
O	to
C	Malvolia
O	s
O	spell
O	is
O	among
O	them
O	If
O	you
O	will
O	have
O	a
O	warm
O	fur
O	coat
O	and
O	four
O	fur
O	boots
O	made
O	for

O	I
O	will
O	go
O	to
O	the
C	Giant
O	and
O	ask
O	him
O	The
C	Prince
O	gave
O	his
O	consent
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	the
O	royal
O	tailor
O	made
O	the
C	poodle
O	a
O	magnificent
O	sealskin
O	coat
O	and
O	four

O	Then
O	the
C	King
O	wished
O	him
O	good
O	speed
O	the
C	Queen
O	cried
O	over

O	and
O	the

O	who
O	could
O	see
O	from
O	his
O	high
O	tower
O	every
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	watched
O	him
O	till
O	he
O	disappeared
O	over
O	the
O	hills
O	and
O	far
O	away
O	Straight
O	north
O	the
C	poodle
O	ran
O	Soon
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	the
O	fertile
O	plains
O	behind
O	him
O	and
O	entered
O	great
O	black
O	pine
O	forests
O	where
O	never
O	a
O	road
O	was
O	to
O	be

O	Hungry
O	wolves
O	and

O	bears
O	often
O	pursued
O	him
O	but
O	somehow
O	he
O	always
O	managed
O	to
O	escape
O	them
O	all
O	At
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	frozen
O	ocean
O	lit
O	by
O	the
O	shuddering
O	light
O	of
O	the

O	in
O	a

O	penguins
O	he
O	flew
O	till
O	on
O	the
O	eleventh
O	day
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	green
O	icy
O	pinnacles
O	of
O	the
C	Giant
O	s
O	palace
O	against

O	On
O	the

O	he
O	entered
O	the

O	The

C	of
C	the

O	was
O	a
O	tall
O	strong

O	wearing
O	a
O	crown
O	of
O	ice
O	and
O	a

O	mantle
O	made
O	from
O	the

O	fur
O	of

O	His
O	servants
O	were
O	the

O	strange
O	supple
O	shadowy
O	creatures
O	moving
O	quickly
O	to

O	Welcome
O	little
C	Poldo
O	said
O	the
C	Giant
O	and
O	his
O	voice
O	sounded
O	like
O	the
O	wind
O	in
O	the
O	treetops
O	what
O	seek
O	you
O	here
O	I
O	seek
O	some
O	words
O	of
O	the

C	Malvolia
O	which
O	were
O	carried
O	away
O	by

C	Rolandor
O	s
O	christening

O	Pole
O	If
O	I

O	them
O	the

O	are
O	yours
O	He
O	summoned
O	two
O	Gusts
O	to
O	bring
O	forth
O	the
O	chest
O	of
O	secrets
O	It
O	was

O	of

O	In

O	all
O	the

O	ever
O	overheard
O	there
O	were
O	secrets
O	confessions
O	vows
O	merry
O	laughs
O	and

O	And
O	sure
O	enough
O	in

O	words
O	Until
O	he
O	finds
O	someone
O	brave
O	enough
O	to

O	So
O	the
O	good
C	poodle
O	learned
O	the
O	words
O	by
O	heart
O	thanked
O	the
C	Giant
O	and
O	hurried
O	home
O	with
O	the
O	message
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
C	King
O	s

O	ran
O	barking
O	with
O	joy
O	right
O	into
O	the

C	Poldo
O	The

O	That
O	very
O	evening
O	the

O	and
O	the

O	sent
O	forth
O	ambassadors
O	to

O	that
O	she
O	refused
O	the

O	The

O	the

O	of

O	was
O	a

O	A

O	The

O	though
O	perhaps
O	a
O	little
O	pale
O	from
O	his
O	confined
O	life
O	looked
O	very
O	handsome
O	and
O	led
O	his
O	ugly
O	bride
O	to
O	the
O	altar
O	like
O	a
O	man
O	Just
O	exactly
O	as
O	the

O	ceremony
O	was
O	half
O	over
O	a

O	the
O	poor
O	young
O	man
O	felt
O	strongly
O	inclined
O	to

O	be
O	seen
O	making
O	heroic
O	efforts

O	the

O	the

O	All
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	The
C	Prince
O	sneezed
O	Ker

O	A

O	what

O	happened
O	The
O	effect
O	of
O	the
O	sneeze
O	was
O	an
O	odd
O	one
O	As
O	it
O	had
O	occurred
O	exactly
O	at
O	the
O	moment
O	when
O	the
C	Prince
O	was
O	the
O	spell
O	had
O	reacted
O	upon

O	Just

O	the

O	An
O	instant
O	later
O	he
O	had
O	fallen
O	into
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	faithful
O	wife
O	who
O	had

O	went
O	on
O	a

O	to
O	the

O	As
O	for
C	Poldo
C	the
C	poodle
O	he
O	was
O	created
O	Prime
O	Minister
O	and
O	lived
O	to
O	a
O	fine
O	old
O	age
O	There
O	was
O	a
C	king
O	and
C	queen
O	who
O	were
O	dotingly
O	fond
O	of
O	their
O	only
O	son
O	notwithstanding
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	equally
O	deformed
O	in
O	mind
O	and
O	person
O	The
C	king
O	was
O	quite
O	sensible
O	of
O	the
O	evil
O	disposition
O	of
O	his
O	son
O	but
O	the
C	queen
O	in
O	her
O	excessive
O	fondness
O	saw
O	no
O	fault
O	whatever
O	in
O	her
O	dear
C	Furibon
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	named
O	The
O	surest
O	way
O	to
O	win
O	her
O	favour
O	was
O	to
O	praise
C	Furibon
O	for
O	charms
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	possess
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	of
O	age
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	governor
O	the
C	king
O	made
O	choice
O	of
O	a
C	prince
O	who
O	had
O	an
O	ancient
O	right
O	to
O	the
O	crown
O	but
O	was
O	not
O	able
O	to
O	support
O	it
O	This
C	prince
O	had
O	a
O	son
O	named
C	Leander
O	handsome
O	accomplished
O	amiable
O	in
O	every
O	respect
O	the
O	opposite
O	of
C	prince
C	Furibon
O	The
O	two
O	were
O	frequently
O	together
O	which
O	only
O	made
O	the
O	deformed
C	prince
O	more
O	repulsive
O	One
O	day
O	certain
O	ambassadors
O	having
O	arrived
O	from
O	a
O	far
O	country
O	the
O	princes
O	stood
O	in
O	a
O	gallery
O	to
O	see
O	them
O	when
O	taking
C	Leander
O	for
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	son
O	they
O	made
O	their
O	obeisance
O	to
O	him
O	treating
C	Furibon
O	as
O	a
O	mere
O	dwarf
O	at
O	which
O	the
O	latter
O	was
O	so
O	offended
O	that
O	he
O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	done
O	them
O	a
O	mischief
O	had
O	not
O	the
C	king
O	just
O	then
O	appeared
O	As
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	affair
O	produced
O	a
O	quarrel
O	which
O	ended
O	in
C	Leander
O	s
O	being
O	sent
O	to
O	a
O	castle
O	belonging
O	to
O	his
O	father
O	There
O	however
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	happy
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	lover
O	of
O	hunting
O	fishing
O	and
O	walking
O	he
O	understood
O	painting
O	read
O	much
O	and
O	played
O	upon
O	several
O	instruments
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	glad
O	to
O	be
O	freed
O	from
O	the
O	fantastic
O	humours
O	of
C	Furibon
O	One
O	day
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	walking
O	in
O	the
O	garden
O	finding
O	the
O	heat
O	increase
O	he
O	retired
O	into
O	a
O	shady
O	grove
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	play
O	upon
O	the
O	flute
O	to
O	amuse
O	himself
O	As
O	he
O	played
O	he
O	felt
O	something
O	wind
O	about
O	his
O	leg
O	and
O	looking
O	down
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	adder
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	handkerchief
O	and
O	catching
O	it
O	by
O	the
O	head
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	kill
O	it
O	But
O	the
O	adder
O	looking
O	steadfastly
O	in
O	his
O	face
O	seemed
O	to
O	beg
O	his
O	pardon
O	At
O	this
O	instant
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	gardeners
O	happened
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
C	Leander
O	was
O	and
O	spying
O	the
C	snake
O	cried
O	out
O	to
O	his
O	master
O	Hold
O	him
O	fast
O	sir
O	it
O	is
O	but
O	an
O	hour
O	since
O	we
O	ran
O	after
O	him
O	to
O	kill
O	him
O	it
O	is
O	the
O	most
O	mischievous
O	creature
O	in
O	the
O	world
C	Leander
O	casting
O	his
O	eyes
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	upon
O	the
C	snake
O	which
O	was
O	speckled
O	with
O	a
O	thousand
O	extraordinary
O	colours
O	perceived
O	the
O	poor
O	creature
O	still
O	looked
O	upon
O	him
O	with
O	an
O	aspect
O	that
O	seemed
O	to
O	implore
O	compassion
O	and
O	never
O	tried
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	to
O	defend
O	itself
O	Though
O	thou
O	hast
O	such
O	a
O	mind
O	to
O	kill
O	it
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	the
O	gardener
O	yet
O	as
O	it
O	came
O	to
O	me
O	for
O	refuge
O	I
O	forbid
O	thee
O	to
O	do
O	it
O	any
O	harm
O	for
O	I
O	will
O	keep
O	it
O	and
O	when
O	it
O	has
O	cast
O	its
O	beautiful
O	skin
O	I
O	will
O	let
O	it
O	go
O	He
O	then
O	returned
O	home
O	and
O	carrying
O	the
C	snake
O	with
O	him
O	put
O	it
O	into
O	a
O	large
O	chamber
O	the
O	key
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	kept
O	himself
O	and
O	ordered
O	bran
O	milk
O	and
O	flowers
O	to
O	be
O	given
O	to
O	it
O	for
O	its
O	delight
O	and
O	sustenance
O	so
O	that
O	never
O	was
C	snake
O	so
O	happy
C	Leander
O	went
O	sometimes
O	to
O	see
O	it
O	and
O	when
O	it
O	perceived
O	him
O	it
O	made
O	haste
O	to
O	meet
O	him
O	showing
O	him
O	all
O	the
O	little
O	marks
O	of
O	love
O	and
O	gratitude
O	of
O	which
O	a
O	poor
C	snake
O	was
O	capable
O	which
O	did
O	not
O	a
O	little
O	surprise
O	him
O	though
O	however
O	he
O	took
O	no
O	further
O	notice
O	of
O	it
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	all
O	the
O	court
O	ladies
O	were
O	extremely
O	troubled
O	at
O	his
O	absence
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	subject
O	of
O	all
O	their
O	discourse
O	Alas
O	cried
O	they
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	pleasure
O	at
O	court
O	since
C	Leander
O	is
O	gone
O	of
O	whose
O	absence
O	the
O	wicked
C	Furibon
O	is
O	the
O	cause
C	Furibon
O	also
O	had
O	his
O	parasites
O	for
O	his
O	power
O	over
O	the
C	queen
O	made
O	him
O	feared
O	they
O	told
O	him
O	what
O	the
O	ladies
O	said
O	which
O	enraged
O	him
O	to
O	such
O	a
O	degree
O	that
O	in
O	his
O	passion
O	he
O	flew
O	to
O	the
O	queen
O	s
O	chamber
O	and
O	vowed
O	he
O	would
O	kill
O	himself
O	before
O	her
O	face
O	if
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	find
O	means
O	to
O	destroy
C	Leander
O	The
C	queen
O	who
O	also
O	hated
C	Leander
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	handsomer
O	than
O	her
O	son
O	replied
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	long
O	looked
O	upon
O	him
O	as
O	a
O	traitor
O	and
O	therefore
O	would
O	willingly
O	consent
O	to
O	his
O	death
O	To
O	which
O	purpose
O	she
O	advised
C	Furibon
O	to
O	go
O	with
O	some
O	of
O	his
O	confidants
O	and
O	contrive
O	it
O	so
O	that
C	Leander
O	should
O	make
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	party
O	Then
O	said
O	she
O	you
O	may
O	find
O	some
O	way
O	to
O	punish
O	him
O	for
O	pleasing
O	everybody
C	Furibon
O	understood
O	her
O	and
O	accordingly
O	went
O	and
C	Leander
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	horns
O	and
O	the
O	hounds
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	rode
O	to
O	see
O	who
O	it
O	was
O	But
O	he
O	was
O	surprised
O	to
O	meet
O	the
C	prince
O	so
O	unexpectedly
O	he
O	alighted
O	immediately
O	and
O	saluted
O	him
O	with
O	respect
O	and
C	Furibon
O	received
O	him
O	more
O	graciously
O	than
O	usual
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	follow
O	him
O	All
O	of
O	a
O	sudden
O	he
O	turned
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	rode
O	another
O	way
O	making
O	a
O	sign
O	to
O	the
O	ruffians
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	first
O	opportunity
O	to
O	kill
O	him
O	but
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	got
O	quite
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	a
O	lion
O	of
O	prodigious
O	size
O	coming
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	den
O	leaped
O	upon
C	Furibon
O	all
O	his
O	followers
O	fled
O	and
O	only
C	Leander
O	remained
O	who
O	attacking
O	the
O	animal
O	sword
O	in
O	hand
O	by
O	his
O	valour
O	and
O	agility
O	saved
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	his
O	most
O	cruel
O	enemy
O	who
O	had
O	fallen
O	in
O	a
O	swoon
O	from
O	fear
O	When
O	he
O	recovered
C	Leander
O	presented
O	him
O	his
O	horse
O	to
O	remount
O	Now
O	any
O	other
O	than
O	such
O	a
O	wretch
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	grateful
O	but
C	Furibon
O	did
O	not
O	even
O	look
O	upon
O	him
O	nay
O	mounting
O	the
O	horse
O	he
O	rode
O	in
O	quest
O	of
O	the
O	ruffians
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	repeated
O	his
O	orders
O	to
O	kill
O	him
O	They
O	accordingly
O	surrounded
C	Leander
O	who
O	setting
O	his
O	back
O	to
O	a
O	tree
O	behaved
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	bravery
O	that
O	he
O	laid
O	them
O	all
O	dead
O	at
O	his
O	feet
C	Furibon
O	believing
O	him
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	slain
O	rode
O	eagerly
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	spot
O	When
C	Leander
O	saw
O	him
O	he
O	advanced
O	to

O	him
O	Sir
O	said
O	he
O	if

O	that

O	retired
O	sad
O	and
O	pensive
O	to
O	his

O	home
O	where
O	he
O	spent
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	pondering
O	what
O	was
O	best
O	for

O	to

O	therefore

O	at

O	Being

O	carried

O	for

O	on

O	and
O	casting

O	he
O	was
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	a

O	gather
O	some
O	wild
O	roses

O	his

O	as
O	thought
O	he
O	flew

O	three
O	roses
O	and
O	returned
O	immediately
O	to

O	that

O	had
O	succeeded
O	so

O	bade
O	him
O	keep
O	the
O	roses
O	for
O	that

O	of
O	them
O	would
O	supply
O	him
O	with
O	money
O	whenever
O	he
O	wanted
O	it
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	put
O	the

O	Now
O	you
O	must
O	know
C	Furibon

O	out
O	that

O	for
O	his
O	courage
C	Leander
O	would

O	when

O	he
O	showed
O	so
O	much
O	courage

O	resolution
O	that
C	Furibon
O	ran
O	to
O	the
O	queen
O	s

O	and
O	prayed

C	Furibon
O	being
O	impatient
O	to

O	followed

O	but
O	stopped
O	at
O	the

O	and
O	laid
O	his
O	ear
O	to
O	the
O	keyhole
O	putting
O	his

O	aside
O	that

O	hear
O	what

O	At
O	the

O	time
C	Leander
O	entered
O	the

O	he
O	took

O	a
O	hammer
O	and
O	nailed
O	his
O	ear
O	to
O	the
O	door
C	Furibon
O	began
O	to
O	roar
O	so
O	that
O	the

O	hearing
O	her

O	s
O	voice
O	ran
O	and
O	opened
O	the

O	from

O	Half
O	out
O	of

O	she
O	set
O	him
O	in
O	her
O	lap
O	took
O	up
O	his
O	ear
O	kissed
O	it
O	and

O	upon

O	with
O	which

O	corrected
O	the

O	several

O	came
O	running
O	in
O	but
O	nothing

O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	Some
O	cried
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	was
O	mad
O	and
O	that
O	her
O	madness
O	proceeded
O	from
O	her
O	grief
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	her
O	son
O	had
O	lost
O	one
O	ear
O	and
O	the

O	was
O	as
O	ready
O	as

O	to
O	believe
O	it
O	so
O	that
O	when

O	he
O	avoided

O	which
O	made
O	a
O	very
O	ridiculous
O	scene
C	Leander
O	then
O	leaving
O	the

O	went
O	into
O	the
O	garden
O	and
O	there
O	assuming
O	his

O	shape
O	he
O	boldly
O	began
O	to
O	pluck
O	the
O	queen
O	s
O	cherries
O	apricots
O	strawberries
O	and
O	flowers
O	though
O	he
O	knew

O	set
O	such
O	a
O	high
O	value
O	on
O	them
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	a
O	man
O	s
O	life
O	was
O	worth
O	to

O	one
O	The
O	gardeners
O	all
O	amazed
O	came
O	and
O	told
O	their
O	majesties
O	that
C	prince
C	Leander
O	was
O	making
O	havoc
O	of
O	all
O	the

O	in
O	the

O	What

O	said

O	then

O	him
O	as

O	deserves
C	Furibon
O	encouraged
O	by

O	mother
O	and
O	attended
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	armed
O	soldiers
O	entered
O	the
O	garden
O	and
O	saw
C	Leander
O	who
O	taking
O	refuge
O	under
O	a
O	tree
O	pelted
O	them
O	all
O	with

O	condition
O	already
O	But
C	Leander
O	played

O	one
O	trick
O	more
O	for

O	pushed
O	him
O	down
O	upon

O	so

O	Satisfied
O	with
O	this
O	revenge
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	servants
O	who
O	waited
O	for
O	him
O	and
O	giving
O	them
O	money
O	sent

O	back
O	to

O	that

O	might
O	know
O	the
O	secret
O	of
O	his
O	red
O	cap
O	and
O	roses
O	As
O	yet
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	determined
O	whither
O	to

O	however
O	he
O	mounted

O	let
O	him
O	take
O	his

O	road
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	arrived
O	in
O	a
O	forest
O	where
O	he
O	stopped
O	to
O	shelter
O	himself
O	from
O	the
O	heat
O	He
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	above
O	a
O	minute
O	there
O	before
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	lamentable
O	noise
O	of
O	sighing
O	and
O	sobbing
O	and
O	looking
O	about
O	him
O	beheld
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	ran
O	stopped
O	then
O	ran
O	again
O	sometimes
O	crying
O	sometimes
O	silent
O	then
O	tearing
O	his
O	hair
O	then
O	thumping
O	his
O	breast
O	like
O	some
O	unfortunate
O	madman
O	Yet
O	he
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	both
O	handsome
O	and
O	young
O	his
O	garments
O	had
O	been
O	magnificent
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	torn
O	them
O	all
O	to
O	tatters
O	The
C	prince
O	moved
O	with
O	compassion
O	made
O	towards
O	him
O	and
O	mildly
O	accosted
O	him
O	Sir
O	said
O	he
O	your
O	condition
O	appears
O	so
O	deplorable
O	that
O	I
O	must
O	ask
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	your
O	sorrow
O	assuring
O	you
O	of
O	every
O	assistance
O	in
O	my
O	power
O	Oh

O	answered
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	nothing
O	can
O	cure
O	my
O	grief
O	this
O	day
O	my
O	dear
O	mistress
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	sacrificed
O	to
O	a
O	rich
O	old
O	ruffian
O	of
O	a
O	husband
O	who
O	will
O	make
O	her
O	miserable
O	Does
O	she
O	love
O	you
O	then
O	asked
C	Leander
O	I
O	flatter
O	myself
O	so
O	answered
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	Where
O	is
O	she
O	continued
C	Leander
O	In
O	a
O	castle
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	this
O	forest
O	replied
O	the

O	Very
O	well
O	said
C	Leander
O	stay
O	you
O	here
O	till
O	I
O	come
O	again
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	I
O	will
O	bring
O	you
O	good
O	news
O	He
O	then
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	little
O	red
O	cap
O	and
O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	He
O	had
O	hardly
O	got
O	thither
O	before
O	he
O	heard
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	music
O	he
O	entered
O	into
O	a
O	great
O	room
O	where
O	the
O	friends
O	and
O	kindred
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	and
O	the
O	young
O	lady
O	were
O	assembled
O	No
O	one
O	could
O	look
O	more
O	amiable
O	than
O	she
O	but
O	the
O	paleness
O	of
O	her
O	complexion
O	the
O	melancholy
O	that
O	appeared
O	in
O	her
O	countenance
O	and
O	the
O	tears
O	that
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	dropped
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	by
O	stealth
O	from
O	her
O	eyes
O	betrayed
O	the
O	trouble
O	of
O	her
O	mind
C	Leander
O	now
O	became
O	invisible
O	and
O	placed
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	He
O	soon
O	perceived
O	the
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	of
O	the
O	bride
O	and
O	coming
O	behind
O	the
O	mother
O	s
O	chair
O	whispered
O	in
O	her
O	ear
O	If
O	you
O	marry
O	your
O	daughter
O	to
O	that
O	old
O	dotard
O	before
O	eight
O	days
O	are
O	over
O	you
O	shall
O	certainly
O	die
O	The
O	woman
O	frightened
O	to

O	sentence
O	pronounced
O	upon
O	her
O	and
O	yet
O	not

O	from
O	whence
O	it
O	came
O	gave
O	a
O	loud
O	shriek
O	and
O	dropped
O	upon
O	the
O	floor
O	Her
O	husband
O	asked
O	what
O	ailed
O	her
O	she
O	cried
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	dead
O	woman
O	if
O	the
O	marriage
O	of
O	her
O	daughter
O	went
O	forward
O	and
O	therefore
O	she
O	would
O	not
O	consent
O	to
O	it
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	Her
O	husband
O	laughed
O	at
O	her
O	and
O	called
O	her
O	a
O	fool
O	But
O	the
O	invisible
C	Leander
O	accosting
O	the
O	man
O	threatened
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	way
O	which
O	frightened
O	him
O	so
O	terribly
O	that
O	he
O	also
O	insisted
O	on
O	the
O	marriage
O	being
O	broken
O	off
O	When
O	the
O	lover
O	complained
C	Leander
O	trod
O	hard
O	upon
O	his
O	gouty
O	toes
O	and
O	rang
O	such
O	an
O	alarum
O	in

O	ears
O	that
O	not
O	being
O	able
O	any
O	longer
O	to
O	hear

O	speak
O	away
O	he
O	limped
O	glad
O	enough
O	to
O	go
O	The
O	real
O	lover
O	soon
O	appeared
O	and
O	he
O	and

O	fair
O	mistress
O	fell
O	joyfully
O	into

O	another

O	assuming
O	his

O	shape
O	appeared
O	at
O	the
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	a
C	stranger
O	drawn
O	thither
O	by
O	the
O	report
O	of
O	this
O	extraordinary
O	wedding
O	From
O	hence
O	he
O	travelled
O	on
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	city
O	where
O	upon
O	his
O	arrival
O	he
O	understood
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	and
O	solemn
O	procession
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	shut
O	up
O	a
O	young
O	woman
O	against
O	her
O	will
O	among
O	the
O	vestal
O	nuns
O	The
C	prince
O	was
O	touched
O	with

O	and
O	thinking
O	the
O	best
O	use
O	he
O	could
O	make
O	of
O	his
O	cap
O	was
O	to

O	relieve
O	the
O	oppressed
O	he
O	flew
O	to
O	the
O	temple
O	where
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	young
O	woman
O	crowned
O	with
O	flowers
O	clad
O	in
O	white
O	and
O	with

O	her
O	by
O	each

O	and
O	her
O	mother
O	followed
O	her
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	crowd
O	of
O	men
O	and
O	women
C	Leander
O	being
O	invisible
O	cried
O	out
O	Stop
O	stop
O	wicked
O	brethren
O	stop
O	rash
O	and
O	inconsiderate
O	mother
O	if
O	you
O	proceed
O	any
O	further
O	you
O	shall
O	be
O	squeezed
O	to
O	death
O	like
O	so
O	many
O	frogs
O	They
O	looked
O	about
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	conceive
O	from
O	whence
O	these
O	terrible
O	menaces
O	came
O	The
O	brothers
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	their
O	sister
O	s
O	lover
O	who
O	had
O	hid
O	himself
O	in
O	some
O	hole
O	at
O	which
C	Leander
O	in
O	wrath
O	took
O	a
O	long
O	cudgel
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	no
O	reason
O	to
O	say
O	the
O	blows
O	were
O	not
O	well
O	laid
O	on
O	The
O	multitude

O	the

O	ran
O	away
O	and
C	Leander
O	was
O	left
O	alone
O	with
O	the
O	victim
O	immediately
O	he
O	pulled
O	off
O	his
O	red
O	cap
O	and
O	asked
O	her
O	wherein
O	he
O	might
O	serve
O	her
O	She
O	answered
O	him
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	certain
O	gentleman
O	whom
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	glad
O	to
O	marry
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	wanted
O	an
O	estate
C	Leander
O	then
O	shook
O	his
O	rose
O	so
O	long
O	that
O	he
O	supplied
O	them
O	with
O	ten
O	millions
O	after
O	which
O	they
O	married
O	and
O	lived
O	happily
O	together
O	But
O	his
O	last
O	adventure
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	agreeable
O	Entering
O	into
O	a
O	wide
O	forest
O	he
O	heard
O	lamentable
O	cries
O	Looking
O	about
O	him
O	every
O	way
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	spied
O	four
O	men
O	well
O	armed
O	who
O	were
O	carrying
O	away
O	by
O	force
O	a
O	young
O	lady
O	thirteen
O	or
O	fourteen
O	years
O	of

O	upon
O	which
O	making
O	up
O	to
O	them
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	What
O	harm
O	has
O	that
O	girl
O	done
O	said
O	he
O	Ha
O	ha
O	my
O	little
O	master
O	cried
O	he
O	who
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	ringleader
O	of
O	the
O	rest
O	who
O	bade
O	you
O	inquire
O	Let
O	her

C	Leander
O	and
O	go
O	about
O	your
O	business
O	Oh
O	yes
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	cried
O	they
O	laughing
O	whereupon
O	the
C	prince
O	alighting
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	red
O	cap
O	not
O	thinking
O	it
O	otherwise
O	prudent
O	to
O	attack
O	four
O	who
O	seemed
O	strong
O	enough
O	to
O	fight
O	a
O	dozen
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	stayed
O	to
O	take
O	care
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	lady
O	while
O	the
O	three
O	others
O	went
O	after
O	who
O	gave
O	them
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	unwelcome
O	exercise
O	Meantime
O	the
O	young
O	lady
O	continued
O	her
O	cries
O	and
O	complaints
O	Oh
O	my
O	dear
C	Princess
O	said
O	she
O	how
O	happy
O	was
O	I
O	in
O	your
O	palace
O	Did
O	you
O	but
O	know
O	my
O	sad
O	misfortune
O	you
O	would
O	send
O	your
O	Amazons
O	to
O	rescue
O	poor
C	Abricotina
C	Leander
O	having
O	listened
O	to
O	what
O	she
O	said
O	without
O	delay
O	seized
O	the
O	ruffian
O	that
O	held
O	her
O	and
O	bound
O	him
O	fast
O	to
O	a
O	tree
O	before
O	he
O	had
O	time
O	or
O	strength
O	to
O	defend
O	himself
O	He
O	then
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	second
O	and
O	taking
O	him
O	by
O	both
O	arms
O	bound
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	to
O	another
O	tree
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
C	Abricotina
O	made
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	her
O	good
O	fortune
O	and
O	betook
O	herself
O	to
O	her
O	heels
O	not
O	knowing
O	which
O	way
O	she
O	went
O	But
C	Leander
O	missing
O	her
O	called
O	out
O	to
O	his
O	horse
O	who
O	by
O	two
O	kicks
O	with
O	his
O	hoof
O	rid
O	himself
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	ruffians
O	who
O	had
O	pursued
O	him
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	had
O	his
O	head
O	broken
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	three
O	of
O	his
O	ribs
O	And
O	now
C	Leander
O	only
O	wanted
O	to
O	overtake
C	Abricotina
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	thought
O	her
O	so
O	handsome
O	that
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	again
O	He
O	found
O	her
O	leaning
O	against
O	a
O	tree
O	When
O	she
O	saw
O	coming
O	towards
O	her
O	How
O	lucky
O	am
O	I
O	cried
O	she
O	this
O	pretty
O	little
O	horse
O	will
O	carry
O	me
O	to
O	the
O	Palace
O	of
O	Pleasure
C	Leander
O	heard
O	her
O	though
O	she
O	saw
O	him
O	not
O	he
O	rode
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	stopped
O	and
O	when
C	Abricotina
O	mounted
O	him
C	Leander
O	clasped
O	her
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	placed
O	her
O	gently
O	before
O	him
O	Oh
O	how
O	great
O	was
O	Abricotina
O	s
O	fear
O	to
O	feel
O	herself
O	fast
O	embraced
O	and
O	yet
O	see
O	nobody
O	She
O	durst
O	not
O	stir
O	and
O	shut
O	her
O	eyes
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	seeing
O	a
O	spirit
O	But
C	Leander
O	took
O	off
O	his
O	little
O	cap
O	How
O	comes
O	it
O	fair
C	Abricotina
O	said
O	he
O	that
O	you
O	are
O	afraid
O	of
O	me
O	who
O	delivered
O	you
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	ruffians
O	With
O	that
O	she
O	opened
O	her

C	Abricotina
O	would

O	him
O	though
O	she
O	was
O	otherwise
O	extremely
O	sensible

O	after

O	had
O	talked
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	of

C	Leander
O	requested

O	married
O	to
O	a

O	which
O	I
O	shall
O	never

O	said
O	how
O	happy
O	he
O	was
O	to

O	into
O	the

C	Abricotina
O	assured
O	him
O	this
O	was
O	impossible
O	and
O	therefore
O	he
O	had
O	better
O	forget
O	all
O	about
O	it
O	While
O	they
O	were
O	thus
O	conversing
O	they
O	came
O	to

O	and
O	then
O	have
O	a

O	So
O	saying
O	he

O	of
O	a

O	near
O	a

O	he
O	had
O	much

O	off
O	again
O	He
O	viewed
O	a

O	some
O	full
O	of

O	no

O	asked

O	She
O	was
O	in
O	great
O	danger
O	of
O	being
O	carried
O	away
O	from
O	this
O	palace
O	but
O	for
O	a
O	young
C	prince
O	who
O	rescued
O	her
O	The
C	Princess
O	was
O	surprised
O	at
O	the

O	his
O	answer
O	was
O	so
O	extremely
O	pertinent
O	You
O	are
O	very
O	rude
O	little
C	parrot
O	said
O	the

O	and
C	Abricotina
O	when

O	comes
O	shall
O	chastise
O	you
O	for
O	it
O	I
O	shall
O	not
O	be
O	chastised
O	answered
C	Leander
O	still
O	counterfeiting
O	the
O	parrot
O	s
O	voice
O	moreover
O	she
O	will
O	let
O	you
O	know
O	the
O	great
O	desire
O	that
C	stranger
O	had
O	to
O	be
O	admitted
O	into
O	this
O	palace
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	convince
O	you

O	the
C	Princess
O	it
O	is
O	a
O	pity
O	you
O	are
O	not
O	every
O	day
O	so
O	diverting
O	I

O	you
O	dearly
O	Ah

C	Leander
O	I

O	from
O	morning
O	till
O	night
O	But
O	continued
O	the
C	Princess
O	how
O	shall
O	I
O	be
O	sure
O	my
C	parrot
O	is
O	not

O	He
O	is
O	more
O	in

O	than

O	the

O	At
O	this
O	moment
C	Abricotina
O	entered
O	the
O	room
O	and
O	falling
O	at
O	her
O	lovely
O	mistress
O	s
O	feet
O	gave
O	her
O	a
O	full
O	account
O	of
O	what
O	had
O	befallen
O	her
O	and
O	described
O	the
C	prince
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	glowing
O	colours
O	I
O	should
O	have
O	hated
O	all

O	added
O	she

O	how
O	charming
O	he
O	is

O	and
O	all
O	his
O	behaviour
O	have
O	something
O	in
O	them
O	so
O	noble
O	and
O	though
O	whatever
O	he
O	spoke
O	was
O	infinitely
O	pleasing
O	yet
O	I
O	think
O	I
O	did
O	well
O	in
O	not
O	bringing
O	him
O	hither
O	To
O	this
O	the
C	Princess
O	said
O	nothing
O	but
O	she
O	asked
C	Abricotina
O	a
O	hundred
O	other
O	questions
O	concerning
O	the
C	prince
O	whether
O	she
O	knew
O	his
O	name
O	his
O	country
O	his
O	birth
O	from
O	whence
O	he
O	came
O	and
O	whither
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	and
O	after
O	this
O	she
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	profound
O	thoughtfulness
C	Leander
O	observed
O	everything
O	and
O	continued
O	to
O	chatter
O	as
O	he
O	had
C	Abricotina
O	is
O	ungrateful
O	madam
O	said
O	he
O	that
O	poor
C	stranger
O	will
O	die
O	for
O	grief
O	if
O	he
O	sees
O	you
O	not
O	Well
C	parrot
O	let
O	him
O	die
O	answered
O	the
C	Princess
O	with
O	a
O	sigh
O	and
O	since
O	thou
O	undertakest
O	to
O	reason
O	like
O	a
O	person
O	of
O	wit
O	and
O	not
O	like
O	a

O	bird
O	I
O	forbid
O	thee
O	to
O	talk
O	to
O	me
O	any
O	more
O	of
O	this
O	unknown
O	person
C	Leander
O	was
O	overjoyed
O	to
O	find
O	that
C	Abricotina
O	s
O	and
O	the
C	parrot
O	s
O	discourse
O	had
O	made
O	such
O	an
O	impression
O	on
O	the
C	Princess
O	He
O	looked
O	upon
O	her
O	with
O	pleasure
O	and
O	delight
O	Can
O	it
O	be
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	himself
O	that
O	the
O	masterpiece
O	of
O	nature
O	that
O	the
O	wonder
O	of
O	our
O	age

O	in
O	an

O	and
O	no

O	he
O	wherefore

O	I
O	concerned
O	that

O	hence
O	since

O	room
O	of
O	marble
O	and
O	porphyry
O	where
O	several
O	bubbling
O	fountains
O	refreshed
O	the

O	with
O	an
O	agreeable
O	coolness
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	she
O	entered

O	had
O	travelled
O	a
O	journey
O	long
O	enough
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	a
O	good
O	appetite
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	draw
O	near
O	the
O	table
O	where
O	the
O	very
O	smell
O	of

O	asked

C	Abricotina

O	having

O	picture
O	to
O	the

O	of
O	several
O	princes
O	where
O	it
O	only
O	served
O	to
O	make
O	those
O	who
O	saw
O	it
O	miserable
O	that
O	every

O	Yes
O	cried
O	the

O	a
O	certain
O	impulse
O	of
O	vanity
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	never

O	The
C	Princess
O	presently
O	asked
C	Abricotina
O	whether
O	she
O	had
O	seen
O	anything
O	extraordinary
O	during
O	her
O	short
O	travels
O	Madam
O	said
O	she
O	I
O	passed
O	through
O	one
O	forest
O	where
O	I
O	saw
O	certain
O	creatures
O	that
O	resembled
O	little
O	children
O	they
O	skip
O	and
O	dance
O	upon
O	the

O	are
O	so
O	nimble
O	as
O	you

O	is
O	impossible
O	to
O	catch
O	one
C	Leander
O	who
O	passed
O	through
O	the
O	same
O	forest
O	knew
O	what
C	Abricotina
O	meant
O	and
O	presently
O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	He
O	caught
O	a
O	dozen
O	of
O	little
O	monkeys
O	some
O	bigger
O	some
O	less
O	and
O	all
O	of
O	different

O	and
O	with
O	much
O	ado
O	put
O	them
O	into
O	a
O	large
O	sack
O	then
O	wishing
O	himself
O	at
O	Paris
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	a
O	man
O	might
O	have
O	everything
O	for
O	money
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	bought
O	a
O	little
O	gold
O	chariot
O	He
O	taught
O	six
O	green
O	monkeys
O	to

O	it
O	they
O	were
O	harnessed
O	with

O	traces
O	of
O	morocco
O	leather
O	He
O	went
O	to
O	another
O	place
O	where
O	he
O	met
O	with
O	two
O	monkeys
O	of
O	merit
O	the
O	most
O	pleasant
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	called
O	Briscambril
O	the
O	other
O	Pierceforest
O	both
O	very
O	spruce
O	and
O	well
O	educated
O	He
O	dressed
O	Briscambril
O	like
O	a
C	king
O	and
O	placed
O	him
O	in
O	the

O	Pierceforest
O	he
O	made
O	the
O	coachman
O	the
O	others
O	were
O	dressed
O	like
O	pages

O	sack
O	coach
O	and
O	all
O	The
C	Princess
O	not
O	being
O	gone
O	to
O	bed
O	heard
O	a
O	rumbling
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	coach
O	in
O	the
O	long
O	gallery
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	her
O	ladies
O	came
O	to
O	tell
O	her
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	of
O	the
O	dwarfs
O	was
O	arrived
O	and
O	the
O	chariot
O	immediately
O	entered
O	her
O	chamber
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	monkey
O	train
O	The
O	country
O	monkeys
O	began
O	to
O	show
O	a
O	thousand
O	tricks
O	which
O	far
O	surpassed
O	those
O	of
O	Briscambril
O	and
O	Pierceforest
O	To
O	say
O	the
O	truth
C	Leander
O	conducted
O	the
O	whole
O	machine
O	He
O	drew
O	the
O	chariot
O	where
O	Briscambril
O	sat
O	arrayed
O	as
O	a
C	king
O	and
O	making
O	him
O	hold
O	a
O	box
O	of
O	diamonds
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	he
O	presented
O	it
O	with
O	a
O	becoming
O	grace
O	to
O	the
C	Princess
O	The
C	Princess
O	s
O	surprise
O	may
O	be
O	easily
O	imagined
O	Moreover
O	Briscambril
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	for
O	Pierceforest
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	dance
O	with
O	him
O	The
O	most
O	celebrated
O	dancers
O	were
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	compared
O	with
O	them
O	in
O	activity
O	But
O	the
C	Princess
O	troubled
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	guess
O	from
O	whence
O	this
O	curious
O	present
O	came
O	dismissed
O	the
O	dancers
O	sooner
O	than
O	she
O	would
O	otherwise
O	have
O	done
O	though
O	she
O	was
O	extremely
O	pleased
O	with
O	them
C	Leander
O	satisfied
O	with
O	having
O	seen
O	the
O	delight
O	the
C	Princess
O	had
O	taken
O	in
O	beholding
O	the
O	monkeys
O	thought
O	of
O	nothing
O	now
O	but
O	to
O	get
O	a
O	little
O	repose
O	which
O	he
O	greatly
O	wanted
O	He
O	stayed
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	gallery
O	afterwards
O	going
O	down
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	stairs
O	and
O	finding
O	a
O	door
O	open
O	he
O	entered
O	into
O	an
O	apartment
O	the
O	most
O	delightful
O	that
O	ever
O	was
O	seen
O	There
O	was
O	in
O	it
O	a
O	bed
O	of
O	cloth
O	of
O	gold
O	enriched
O	with
O	pearls
O	intermixed
O	with
O	rubies
O	and
O	emeralds
O	for
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	there
O	appeared
O	daylight
O	sufficient
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	view
O	and
O	admire
O	the
O	magnificence
O	of
O	this
O	sumptuous
O	furniture
O	Having
O	made
O	fast
O	the
O	door
O	he
O	composed
O	himself
O	to
O	sleep
O	Next
O	day
O	he
O	rose
O	very
O	early
O	and
O	looking
O	about
O	on
O	every
O	side
O	he
O	spied
O	a
O	painter
O	s
O	pallet
O	with
O	colours
O	ready
O	prepared
O	and
O	pencils
O	Remembering
O	what
O	the
C	Princess
O	had
O	said
O	to
C	Abricotina
O	touching
O	her
O	own
O	portrait
O	he
O	immediately
O	for
O	he
O	could
O	paint
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	most
O	excellent
O	masters
O	seated
O	himself
O	before
O	a
O	mirror
O	and
O	drew
O	his
O	own
O	picture
O	first
O	then
O	in
O	an
O	oval
O	that
O	of
O	the
C	Princess
O	He
O	had
O	all
O	her
O	features
O	so
O	strong
O	in
O	his
O	imagination
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	occasion
O	for
O	her
O	sitting
O	and
O	as
O	his
O	desire
O	to
O	please
O	her
O	had
O	set
O	him
O	to
O	work
O	never
O	did
O	portrait
O	bear
O	a
O	stronger
O	resemblance
O	He
O	had
O	painted
O	himself
O	upon
O	one
O	knee
O	holding
O	the
C	Princess
O	s
O	picture
O	in
O	one
O	hand
O	and
O	in
O	the

O	a

O	When
O	the
C	Princess
O	went
O	into
O	her
O	cabinet
O	she
O	was
O	amazed
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	portrait
O	of
O	a
O	man
O	and
O	she
O	fixed
O	her
O	eyes
O	upon
O	it
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	the
O	more
O	surprise
O	because
O	she
O	also
O	saw
O	her
O	own
O	with
O	it
O	and
O	because
O	the
O	words
O	which
O	were
O	written
O	upon
O	the
O	label
O	afforded
O	her
O	ample
O	room
O	for
O	curiosity
O	She
O	persuaded
O	herself
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	Abricotina
O	s
O	doing
O	and
O	all
O	she
O	desired
O	to
O	know

O	whether
O	the
O	portrait
O	were
O	real
O	or
O	imaginary
O	Rising
O	in
O	haste
O	she
O	called
C	Abricotina
O	while
O	the
O	invisible
C	Leander
O	with
O	his
O	little
O	red
O	cap
O	slipped
O	into

O	passed
O	The
C	Princess
O	bid
C	Abricotina
O	look
O	upon
O	the
O	picture
O	and
O	tell
O	her
O	what
O	she
O	thought
O	of
O	it
O	After
O	she
O	had
O	viewed
O	it
O	I
O	protest
O	said
O	she
O	tis
O	the
O	picture
O	of
O	that
O	generous
C	stranger
O	to
O	whom
O	I
O	am
O	indebted
O	for
O	my
O	life
O	Yes
O	yes
O	I
O	am
O	sure
O	it
O	is
O	he
O	his
O	very
O	features
O	shape
O	and
O	hair
O	Thou
O	pretendest
O	surprise
O	said
O	the
C	Princess
O	but
O	I
O	know
O	it
O	was
O	thou
O	thyself
O	who
O	put
O	it
O	there
O	Who
O	I
O	madam
O	replied
C	Abricotina
O	I
O	protest
O	I
O	never
O	saw
O	the
O	picture
O	before
O	in
O	my
O	life
O	Should
O	I
O	be
O	so
O	bold
O	as
O	to
O	conceal
O	from
O	your
O	knowledge
O	a
O	thing
O	that
O	so
O	nearly
O	concerns
O	you
O	And
O	by
O	what
O	miracle
O	could
O	I
O	come
O	by
O	it
O	I
O	never
O	could
O	paint
O	nor
O	did
O	any
O	man
O	ever
O	enter
O	this
O	place
O	yet
O	here
O	he
O	is
O	painted
O	with
O	you
O	Some
O	spirit
O	then
O	must
O	have
O	brought
O	it
O	hither
O	cried
O	the
C	Princess
O	How
O	I
O	tremble
O	for
O	fear
O	madam
O	said
C	Abricotina
O	Was
O	it
O	not
O	rather
O	some
O	lover
O	And
O	therefore
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	take
O	my
O	advice
O	let
O	us
O	burn
O	it
O	immediately
O	Twere
O	a
O	pity
O	to
O	burn
O	it
O	cried
O	the
C	Princess
O	sighing
O	a
O	finer
O	piece
O	methinks
O	cannot
O	adorn
O	my
O	cabinet
O	And
O	saying
O	these
O	words
O	she
O	cast
O	her
O	eyes
O	upon
O	it
O	But
C	Abricotina
O	continued
O	obstinate
O	in
O	her
O	opinion
O	that
O	it
O	ought
O	to
O	be
O	burnt
O	as
O	a
O	thing
O	that
O	could
O	not
O	come
O	there
O	but
O	by
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	magic
O	And
O	these
O	She
O	is
O	better
O	in
O	my
O	heart
O	said
O	the
C	Princess
O	must
O	we
O	burn
O	them
O	too
O	No
O	favour
O	must
O	be
O	shown
O	to
O	anything
O	said
C	Abricotina
O	not
O	even
O	to
O	your
O	own
O	portrait
C	Abricotina
O	ran
O	away
O	immediately
O	for
O	some
O	fire
O	while
O	the
C	Princess
O	went
O	to
O	look
O	out
O	at
O	the
O	window
C	Leander
O	unwilling
O	to
O	let
O	his
O	performance
O	be
O	burnt
O	took
O	this
O	opportunity
O	to
O	convey
O	it
O	away
O	without
O	being
O	perceived
O	He
O	had
O	hardly
O	quitted
O	the
O	cabinet
O	when
O	the
C	Princess
O	turned
O	about
O	to
O	look
O	once
O	more
O	upon
O	that
O	enchanting
O	picture
O	which
O	had
O	so
O	delighted
O	her
O	But
O	how
O	was
O	she
O	surprised
O	to
O	find
O	it
O	gone
O	She
O	sought
O	for
O	it
O	all
O	the
O	room
O	over
O	and
C	Abricotina
O	returning
O	was
O	no
O	less
O	surprised
O	than
O	her
O	mistress
O	so
O	that
O	this
O	last
O	adventure
O	put
O	them
O	both
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	terrible
O	fright
C	Leander
O	took
O	great
O	delight
O	in
O	hearing
O	and
O	seeing
O	his
O	incomparable
O	mistress
O	even
O	though
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	eat
O	every
O	day
O	at
O	her
O	table
O	with
O	the
O	who
O	fared
O	never
O	the
O	worse
O	for
O	that
O	but
O	his
O	satisfaction
O	was
O	far
O	from
O	being
O	complete
O	seeing
O	he
O	durst
O	neither
O	speak
O	nor
O	show
O	himself
O	and
O	he
O	knew
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	common
O	thing
O	for
O	ladies
O	to
O	fall
O	in
O	love
O	with
O	persons
O	invisible
O	The
C	Princess
O	had
O	a
O	universal
O	taste
O	for
O	amusement
O	One
O	day
O	she
O	was
O	saying
O	to
O	her
O	attendants
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	give
O	her
O	great
O	pleasure
O	to
O	know
O	how
O	the
O	ladies
O	were
O	dressed
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	courts
O	of
O	the
O	universe
O	There
O	needed
O	no
O	more
O	words
O	to
O	send
C	Leander
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	world
O	He
O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	China
O	where
O	he
O	bought
O	the
O	richest
O	stuffs
O	he
O	could
O	lay
O	his
O	hands
O	on
O	and
O	got
O	patterns
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	court
O	fashions
O	From
O	thence
O	he
O	flew
O	to
O	Siam
O	where
O	he
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	in
O	three
O	days
O	he
O	travelled
O	over
O	all
O	the
O	four
O	parts
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	and
O	from
O	time
O	to
O	time
O	brought
O	what
O	he
O	bought
O	to
O	the
O	Palace
O	of
O	Calm
O	Delights
O	and
O	hid
O	it
O	all
O	in
O	a
O	chamber
O	which
O	he
O	kept
O	always
O	locked
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	thus
O	collected
O	together
O	all
O	the
O	rarities
O	he
O	could
O	meet
O	with
O	for
O	he
O	never
O	wanted
O	money
O	his
O	rose
O	always
O	supplying
O	him
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	bought
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	dozen
O	of
O	dolls
O	which
O	he
O	caused
O	to
O	be
O	dressed
O	at
O	Paris
O	the
O	place
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	where
O	most
O	regard
O	is
O	paid
O	to
O	fashions
O	They
O	were
O	all
O	dressed
O	differently
O	and
O	as
O	magnificent
O	as
O	could
O	be
O	and
C	Leander
O	placed
O	them
O	all
O	in
O	the
C	Princess
O	s
O	closet
O	When
O	she
O	entered
O	it
O	she
O	was
O	agreeably
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	such
O	a
O	company
O	of
O	little
O	mutes
O	every
O	one
O	decked
O	with
O	watches
O	bracelets
O	diamond
O	buckles
O	or
O	necklaces
O	and
O	the
O	most
O	remarkable
O	of
O	them
O	held
O	a
O	in
O	its
O	hand
O	which
O	the
C	Princess
O	opening
O	found
O	it
O	contained
C	Leander
O	s
O	portrait
O	She
O	gave
O	a
O	loud
O	shriek
O	and
O	looking
O	upon
C	Abricotina
O	There
O	have
O	appeared
O	of
O	late
O	said
O	she
O	so
O	many
O	wonders
O	in
O	this
O	place
O	that
O	I
O	know
O	not
O	what
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	them
O	my
O	birds
O	are
O	all
O	grown
O	witty
O	I
O	cannot
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	wish
O	but
O	presently
O	I
O	have
O	my
O	desires
O	twice
O	have
O	I
O	now
O	seen
O	the
O	portrait
O	of
O	him
O	who
O	rescued
O	thee
O	from
O	the
O	ruffians
O	and
O	here
O	are
O	silks
O	of
O	all
O	sorts
O	diamonds
O	embroideries
O	laces
O	and
O	an
O	infinite
O	number
O	of
O	other
O	rarities
O	What
C	fairy
O	is
O	it
O	that
O	takes
O	such
O	care
O	to
O	pay
O	me
O	these
O	agreeable
O	civilities
C	Leander
O	was
O	overjoyed
O	to
O	hear
O	and
O	see
O	her
O	so
O	much
O	interested
O	about
O	his
O	picture
O	and
O	calling
O	to
O	mind
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	grotto
O	which
O	she
O	often
O	frequented
O	a
O	certain
O	pedestal
O	on
O	which
O	a
O	Diana
O	not
O	yet
O	finished
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	erected
O	on
O	this
O	pedestal
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	place
O	himself
O	crowned
O	with
O	laurel
O	and
O	holding
O	a
O	lyre
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	on
O	which
O	he
O	played
O	like
O	another
O	Apollo
O	He
O	most
O	anxiously
O	waited
O	the
C	Princess
O	s
O	retiring
O	to
O	the
O	grotto
O	which
O	she
O	did
O	every
O	day
O	since
O	her
O	thoughts
O	had
O	been
O	taken
O	up
O	with
O	this
O	unknown
O	person
O	for
O	what
C	Abricotina
O	had
O	said
O	joined
O	to
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	the
O	picture
O	had
O	almost
O	destroyed
O	her
O	repose
O	her
O	lively
O	humour
O	changed
O	into
O	a
O	pensive
O	melancholy
O	and
O	she
O	grew
O	a
O	great
O	lover
O	of
O	solitude
O	When
O	she
O	entered
O	the
O	grotto
O	she
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	that
O	nobody
O	should
O	follow
O	her
O	so
O	that
O	her
O	young
O	damsels
O	dispersed
O	themselves
O	into
O	the
O	neighbouring
O	walks
O	The
C	Princess
O	threw
O	herself
O	upon
O	a
O	bank
O	of
O	green
O	turf
O	sighed
O	wept
O	and
O	even
O	talked
O	but
O	so
O	softly
O	that
C	Leander
O	could
O	not
O	hear
O	what
O	she
O	said
O	He
O	had
O	put
O	his
O	red
O	cap
O	on
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	not
O	see
O	him
O	at
O	first
O	but
O	having
O	taken
O	it
O	off
O	she
O	beheld
O	him
O	standing
O	on
O	the
O	pedestal
O	At
O	first
O	she
O	took
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	real
O	statue
O	for
O	he
O	observed
O	exactly
O	the
O	attitude
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	placed
O	himself
O	without
O	moving
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	a
O	finger
O	She
O	beheld
O	with
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	pleasure
O	intermixed
O	with
O	fear
O	but
O	pleasure
O	soon
O	dispelled
O	her
O	fear
O	and
O	she
O	continued
O	to
O	view
O	the
O	pleasing
O	figure
O	which
O	so
O	exactly
O	resembled
O	life
O	The
C	prince
O	having
O	tuned
O	his
O	lyre
O	began
O	to
O	play
O	at
O	which
O	the
C	Princess
O	greatly
O	surprised
O	could
O	not
O	resist
O	the
O	fear
O	that
O	seized
O	her
O	she
O	grew
O	pale
O	and
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	swoon
C	Leander
O	leaped
O	from
O	the
O	pedestal
O	and
O	putting
O	on
O	his
O	little
O	red
O	cap
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	perceived
O	took
O	the
C	Princess
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	gave
O	her
O	all
O	the
O	assistance
O	that
O	his
O	zeal
O	and
O	tenderness
O	could
O	inspire
O	At
O	length
O	she
O	opened
O	her
O	charming
O	eyes
O	and
O	looked
O	about
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	him
O	but
O	she
O	could
O	perceive
O	nobody
O	yet
O	she
O	felt
O	somebody
O	who
O	held
O	her
O	hands
O	kissed
O	them
O	and
O	bedewed
O	them
O	with
O	his
O	tears
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	before
O	she
O	durst
O	speak
O	and
O	her
O	spirits
O	were
O	in
O	a
O	confused
O	agitation
O	between
O	fear
O	and
O	hope
O	She
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	the
O	spirit
O	but
O	loved
O	the
O	figure
O	of
O	the
O	unknown
O	At
O	length
O	she
O	said
O	Courtly
O	invisible
O	why
O	are
O	you
O	not
O	the
O	person
O	I
O	desire
O	you
O	should
O	be
O	At
O	these
O	words
C	Leander
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	declare
O	himself
O	but
O	durst
O	not
O	do
O	it
O	yet
O	For
O	thought
O	he
O	if
O	I
O	again
O	affright
O	the
O	object
O	I
O	adore
O	and
O	make
O	her
O	fear
O	me
O	she
O	will
O	not
O	love
O	me
O	This
O	consideration
O	caused
O	him
O	to
O	keep
O	silence
O	The
C	Princess
O	then
O	believing
O	herself
O	alone
O	called
C	Abricotina
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	all
O	the
O	wonders
O	of
O	the
O	animated
O	statue
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	played
O	divinely
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	invisible
O	person
O	had
O	greatly
O	assisted
O	her
O	when
O	she
O	lay
O	in
O	a
O	swoon
O	What
O	pity
O	tis
O	said
O	she
O	that
O	this
O	person
O	should
O	be
O	so
O	frightful
O	for
O	nothing
O	can
O	be
O	more
O	amiable
O	or
O	acceptable
O	than
O	his
O	behaviour
O	Who
O	told
O	you
O	madam
O	answered
C	Abricotina
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	frightful
O	If
O	he
O	is
O	the
O	youth
O	who
O	saved
O	me
O	he
O	is
O	beautiful
O	as
O	Cupid
O	himself
O	If
O	Cupid
O	and
O	the
O	unknown
O	are
O	the
O	same
O	replied
O	the
C	Princess
O	blushing
O	I
O	could
O	be
O	content
O	to
O	love
O	Cupid
O	but
O	alas
O	how
O	far

O	picture
O	joined

O	hast
O	told

O	that

O	afraid
O	of

O	Oh
O	madam
O	said
C	Abricotina
O	interrupting
O	her
O	have
O	you
O	not
O	troubles
O	enough
O	already
O	Why
O	should
O	you

O	afflictions
O	which
O	may
O	never
O	come
O	to
O	pass
O	It
O	is
O	easy
O	to
O	imagine
O	what
O	pleasure
C	Leander
O	took
O	in
O	this
O	conversation
O	In
O	the
O	meantime
O	the
O	little
C	Furibon
O	still
O	enamoured
O	of
O	the
C	Princess
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	expected
O	with
O	impatience
O	the
O	return
O	of
O	the
O	four
O	servants
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	sent
O	to
O	the
O	Island
O	of
O	Calm
O	Delights
O	One
O	of
O	them
O	at
O	last
O	came
O	back
O	and
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	the
C	prince
O	a
O	particular
O	account
O	of
O	what
O	had
O	passed
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	defended
O	by
O	Amazons
O	and
O	that
O	unless
O	he
O	sent
O	a
O	very
O	powerful
O	army
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	impossible
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	it
O	The
C	king
O	his
O	father
O	was
O	dead
O	and
C	Furibon
O	was
O	now
O	lord
O	of
O	all
O	disdaining
O	therefore
O	any
O	repulse
O	he
O	raised
O	an
O	army
O	of
O	four
O	hundred
O	thousand
O	men
O	and
O	put
O	himself
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	them
O	appearing
O	like
O	another
O	Tom
O	Thumb
O	upon
O	a
O	Now
O	when
O	the
O	Amazons
O	perceived
O	his
O	mighty
O	host
O	they
O	gave
O	the
C	Princess
O	notice
O	of
O	it
O	who
O	immediately
O	despatched
O	away
O	her
O	trusty
C	Abricotina
O	to
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	the
O	fairies
O	to

O	do
O	to
O	drive
O	the
O	little
C	Furibon
O	from
O	her
O	territories
O	But
C	Abricotina
O	found
O	the
C	fairy
O	in
O	an
O	angry
O	humour
O	Nothing
O	that
O	my
O	daughter
O	does
O	said
O	she
O	escapes
O	my
O	knowledge
O	The
C	prince
C	Leander
O	is
O	now
O	in
O	her
O	palace
O	he
O	loves
O	her
O	and
O	she
O	has
O	a
O	tenderness
O	for
O	him
O	All
O	my
O	cares
O	and
O	precepts
O	have
O	not
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	guard
O	her
O	from
O	the
O	tyranny
O	of
O	love
O	and
O	she
O	is
O	now
O	under
O	its
O	fatal
O	dominion
O	But
O	it
O	is
O	the
O	decree
O	of
O	destiny
O	and
O	I
O	must
O	submit
O	therefore
C	Abricotina
O	begone
O	nor
O	let
O	me
O	hear
O	a
O	word
O	more
O	of
O	a
O	daughter
O	whose
O	behaviour
O	has
O	so
O	much
O	displeased
O	me
C	Abricotina
O	returned
O	with
O	these
O	ill
O	tidings
O	whereat
O	the
C	Princess
O	was
O	almost
O	distracted
O	and
O	this
O	was
O	soon
O	perceived
O	by
C	Leander
O	who
O	was
O	near
O	her
O	though
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	see
O	him
O	He
O	beheld
O	her
O	grief
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	pain
O	However
O	he
O	durst
O	not
O	then
O	open
O	his
O	lips
O	but
O	recollecting
O	that
C	Furibon
O	was
O	exceedingly
O	covetous
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	by
O	giving
O	him
O	a
O	sum
O	of
O	money
O	he
O	might
O	perhaps
O	prevail
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	retire
O	Thereupon
O	he
O	dressed
O	himself
O	like
O	an
O	Amazon
O	and
O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	to
O	catch
O	his
O	horse
O	He
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	called
O	him
O	than
O	came
O	leaping
O	prancing
O	and
O	neighing
O	for
O	joy
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	grown
O	quite
O	weary
O	of
O	being
O	so
O	long
O	absent
O	from
O	his
O	dear
O	master
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	beheld
O	him
O	dressed
O	as
O	a
O	woman
O	he
O	hardly
O	knew
O	him
O	However
O	at
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	his
O	voice
O	he
O	suffered
O	the
C	prince
O	to
O	mount
O	and
O	they
O	soon
O	arrived
O	in
O	the
O	camp
O	of
C	Furibon
O	where
O	they
O	gave
O	notice
O	that
O	a
O	lady
O	was
O	come
O	to
O	speak
O	with
O	him
O	from
O	the
C	Princess
O	of
O	Calm
O	Delights
O	Immediately
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	royal
O	robes
O	and
O	having
O	placed
O	himself
O	upon
O	his
O	throne
O	he
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	great
O	toad
O	counterfeiting
O	a
C	king
C	Leander
O	harangued
O	him
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	the
C	Princess
O	preferring
O	a
O	quiet
O	and
O	peaceable
O	life
O	to
O	the
O	fatigues
O	of
O	war
O	had
O	sent
O	to
O	offer
O	his
O	majesty
O	as
O	much
O	money
O	as
O	he
O	pleased
O	to
O	demand
O	provided
O	he
O	would
O	suffer
O	her
O	to
O	continue
O	in
O	peace
O	but
O	if
O	he
O	refused
O	her
O	proposal
O	she
O	would
O	omit
O	no
O	means
O	that
O	might
O	serve
O	for
O	her
O	defence
C	Furibon
O	replied
O	that
O	he
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	her
O	and
O	would
O	grant
O	her
O	the
O	honour
O	of
O	his
O	protection
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	demanded
O	a
O	hundred
O	thousand
O	thousand
O	millions
O	of
O	pounds
O	and
O	without
O	which
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	return
O	to
O	his
O	kingdom
C	Leander
O	answered
O	that
O	such
O	a
O	vast
O	sum
O	would
O	be
O	too
O	long
O	and
O	therefore
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	say
O	how
O	many
O	rooms
O	full
O	he
O	desired
O	to
O	have
O	the
C	Princess
O	was
O	generous
O	and
O	rich
O	enough
O	to
O	satisfy
O	him
C	Furibon
O	was
O	astonished
O	to
O	hear
O	that
O	instead
O	of
O	entreating
O	she
O	would
O	rather
O	offer
O	more
O	and
O	it
O	came
O	into
O	his
O	wicked
O	mind
O	to
O	take
O	all
O	the
O	money
O	he
O	could
O	get
O	and
O	then
O	seize
O	the
O	Amazon
O	and
O	kill
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	never
O	return
O	to
O	her
O	mistress
O	He
O	told
C	Leander
O	therefore
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	thirty
O	chambers
O	of
O	gold
O	all
O	full
O	to
O	the
O	ceiling
C	Leander
O	being
O	conducted
O	into
O	the
O	chambers
O	took
O	his
O	rose
O	and
O	shook
O	it
O	till
O	every
O	room
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	coin
C	Furibon
O	was
O	in
O	an
O	ecstasy
O	and
O	the
O	more
O	gold
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	greater
O	was
O	his
O	desire
O	to
O	get
O	hold
O	of
O	the
O	Amazon
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	all
O	the
O	rooms
O	were
O	full
O	he
O	commanded
O	his
O	guards
O	to
O	seize
O	her
O	alleging
O	she
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	counterfeit
O	money
O	Immediately
C	Leander
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	little
O	red
O	cap
O	and
O	disappeared
O	The
O	guards
O	believing
O	that
O	the
O	lady
O	had
O	escaped
O	ran
O	out
O	and
O	left
C	Furibon
O	alone
O	when
C	Leander
O	availing
O	himself
O	of
O	the
O	opportunity
O	took
O	the
O	tyrant
O	by
O	the
O	hair
O	and
O	twisted
O	his
O	head
O	off
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	ease
O	he
O	would
O	a
O	pullet
O	s
O	nor
O	did
O	the
O	little
O	wretch
O	of
O	a
C	king
O	see
O	the
O	hand
O	that
O	killed
O	him
C	Leander
O	having
O	got
O	his
O	enemy
O	s
O	head
O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	Palace
O	of
O	Calm
O	Delights
O	where
O	he
O	found
O	the
C	Princess
O	walking
O	and
O	with
O	grief
O	considering
O	the
O	message
O	which
O	her
O	mother
O	had
O	sent
O	her
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	means
O	to
O	repel
C	Furibon
O	Suddenly
O	she
O	beheld
O	a
O	head
O	hanging
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	with
O	nobody
O	to
O	hold
O	it
O	This
O	prodigy
O	astonished
O	her
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	what
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	but
O	her
O	amazement
O	was
O	increased
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	head
O	laid
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	and
O	heard
O	a
O	voice
O	utter
O	these
O	words
O	Charming
C	Princess
O	cease
O	your
O	fear
O	Of
C	Furibon
O	whose
O	head
O	see
O	here
C	Abricotina
O	knowing
C	Leander
O	s
O	voice
O	cried
O	I
O	protest
O	madam
O	the
O	invisible
O	person
O	who
O	speaks
O	is
O	the
O	very
C	stranger
O	that
O	rescued
O	me
O	The
C	Princess
O	seemed
O	astonished
O	but
O	yet
O	pleased
O	Oh
O	said
O	she
O	if
O	it
O	be
O	true
O	that
O	the
O	invisible
O	and
O	the
C	stranger
O	are
O	the
O	same
O	person
O	I
O	confess
O	I
O	shall
O	be
O	glad
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	my
O	acknowledgments
C	Leander
O	still
O	invisible
O	replied
O	I
O	will
O	yet
O	do
O	more
O	to
O	deserve
O	them
O	and
O	so
O	saying
O	he
O	returned
O	to
C	Furibon
O	s
O	army
O	where
O	the
O	report
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	death
O	was
O	already
O	spread
O	throughout
O	the
O	camp
O	As
O	soon
O	as
C	Leander
O	appeared
O	there
O	in
O	his
O	usual
O	habit
O	everybody
O	knew
O	him
O	all
O	the
O	officers
O	and
O	soldiers
O	surrounded
O	him
O	uttering
O	the
O	loudest
O	acclamations
O	of
O	joy
O	In
O	short
O	they
O	acknowledged
O	him
O	for
O	their
C	king
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	crown
O	of
O	right
O	belonged
O	to
O	him
O	for
O	which
O	he
O	thanked
O	them
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	first
O	mark
O	of
O	his
O	royal
O	bounty
O	divided
O	the
O	thirty
O	rooms
O	of
O	gold
O	among
O	the
O	soldiers
O	This
O	done
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
C	Princess
O	ordering
O	the
O	army
O	to
O	march
O	back
O	into
O	his
O	kingdom
O	The
C	Princess
O	was
O	gone
O	to
O	bed
C	Leander
O	therefore
O	retired
O	into
O	his
O	own
O	apartment
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	sleepy
O	so
O	sleepy
O	that
O	he
O	forgot
O	to
O	bolt
O	his
O	door
O	and
O	so
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	the
C	Princess
O	rising
O	early
O	to
O	taste
O	the
O	morning
O	air
O	chanced
O	to
O	enter
O	into
O	this
O	very
O	chamber
O	and
O	was
O	greatly
O	astonished
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	young
C	prince
O	asleep
O	upon
O	the
O	bed
O	She
O	took
O	a
O	full
O	view
O	of
O	him
O	and
O	was
O	convinced
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	person
O	whose
O	picture
O	she
O	had
O	in
O	her
O	diamond
O	box
O	It
O	is
O	impossible
O	said
O	she
O	that
O	this
O	should
O	be
O	a
O	spirit
O	for
O	can
O	spirits
O	sleep
O	Is
O	this
O	a
O	body
O	composed
O	of
O	air
O	and
O	fire
O	without
O	substance
O	as
C	Abricotina
O	told
O	me
O	She
O	softly
O	touched
O	his
O	hair
O	and
O	heard
O	him
O	breathe
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	him
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	could
O	have
O	looked
O	for
O	ever
O	While
O	she
O	was
O	thus
O	occupied
O	her
O	mother
O	the
C	fairy
O	entered
O	with
O	such
O	a
O	dreadful
O	noise
O	that
C	Leander
O	started
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	sleep
O	But
O	how
O	deeply
O	was
O	he
O	afflicted
O	to
O	behold
O	his
O	beloved
C	Princess
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	deplorable
O	condition
O	Her
O	mother
O	dragged
O	her
O	by
O	the
O	hair
O	and
O	loaded
O	her
O	with
O	a
O	thousand

O	This
O	short
O	compliment
O	pleased
O	the
C	fairy
O	exceedingly
O	for
O	she
O	belonged
O	to
O	those
O	ancient
O	days
O	when

O	whole
O	day
O	upon
O	one
O	leg
O	complimenting
O	one
O	another
O	The
O	nuptials
O	were

O	in
O	a
O	most
O	splendid
O	manner
O	and
O	the
O	young
C	prince
O	and
C	Princess
O	lived
O	together
O	happily
O	for
O	many
O	years
O	beloved
O	by
O	all
O	around
O	them
O	In
O	the
O	days
O	of
O	King
O	Alfred
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	poor
O	woman
O	whose
O	cottage
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	remote
O	country
O	village
O	many
O	miles
O	from
O	London
O	She
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	widow
O	some
O	years
O	and
O	had
O	an
O	only
O	child
O	named
C	Jack
O	whom
O	she
O	indulged
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	never
O	paid
O	the
O	least
O	attention
O	to
O	anything
O	she
O	said
O	but
O	was
O	indolent
O	careless
O	and
O	extravagant
O	His
O	follies
O	were
O	not
O	owing
O	to
O	a
O	bad
O	disposition
O	but
O	to
O	his
C	mother
O	s
O	foolish
O	partiality
O	By
O	degrees
O	he
O	spent
O	all
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	scarcely
O	anything
O	remained
O	but
O	a
O	cow
O	One
O	day
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	in
O	her
O	life
O	she
O	reproached
O	him
O	Cruel
O	cruel
O	boy
O	you
O	have
O	at
O	last
O	brought
O	me
O	to
O	beggary
O	I
O	have
O	not
O	money
O	enough
O	to
O	purchase
O	even
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	bread
O	nothing
O	now
O	remains
O	to
O	sell
O	but
O	my
O	poor
O	cow
O	I
O	am
O	sorry
O	to
O	part
O	with
O	her
O	it
O	grieves
O	me
O	sadly
O	but
O	we
O	cannot
O	starve
O	For
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
C	Jack
O	felt
O	remorse
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	soon
O	over
O	and
O	he
O	began
O	asking
O	his
C	mother
O	to
O	let
O	him
O	sell
O	the
O	cow
O	at
O	the
O	next
O	village
O	teasing
O	her
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	she
O	at
O	last
O	consented
O	As
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	along
O	he
O	met
O	a
C	butcher
O	who
O	inquired
O	why
O	he
O	was
O	driving
O	the
O	cow
O	from
O	home
C	Jack
O	replied
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	sell
O	it
O	The
C	butcher
O	held
O	some
O	curious
O	beans
O	in
O	his
O	hat
O	they
O	were
O	of
O	various
O	colors
O	and
O	attracted
C	Jack
O	s
O	attention
O	this
O	did
O	not
O	pass
O	unnoticed
O	by
O	the
O	man
O	who
O	knowing
C	Jack
O	s
O	easy
O	temper
O	thought
O	now
O	was
O	the
O	time
O	to
O	take
O	an
O	advantage
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	determined
O	not
O	to
O	let
O	slip
O	so
O	good
O	an
O	opportunity
O	asked
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	price
O	of
O	the
O	cow
O	offering
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	all
O	the
O	beans
O	in
O	his
O	hat
O	for
O	her
O	The
O	silly
O	boy
O	could
O	not
O	conceal
O	the
O	pleasure
O	he
O	felt
O	at
O	what
O	he
O	supposed
O	so
O	great
O	an
O	offer
O	the
O	bargain
O	was
O	struck
O	instantly
O	and
O	the
O	cow
O	exchanged
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	paltry
O	beans
C	Jack
O	made
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	home
O	calling
O	aloud
O	to
O	his
C	mother
O	before
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	door
O	thinking
O	to
O	surprise
O	her
O	When
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	beans
O	and
O	heard
C	Jack
O	s
O	account
O	her
O	patience
O	quite
O	forsook
O	her
O	she
O	tossed
O	the
O	beans
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	where
O	they
O	fell
O	on
O	the
O	below
O	Then
O	she
O	threw
O	her
O	apron
O	over
O	her
O	head
O	and
O	cried
O	bitterly
C	Jack
O	attempted
O	to
O	console
O	her
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	and
O	not
O	having
O	anything
O	to
O	eat
O	they
O	both
O	went
O	supperless
O	to
O	bed
C	Jack
O	awoke
O	early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	and
O	seeing
O	something
O	uncommon
O	darkening
O	the
O	window
O	of
O	his
O	bedchamber
O	ran
O	downstairs
O	into
O	the
O	garden
O	where
O	he
O	found
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	beans
O	had
O	taken
O	root
O	and
O	sprung
O	up
O	surprisingly
O	the
O	stalks
O	were
O	of
O	an
O	immense
O	thickness
O	and
O	had
O	twined
O	together
O	until
O	they
O	formed
O	a
O	ladder
O	like
O	a
O	chain
O	and
O	so
O	high
O	that
O	the
O	top
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	lost
O	in
O	the
O	clouds
C	Jack
O	was
O	an
O	adventurous
O	lad
O	he
O	determined
O	to
O	climb
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	and
O	ran
O	to
O	tell
O	his
C	mother
O	not
O	doubting
O	but
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	equally
O	pleased
O	with
O	himself
O	She
O	declared
O	he
O	should
O	not
O	go
O	said
O	it
O	would
O	break
O	her
O	heart
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	entreated
O	and
O	threatened
O	but
O	all
O	in
O	vain
C	Jack
O	set
O	out
O	and
O	after
O	climbing
O	for
O	some
O	hours
O	reached
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	quite
O	exhausted
O	Looking
O	around
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	strange
O	country
O	it
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	barren
O	desert
O	not
O	a
O	tree
O	shrub
O	house
O	or
O	living
O	creature
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	were
O	scattered
O	fragments
O	of
O	stone
O	and
O	at
O	unequal
O	distances
O	small
O	heaps
O	of
O	earth
O	were
O	loosely
O	thrown
O	together
C	Jack
O	seated
O	himself
O	pensively
O	upon
O	a
O	block
O	of
O	stone
O	and
O	thought
O	of
O	his
C	mother
O	he
O	reflected
O	with
O	sorrow
O	upon
O	his
O	disobedience
O	in
O	climbing
O	the
O	against
O	her
O	will
O	and
O	concluded
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	die
O	of
O	hunger
O	However
O	he
O	walked
O	on
O	hoping
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	house
O	where
O	he
O	might
O	beg
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	drink
O	He
O	did
O	not
O	find
O	it
O	but
O	he
O	saw
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	a
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	walking
O	all
O	alone
O	She
O	was
O	elegantly
O	clad
O	and
O	carried
O	a
O	white
O	wand
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	which
O	sat
O	a
O	peacock
O	of
O	pure
O	gold
C	Jack
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	gallant
O	fellow
O	went
O	straight
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	when
O	with
O	a
O	bewitching
O	smile
O	she
O	asked
O	him
O	how
O	he
O	came
O	there
O	He
O	told
O	her
O	all
O	about
O	the
O	The
O	lady
O	answered
O	him
O	by
O	a
O	question
O	Do
O	you
O	remember
O	your
C	father
O	young
O	man
O	No
O	madam
O	but
O	I
O	am
O	sure
O	there
O	is
O	some
O	mystery
O	about
O	him
O	for
O	when
O	I
O	name
O	him
O	to
O	my
C	mother
O	she
O	always
O	begins
O	to
O	weep
O	and
O	will
O	tell
O	me
O	nothing
O	She
O	dare
O	not
O	replied
O	the
O	lady
O	but
O	I
O	can
O	and
O	will
O	For
O	know
O	young
O	man
O	that
O	I
O	am
O	a
C	fairy
O	and
O	was
O	your
C	father
O	s
O	guardian
O	But
O	fairies
O	are
O	bound
O	by
O	laws
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	mortals
O	and
O	by
O	an
O	error
O	of
O	mine
O	I
O	lost
O	my
O	power
O	for
O	a
O	term
O	of
O	years
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	unable

O	your
C	father
O	when
O	he
O	most
O	needed
O	it
O	and

O	Here
O	the

O	looked
O	so
O	sorrowful
O	that
C	Jack
O	s
O	heart
O	warmed
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	he
O	begged
O	her
O	earnestly
O	to
O	tell
O	him
O	more
O	I
O	will
O	only
O	you
O	must

O	Your

O	had
O	a
O	good

O	but
O	he
O	had
O	one
O	misfortune
O	a
O	false
O	friend
O	This
O	was
O	a
C	giant
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	succoured
O	in
O	misfortune
O	and
O	who
O	returned
O	his
O	kindness
O	by
O	murdering
O	him
O	and
O	seizing
O	on
O	all
O	his
O	property
O	also
O	making
O	your

O	your
C	father
O	or
O	he
O	would
O	murder
O	both
O	her

O	he
O	turned
O	her
O	off
O	with
O	you
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	to
O	wander
O	about

C	Jack

O	Along
O	the

O	till
O	you

O	You
O	must

O	I
O	will

O	Farewell
O	She
O	bestowed
O	on
O	the
O	youth
O	a
O	benignant
O	smile
O	and
O	vanished
C	Jack
O	pursued
O	his
O	journey
O	He
O	walked
O	on
O	till
O	after
O	sunset
O	when
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	joy
O	he
O	espied
O	a
O	large
O	mansion
O	A
O	woman
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	he
O	accosted
O	her
O	begging
O	she
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	a
O	morsel
O	of
O	bread
O	and
O	a
O	night
O	s
O	lodging
O	She
O	expressed
O	the
O	greatest
O	surprise
O	and
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	uncommon
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	human
O	being
O	near
O	their
O	house
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	well
O	known
O	that
O	her
O	husband
O	was
O	a
O	powerful
C	giant
O	who
O	would
O	never
O	eat
O	anything
O	but
O	human
O	flesh
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	possibly
O	get
O	it
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	walk
O	fifty
O	miles
O	to
O	procure
O	it
O	usually
O	being
O	out
O	the
O	whole
O	day
O	for
O	that
O	purpose
O	This
O	account
O	greatly
O	terrified
C	Jack
O	but
O	still
O	he
O	hoped
O	to
O	elude
O	the
C	giant
O	and
O	therefore
O	he
O	again
O	entreated
O	the
O	woman
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	in
O	for
O	one
O	night
O	only
O	and
O	hide
O	him
O	where
O	she
O	thought
O	proper
O	She
O	at
O	last
O	suffered
O	herself
O	to
O	be
O	persuaded
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	of
O	a
O	compassionate
O	and
O	generous
O	disposition
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	First
O	they
O	entered
O	a
O	fine
O	large
O	hall
O	magnificently
O	furnished
O	they
O	then
O	passed
O	through
O	several
O	spacious
O	rooms
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	style
O	of
O	grandeur
O	but
O	all
O	appeared
O	forsaken
O	and
O	desolate
O	A
O	long
O	gallery
O	came
O	next
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	dark
O	just
O	light
O	enough
O	to
O	show
O	that
O	instead
O	of
O	a
O	wall
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	grating
O	of
O	iron
O	which
O	parted
O	off
O	a
O	dismal
O	dungeon
O	from
O	whence
O	issued
O	the
O	groans
O	of
O	those
O	victims
O	whom
O	the
O	cruel
C	giant
O	reserved
O	in
O	confinement
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	voracious
O	appetite
O	Poor
C	Jack
O	was
O	half
O	dead
O	with
O	fear
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	given
O	the
O	world
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	with
O	his
C	mother
O	again
O	for
O	he
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	doubt
O	if
O	he
O	should
O	ever
O	see
O	her
O	more
O	he
O	even
O	mistrusted
O	the
O	good
O	woman
O	and
O	thought
O	she
O	had
O	let
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	for
O	no
O	other
O	purpose
O	than
O	to
O	lock
O	him
O	up
O	among
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	people
O	in
O	the
O	dungeon
O	However
O	she
O	bade
C	Jack
O	sit
O	down
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	plenty
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	drink
O	and
O	he
O	not
O	seeing
O	anything
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	uncomfortable
O	soon
O	forgot
O	his
O	fear
O	and
O	was
O	just
O	beginning
O	to
O	enjoy
O	himself
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	startled
O	by
O	a
O	loud
O	knocking
O	at
O	the
O	outer
O	door
O	which
O	made
O	the
O	whole
O	house
O	shake
O	Ah
O	that
O	s
O	the
C	giant
O	and
O	if
O	he
O	sees
O	you
O	he
O	will
O	kill
O	you
O	and
O	me
O	too
O	cried
O	the
O	poor
O	woman
O	trembling
O	all
O	over
O	What
O	shall
O	I
O	do
O	Hide
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	oven
O	cried
C	Jack
O	now
O	as
O	bold
O	as
O	a
O	lion
O	at
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	being
O	face
O	to
O	face
O	with
O	his
C	father
O	s
O	cruel
O	murderer
O	So
O	he
O	crept
O	into
O	the
O	oven
O	for
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	fire
O	near
O	it
O	and
O	listened
O	to
O	the
C	giant
O	s
O	loud
O	voice
O	and
O	heavy
O	step
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	the
O	kitchen
O	scolding
O	his
C	wife
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	seated
O	himself
O	at
O	table
O	and
C	Jack
O	peeping
O	through
O	a
O	crevice
O	in
O	the
O	oven
O	was
O	amazed
O	to
O	see
O	what
O	a
O	quantity
O	of
O	food
O	he
O	devoured
O	It
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	never
O	would
O	have
O	done
O	eating
O	and
O	drinking
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	at
O	last
O	and
O	leaning
O	back
O	called
O	to
O	his
C	wife
O	in
O	a
O	voice
O	like
O	thunder
O	Bring
O	me
O	my
O	hen
O	She
O	obeyed
O	and
O	placed
O	upon
O	the
O	table
O	a
O	very
O	beautiful
O	live
O	hen
O	Lay
O	roared
O	the
C	giant
O	and
O	the
O	hen
O	laid
O	immediately
O	an
O	egg
O	of
O	solid
O	gold
O	Lay
O	another
O	and
O	every
O	time
O	the
C	giant
O	said
O	this
O	the
O	hen
O	laid
O	a
O	larger
O	egg
O	than
O	before
O	He
O	amused
O	himself
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	with
O	his
O	hen
O	and
O	then
O	sent
O	his
C	wife
O	to
O	bed
O	while
O	he
O	fell
O	asleep
O	by
O	the
O	fireside
O	and
O	snored
O	like
O	the
O	roaring
O	of
O	cannon
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	asleep
C	Jack
O	crept
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	oven
O	seized
O	the
O	hen
O	and
O	ran
O	off
O	with
O	her
O	He
O	got
O	safely
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	finding
O	his
O	way
O	along
O	the
O	road
O	he
O	came
O	reached
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	which
O	he
O	descended
O	in
O	safety
O	His
C	mother
O	was
O	overjoyed
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	She
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	some
O	ill
O	end
O	Not
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	it
C	mother
O	Look
O	here
O	and
O	he
O	showed
O	her
O	the
O	hen
O	Now
O	lay
O	and
O	the
O	hen
O	obeyed
O	him
O	as
O	readily
O	as
O	the
C	giant
O	and
O	laid
O	as
O	many
O	golden
O	eggs
O	as
O	he
O	desired
O	These
O	eggs
O	being
O	sold
C	Jack
O	and
O	his
C	mother
O	got
O	plenty
O	of
O	money
O	and
O	for
O	some
O	months
O	lived
O	very
O	happily
O	together
O	till
C	Jack
O	got
O	another
O	great
O	longing
O	to
O	climb
O	the
O	and
O	carry
O	away
O	some
O	more
O	of
O	the
C	giant
O	s
O	riches
O	He
O	had
O	told
O	his
C	mother
O	of
O	his
O	adventure
O	but
O	had
O	been
O	very
O	careful
O	not
O	to
O	say
O	a
O	word
O	about
O	his
C	father
O	He
O	thought
O	of
O	his
O	journey
O	again
O	and
O	again
O	but
O	still
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	summon
O	resolution
O	enough
O	to
O	break
O	it
O	to
O	his
C	mother
O	being
O	well
O	assured
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	endeavour
O	to
O	prevent
O	his
O	going
O	However
O	one
O	day
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	boldly
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	take
O	another
O	journey
O	up
O	the
O	she
O	begged
O	and
O	prayed
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	tried
O	all
O	in
O	her
O	power
O	to
O	dissuade
O	him
O	She
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	the
C	giant
O	s
C	wife
O	would
O	certainly
O	know
O	him
O	again
O	and
O	that
O	the
C	giant
O	would
O	desire
O	nothing
O	better
O	than
O	to
O	get
O	him
O	into
O	his
O	power
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	put
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	cruel
O	death
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	be
O	revenged
O	for
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	hen
C	Jack
O	finding
O	that
O	all
O	his
O	arguments
O	were
O	useless
O	ceased
O	speaking
O	though
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	at
O	all
O	events
O	He
O	had
O	a
O	dress
O	prepared
O	which
O	would
O	disguise
O	him
O	and
O	something
O	to
O	colour
O	his
O	skin
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	impossible
O	for
O	any
O	one
O	to
O	recollect
O	him
O	in
O	this
O	dress
O	A
O	few
O	mornings
O	after
O	he
O	rose
O	very
O	early
O	and
O	unperceived
O	by
O	any
O	one
O	climbed
O	the
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	He
O	was
O	greatly
O	fatigued
O	when
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	top
O	and
O	very
O	hungry
O	Having
O	rested
O	some
O	time
O	on
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	stones
O	he
O	pursued
O	his
O	journey
O	to
O	the
C	giant
O	s
O	mansion
O	which
O	he
O	reached
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	the
O	woman
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	as
O	before
C	Jack
O	addressed
O	her
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	telling
O	her
O	a
O	pitiful
O	tale
O	and
O	requesting
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	some
O	victuals
O	and
O	drink
O	and
O	also
O	a
O	night
O	s
O	lodging
O	She
O	told
O	him
O	what
O	he
O	knew
O	before
O	very
O	well
O	about
O	her
O	husband
O	s
O	being
O	a
O	powerful
O	and
O	cruel
C	giant
O	and
O	also
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	one
O	night
O	admitted
O	a
O	poor
O	hungry
O	friendless
O	boy
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	ungrateful
O	fellow
O	had
O	stolen
O	one
O	of
O	the
C	giant
O	s
O	treasures
O	and
O	ever
O	since
O	that
O	her
O	husband
O	had
O	been
O	worse
O	than
O	before
O	using
O	her
O	very
O	cruelly
O	and
O	continually
O	upbraiding
O	her
O	with
O	being
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	his
O	misfortune
C	Jack
O	felt
O	sorry
O	for
O	her
O	but
O	confessed
O	nothing
O	and
O	did
O	his
O	best
O	to
O	persuade
O	her
O	to
O	admit
O	him
O	but
O	found
O	it
O	a
O	very
O	hard
O	task
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	consented
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	led
O	the
O	way
C	Jack
O	observed
O	that
O	everything
O	was
O	just
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	found
O	it
O	before
O	she
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	kitchen
O	and
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	eating
O	and
O	drinking
O	she
O	hid
O	him
O	in
O	an
O	old
O	The
C	giant
O	returned
O	at
O	the
O	usual
O	time
O	and
O	walked
O	in
O	so
O	heavily
O	that
O	the
O	house
O	was
O	shaken
O	to
O	its
O	foundation
O	He
O	seated
O	himself
O	by
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	soon
O	after
O	exclaimed
C	wife
O	I
O	smell
O	fresh
O	meat
O	The
C	wife
O	replied
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	crows
O	which
O	had
O	brought
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	raw
O	meat
O	and
O	left
O	it
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	While
O	supper
O	was
O	preparing
O	the
C	giant
O	was
O	very
O	and
O	impatient
O	frequently
O	lifting
O	up
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	strike
O	his
C	wife
O	for
O	not
O	being
O	quick
O	enough
O	He
O	was
O	also
O	continually
O	upbraiding
O	her
O	with
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	wonderful
O	hen
O	At
O	last
O	having
O	ended
O	his
O	supper
O	he
O	cried
O	Give
O	me
O	something
O	to
O	amuse
O	me
O	my
O	harp
O	or
O	my
O	Which
O	will
O	you
O	have
O	my
O	dear
O	said
O	the
C	wife
O	humbly
O	My
O	because
O	they
O	are
O	the
O	heaviest
O	to
O	carry
O	thundered
O	he
O	She
O	brought
O	them
O	staggering
O	under
O	the
O	weight
O	two
O	bags
O	one
O	filled
O	with
O	new
O	guineas
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	with
O	new
O	shillings
O	she
O	emptied
O	them
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	and
O	the
C	giant
O	began
O	counting
O	them
O	in
O	great
O	glee
O	Now
O	you
O	may
O	go
O	to
O	bed
O	you
O	old
O	fool
O	So
O	the
C	wife
O	crept
O	away
C	Jack
O	from
O	his
O	watched
O	the
O	counting
O	of
O	the
O	money
O	which
O	he
O	knew
O	was
O	his
O	poor
C	father
O	s
O	and
O	wished
O	it
O	was
O	his
O	own
O	it
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	much
O	less
O	trouble
O	than
O	going
O	about
O	selling
O	the
O	golden
O	eggs
O	The
C	giant
O	little
O	thinking
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	narrowly
O	observed
O	reckoned
O	it
O	all
O	up
O	and
O	then
O	replaced
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	two
O	bags
O	which
O	he
O	tied
O	up
O	very
O	carefully
O	and
O	put
O	beside
O	his
O	chair
O	with
O	his
O	little
O	dog
O	to
O	guard
O	them
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	fell
O	asleep
O	as
O	before
O	and
O	snored
O	so
O	loud
O	that
C	Jack
O	compared
O	his
O	noise
O	to
O	the
O	roaring
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	in
O	a
O	high
O	wind
O	when
O	the
O	tide
O	is
O	coming
O	in
O	At
O	last
C	Jack
O	concluding
O	all
O	secure
O	stole
O	out
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	carry
O	off
O	the
O	two
O	bags
O	of
O	money
O	but
O	just
O	as
O	he
O	laid
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	the
O	little
O	dog
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	perceived
O	before
O	started
O	from
O	under
O	the
C	giant
O	s
O	chair
O	and
O	barked
O	most
O	furiously
O	Instead
O	of
O	endeavouring
O	to
O	escape
C	Jack
O	stood
O	still
O	though
O	expecting
O	his
O	enemy
O	to
O	awake
O	every
O	instant
O	Contrary
O	however
O	to
O	his
O	expectation
O	the
C	giant
O	continued
O	in
O	a
O	sound
O	sleep
O	and
C	Jack
O	seeing
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	meat
O	threw
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	dog
O	who
O	at
O	once
O	ceased
O	barking
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	devour
O	it
O	So
C	Jack
O	carried
O	off
O	the
O	bags
O	one
O	on
O	each
O	shoulder
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	so
O	heavy
O	that
O	it
O	took
O	him
O	two
O	whole
O	days
O	to
O	descend
O	the
O	and
O	get
O	back
O	to
O	his
C	mother
O	s
O	door
O	When
O	he
O	came
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	cottage
O	deserted
O	He
O	ran
O	from
O	one
O	room
O	to
O	another
O	without
O	being
O	able
O	to
O	find
O	any
O	one
O	he
O	then
O	hastened
O	into
O	the
O	village
O	hoping
O	to
O	see
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	neighbours
O	who
O	could
O	inform
O	him
O	where
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	his
C	mother
O	An
O	old
O	woman
O	at
O	last
O	directed
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	house
O	where
O	she
O	was
O	ill
O	of
O	a
O	fever
O	He
O	was
O	greatly
O	shocked
O	at
O	finding
O	her
O	apparently
O	dying
O	and
O	blamed
O	himself
O	bitterly
O	as
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	it
O	all
O	However
O	at
O	sight
O	of
O	her
O	dear
O	son
O	the
O	poor
O	woman
O	revived
O	and
O	slowly
O	recovered
O	health
C	Jack
O	gave
O	her
O	his
O	two
O	they
O	had
O	the
O	cottage
O	rebuilt
O	and
O	well
O	furnished
O	and
O	lived
O	happier
O	than
O	they
O	had
O	ever
O	done
O	before
O	For
O	three
O	years
C	Jack
O	heard
O	no
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	forget
O	it
O	though
O	he
O	feared
O	making
O	his
C	mother
O	unhappy
O	It
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	endeavouring
O	to
O	amuse
O	himself
O	he
O	became
O	thoughtful
O	and
O	would
O	arise
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	dawn
O	of
O	day
O	and
O	sit
O	looking
O	at
O	the
O	for
O	hours
O	together
O	His
C	mother
O	saw
O	that
O	something
O	preyed
O	upon
O	his
O	mind
O	and
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	discover
O	the
O	cause
O	but
C	Jack
O	knew
O	too
O	well
O	what
O	the
O	consequence
O	would
O	be
O	should
O	she
O	succeed
O	He
O	did
O	his
O	utmost
O	therefore
O	to
O	conquer
O	the
O	great
O	desire
O	he
O	had
O	for
O	another
O	journey
O	up
O	the
O	Finding
O	however
O	that
O	his
O	inclination
O	grew
O	too
O	powerful
O	for
O	him
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	make
O	secret
O	preparations
O	for
O	his
O	journey
O	He
O	got
O	ready
O	a
O	new
O	disguise
O	better
O	and
O	more
O	complete
O	than
O	the
O	former
O	and
O	when
O	summer
O	came
O	on
O	the
O	longest
O	day
O	he
O	awoke
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	light
O	and
O	without
O	telling
O	his
C	mother
O	ascended
O	the
O	He
O	found
O	the
O	road
O	journey
O	much
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	two
O	former
O	times
O	He
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
C	giant
O	s
O	mansion
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	and
O	found
O	the
C	wife
O	standing
O	as
O	usual
O	at
O	the
O	door
C	Jack
O	had
O	disguised
O	himself
O	so
O	completely
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	least
O	recollection
O	of
O	him
O	however
O	when
O	he
O	pleaded
O	hunger
O	and
O	poverty
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	gain
O	admittance
O	he
O	found
O	it
O	very
O	difficult
O	indeed
O	to
O	persuade
O	her
O	At
O	last
O	he
O	prevailed
O	and
O	was
O	concealed
O	in
O	the
O	copper
O	When
O	the
C	giant
O	returned
O	he
O	said
O	furiously
O	I
O	smell
O	fresh
O	meat
O	But
C	Jack
O	felt
O	quite
O	composed
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	said
O	so
O	before
O	and
O	had
O	been
O	soon
O	satisfied
O	However
O	the
C	giant
O	started
O	up
O	suddenly
O	and
O	notwithstanding
O	all
O	his
C	wife
O	could
O	say
O	he
O	searched
O	all
O	round
O	the
O	room
O	Whilst
O	this
O	was
O	going
O	forward
C	Jack
O	was
O	exceedingly
O	terrified
O	wishing
O	himself
O	at
O	home
O	a
O	thousand
O	times
O	but
O	when
O	the
C	giant
O	approached
O	the
O	copper
O	and
O	put
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	the
O	lid
C	Jack
O	thought
O	his
O	death
O	was
O	certain
O	However
O	nothing
O	happened
O	for
O	the
C	giant
O	did
O	not
O	take
O	the
O	trouble
O	to
O	lift
O	up
O	the
O	lid
O	but
O	sat
O	down
O	shortly
O	by
O	the
O	fireside
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	eat
O	his
O	enormous
O	supper
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	finished
O	he
O	commanded
O	his
C	wife
O	to
O	fetch
O	down
O	his
O	harp
C	Jack
O	peeped
O	under
O	the
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	most
O	beautiful
O	harp
O	The
C	giant
O	placed
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	said
O	Play
O	and
O	it
O	played
O	of
O	its
O	own
O	accord
O	without
O	anybody
O	touching
O	it
O	the
O	most
O	exquisite
O	music
O	imaginable
C	Jack
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	musician
O	was
O	delighted
O	and
O	more
O	anxious
O	to
O	get
O	this
O	than
O	any
O	other
O	of
O	his
O	enemy
O	s
O	treasures
O	But
O	the
C	giant
O	not
O	being
O	particularly
O	fond
O	of
O	music
O	the
O	harp
O	had
O	only
O	the
O	effect
O	of
O	lulling
O	him
O	to
O	sleep
O	earlier
O	than
O	usual
O	As
O	for
O	the
C	wife
O	she
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	bed
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	ever
O	she
O	could
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	thought
O	all
O	was
O	safe
C	Jack
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	copper
O	and
O	seizing
O	the
O	harp
O	was
O	eagerly
O	running
O	off
O	with
O	it
O	But
O	the
O	harp
O	was
O	enchanted
O	by
O	a
C	fairy
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	found
O	itself
O	in
O	strange
O	hands
O	it
O	called
O	out
O	loudly
O	just
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	alive
O	Master
O	Master
O	The
C	giant
O	awoke
O	started
O	up
O	and
O	saw
C	Jack
O	scampering
O	away
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	his
O	legs
O	could
O	carry
O	him
O	Oh
O	you
O	villain
O	it
O	is
O	you
O	who
O	have
O	robbed
O	me
O	of
O	my
O	hen
O	and
O	my
O	and
O	now
O	you
O	are
O	stealing
O	my
O	harp
O	also
O	Wait
O	till
O	I
O	catch
O	you
O	and
O	I
O	ll
O	eat
O	you
O	up
O	alive
O	Very
O	well
O	try
O	shouted
C	Jack
O	who
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	bit
O	afraid
O	for
O	he
O	saw
O	the
C	giant
O	was
O	so
O	tipsy
O	he
O	could
O	hardly
O	stand
O	much
O	less
O	run
O	and
O	he
O	himself
O	had
O	young
O	legs
O	and
O	a
O	clear
O	conscience
O	which
O	carry
O	a
O	man
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	So
O	after
O	leading
O	the
C	giant
O	a
O	considerable
O	race
O	he
O	contrived
O	to
O	be
O	first
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	and
O	then
O	scrambled
O	down
O	it
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	the
O	harp
O	playing
O	all
O	the
O	while
O	the
O	most
O	melancholy
O	music
O	till
O	he
O	said
O	Stop
O	and
O	it
O	stopped
O	Arrived
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	he
O	found
O	his
C	mother
O	sitting
O	at
O	her
O	weeping
O	silently
O	Here
C	mother
O	don

O	cry
O	just

O	knew
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	a

O	to
O	spare
O	he

O	too
O	late

C	Jack
O	with

O	cut
O	the

O	the

O	fell
O	headlong
O	into
O	the

O	and
O	was
O	killed
O	on
O	the
O	spot
O	Instantly
O	the
C	fairy
O	appeared
O	and
O	explained
O	everything
O	to
C	Jack
O	s
C	mother
O	begging
O	her
O	to

C	Jack

O	nothing
O	was
O	ever
O	beard

O	seen
O	of

O	There
O	was
O	once
O	a

O	who
O	was
O	very
O	poor
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	beautiful
C	daughter
O	Now
O	it
O	happened
O	that

O	I
O	have
O	a
C	daughter
O	who
O	can
O	spin
O	straw

O	The
C	king
O	said
O	to
O	the
C	miller
O	That
O	is
O	a
O	talent
O	that
O	pleases
O	me
O	well
O	if

O	as
O	skilful
O	as
O	you
O	say
O	bring
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	put
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	proof
O	When
O	the
O	maiden
O	was
O	brought
O	to
O	him
O	he
O	led
O	her
O	to
O	a
O	room
O	full
O	of
O	straw
O	gave
O	her
O	a
O	wheel
O	and
O	spindle
O	and
O	said
O	Now
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	and
O	if
O	by
O	the
O	morrow
O	this
O	straw
O	be
O	not
O	spun
O	into
O	gold
O	you
O	shall
O	die
O	He
O	locked
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	maiden
O	alone
O	The
O	poor
O	girl
O	sat
O	down
O	disconsolate
O	and
O	could
O	not

O	her
O	life
O	think
O	what
O	she
O	was
O	to

O	she
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	spin
O	straw
O	into
O	gold
O	and
O	her
O	distress
O	increased
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	All
O	at
O	once
O	the

O	opened
O	and
O	a
C	little
C	man
O	entered
O	and
O	said
O	Good
O	evening
O	my
O	pretty
C	daughter
O	why
O	are
O	you
O	weeping
O	so
O	bitterly
O	Ah
O	answered
O	the
O	maiden
O	I
O	must
O	spin
O	straw
O	into
O	gold
O	and
O	know
O	not
O	how
O	to

O	it
O	The
C	little
C	man
O	said
O	What
O	will
O	you
O	give
O	me
O	if
O	I
O	do
O	it
O	for
O	you
O	My
O	neckerchief
O	said
O	the
O	maiden
O	He
O	took
O	the
O	kerchief
O	sat
O	down
O	before
O	the
O	wheel
O	and
O	grind
O	grind
O	grind
O	three
O	times
O	did
O	he
O	grind
O	and
O	the
O	spindle
O	was
O	full
O	then
O	he
O	put
O	another
O	thread
O	on

O	grind
O	grind
O	grind
O	the
O	second
O	was
O	full
O	so
O	he
O	spun
O	on
O	till
O	morning
O	when
O	all
O	the
O	straw
O	was
O	spun
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	spindles
O	were
O	full
O	of
O	gold
O	The
C	king
O	came
O	at
O	sunrise
O	and
O	was
O	greatly
O	astonished
O	and
O	overjoyed
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	but
O	it
O	only
O	made
O	his
O	heart
O	the
O	more
O	greedy
O	of
O	gold
O	He
O	put
O	the
C	daughter
O	into
O	another
O	much
O	larger
O	room
O	full
O	of
O	straw
O	and
O	ordered
O	her
O	to

O	it
O	all
O	in
O	one
O	night
O	if
O	life
O	were
O	dear
O	to
O	her
O	The
O	poor
O	helpless
O	maiden
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	when
O	once
O	more
O	the
O	door
O	flew
O	open
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	appeared
O	and
O	said
O	What

O	you
O	give
O	me
O	if
O	I
O	spin
O	this
O	straw
O	into
O	gold
O	My
O	ring
O	from
O	my
O	finger
O	answered
O	the
O	maiden
O	The
C	little
C	man
O	took
O	the
O	ring
O	began
O	to
O	turn
O	the
O	wheel
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	morning
O	all
O	the
O	straw
O	was
O	spun
O	into
O	shining
O	gold
O	The
C	king
O	was
O	highly
O	delighted
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	it
O	but
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	satisfied
O	with
O	the
O	quantity
O	of
O	gold
O	so
O	he
O	put
O	the
O	damsel
O	into
O	a
O	still
O	larger
O	room
O	full
O	of
O	straw
O	and
O	said
O	Spin
O	this
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	and
O	if
O	you
O	do
O	it
O	you
O	shall
O	be
O	my
O	wife
O	For
O	he
O	thought
O	if
O	she
O	s
O	only
O	a
C	daughter
O	I
O	shall
O	never
O	find
O	a
O	richer
O	wife
O	in
O	the
O	whole
O	world
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	damsel
O	was
O	alone
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	came
O	the
O	third
O	time
O	and
O	said
O	What
O	will
O	you
O	give
O	me
O	if
O	I
O	again
O	spin
O	all
O	this
O	straw
O	for
O	you
O	I
O	have
O	nothing
O	more
O	to
O	give
O	you
O	answered
O	the
O	girl
O	Then
O	promise
O	if
O	you
O	become
O	queen
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	your
O	first
C	child
O	Who
O	knows
O	how
O	that
O	may
O	be
O	or
O	how
O	things
O	may
O	turn
O	out
O	between
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	thought
O	the
O	girl
O	but
O	in
O	her
O	perplexity
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	herself
O	so
O	she
O	promised
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	what
O	he
O	desired
O	and
O	he
O	spun
O	all
O	the
O	straw
O	into
O	gold
O	When
O	the
C	king
O	came
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	his
O	orders
O	had
O	been
O	obeyed
O	he
O	married
O	the
O	maiden
O	and
O	the
O	beautiful
C	daughter
O	became
O	a
O	queen
O	After
O	a
O	year
O	had
O	passed
O	she
O	brought
O	a
O	lovely
O	baby
O	into
O	the
O	world
O	but
O	quite
O	forgot
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	till
O	he
O	walked
O	suddenly
O	into
O	her
O	chamber
O	and
O	said
O	Give
O	me
O	what
O	you
O	promised
O	me
O	The
O	queen
O	was
O	frightened
O	and
O	offered
O	the
O	dwarf
O	all
O	the
O	riches
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	only
O	leave
O	her
O	her
C	child
O	but
O	he
O	answered
O	No
O	something
O	living
O	is
O	dearer
O	to
O	me
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	treasures
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	Then
O	the
O	queen
O	began
O	to
O	grieve
O	and
O	to
O	weep
O	so
O	bitterly
O	that
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	took
O	pity
O	upon
O	her
O	and
O	said
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	you
O	three
O	days
O	if
O	in
O	that
O	time
O	you
O	can
O	find
O	out
O	my
O	name
O	you
O	shall
O	keep
O	the
C	child
O	All
O	night
O	long
O	the
O	queen
O	thought
O	over
O	every
O	name
O	she
O	had
O	ever
O	heard
O	and
O	sent
O	a
O	messenger
O	through
O	the
O	kingdom
O	to
O	inquire
O	what
O	names
O	were
O	usually
O	given
O	to
O	people
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	When
O	next
O	day
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	came
O	again
O	she
O	began
O	with
O	Caspar
O	Melchoir
O	Balthazar
O	and
O	repeated
O	each
O	after
O	each
O	all
O	the
O	names
O	she
O	knew
O	or
O	had
O	heard
O	of
O	but
O	at
O	each
O	one
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	said
O	That
O	is
O	not
O	my
O	name
O	The
O	second
O	day
O	she
O	again
O	sent
O	round
O	about
O	in
O	all
O	directions
O	to
O	ask
O	how
O	the
O	people
O	were
O	called
O	and
O	repeated
O	to
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	the
O	strangest
O	names
O	she
O	could
O	hear
O	of
O	or
O	imagine
O	to
O	each
O	he
O	answered
O	always
O	That
O	is
O	not
O	my
O	name
O	The
O	third
O	day
O	the
O	messenger
O	returned
O	and
O	said
O	I
O	have
O	not
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	single
O	new
O	name
O	but
O	as
O	I
O	came
O	over
O	a
O	high
O	mountain
O	by
O	a
O	wood
O	where
O	the
O	fox
O	and
O	the
O	hare
O	bid
O	each
O	other
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	little
O	house
O	and
O	before
O	the
O	house
O	was
O	burning
O	a
O	little
O	fire
O	and
O	round
O	the
O	fire
O	danced
O	a
O	very
O	funny
C	little
C	man
O	who
O	hopped
O	upon
O	one
O	leg
O	and
O	cried
O	out

C	Rumpelstilzchen
O	You
O	may
O	guess
O	how
O	joyful
O	the
O	queen
O	was
O	at
O	hearing
O	this
O	and
O	when
O	soon
O	after
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	entered
O	and
O	said
O	Queen
O	what

O	witch
O	has
O	told
O	you
O	shrieked
O	the
O	poor
C	little
C	man
O	and
O	stamped
O	so
O	furiously
O	with
O	his
O	right
O	foot
O	that
O	it
O	sunk
O	into
O	the
O	earth
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	hip
O	then
O	he
O	seized
O	his
O	left
O	foot
O	with
O	both
O	hands
O	with
O	such
O	violence
O	that
O	he
O	tore
O	himself
O	right
O	in
O	two
O	Once
O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	had
O	a
O	daughter
O	who
O	was
O	called
C	Clever
C	Alice
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	grown
O	up
O	her
C	father
O	said
O	We
O	must
O	see
O	about
O	her
O	marrying
O	0
O	Yes
O	replied
O	her
C	mother
O	whenever
O	a
O	young
O	man
O	shall
O	appear
O	who
O	is
O	worthy
O	of
O	her
O	0
O	At
O	last
O	a
O	certain
O	youth
O	by
O	name
C	Hans
O	came
O	from
O	a
O	distance
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	proposal
O	of
O	marriage
O	but
O	he
O	required
O	one
O	condition
O	that
O	the
C	Clever
C	Alice
O	should
O	be
O	very
O	prudent
O	0
O	Oh
O	said
O	her
C	father
O	no
O	fear
O	of
O	that
O	she
O	has
O	got
O	a
O	head
O	full
O	of
O	brains
O	and
O	the
C	mother
O	added
O	Ah
O	she
O	can
O	see
O	the
O	wind
O	blow
O	up
O	the
O	street
O	and
O	hear
O	the
O	flies
O	cough
O	Very
O	well
O	replied
C	Hans
O	but
O	remember
O	if
O	she
O	is
O	not
O	very
O	prudent
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	take
O	her
O	0
O	Soon
O	afterwards
O	they
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	dinner

O	her
C	mother
O	said
C	Alice
O	go
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	cellar
O	and
O	draw
O	some
O	beer

O	So
C	Clever
C	Alice
O	took
O	the
O	jug
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	wall
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	cellar
O	jerking
O	the
O	lid
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	on

O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	she
O	got
O	downstairs
O	she
O	drew
O	a

O	placed
O	it
O	before
O	the
O	cask
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	not
O	have
O	to
O	stoop
O	for
O	she
O	thought
O	stooping
O	might
O	in
O	some

O	her
O	back

O	of

O	during

C	Jacques
O	carried
O	a

O	quarter
O	in

O	suspended
O	it
O	beside
O	the
O	closed
O	fireplace
O	later
O	cutting
O	off
O	steaks
O	for
O	supper
O	and
O	breakfast
O	They
O	passed
O	a
O	merry
O	evening
O	each
O	telling
O	stories
O	of
O	his
O	experiences
O	which
O	were
O	so
O	different
O	in
O	quality
O	that
O	they
O	possessed
O	all
O	the
O	charm
O	of
O	novelty
O	to
O	the
O	respective
O	listeners
O	Again
C	Ray
O	set
O	the
O	door
O	ajar
O	after
O	they
O	had
O	undressed
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	both
O	were
O	asleep
O	Several
O	hours
O	passed
O	Had
O	either
O	young
O	man
O	been
O	awake
O	he
O	might

O	heard
O	soft
O	footfalls
O	about

O	A
O	squatty
O	heavily
O	built
O	animal
O	with
O	huge
O	feet

O	tail
O	and
O	pointed
O	ears
O	adorned
O	with
O	tufts
O	of
O	hair
O	had
O	traced
O	the
O	slaughtered
O	deer
O	to
O	the
O	farmhouse
O	by
O	means
O	of
O	drops
O	of
O	blood
O	and
O	now
O	was
O	searching
O	eagerly
O	for
O	the
O	meat
O	He
O	sought
O	the

O	and
O	again
O	and
O	even
O	sprang
O	to
O	the
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	inside
O	Then
O	he
O	came
O	back
O	and
O	sniffed
O	at
O	the
O	partly
O	open
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	The
O	human
O	smell
O	was
O	there
O	and
O	he
O	hesitated
O	But
O	so
O	too
O	was
O	the
O	odor
O	of
O	fresh
O	venison
O	and
O	his
O	mouth
O	watered
O	A
O	round
O	head
O	was
O	thrust
O	inside
O	the

O	hemlocks
O	to

O	cast
O	its
O	rays
O	through
O	a
O	window
O	directly
O	upon
O	the
O	fresh
O	meat
O	The
O	temptation
O	was
O	greater
O	than
O	the
O	intruder
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	withstand
O	Inch
O	by
O	inch
O	he
O	crowded
O	past
O	the
O	swaying
O	door
O	and
O	silently
O	crept
O	toward
O	the
O	venison
O	The
O	two
O	men
O	were
O	breathing
O	very
O	loudly
O	but
O	neither
O	stirred
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	gathered
O	supreme
O	courage
O	and
O	leaped
O	upon
O	the
O	meat
O	It
O	fell
O	with
O	a
O	crash
O	against
O	the
O	stove
O	and
O	the
O	two
O	were
O	awakened
O	simultaneously
O	As

O	toward

O	He
O	collided
O	with

O	knocking
O	the
O	billet
O	of
O	wood
O	outside
O	and
O	the
O	latch
O	fell
O	into
O	place
O	with
O	a
O	clash
O	Finding
O	himself
O	a
O	prisoner
O	the
O	creature
O	advanced
O	spitting

O	straight
O	at

O	retreated
O	to

O	the

O	was
O	about

O	too

O	turned

O	at

O	so
O	viciously
O	that
O	in
O	a
O	couple
O	of
O	seconds
O	he
O	too
O	found

O	As
O	he
O	flung
O	the

O	wide
O	open
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	rasping
O	of
O	the
O	lynx
O	s
O	claws
O	on
O	the

C	Jacques
O	a

C	Ray
O	grinned

O	who

O	a
C	donkey
O	which
O	had
O	carried
O	his
O	sacks
O	to
O	the
O	mill
O	industriously
O	for
O	many
O	years
O	but
O	whose
O	strength
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	an
O	end
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	poor
O	beast
O	grew
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	unfit
O	for
O	work
O	The
C	master
O	determined
O	to
O	stop
O	his
O	food
O	but
O	the
C	donkey
O	discovering
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	good
O	intended
O	to
O	him
O	ran
O	away
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	road
O	to
O	Bremen
O	There
O	thought
O	he
O	I
O	can
O	turn
O	Town
O	Musician
O	When
O	he
O	had
O	gone
O	a
O	little
O	way
O	he
O	found
O	a
O	hound
O	lying
O	on
O	the
O	road
O	and
O	panting
O	like
O	one
O	who
O	was
O	tired
O	with
O	running
O	Hollo
O	what
O	are
O	you
O	panting
O	so
O	for
O	worthy
O	Seize
O	em
O	asked
O	the
C	donkey
O	Oh
O	said
O	the
C	dog
O	just
O	because
O	I
O	am
O	old
O	and
O	get
O	weaker
O	every
O	day
O	and
O	cannot
O	go
O	out
O	hunting
O	my
C	master
O	wanted
O	to
O	kill
O	me
O	so
O	I
O	have
O	taken
O	leave
O	of
O	him
O	but
O	how
O	shall
O	I
O	gain
O	my
O	living
O	now
O	I
O	ll
O	tell
O	you
O	what
O	said
O	the
C	donkey

O	and
O	you
O	shall
O	beat
O	the

O	The
C	dog
O	liked
O	the
O	idea
O	and
O	they
O	travelled
O	on
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	they
O	saw
O	a
C	cat
O	sitting
O	by
O	the
O	road
O	making
O	a
O	face
O	like
O	three
O	rainy
O	days
O	Now
O	then
O	what
O	has
O	gone
O	wrong
O	with
O	you
O	old
O	Whiskers
O	said
O	the
C	donkey
O	Who
O	can
O	be
O	merry
O	when
O	his
O	neck
O	is
O	in
O	danger
O	answered
O	the
C	cat
O	Because
O	I
O	am
O	advanced
O	in
O	years
O	and
O	my
O	teeth
O	are
O	blunt
O	and
O	I
O	like
O	sitting
O	before
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	purring
O	better
O	than
O	chasing
O	the
O	mice
O	about
O	my
O	mistress
O	wanted
O	to
O	drown
O	me
O	I
O	have
O	managed
O	to
O	escape
O	but
O	good
O	advice
O	is
O	scarce
O	tell
O	me
O	where
O	I
O	shall
O	go
O	to
O	Come
O	with
O	us
O	two
O	to
O	Bremen
O	you
O	understand
O	serenading
O	you
O	also
O	can
O	become
O	a
O	Town
O	Musician
O	The
C	cat
O	thought
O	it
O	a
O	capital
O	idea
O	and
O	went
O	with
O	them
O	Soon
O	after
O	the
O	three
O	runaways
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	farmyard
O	and
O	there
O	sat
O	a
C	cock
O	on
O	the
O	gate
O	crowing
O	with
O	might
O	and
O	main
O	You
O	crow
O	loud
O	enough
O	to
O	deafen
O	one
O	said
O	the
C	donkey
O	what
O	is
O	the
O	matter
O	with
O	you
O	I
O	prophesied
O	fair
O	weather
O	said
O	the
C	cock
O	because
O	it
O	is
O	our
O	good
O	mistress
O	s
O	and
O	she
O	wants
O	to
O	dry
O	the
O	clothes
O	but
O	because
O	is
O	Sunday
O	and
O	company
O	is
O	coming
O	the
O	mistress
O	has
O	no
O	pity
O	on
O	me
O	and
O	has
O	told
O	the
O	cook
O	to
O	put
O	me
O	into
O	the
O	soup
O	and
O	I
O	must
O	have
O	my
O	head
O	cut
O	off
O	so
O	now
O	I
O	am
O	crowing
O	with
O	all
O	my
O	might
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	I
O	can
O	O
O	you
O	old
O	Redhead
O	said
O	the
C	donkey
O	you
O	had
O	better
O	come
O	with
O	us
O	we
O	are
O	going
O	to
O	Bremen
O	where
O	you
O	will
O	certainly
O	find
O	something
O	better
O	than
O	having
O	your
O	head
O	cut
O	off
O	you
O	have
O	a
O	good
O	voice
O	and
O	if
O	we
O	all
O	make
O	music
O	together
O	it
O	will
O	be
O	something
O	striking
O	The
C	cock
O	liked
O	the
O	proposal
O	and
O	they
O	went
O	on
O	all
O	four
O	together
O	But
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	reach
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	Bremen
O	in
O	one
O	day
O	and
O	they
O	came
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	to
O	a
O	wood
O	where
O	they
O	agreed
O	to
O	spend
O	the
O	night
O	The
C	donkey
O	and
O	the
C	dog
O	laid
O	themselves
O	down
O	under
O	a
O	great
O	tree
O	but
O	the
C	cat
O	and
O	the
C	cock
O	went
O	higher
O	the
C	cock
O	flying
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	topmost
O	branch
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	safest
O	Before
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	he
O	looked
O	round
O	towards
O	all
O	the
O	four
O	points
O	of
O	the
O	compass
O	and
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	spark
O	shining
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	He
O	called
O	to
O	his
O	companions
O	that
O	there
O	must
O	be
O	a
O	house
O	not
O	far
O	off
O	for
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	a
O	light
O	The
C	donkey
O	said
O	Then
O	we
O	must
O	rise
O	and
O	go
O	to
O	it
O	for
O	the
O	lodgings
O	here
O	are
O	very
O	bad
O	and
O	the
C	dog
O	said
O	Yes
O	a
O	few
O	bones
O	with
O	a
O	little
O	flesh
O	on
O	them
O	would
O	do
O	me
O	good
O	So
O	they
O	took
O	the
O	road
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	where
O	the
O	light
O	was
O	and
O	soon
O	saw
O	it
O	shine
O	brighter
O	and
O	it
O	got
O	larger
O	and
O	larger
O	till
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	robber
O	s
O	house
O	The
C	donkey
O	being
O	the
O	biggest
O	got
O	up
O	at
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	looked
O	in
O	What
O	do
O	you
O	see
O	Greybeard
O	said
O	the
C	cock
O	What
O	do
O	I
O	see
O	answered
O	the
C	donkey
O	a
O	table
O	covered
O	with
O	beautiful
O	food
O	and
O	drink
O	and
C	robbers
O	are
O	sitting
O	round
O	it
O	and
O	enjoying
O	themselves
O	That
O	would
O	do
O	nicely
O	for
O	us
O	said
O	the
C	cock
O	Yes
O	indeed
O	if
O	we
O	were
O	only
O	there
O	replied
O	the
C	donkey
O	The
O	animals
O	then
O	consulted
O	together
O	how
O	they
O	should
O	manage
O	to
O	drive
O	out
O	the
C	robbers
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	settled
O	on
O	a
O	plan
O	Tie
C	donkey
O	was
O	to
O	place
O	himself
O	with
O	his
O	forefeet
O	on
O	the
O	the
C	dog
O	to
O	climb
O	on
O	the
C	donkey
O	s
O	back
O	and
O	the
C	cat
O	on
O	the
C	dog
O	s
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	the
C	cock
O	was
O	to
O	fly
O	up
O	and
O	perch
O	himself
O	on
O	the
C	cat
O	s
O	head
O	When
O	that
O	was
O	done
O	at
O	a
O	signal
O	they
O	began
O	their
O	music
O	all
O	together
O	the
C	donkey
O	brayed
O	the
C	dog
O	barked
O	the
C	cat
O	mewed
O	and
O	the
C	cock
O	crowed
O	then
O	with
O	one
O	great
O	smash
O	they
O	dashed
O	through
O	the
O	window
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	glass
O	clattered
O	down
O	The
C	robbers
O	jumped
O	up
O	at
O	this
O	dreadful
O	noise
O	thinking
O	that
O	nothing
O	less
O	than
O	a
O	ghost
O	was
O	coming
O	in
O	and
O	ran
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	fright
O	The
O	four
O	companions
O	then
O	sat
O	down
O	at
O	the
O	table
O	quite
O	content
O	with
O	what
O	was
O	left
O	there
O	and
O	ate
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	were
O	expecting
O	to
O	fast
O	for
O	a
O	month
O	to
O	come
O	When
O	the
O	four
O	musicians
O	had
O	finished
O	they
O	put
O	out
O	the
O	light
O	and
O	each
O	one
O	looked
O	out
O	for
O	a
O	suitable
O	and
O	comfortable
O	The
C	donkey
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	the

O	behind
O	the

O	on
O	the
O	hearth
O	near
O	the
O	warm
O	ashes
O	and
O	the
C	cock
O	set
O	himself
O	on
O	the
O	and
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	tired
O	with
O	their
O	long
O	journey
O	they
O	soon
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	Soon
O	after
O	midnight
O	as
O	the
C	robbers
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	could
O	see
O	that
O	no
O	more
O	lights
O	were
O	burning
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	as
O	all
O	seemed
O	quiet
O	the
C	captain
O	said
O	We
O	ought
O	not
O	to
O	have
O	let
O	ourselves
O	be
O	scared
O	so
O	easily
O	and
O	sent
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	to
O	examine
O	the
O	house
O	The
O	messenger
O	found
O	everything
O	quiet
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	kitchen
O	to
O	light
O	a

O	and
O	thinking
O	the
C	cat

O	coals
O	he

O	it
O	But
O	the
C	cat
O	did
O	not

O	the
O	joke
O	flew
O	in
O	his
O	face
O	spat
O	at
O	him
O	and
O	scratched
O	He
O	was
O	dreadfully
O	frightened
O	ran
O	away
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	back

O	when
O	the
C	dog
O	who
O	was
O	lying
O	there
O	jumped
O	up
O	and
O	bit
O	him
O	in
O	the

O	As
O	he
O	ran
O	through
O	the
O	yard
O	past
O	the
O	dunghill
O	the
C	donkey
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	good
O	kick
O	with

O	and
O	the

O	being
O	awakened
O	and

O	by
O	the

O	called
O	out
O	from

O	ran
O	as
O	hard
O	as
O	he

O	and
O	scratched
O	my
O	face
O	with
O	her
O	long
O	fingers
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	door
O	stands
O	a
C	man
O	with
O	a
O	knife
O	who
O	stabbed
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	leg
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	yard
O	lies
O	a
O	black
O	monster
O	who
O	hit
O	me
O	with
O	a
O	club
O	and
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	roof
O	there
O	sits
O	the
O	judge
O	who
O	called
O	out
O	Bring
O	the
O	rascal
O	up
O	here
O	so
O	I
O	made
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	my
O	way
O	off
O	From
O	that
O	time
O	the
C	robbers
O	never
O	trusted
O	themselves
O	again
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	but
O	the
O	four
O	musicians
O	liked
O	it
O	so
O	well
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	make
O	up
O	their
O	minds
O	to
O	leave
O	it
O	and
O	spent
O	there
O	the
O	remainder
O	of
O	their
O	days
O	as
O	the
O	last
O	person
O	who
O	told
O	the
O	story
O	is
O	ready
O	to
O	avouch
O	for
O	a
O	fact
O	In
O	the
O	days
O	when
O	magic
O	was
O	still
O	of
O	some
O	avail
O	a
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	was
O	enchanted
O	by
O	an
O	old
O	witch
O	and
O	compelled
O	to
O	spend
O	his
O	life
O	sitting
O	inside
O	a
O	great
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	in
O	a
O	wood
O	There
O	he
O	passed
O	many
O	years
O	and
O	nobody
O	could
O	release
O	him
O	Once
O	a
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	She
O	had
O	gone
O	astray
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	find
O	her
O	father
O	s
O	kingdom
O	again
O	and
O	having
O	wandered
O	about
O	for
O	nine
O	days
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	stood
O	before
O	the
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	Then
O	a
O	voice
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	said
O	Whence
O	do
O	you
O	come
O	and
O	where
O	do
O	you
O	want
O	to
O	go
O	She
O	answered
O	I
O	have
O	wandered
O	from
O	my
O	father
O	s
O	kingdom
O	and
O	lost
O	myself
O	and
O	cannot
O	get
O	home
O	again
O	Then
O	the
O	voice
O	spoke
O	out
O	of
O	the
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	I
O	will
O	help
O	you
O	home
O	again
O	and
O	that
O	too
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	promise
O	to
O	do
O	what
O	I
O	desire
O	I
O	am
O	a
O	greater
C	prince
O	than
O	you
O	are
O	a
O	princess
O	and
O	I
O	wish
O	to
O	marry
O	you
O	She
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	frightened
O	and
O	thought
O	Oh
O	what
O	shall
O	I
O	do
O	How
O	can
O	I
O	marry
O	an
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	However
O	as
O	she
O	wanted
O	very
O	much
O	to
O	go
O	home
O	to
O	her
C	father
O	she
O	promised
O	what
O	was
O	demanded
O	of
O	her
O	Very
O	well
O	said
O	the
O	voice
O	you
O	must
O	come
O	again
O	and
O	bring
O	a
O	knife
O	with
O	you
O	and
O	scrape
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	iron
O	And
O	the
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	gave
O	her
O	for
O	a
O	companion
O	something
O	or
O	somebody
O	she
O	was
O	not
O	quite
O	sure
O	what
O	who
O	walked
O	by
O	her
O	side
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	speak
O	but
O	took
O	her
O	safe
O	home
O	within
O	two
O	hours
O	Then
O	there
O	was
O	great
O	joy
O	in
O	her
O	father
O	s
O	palace
O	and
O	the
C	old
C	king
O	fell
O	on
O	her
O	neck
O	and
O	kissed
O	her
O	many
O	times
O	But
O	she
O	was
O	very
O	sorrowful
O	and
O	said
O	Dear
C	father
O	you
O	little
O	know
O	what
O	has
O	happened
O	to
O	me
O	I
O	should
O	never
O	have
O	come
O	home
O	again
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	wild
O	wood
O	if
O	I
O	had
O	not
O	passed
O	by
O	an
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	But
O	I
O	had
O	to
O	promise
O	faithfully
O	that
O	I
O	would
O	return
O	back
O	to
O	it
O	and
O	marry
O	it
O	The
C	old
C	king
O	was
O	so
O	terrified
O	that
O	he
O	nearly
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	swoon
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	only
O	this
O	one
O	child
O	They
O	therefore
O	consulted
O	together
O	and
O	decided
O	to
O	send
O	not
O	the
C	princess
O	but
O	a
C	miller
C	s
C	daughter
O	who
O	was
O	very
O	beautiful
O	and
O	leading
O	her
O	out
O	they
O	gave
O	her
O	a
O	knife
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	how
O	she
O	was
O	to
O	scrape
O	the
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	When
O	she
O	reached
O	the
O	wood
O	she
O	scraped
O	away
O	for
O	hours
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	make
O	the
O	slightest
O	impression
O	But
O	when
O	day
O	began
O	to
O	break
O	a
O	voice
O	in
O	the
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	called
O	out
O	It
O	seems
O	to
O	me
O	that
O	it
O	is
O	day
O	out
O	there
O	She
O	answered
O	It
O	seems
O	so
O	to
O	me
O	too
O	I
O	think
O	I
O	hear
O	my
O	father
O	s
O	mill
O	turning
O	Oh
O	then
O	you
O	are
O	a
C	miller
C	s
C	daughter
O	go
O	straight
O	back
O	and
O	send
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	here
O	Then
O	she
O	returned
O	and
O	told
O	the
C	old
C	king
O	that
O	the
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	her
O	he
O	wanted
O	the
C	princess
O	only
O	The
C	old
C	king
O	was
O	greatly
O	frightened
O	and
O	the
C	princess
O	wept
O	But
O	they
O	had
O	still
O	a
C	swineherd
C	s
C	daughter
O	who
O	was
O	still
O	more
O	beautiful
O	than
O	the
C	miller
C	s
C	daughter
O	so
O	they
O	gave
O	her
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	gold
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	be
O	persuaded
O	to
O	go
O	instead
O	of
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	to
O	the
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	She
O	was
O	taken
O	to
O	the
O	wood
O	as
O	before
O	and
O	had
O	also
O	to
O	scrape
O	for
O	hours
O	but
O	she
O	could
O	make
O	no
O	impression
O	Now
O	when
O	dawn
O	broke
O	a
O	voice
O	called
O	out
O	of
O	the
C	Stove
O	It
O	seems
O	to
O	me
O	it
O	is
O	day
O	out
O	there
O	Then
O	she
O	answered
O	It
O	seems
O	so
O	to
O	me
O	too
O	I
O	think
O	I
O	hear
O	my
O	father
O	s
O	little
O	horn
O	sounding
O	So
O	you
O	are
O	the
C	swineherd
C	s
C	daughter
O	go
O	away
O	directly
O	and
O	bid
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	come
O	and
O	tell
O	her
O	it
O	shall
O	happen
O	to
O	her
O	as
O	I
O	forewarned
O	her
O	if
O	she
O	does
O	not
O	come
O	everything
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	shall
O	fall
O	to
O	pieces
O	and
O	tumble
O	down
O	and
O	no
O	stone
O	remain
O	upon
O	another
O	When
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	heard
O	this
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	cry
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	else
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	she
O	must
O	keep
O	her
O	promise
O	She
O	took
O	leave
O	of
O	her
C	father
O	put
O	a
O	knife
O	in
O	her
O	pocket
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	to
O	the
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	When
O	she
O	arrived
O	there
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	scrape
O	and
O	scrape
O	the
O	iron
O	yielded
O	and
O	in
O	two
O	hours
O	she
O	had
O	already
O	scraped
O	a
O	little
O	hole
O	She
O	looked
O	in
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	most
O	beautiful
O	youth
O	oh
O	he
O	shone
O	so
O	with
O	gold
O	and
O	precious
O	stones
O	that
O	he
O	pleased
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	very
O	bottom
O	of
O	her
O	heart
O	She
O	scraped
O	away
O	faster
O	than
O	ever
O	till
O	she
O	made
O	the
O	hole
O	so
O	large
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	get
O	out
O	Then
O	he
O	said
O	You
O	are
O	mine
O	and
O	I
O	am
O	yours
O	you
O	have
O	freed
O	me
O	and
O	you
O	are
O	my
O	bride
O	He
O	wished
O	to
O	take
O	her
O	home
O	to
O	his
O	kingdom
O	but
O	she
O	begged
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	go
O	once
O	more
O	to
O	see
O	her
C	father
O	and
O	the
C	prince
O	gave
O	her
O	leave
O	on
O	condition
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	speak
O	no
O	more
O	than
O	three
O	words
O	with
O	him
O	and
O	come
O	back
O	again
O	So
O	she
O	went
O	home
O	but
O	alas
O	being
O	a
O	little
O	she
O	spoke
O	more
O	than
O	three
O	words
O	The
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	disappeared
O	instantly
O	and
O	was
O	removed
O	far
O	away
O	over
O	glass
O	mountains
O	and
O	sharp
O	swords
O	but
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	being
O	now
O	freed
O	was
O	not
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	it
O	The
C	princess
O	took
O	leave
O	of
O	her
C	father
O	and
O	took
O	some
O	money
O	with
O	her
O	but
O	not
O	much
O	and
O	went
O	again
O	into
O	the
O	great
O	wood
O	There
O	she
O	looked
O	everywhere
O	for
O	the
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	She
O	sought
O	it
O	for
O	nine
O	days
O	until
O	her
O	hunger
O	was
O	so
O	great
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	for
O	she
O	had
O	eaten
O	all
O	the
O	food
O	she
O	could
O	find
O	and
O	had
O	nothing
O	left
O	to
O	keep
O	her
O	alive
O	At
O	she
O	climbed
O	up
O	into
O	a
O	little
O	tree
O	and
O	purposed
O	spending
O	the
O	night
O	there
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	But
O	when
O	midnight
O	came
O	she
O	saw
O	afar
O	off
O	a
O	little
O	glimmering
O	light
O	and
O	thinking
O	Oh
O	there
O	I
O	should
O	be
O	safe
O	climbed
O	down
O	and
O	went
O	towards
O	it
O	Then
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	old
O	house
O	overgrown
O	with
O	grass
O	with
O	a
O	little
O	heap
O	of
O	wood
O	before
O	the
O	door
O	Wondering
O	how
O	it
O	came
O	there
O	she
O	looked
O	in
O	through
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	saw
O	nothing
O	inside
O	but
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	fat
O	little
O	frogs
O	and
O	a
O	table
O	beautifully
O	spread
O	There
O	were
O	on
O	it
O	roast
O	meats
O	and
O	wines
O	and
O	the
O	plates
O	and
O	cups
O	were
O	all
O	of
O	silver
O	So
O	she
O	took
O	heart
O	and
O	knocked
O	Immediately
O	the
O	fattest
O	frog
O	called
O	Maiden
O	sweet
O	and
O	small
C	Hutzelbein
O	I
O	call
C	Hutzelbein
O	s
O	little
O	dog
O	Creep
O	about
O	and
O	see
O	Who
O	this
O	can
O	be
O	Then
O	a
O	little
O	frog
O	came
O	and
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	for
O	her
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	she
O	came
O	in
O	the
O	frogs
O	all
O	bade
O	her
O	welcome
O	and
O	persuaded
O	her
O	to
O	sit
O	down
O	They
O	Whence
O	do
O	you
O	come
O	where
O	do
O	you
O	want
O	to
O	go
O	Then
O	she
O	told
O	them
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	happened
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	how
O	because
O	she
O	had
O	disobeyed
O	the
O	command
O	not
O	to
O	speak
O	to
O	her
C	father
O	more
O	than
O	three
O	words
O	the
O	Stove
O	had
O	disappeared
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	now
O	she
O	was
O	determined
O	to
O	seek
O	him
O	and
O	to
O	wander
O	over
O	mountain
O	and
O	valley
O	till
O	she
O	found
O	him
O	The

O	me
O	Then
O	the
O	little
O	frog
O	went
O	and
O	brought
O	the
O	box
O	Afterwards
O	they
O	gave
O	the
C	princess
O	food
O	and
O	drink
O	and
O	took
O	her
O	to
O	a
O	bed
O	all
O	of
O	silk
O	and
O	velvet
O	she
O	laid
O	herself
O	in
O	it
O	and
O	slept
O	peacefully
O	When
O	day
O	came
O	she
O	arose
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	frog
O	gave
O	her
O	three
O	needles
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	box
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	with
O	her
O	They
O	would
O	be
O	very
O	necessary
O	to
O	her
O	for
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	go
O	over
O	a
O	high
O	glass
O	mountain
O	and
O	three
O	sharp
O	swords
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	sea
O	if
O	she
O	passed
O	all
O	those
O	she
O	would
O	recover
O	her
O	dearest
C	prince
O	The
O	frog
O	also
O	gave
O	her
O	besides
O	the
O	three
O	needles
O	other
O	gifts
O	which
O	she
O	was
O	to
O	take
O	great
O	care
O	of
O	namely
O	a
O	and
O	three
O	nuts
O	With
O	these
O	she
O	set
O	off
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	slippery
O	glass
O	mountain
O	she
O	stuck
O	the
O	three
O	needles
O	into
O	it
O	as
O	she
O	walked
O	some
O	before
O	her
O	feet
O	and
O	some
O	behind
O	and
O	so
O	managed
O	to
O	get
O	across
O	When
O	she
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	she
O	hid
O	the
O	needles
O	in
O	a
O	place
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	noticed
O	particularly
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	her
O	way
O	Afterwards
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	swords
O	but
O	she
O	set
O	herself
O	on
O	her
O	and
O	rolled
O	safely
O	over
O	them
O	At
O	last
O	she
O	came
O	before
O	a
O	great
O	lake
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	to
O	sail
O	across
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	done
O	so
O	she
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	castle
O	She
O	went
O	in
O	and
O	said
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	poor
O	maiden
O	who
O	wished
O	very
O	much
O	to
O	hire
O	herself
O	out
O	if
O	she
O	might
O	be
O	taken
O	in
O	there
O	as
O	a
O	servant
O	For
O	the
O	frogs
O	had
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	whom
O	she
O	had
O	released
O	out
O	of
O	the
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	wood
O	dwelt
O	there
O	so
O	she
O	was
O	content
O	to
O	be
O	taken
O	as
O	for
O	very
O	small
O	pay
O	Now
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	had
O	thought
O	the
C	princess
O	was
O	dead
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	now
O	with
O	him
O	another
O	maiden
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	persuaded
O	he
O	ought
O	to
O	marry
O	which
O	grieved
O	the
O	poor
O	very
O	much
O	In
O	the
O	evening
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	washed
O	up
O	the
O	dishes
O	and
O	had
O	done
O	all
O	her
O	work
O	she
O	felt
O	in
O	her
O	pocket
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	three
O	nuts
O	which
O	the
O	old
O	frog
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	She
O	bit
O	one
O	open
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	eat
O	the
O	kernel
O	when
O	behold
O	inside
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	dress
O	imaginable
O	so
O	beautiful
O	that
O	the
O	bride
O	soon
O	heard
O	of
O	it
O	came
O	and
O	asked
O	to
O	see
O	it
O	and
O	wanted
O	to
O	buy
O	it
O	saying
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	dress
O	for
O	a
O	But
O	the
O	thought
O	differently
O	and
O	refused
O	to
O	sell
O	it
O	but
O	offered
O	to
O	give
O	it
O	as
O	a
O	present
O	if
O	the
O	bride
O	would
O	grant
O	her
O	one
O	favour
O	namely
O	to
O	sleep
O	one
O	night
O	on
O	the
O	mat
O	outside
O	the
O	bridegroom
O	s
O	door
O	The
O	bride
O	gave
O	her
O	leave
O	because
O	the
O	dress
O	was
O	so
O	beautiful
O	and
O	she
O	had
O	none
O	like
O	it
O	Now
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	evening
O	she
O	said
O	to
O	her
O	bridegroom
O	The
O	foolish
O	wants
O	to
O	sleep
O	on
O	the
O	mat
O	outside
O	your
O	door
O	If
O	you
O	are
O	content
O	I
O	am
O	said
O	he
O	But
O	the
O	bride
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	glass
O	of
O	wine
O	in
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	put
O	a
O	sleeping
O	draught
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	slept
O	so
O	soundly
O	nothing
O	could
O	wake
O	him
O	While
O	outside
O	the
O	door
O	the
C	princess
O	wept
O	the
O	whole
O	night
O	saying
O	I
O	have
O	released
O	you
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	wild
O	wood
O	out
O	of
O	an
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	in
O	seeking
O	you
O	I
O	have
O	gone
O	over
O	a
O	glass
O	mountain
O	over
O	three
O	sharp
O	swords
O	and
O	over
O	a
O	great
O	lake
O	yet
O	now
O	that
O	I
O	find
O	you
O	you
O	will
O	not
O	hear
O	me
O	Next
O	evening
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	washed
O	up
O	everything
O	she
O	bit
O	the
O	second
O	nut
O	open
O	and
O	inside
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	far
O	more
O	beautiful
O	dress
O	than
O	the
O	first
O	which
O	when
O	the
O	bride
O	saw
O	she
O	wished
O	to
O	buy
O	also
O	But
O	the
O	girl
O	again
O	refused
O	to
O	take
O	money
O	and
O	again
O	begged
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	spend
O	the
O	night
O	outside
O	the
O	bridegroom
O	s
O	door
O	Once
O	more
O	the
O	bride
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	and
O	he
O	slept
O	so
O	soundly
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	hear
O	nothing
O	But
O	the
O	wept
O	the
O	whole
O	night
O	long
O	crying
O	I
O	have
O	released
O	you
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	wild
O	wood
O	and
O	out
O	of
O	an
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	and
O	have
O	gone
O	over
O	a
O	glass
O	mountain
O	over
O	three
O	sharp
O	swords
O	and
O	over
O	a
O	great
O	lake
O	before
O	I
O	found
O	you
O	and
O	yet
O	when
O	I
O	find
O	you
O	you
O	will
O	not
O	hear
O	me
O	The
O	third
O	evening
O	she
O	bit
O	open
O	the
O	third
O	nut
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	in
O	it
O	a
O	still
O	more
O	beautiful
O	dress
O	which
O	shone
O	stiff
O	with
O	pure
O	gold
O	When
O	the
O	bride
O	saw
O	it
O	she
O	wished
O	more
O	earnestly
O	than
O	ever
O	to
O	have
O	it
O	but
O	the
O	would
O	only
O	give
O	it
O	to
O	her
O	on
O	condition
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	sleep
O	for
O	the
O	third
O	time
O	on
O	the
O	mat
O	at
O	the
O	bridegroom
O	s
O	door
O	But
O	this
O	time
O	the
C	prince
O	was
O	cautious
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	untouched
O	Now
O	when
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	and
O	to
O	call
O	out
O	Dearest
O	treasure
O	I
O	have
O	released
O	you
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	horrible
O	wild
O	wood
O	and
O	out
O	of
O	an
C	Iron
C	Stove
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	sprang
O	up
O	crying
O	out
O	This
O	is
O	my
O	right
O	true
O	love
O	she
O	is
O	mine
O	and
O	I
O	am
O	hers
O	Then
O	he
O	declared
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	marry
O	the
O	other
O	bride
O	whom
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	love
O	and
O	so
O	still
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	night
O	he
O	got
O	into
O	a
O	carriage
O	with
O	the
O	and
O	drove
O	away
O	When
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	great
O	lake
O	they
O	sailed
O	over
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	three
O	sharp
O	swords
O	they
O	seated
O	themselves
O	on
O	the
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	glass
O	mountain
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	three
O	needles
O	and
O	stuck
O	them
O	in
O	step
O	by
O	step
O	So
O	they
O	came
O	at
O	last
O	to
O	the
O	little
O	old
O	house
O	but
O	as
O	they
O	went
O	in
O	lo
O	it
O	changed
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	castle
O	the
O	frogs
O	turned
O	to
O	princes
O	and
C	princesses
O	all
O	kings
O	children
O	and
O	received
O	them
O	both
O	with
O	great
O	joy
O	There
O	the
O	wedding
O	was
O	celebrated
O	and
O	they
O	remained
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	which
O	was
O	much
O	larger
O	than
O	that
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	the
C	princess
O	s
C	father
O	But
O	as
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	lamented
O	very
O	much
O	his
C	daughter
O	s
O	loss
O	and
O	his
O	own
O	loneliness
O	they
O	soon
O	went
O	and
O	fetched
O	him
O	home
O	to
O	themselves
O	So
O	they
O	had
O	two
O	kingdoms
O	instead
O	of
O	one
O	and
O	lived
O	happily
O	together
O	all
O	their
O	days
O	On
O	my
O	return
O	home
O	from
O	my
O	sixth
O	voyage
O	I
O	had
O	entirely
O	given
O	up
O	all
O	thoughts
O	of
O	again
O	going
O	to
O	sea
O	for
O	besides
O	that
O	my
O	age
O	now
O	required
O	rest
O	I
O	was
O	resolved
O	no
O	more
O	to
O	expose
O	myself
O	to
O	such
O	risks
O	as
O	I
O	had
O	encountered
O	so
O	that
O	I
O	thought
O	of
O	nothing
O	but
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	my
O	days
O	in
O	tranquillity
O	One
O	day
O	however
O	an
O	officer
O	of
O	the
O	caliph
O	s
O	inquired
O	for
O	me
O	The
O	caliph
O	said
O	he
O	has
O	sent
O	me
O	to
O	tell
O	you
O	that

O	must
O	speak
O	with
O	you
O	I
O	followed
O	the
O	officer
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	where
O	being
O	presented
O	to
O	the
O	caliph
O	I
O	saluted
O	him
O	by
O	prostrating
O	myself
O	at
O	his
O	feet
C	Sindbad
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	me
O	I
O	stand
O	in
O	need
O	of

O	my
O	answer
O	and
O	present
O	to
O	the
C	King
C	of
C	Serendib
O	This
O	command
O	of
O	the
O	caliph
O	was
O	to
O	me
O	like
O	a
O	clap
O	of
O	thunder
O	Commander
O	of
O	the

O	I
O	beseech

O	most
O	humbly
O	to

O	have
O	also
O	made
O	a
O	vow
O	never
O	to
O	leave
O	Bagdad
O	Perceiving
O	that
O	the
O	caliph
O	insisted
O	upon
O	my
O	compliance
O	I
O	submitted
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	willing
O	to
O	obey
O	He
O	was
O	very
O	well
O	pleased
O	and
O	ordered
O	me
O	one
O	thousand
O	sequins
O	for
O	the
O	expenses
O	of
O	my

O	I

O	A
O	little
O	time
O	after

O	I
O	solicited

O	obtained
O	it
O	The

O	when

O	dismissed
O	me

O	me
O	a
O	very

O	present
O	I
O	embarked
O	immediately
O	to

O	but
O	had
O	not
O	the

O	so
O	speedily

O	Three

O	days
O	after

O	we
O	were
O	attacked
O	by
C	pirates
O	who
O	easily
O	seized
O	upon
O	our
O	ship
O	because
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	vessel
O	of
O	war
O	Some
O	of
O	the
O	crew
O	offered
O	resistance
O	which
O	cost
O	them
O	their
O	lives
O	But
O	for
O	myself
O	and
O	the
O	rest
O	who
O	were
O	not
O	so
O	imprudent
O	the
C	pirates
O	saved
O	us
O	and
O	carried
O	us
O	into
O	a
O	remote
O	island
O	where
O	they
O	sold
O	us
O	I
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	a
O	rich
O	merchant
O	who
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	bought
O	me
O	took
O	me
O	to
O	his
O	house
O	treated
O	me
O	well
O	and
O	clad
O	me
O	handsomely
O	as
O	a
C	slave
O	Some
O	days
O	after
O	he
O	asked
O	me
O	if
O	I
O	understood
O	any
O	trade
O	I
O	answered
O	that
O	I
O	was
O	no
O	mechanic
O	but
O	a
O	merchant
O	and
O	that
O	the
C	pirates
O	who
O	sold
O	me
O	had
O	robbed
O	me
O	of
O	all

O	Tell
O	me
O	replied
O	he
O	can
O	you
O	shoot
O	with
O	a
O	bow
O	I
O	answered
O	that
O	the
O	bow
O	was
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	exercises
O	in
O	my
O	youth
O	He
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	bow
O	and
O	arrows
O	and
O	taking
O	me
O	behind
O	him
O	on
O	an
O	elephant
O	carried
O	me
O	to
O	a
O	thick
O	forest
O	some
O	leagues
O	from
O	the
O	town
O	We
O	penetrated
O	a
O	great
O	way
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	thought
O	fit
O	to
O	stop
O	he
O	bade
O	me
O	alight
O	then
O	showing
O	me
O	a
O	great
O	tree
O	Climb
O	up
O	that
O	said
O	he
O	and
O	shoot
O	at
O	the
O	elephants
O	as
O	you
O	see
O	them
O	pass
O	by
O	for
O	there
O	is
O	a
O	prodigious
O	number
O	of
O	them
O	in
O	this
O	forest
O	and
O	if
O	any
O	of
O	them
O	fall
O	come
O	and
O	give
O	me
O	notice
O	Having
O	spoken
O	thus
O	he
O	left
O	me
O	victuals
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	and
O	I
O	continued
O	upon
O	the
O	tree
O	all
O	night
O	I
O	saw
O	no
O	elephant
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	but
O	next
O	morning
O	at
O	break
O	of
O	day
O	I
O	perceived
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	I
O	shot
O	several
O	arrows
O	among
O	them
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	elephants
O	fell
O	when
O	the
O	rest
O	retired
O	immediately
O	and
O	left
O	me
O	at
O	liberty
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	acquaint
O	my
C	patron
O	with
O	my
O	success
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	informed
O	him
O	he
O	commended
O	my
O	dexterity
O	and
O	caressed
O	me
O	highly
O	We
O	went
O	afterward
O	together
O	to
O	the
O	forest
O	where
O	we
O	dug
O	a
O	hole
O	for
O	the
O	elephant
O	my
C	patron
O	designing
O	to
O	return
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	rotten
O	and
O	take
O	his
O	teeth
O	to
O	trade
O	with
O	I
O	continued
O	this
O	employment
O	for
O	two
O	months
O	One
O	morning
O	as
O	I
O	looked
O	for
O	the
O	elephants
O	I
O	perceived
O	with
O	extreme
O	amazement
O	that
O	instead
O	of
O	passing
O	by
O	me
O	across
O	the
O	forest
O	as
O	usual
O	they
O	stopped
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	me
O	with
O	a
O	horrible
O	noise
O	in
O	such
O	numbers
O	that
O	the
O	plain
O	was
O	covered
O	and
O	shook
O	under
O	them
O	They
O	surrounded
O	the
O	tree
O	in
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	concealed
O	with
O	their
O	trunks
O	uplifted
O	and
O	all
O	fixed
O	their
O	eyes
O	upon
O	me
O	At
O	this
O	alarming
O	spectacle
O	I
O	continued
O	immovable
O	and
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	terrified
O	that
O	my
O	bow
O	and
O	arrows
O	fell
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	hand
O	My
O	fears
O	were
O	not
O	without
O	cause
O	for
O	after
O	the
O	elephants
O	had
O	stared
O	upon
O	me
O	some
O	time
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	largest
O	of
O	them
O	put
O	his
O	trunk
O	round
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	plucked
O	it
O	up
O	and
O	threw
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	I
O	fell
O	with
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	the
O	elephant
O	taking
O	me
O	up
O	with
O	his
O	trunk
O	laid
O	me
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	where
O	I
O	sat
O	more
O	like
O	one
O	dead
O	than
O	alive
O	with
O	my
O	quiver
O	on
O	my
O	shoulder
O	He
O	put
O	himself
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	rest
O	who
O	followed
O	him
O	in
O	line
O	one
O	after
O	the
O	other
O	carried
O	me
O	a
O	considerable
O	way
O	then
O	laid
O	me
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	retired
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	companions
O	After
O	having
O	lain
O	some
O	time
O	and
O	seeing
O	the
O	elephants
O	gone
O	I
O	got
O	up
O	and
O	found
O	I
O	was
O	upon
O	a
O	long
O	and
O	broad
O	hill
O	almost
O	covered
O	with
O	the
O	bones
O	and
O	teeth
O	of
O	elephants
O	I
O	doubted
O	not
O	but
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	of
O	the
O	elephants
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	carried
O	me
O	thither
O	on
O	purpose
O	to
O	tell
O	me
O	that
O	I
O	should
O	forbear
O	to
O	kill
O	them
O	as
O	now
O	I
O	knew
O	where
O	to
O	get
O	their
O	teeth
O	without
O	inflicting
O	injury
O	on
O	them
O	I
O	did
O	not
O	stay
O	on
O	the
O	hill
O	but
O	turned
O	toward
O	the
O	city
O	and
O	after
O	having
O	travelled
O	a
O	day
O	and
O	a
O	night
O	I
O	came
O	to
O	my
C	patron
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	my
C	patron
O	saw
O	me
O	Ah
O	poor
C	Sindbad
O	exclaimed
O	he
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	great
O	trouble
O	to
O	know
O	what
O	was
O	become
O	of
O	you
O	I
O	have
O	been
O	at
O	the
O	forest
O	where
O	I
O	found
O	a
O	tree
O	newly
O	pulled
O	up
O	and
O	your
O	bow
O	and
O	arrows
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	I
O	despaired
O	of
O	ever
O	seeing
O	you
O	more
O	Pray
O	tell
O	me
O	what
O	befell
O	you
O	I
O	satisfied
O	his
O	curiosity
O	and
O	we
O	both
O	of
O	us
O	set
O	out
O	next
O	morning
O	to
O	the
O	hill
O	We
O	loaded
O	the
O	elephant
O	which
O	had
O	carried
O	us
O	with
O	as
O	many
O	teeth
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	bear
O	and
O	when
O	we
O	were
O	returned
O	my
O	master
O	thus
O	addressed
O	me
O	Hear
O	now
O	what
O	I
O	shall
O	tell
O	you
O	The
O	elephants
O	of
O	our
O	forest
O	have
O	every
O	year
O	killed
O	us
O	a
O	great
O	many
C	slaves
O	whom
O	we
O	sent
O	to
O	seek
O	ivory
O	For
O	all
O	the
O	cautions
O	we
O	could
O	give

O	fury
O	and
O	has
O	bestowed
O	that
O	favor
O	upon
O	you

O	venture
O	by
O	sea
O	to
O	Bussorah
O	I
O	landed
O	my
O	proportion
O	of
O	the
O	ivory
O	resolving
O	to
O	proceed
O	on
O	my
O	journey
O	by
O	land
O	I
O	realized
O	vast
O	sums
O	by
O	my
O	ivory
O	bought
O	several
O	rarities
O	which
O	I
O	intended
O	for
O	presents
O	and
O	when
O	my
O	equipage
O	was
O	ready
O	set
O	out
O	in
O	company
O	with
O	a
O	large
O	caravan
O	of
O	merchants
O	I
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	on
O	the
O	journey
O	and
O	suffered
O	much
O	but
O	was
O	happy
O	in
O	thinking
O	that
O	I
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	fear
O	from
O	the
O	seas
O	from
C	pirates
O	from
O	serpents
O	or
O	from
O	the
O	other
O	perils
O	to
O	which
O	I
O	had
O	been
O	exposed
O	I
O	at
O	last
O	arrived
O	safe
O	at
O	Bagdad
O	and
O	immediately
O	waited
O	upon
O	the
O	caliph
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	my
O	embassy
O	He
O	loaded
O	me
O	with
O	honors
O	and
O	rich
O	presents
O	and
O	I
O	have
O	ever
O	since
O	devoted
O	myself
O	to
O	my
O	family
O	kindred
O	and
O	friends
C	Sindbad
O	here
O	finished
O	the
O	relation
O	of
O	his
O	seventh
O	and
O	last
O	voyage
O	and
O	then
O	addressing
O	himself
O	to
C	Hindbad
O	Well
O	friend
O	said
O	he
O	did
O	you
O	ever
O	hear
O	of
O	any
O	person
O	that
O	suffered
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	I
O	have
O	done
O	Is
O	it
O	not
O	reasonable
O	that
O	after
O	all
O	this
O	I
O	should
O	enjoy
O	a
O	quiet
O	and
O	pleasant
O	life
O	As
O	he
O	said
O	these
O	words
C	Hindbad
O	kissed
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	said
O	Sir
O	my
O	afflictions
O	are
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	compared
O	with
O	yours
O	You
O	not
O	only
O	deserve
O	a
O	quiet
O	life
O	but
O	are
O	worthy
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	riches
O	you
O	possess
O	since
O	you
O	make
O	so
O	good
O	a
O	use
O	of
O	them
O	May
O	you
O	live
O	happily
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
C	Sindbad
O	ordered
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	paid
O	another
O	hundred
O	sequins
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	to
O	give
O	up
O	carrying
O	burdens
O	as
O	a
O	porter
O	and
O	to
O	eat
O	henceforth
O	at
O	his
O	table
O	for
O	he
O	wished
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	all
O	his
O	life
O	have
O	reason
O	to
O	remember
O	that
O	he
O	henceforth
O	had
O	a
O	friend
O	in
C	Sindbad
O	the
O	Sailor
O	One
O	morning
C	Thor
O	the
O	Thunderer
O	awoke
O	with
O	a
O	yawn
O	and
O	stretching
O	out
O	his
O	knotted
O	arm
O	felt
O	for
O	his
O	precious
O	hammer
O	which
O	he
O	kept
O	always
O	under
O	his
O	pillow
O	of
O	clouds
O	But
O	he
O	started
O	up
O	with
O	a
O	roar
O	of
O	rage
O	so
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	palace
O	trembled
O	The
O	hammer
O	was
O	gone
O	Now
O	this
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	serious
O	matter
O	for
C	Thor
O	was
O	the
O	protector
O	of
O	Asgard
O	and
O	Miölnir
O	the
O	magic
O	hammer
O	which
O	the
O	dwarf
O	had
O	made
O	was
O	his
O	mighty
O	weapon
O	of
O	which
O	the
O	enemies
O	of
O	the
O	Aesir
O	stood
O	so
O	much
O	in
O	dread
O	that
O	they
O	dared
O	not
O	venture
O	near
O	But
O	if
O	they
O	should
O	learn
O	that
O	Miölnir
O	was
O	gone
O	who
O	could
O	tell
O	what
O	danger
O	might
O	not
O	threaten
O	the
O	palaces
O	of
O	heaven
C	Thor
O	darted
O	his
O	flashing
O	eye
O	into
O	every
O	corner
O	of
O	Cloud
O	Land
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	the
O	hammer
O	He
O	called
O	his
O	fair
O	wife
C	Sif
O	of
O	the
O	golden
O	hair
O	to
O	aid
O	in
O	the
O	search
O	and
O	his
O	two
O	lovely
O	daughters
C	Thrude
O	and
C	Lora
O	They
O	hunted
O	and
O	they
O	hunted
O	they
O	turned
O	Thrudheim
O	upside
O	down
O	and
O	set
O	the
O	clouds
O	to
O	rolling
O	wonderfully
O	as
O	they
O	peeped
O	and
O	pried
O	behind
O	and
O	around
O	and
O	under
O	each
O	billowy
O	mass
O	But
O	Miölnir
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	Certainly
O	someone
O	had
O	stolen
O	it
C	Thor
O	s
O	yellow
O	beard
O	quivered
O	with
O	rage
O	and
O	his
O	hair
O	bristled
O	on
O	end
O	like
O	the
O	golden
O	rays
O	of
O	a
O	star
O	while
O	all
O	his
O	household
O	trembled
O	It
O	is
C	Loki
O	again
O	he
O	cried
O	I
O	am
O	sure
C	Loki
O	is
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	this
O	mischief
O	For
O	since
O	the
O	time
O	when
C	Thor
O	had
O	captured
C	Loki
O	for
O	the
O	dwarf
C	Brock
O	and
O	had
O	given
O	him
O	over
O	to
O	have
O	his
O	bragging
O	lips
O	sewed
O	up
C	Loki
O	had
O	looked
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	evil
O	eyes
O	and
C	Thor
O	knew
O	that
O	the
O	red
O	rascal
O	hated
O	him
O	most
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	gods
O	But
O	this
O	time
C	Thor
O	was
O	mistaken
O	It
O	was
O	not
C	Loki
O	who
O	had
O	stolen
O	the
O	hammer
O	he
O	was
O	too
O	great
O	a
O	coward
O	for
O	that
O	And
O	though
O	he
O	meant
O	before
O	the
O	end
O	to
O	be
O	revenged
O	upon
C	Thor
O	he
O	was
O	waiting
O	until
O	a
O	safe
O	chance
O	should
O	come
O	when
C	Thor
O	himself
O	might
O	stumble
O	into
O	danger
O	and
C	Loki
O	need
O	only
O	to
O	help
O	the
O	evil
O	by
O	a
O	malicious
O	word
O	or
O	two
O	and
O	this
O	chance
O	came
O	later
O	as
O	you
O	shall
O	hear
O	in
O	another
O	tale
O	Meanwhile
C	Loki
O	was
O	on
O	his
O	best
O	behaviour
O	trying
O	to
O	appear
O	very
O	kind
O	and
O	obliging
O	so
O	when
C	Thor
O	came
O	rumbling
O	and
O	roaring
O	up
O	to
O	him
O	demanding
O	What
O	have
O	you
O	done
O	with
O	my
O	hammer
O	you
O	thief
C	Loki
O	looked
O	surprised
O	but
O	did
O	not
O	lose
O	his
O	temper
O	nor
O	answer
O	rudely
O	Have
O	you
O	indeed
O	missed
O	your
O	hammer
O	brother
C	Thor
O	he
O	said
O	mumbling
O	for
O	his
O	mouth
O	was
O	still
O	sore
O	where
C	Brock
O	had
O	sewed
O	the
O	stitches
O	That
O	is
O	a
O	pity
O	for
O	if
O	the
O	giants
O	hear
O	of
O	this
O	they
O	will
O	be
O	coming
O	to
O	try
O	their
O	might
O	against
O	Asgard
O	Hush
O	muttered
C	Thor
O	grasping
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	shoulder
O	with
O	his
O	iron
O	fingers
O	That
O	is
O	what
O	I
O	fear
O	But
O	look
O	you
C	Loki
O	I
O	suspect
O	your
O	hand
O	in
O	the
O	mischief
O	Come
O	confess
O	Then
C	Loki
O	protested
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	with
O	so
O	wicked
O	a
O	deed
O	But
O	he
O	added
O	wheedlingly
O	I
O	think
O	I
O	can
O	guess
O	the
O	thief
O	and
O	because
O	I
O	love
O	you
C	Thor
O	I
O	will
O	help
O	you
O	to
O	find
O	him
O	Humph
O	growled
C	Thor
O	Much
O	love
O	you
O	bear
O	to
O	me
O	However
O	you
O	are
O	a
O	wise
O	rascal
O	the
O	nimblest
O	wit
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	Aesir
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	better
O	to
O	have
O	you
O	on
O	my
O	side
O	than
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	when
O	giants
O	are
O	in
O	the
O	game
O	Tell
O	me
O	then
O	who
O	has
O	robbed
O	the
O	Thunder
O	Lord
O	of
O	his
O	bolt
O	of
O	power
C	Loki
O	drew
O	near
O	and
O	whispered
O	in
C	Thor
O	s
O	ear
O	Look
O	how
O	the
O	storms
O	rage
O	and
O	the
O	winds
O	howl
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	below
O	Someone
O	is
O	wielding
O	your
O	thunder
O	hammer
O	all
O	unskilfully
O	Can
O	you
O	not
O	guess
O	the
O	thief
O	Who
O	but
C	Thrym
O	the
O	mighty
O	giant
O	who
O	has
O	ever
O	been
O	your
O	enemy
O	and
O	your
O	imitator
O	and
O	whose
O	fingers
O	have
O	long
O	itched
O	to
O	grasp
O	the
O	short
O	handle
O	of
O	mighty
O	Miölnir
O	that
O	the
O	world
O	may
O	name
O	him
O	Thunder
O	Lord
O	instead
O	of
O	you
O	But
O	look
O	What
O	a
O	tempest
O	The
O	world
O	will
O	be
O	shattered
O	into
O	fragments
O	unless
O	we
O	soon
O	get
O	the
O	hammer
O	back
O	Then
C	Thor
O	roared
O	with
O	rage
O	I
O	will
O	seek
O	this
O	impudent
C	Thrym
O	he
O	cried
O	I
O	will
O	crush
O	him
O	into
O	bits
O	and
O	teach
O	him
O	to
O	meddle
O	with
O	the
O	weapon
O	of
O	the
O	Aesir
O	Softly
O	softly
O	said
C	Loki
O	smiling
O	maliciously
O	He
O	is
O	a
O	shrewd
O	giant
O	and
O	a
O	mighty
O	Even
O	you
O	great
C	Thor
O	cannot
O	go
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	pluck
O	the
O	hammer
O	from
O	his
O	hand
O	as
O	one
O	would
O	slip
O	the
O	rattle
O	from
O	a
O	baby
O	s
O	pink
O	fist
O	Nay
O	you
O	must
O	use
O	craft
C	Thor
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	I
O	who
O	will
O	teach
O	you
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	be
O	patient
C	Thor
O	was
O	a
O	brave
O	blunt
O	fellow
O	and
O	he
O	hated
O	the
O	ways
O	of
C	Loki
O	his
O	lies
O	and
O	his
O	deceit
O	He
O	liked
O	best
O	the
O	way
O	of
O	warriors
O	the
O	thundering
O	charge
O	the
O	flash
O	of
O	weapons
O	and
O	the
O	heavy
O	blow
O	but
O	without
O	the
O	hammer
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	fight
O	the
O	giants
O	hand
O	to
O	hand
C	Loki
O	s
O	advice
O	seemed
O	wise
O	and
O	he
O	decided
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	matter
O	to
O	the
O	Red
O	One
C	Loki
O	was
O	now
O	all
O	eagerness
O	for
O	he
O	loved
O	difficulties
O	which
O	would
O	set
O	his
O	wit
O	in
O	play
O	and
O	bring
O	other
O	folk
O	into
O	danger
O	Look
O	now
O	he
O	said
O	We
O	must
O	go
O	to
C	Freia
O	and
O	borrow
O	her
O	falcon
O	dress
O	But
O	you
O	must
O	ask
O	for
O	she
O	loves
O	me
O	so
O	little
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	scarce
O	listen
O	to
O	me
O	So
O	first
O	they
O	made
O	their
O	way
O	to
O	Folkvang
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	maidens
O	where
C	Freia
O	dwelt
O	the
O	loveliest
O	of
O	all
O	in
O	Asgard
O	She
O	was
O	fairer
O	than
O	fair
O	and
O	sweeter
O	than
O	sweet
O	and
O	the
O	tears
O	from
O	her
O	flower
O	eyes
O	made
O	the
O	dew
O	which
O	blessed
O	the
O	earth
O	flowers
O	night
O	and
O	morning
O	Of
O	her
C	Thor
O	borrowed
O	the
O	magic
O	dress
O	of
O	feathers
O	in
O	which
C	Freia
O	was
O	wont
O	to
O	clothe
O	herself
O	and
O	flit
O	like
O	a
O	great
O	beautiful
O	bird
O	all
O	about
O	the
O	world
O	She
O	was
O	willing
O	enough
O	to
O	lend
O	it
O	to
C	Thor
O	when
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	by
O	its
O	aid
O	he
O	hoped
O	to
O	win
O	back
O	the
O	hammer
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	lost
O	for
O	she
O	well
O	knew
O	the
O	danger
O	threatening
O	herself
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	Aesir
O	until
O	Miölnir
O	should
O	be
O	found
O	Now
O	will
O	I
O	fetch
O	the
O	hammer
O	for
O	you
O	said
C	Loki
O	So
O	he
O	put
O	on
O	the
O	falcon
O	plumage
O	and
O	spreading
O	his
O	brown
O	wings
O	flapped
O	away
O	up
O	up
O	over
O	the
O	world
O	down
O	down
O	across
O	the
O	great
O	ocean
O	which
O	lies
O	beyond
O	all
O	things
O	that
O	men

O	And
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	dark
O	country
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	sunshine
O	nor
O	spring
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	always
O	dreary
O	winter
O	where
O	mountains
O	were
O	piled
O	up
O	like
O	blocks
O	of
O	ice
O	and
O	where
O	great
O	caverns
O	yawned
O	hungrily
O	in
O	blackness
O	And
O	this
O	was
O	Jotunheim
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	the
O	Frost
O	Giants
O	And
O	lo
O	when
C	Loki
O	came
O	thereto
O	he
O	found
C	Thrym
O	the
O	Giant
O	King
O	sitting
O	outside
O	his
O	palace
O	cave
O	playing
O	with
O	his
O	dogs
O	and
O	horses
O	The
O	dogs
O	were
O	as
O	big
O	as
O	elephants
O	and
O	the
O	horses
O	were
O	as
O	big
O	as
O	houses
O	but
C	Thrym
O	himself
O	was
O	as
O	huge
O	as
O	a
O	mountain
O	and
C	Loki
O	trembled
O	but
O	he
O	tried
O	to
O	seem
O	brave
C	Loki
O	said
C	Thrym
O	with
O	the
O	terrible
O	voice
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	proud
O	for
O	he
O	fancied
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	loud
O	as
C	Thor
O	s
O	How
O	fares
O	it
O	feathered
O	one
O	with
O	your
O	little
O	brothers
O	the
O	Aesir
O	in
O	Asgard
O	halls
O	And
O	how
O	dare
O	you
O	venture
O	alone
O	in
O	this
O	guise
O	to
O	Giant
O	Land
O	It
O	is
O	an
O	ill
O	day
O	in
O	Asgard
O	sighed
C	Loki
O	keeping
O	his
O	eye
O	warily
O	upon
O	the
O	giant
O	and
O	a
O	stormy
O	one
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	of
O	men
O	I
O	heard
O	the
O	winds
O	howling
O	and
O	the
O	storms
O	rushing
O	on
O	the
O	earth
O	as
O	I
O	passed
O	by
O	Some
O	mighty
O	one
O	has
O	stolen
O	the
O	hammer
O	of
O	our
C	Thor
O	Is
O	it
O	you
C	Thrym
O	greatest
O	of
O	all
O	giants
O	greater
O	than
C	Thor
O	himself
O	This
O	the
O	crafty
O	one
O	said
O	to
O	flatter
C	Thrym
O	for
C	Loki
O	well
O	knew
O	the
O	weakness
O	of
O	those
O	who
O	love
O	to
O	be
O	thought
O	greater
O	than
O	they
O	are
O	Then
C	Thrym
O	bridled
O	and
O	swelled
O	with
O	pride
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	put
O	on
O	the
O	majesty
O	and
O	awe
O	of
O	noble
C	Thor
O	but
O	he
O	only
O	succeeded
O	in
O	becoming
O	an
O	ugly
O	puffy
O	monster
O	Well
O	yes
O	he
O	admitted
O	I
O	have
O	the
O	hammer
O	that
O	belonged
O	to
O	your
O	little
C	Thor
O	and
O	now
O	how
O	much
O	of
O	lord
O	is
O	he
O	Alack
O	sighed
C	Loki
O	again
O	weak
O	enough
O	he
O	is
O	without
O	his
O	magic
O	weapon
O	But
O	you
O	O
C	Thrym
O	surely
O	your
O	mightiness
O	needs
O	no
O	such
O	aid
O	Give
O	me
O	the
O	hammer
O	that
O	Asgard
O	may
O	no
O	longer
O	be
O	shaken
O	by
C	Thor
O	s
O	grief
O	for
O	his
O	precious
O	toy
O	But
C	Thrym
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	easily
O	to
O	be
O	flattered
O	into
O	parting
O	with
O	his
O	stolen
O	treasure
O	He
O	grinned
O	a
O	dreadful
O	grin
O	several
O	yards
O	in
O	width
O	which
O	his
O	teeth
O	barred
O	like
O	jagged
O	boulders
O	across
O	the
O	entrance
O	to
O	a
O	mountain
O	cavern
O	Miölnir
O	the
O	hammer
O	is
O	mine
O	he
O	said
O	and
O	I
O	am
O	Thunder
O	Lord
O	mightiest
O	of
O	the
O	mighty
O	I
O	have
O	hidden
O	it
O	where
C	Thor
O	can
O	never
O	find
O	it
O	twelve
O	leagues
O	below
O	the
O	sea
O	caves
O	where
O	Queen
O	Ran
O	lives
O	with
O	her
O	daughters
O	the
O	Waves
O	But
O	listen
C	Loki
O	Go
O	tell
O	the
O	Aesir
O	that
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	back
C	Thor
O	s
O	hammer
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	it
O	back
O	upon
O	one
O	condition
O	that
O	they
O	send
C	Freia
O	the
O	beautiful
O	to
O	be
O	my
O	wife
C	Freia
O	the
O	beautiful
C	Loki
O	had
O	to
O	stifle
O	a
O	laugh
O	Fancy
O	the
O	Aesir
O	giving
O	their
O	fairest
O	flower
O	to
O	such
O	an
O	ugly
O	fellow
O	as
O	this
O	But
O	he
O	only
O	said
O	politely
O	Ah
O	yes
O	you
O	demand
O	our
C	Freia
O	in
O	exchange
O	for
O	the
O	little
O	hammer
O	It
O	is
O	a
O	costly
O	price
O	great
C	Thrym
O	But
O	I
O	will
O	be
O	your
O	friend
O	in
O	Asgard
O	If
O	I
O	have
O	my
O	way
O	you
O	shall
O	soon
O	see
O	the
O	fairest
O	bride
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	knocking
O	at
O	your
O	door
O	Farewell
O	So
C	Loki
O	whizzed
O	back
O	to
O	Asgard
O	on
O	his
O	falcon
O	wings
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	he
O	chuckled
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	the
O	evils
O	which
O	were
O	likely
O	to
O	happen
O	because
O	of
O	his
O	words
O	with
C	Thrym
O	First
O	he
O	gave
O	the
O	message
O	to
C	Thor
O	not
O	sparing
O	of
C	Thrym
O	s
O	insolence
O	to
O	make
C	Thor
O	angry
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	went
O	to
C	Freia
O	with
O	the
O	word
O	for
O	her
O	sparing
O	of
C	Thrym
O	s
O	ugliness
O	to
O	make
O	her
O	shudder
O	The
O	spiteful
O	fellow
O	Now
O	you
O	can
O	imagine
O	the
O	horror
O	that
O	was
O	in
O	Asgard
O	as
O	the
O	Aesir
O	listened
O	to
C	Loki
O	s
O	words
O	My
O	hammer
O	roared
C	Thor
O	The
O	villain
O	confesses
O	that
O	he
O	has
O	stolen
O	my
O	hammer
O	and
O	boasts
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	Thunder
O	Lord
O	The
O	ugly
O	giant
O	wailed
C	Freia
O	Must
O	I
O	be
O	the
O	bride
O	of
O	that
O	hideous
O	old
O	monster
O	and
O	live
O	in
O	his
O	gloomy
O	mountain
O	prison
O	all
O	my
O	life
O	Yes
O	put
O	on
O	your
O	bridal
O	veil
O	sweet
C	Freia
O	said
C	Loki
O	maliciously
O	and
O	come
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	Jotunheim
O	Hang
O	your
O	famous
O	starry
O	necklace
O	about
O	your
O	neck
O	and
O	don
O	your
O	bravest
O	robe
O	for
O	in
O	eight
O	days
O	there
O	will
O	be
O	a
O	wedding
O	and
C	Thor
O	s
O	hammer
O	is
O	to
O	pay
O	Then
C	Freia
O	fell
O	to
O	weeping
O	I
O	cannot
O	go
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	go
O	she
O	cried
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	leave
O	the
O	home
O	of
O	gladness
O	and
O	Father
C	Odin
O	s
O	table
O	to
O	dwell
O	in
O	the
O	land
O	of
O	horrors
C	Thor
O	s
O	hammer
O	is
O	mighty
O	but
O	mightier
O	the
O	love
O	of
O	the
O	kind
O	Aesir
O	for
O	their
O	little
C	Freia
O	Good
C	Odin
O	dear
O	brother
C	Frey
O	speak
O	for
O	me
O	You
O	will
O	not
O	make
O	me
O	go
O	The
O	Asir
O	looked
O	at
O	her
O	and
O	thought
O	how
O	lonely
O	and
O	bare
O	would
O	Asgard
O	be
O	without
O	her
O	loveliness
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	fairer
O	than
O	fair
O	and
O	sweeter
O	than
O	sweet
O	She
O	shall
O	not
O	go
O	shouted
C	Frey
O	putting
O	his
O	arms
O	about
O	his
O	sister
O	s
O	neck
O	No
O	she
O	shall
O	not
O	go
O	cried
O	all
O	the
O	Asir
O	with
O	one
O	voice
O	But
O	my
O	hammer
O	insisted
C	Thor
O	I
O	must
O	have
O	Miölnir
O	back
O	again
O	And
O	my
O	word
O	to
C	Thrym
O	said
C	Loki
O	that
O	must
O	be
O	made
O	good
O	You
O	are
O	too
O	generous
O	with
O	your
O	words
O	said
C	Odin
O	sternly
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	his
O	brother
O	well
O	Your
O	word
O	is
O	not
O	a
O	gem
O	of
O	great
O	price
O	for
O	you
O	have
O	made
O	it
O	cheap
O	Then
O	spoke
C	Heimdal
O	the
O	sleepless
O	watchman
O	who
O	sits
O	on
O	guard
O	at
O	the
O	entrance
O	to
O	the
O	rainbow
O	bridge
O	which
O	leads
O	to
O	Asgard
O	and
C	Heimdal
O	was
O	the
O	wisest
O	of
O	the
O	Aesir
O	for
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	into
O	the
O	future
O	and
O	knew
O	how
O	things
O	would
O	come
O	to
O	pass
O	Through
O	his
O	golden
O	teeth
O	he
O	spoke
O	for
O	his
O	teeth
O	were
O	all
O	of
O	gold
O	I
O	have
O	a
O	plan
O	he
O	said
O	Let
O	us
O	dress
C	Thor
O	himself
O	like
O	a
O	bride
O	in
C	Freia
O	s
O	robes
O	and
O	send
O	him
O	to
O	Jotunheim
O	to
O	talk
O	with
C	Thrym
O	and
O	to
O	win
O	back
O	his
O	hammer
O	But
O	at
O	this
O	word
C	Thor
O	grew
O	very
O	angry
O	What
O	dress
O	me
O	like
O	a
O	girl
O	he
O	roared
O	I
O	should
O	never
O	hear
O	the
O	last
O	of
O	it
O	The
O	Asir
O	will
O	mock
O	me
O	and
O	call
O	me
O	maiden
O	The
O	giants
O	and
O	even
O	the
O	puny
O	dwarfs
O	will
O	have
O	a
O	lasting
O	jest
O	upon
O	me
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	go
O	I
O	will
O	fight
O	I
O	will
O	die
O	if
O	need
O	be
O	But
O	dressed
O	as
O	a
O	woman
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	go
O	But
C	Loki
O	answered
O	him
O	with
O	sharp
O	words
O	for
O	this
O	was
O	a
O	scheme
O	after
O	his
O	own
O	heart
O	What
C	Thor
O	he
O	said
O	Would
O	you
O	lose
O	your
O	hammer
O	and
O	keep
O	Asgard
O	in
O	danger
O	for
O	so
O	small
O	a
O	whim
O	Look
O	now
O	if
O	you
O	go
O	not
C	Thrym
O	with
O	his
O	giants
O	will
O	come
O	in
O	a
O	mighty
O	army
O	and
O	drive
O	us
O	from
O	Asgard
O	then
O	he
O	will
O	indeed
O	make
C	Freia
O	his
O	bride
O	and
O	moreover
O	he
O	will
O	have
O	you
O	for
O	his
O	slave
O	under
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	his
O	hammer
O	How
O	like
O	you
O	this
O	picture
O	brother
O	of
O	the
O	thunder
O	Nay
C	Heimdal
O	s
O	plan
O	is
O	a
O	good
O	one
O	and
O	I
O	myself
O	will
O	help
O	to
O	carry
O	it
O	out
O	Still
C	Thor
O	hesitated
O	but
C	Freia
O	came
O	and
O	laid
O	her
O	white
O	hand
O	on
O	his
O	arm
O	and
O	looked
O	up
O	into
O	his
O	scowling
O	face
O	pleadingly
O	To
O	save
O	me
C	Thor
O	she
O	begged
O	And
C	Thor
O	said
O	he
O	would
O	go
O	Then
O	there
O	was
O	great
O	sport
O	among
O	the
O	Aesir
O	while
O	they
O	dressed
C	Thor
O	like
O	a
O	beautiful
O	maiden
O	Brunhilde
O	and
O	her
O	sisters
O	the
O	nine
O	Valkyrie
O	daughters
O	of
C	Odin
O	had
O	the
O	task
O	in
O	hand
O	How
O	they
O	laughed
O	as
O	they
O	brushed
O	and
O	curled
O	his
O	yellow
O	hair
O	and
O	set
O	upon
O	it
O	the
O	wondrous
O	headdress
O	of
O	silk
O	and
O	pearls
O	They
O	let
O	out
O	seams
O	and
O	they
O	let
O	down
O	hems
O	and
O	set
O	on
O	extra
O	pieces
O	to
O	make
O	it
O	larger
O	and
O	so
O	they
O	hid
O	his
O	great
O	limbs
O	and
O	knotted
O	arms
O	under
C	Freia
O	s
O	fairest
O	robe
O	of
O	scarlet
O	but
O	beneath
O	it
O	all
O	he
O	would
O	wear
O	his
O	shirt
O	of
O	mail
O	and
O	his
O	belt
O	of
O	power
O	that
O	gave
O	him
O	double
O	strength
C	Freia
O	herself
O	twisted
O	about
O	his
O	neck
O	her
O	famous
O	necklace
O	of
O	starry
O	jewels
O	and
C	Queen
C	Frigg
O	his
O	mother
O	hung
O	at
O	his
O	girdle
O	a
O	jingling
O	bunch
O	of
O	keys
O	such
O	as
O	was
O	the
O	custom
O	for
O	the
O	bride
O	to
O	wear
O	at
O	Norse
O	weddings
O	Last
O	of

O	that

O	might
O	not
O	see
C	Thor
O	s
O	fierce
O	eyes
O	and
O	the
O	yellow
O	beard
O	that
O	ill
O	became
O	a
O	maiden
O	they
O	threw
O	over
O	him
O	a
O	long
O	veil
O	of
O	silver
O	white
O	which
O	covered
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	feet
O	And
O	there
O	he
O	stood
O	as
O	stately
O	and
O	tall
O	a
O	bride
O	as
O	even
O	a
O	giant
O	might
O	wish
O	to
O	see
O	but
O	on
O	his
O	hands
O	he
O	wore
O	his
O	iron
O	gloves
O	and
O	they
O	ached
O	for
O	but
O	one
O	thing
O	to
O	grasp
O	the
O	handle
O	of
O	the
O	stolen
O	hammer
O	Ah
O	what
O	a
O	lovely
O	maid
O	it
O	is
O	chuckled
C	Loki
O	and
O	how
O	glad
O	will
C	Thrym
O	be
O	to
O	see
O	this
C	Freia
O	come
O	Bride
C	Thor
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	with
O	you
O	as
O	your
O	handmaiden
O	for
O	I
O	would
O	fain
O	see
O	the
O	fun
O	Come
O	then
O	said
C	Thor
O	sulkily
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	ill
O	pleased
O	and
O	wore
O	his
O	maiden
O	robes
O	with
O	no
O	good
O	grace
O	It
O	is
O	fitting
O	that
O	you
O	go
O	for
O	I
O	like
O	not
O	these
O	lies
O	and
O	masking
O	and
O	I
O	may
O	spoil
O	the
O	mummery
O	without
O	you
O	at
O	my
O	elbow
O	There
O	was
O	loud
O	laughter
O	above
O	the
O	clouds
O	when
C	Thor
O	all
O	veiled
O	and
O	dainty
O	seeming
O	drove
O	away
O	from
O	Asgard
O	to
O	his
O	wedding
O	with
O	maid
C	Loki
O	by
O	his
O	side
C	Thor
O	cracked
O	his
O	whip
O	and
O	chirruped
O	fiercely
O	to
O	his
O	twin
O	goats
O	with
O	golden
O	hoofs
O	for
O	he
O	wanted
O	to
O	escape
O	the
O	sounds
O	of
O	mirth
O	that
O	echoed
O	from
O	the
O	rainbow
O	bridge
O	where
O	all
O	the
O	Aesir
O	stood
O	watching
C	Loki
O	sitting
O	with
O	his
O	hands
O	meekly
O	folded
O	like
O	a
O	girl
O	chuckled
O	as
O	he
O	glanced
O	up
O	at
C	Thor
O	s
O	angry
O	face
O	but
O	he
O	said
O	nothing
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	good
O	to
O	joke
O	too
O	far
O	with
C	Thor
O	even
O	when
O	Milönir
O	was
O	hidden
O	twelve
O	leagues
O	below
O	the
O	sea
O	in
O	Ran
O	s
O	kingdom
O	So
O	off
O	they
O	dashed
O	to
O	Jotunheim
O	where
C	Thrym
O	was
O	waiting
O	and
O	longing
O	for
O	his
O	beautiful
O	bride
C	Thor
O	s
O	goats
O	thundered
O	along
O	above
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	land
O	and
O	people
O	far
O	below
O	who
O	looked
O	up
O	wondering
O	as
O	the
O	noise
O	rolled
O	overhead
O	Hear
O	how
O	the
O	thunder
O	rumbles
O	they
O	said
C	Thor
O	is
O	on
O	a
O	long
O	journey
O	And
O	a
O	long
O	journey
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	the
O	tired
O	goats
O	found
O	before
O	they
O	reached
O	the
O	end
C	Thrym
O	heard
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	their
O	approach
O	for
O	his
O	ear
O	was
O	eager
O	Hola
O	he
O	cried
O	Someone
O	is
O	coming
O	from
O	Asgard
O	only
O	one
O	of
C	Odin
O	s
O	children
O	could
O	make
O	a
O	din
O	so
O	fearful
O	Hasten
O	men
O	and
O	see
O	if
O	they
O	are
O	bringing
C	Freia
O	to
O	be
O	my
O	wife
O	Then
O	the
O	lookout
O	giant
O	stepped
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	his
O	mountain
O	and
O	said
O	that
O	a
O	chariot
O	was
O	bringing
O	two
O	maidens
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	Run

O	silken

O	in
O	all
O	space
O	Bring
O	in
O	all
O	my

O	The

O	the

O	hidden
O	from

O	and

O	How
O	afraid
O	of
O	catching
O	cold
O	they
O	must
O	be
O	whispered
O	the
O	giant
O	ladies
O	who
O	were
O	peering
O	over
O	one
O	another
O	s
O	shoulders
O	to
O	catch
O	a
O	glimpse
O	of
O	the
O	bride
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	crowd
O	outside
O	the
O	awning
O	does
O	at
O	a
O	wedding
O	nowadays
C	Thrym
O	had
O	sent
O	six
O	splendid
O	servants
O	to
O	escort
O	the
O	maidens
O	these
O	were
O	the
O	Metal
O	Kings
O	who
O	served
O	him
O	as
O	lord
O	of
O	them
O	all
O	There
O	was
O	the
O	Gold
O	King
O	all
O	in
O	cloth
O	of
O	gold
O	with
O	fringes
O	of
O	yellow
O	bullion
O	most
O	glittering
O	to
O	see
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	the
O	Silver
O	King
O	almost
O	as
O	gorgeous
O	in
O	a
O	suit
O	of
O	spangled
O	white
O	and
O	side
O	by
O	side
O	bowed
O	the
O	dark
O	Kings
O	of
O	Iron
O	and
O	Lead
O	the
O	one
O	mighty
O	in
O	black
O	the
O	other
O	sullen
O	in
O	blue
O	and
O	after
O	them
O	were
O	the
O	Copper
O	King
O	gleaming
O	ruddy
O	and
O	brave
O	and
O	the
O	Tin
O	King
O	strutting
O	in
O	his
O	trimmings
O	of
O	gaudy
O	tinsel
O	which
O	looked
O	nearly
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	silver
O	but
O	were
O	more
O	economical
O	And
O	this
O	fine
O	troop
O	of
O	lackey
O	kings
O	most
O	politely
O	led
C	Thor
O	and
C	Loki
O	into
O	the
O	palace
O	and
O	gave
O	them
O	of
O	the
O	best
O	for
O	they
O	never
O	suspected
O	who
O	these
O	seeming
O	maidens
O	really
O	were
O	And
O	when
O	evening
O	came
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	wonderful
O	banquet
O	to
O	celebrate
O	the
O	wedding
O	On
O	a
O	golden
O	throne
O	sat
C	Thrym
O	uglier
O	than
O	ever
O	in
O	his
O	finery
O	of
O	purple
O	and
O	gold
O	Beside
O	him
O	was
O	the
O	bride
O	of
O	whose
O	face
O	no
O	one
O	had
O	yet
O	caught
O	even
O	a
O	glimpse
O	and
O	at
C	Thrym
O	s
O	other
O	hand
O	stood
C	Loki
O	the
C	waiting
C	maid
O	for
O	he
O	wanted
O	to
O	be
O	near
O	to
O	mend
O	the
O	mistakes
O	which
C	Thor
O	might
O	make
O	Now
O	the
O	dishes
O	at
O	the
O	feast
O	were
O	served
O	in
O	a
O	huge
O	way
O	as
O	befitted
O	the
O	table
O	of
O	giants
O	great
O	beeves
O	roasted
O	whole
O	on
O	platters
O	as
O	wide
O	across
O	as
O	a
O	ship
O	s
O	deck
O	plum
O	puddings
O	as
O	fat
O	as
O	feather
O	beds
O	with
O	plums
O	as
O	big
O	as
O	footballs
O	and
O	a
O	wedding
O	cake
O	like
O	a
O	hay
O	mow
O	The
O	giants
O	ate
O	enormously
O	But
O	to
C	Thor
O	because
O	they
O	thought
O	him
O	a
O	dainty
O	maiden
O	they
O	served
O	small
O	bits
O	of
O	everything
O	on
O	a
O	tiny
O	gold
O	dish
O	Now
C	Thor
O	s
O	long
O	journey
O	had
O	made
O	him
O	very
O	hungry
O	and
O	through
O	his
O	veil
O	he
O	whispered
O	to
C	Loki
O	I
O	shall
O	starve
C	Loki
O	I
O	cannot
O	fare
O	on
O	these
O	nibbles
O	I
O	must
O	eat
O	a
O	goodly
O	meal
O	as
O	I
O	do
O	at
O	home
O	And
O	forthwith
O	he
O	helped
O	himself
O	to
O	such
O	morsels
O	as
O	might
O	satisfy
O	his
O	hunger
O	for
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	You
O	should
O	have
O	seen
O	the
O	giants
O	stare
O	at
O	the
O	meal
O	which
O	the
O	dainty
O	bride
O	devoured
O	For
O	first
O	under
O	the
O	silver
O	veil
O	disappeared
O	by
O	pieces
O	a
O	whole
O	roast
O	ox
O	Then
C	Thor
O	made
O	eight
O	mouthfuls
O	of
O	eight
O	pink
O	salmon
O	a
O	dish
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	fond
O	And
O	next
O	he
O	looked
O	about
O	and
O	reached
O	for
O	a
O	platter
O	of
O	cakes
O	and
O	sweetmeats
O	that
O	was
O	set
O	aside
O	at
O	one
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	table
O	for
O	the
O	lady
O	guests
O	and
O	the
O	bride
O	ate
O	them
O	all
O	You
O	can
O	fancy
O	how
O	the
O	damsels
O	drew
O	down
O	their
O	mouths
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	one
O	another
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	their
O	dessert
O	disappear
O	and
O	they
O	whispered
O	about
O	the
O	table
O	Alack
O	if
O	our
O	future
O	mistress
O	is
O	to
O	sup
O	like
O	this
O	day
O	by
O	day
O	there
O	will
O	be
O	poor
O	cheer
O	for
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	us
O	And
O	to
O	crown
O	it
O	all
C	Thor
O	was
O	thirsty
O	as
O	well
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	and
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	he
O	raised
O	to
O	his
O	lips
O	and
O	emptied
O	three
O	great
O	barrels
O	of
O	mead
O	the
O	foamy
O	drink
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	Then
O	indeed
C	Thrym
O	was
O	amazed
O	for
C	Thor
O	s
O	giant
O	appetite
O	had
O	beaten
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	themselves
O	Never
O	before
O	saw
O	I
O	a
O	bride
O	so
O	hungry
O	he
O	cried
O	And
O	never
O	before
O	one
O	half
O	so
O	thirsty
O	But
C	Loki
O	the
C	waiting
C	maid
O	whispered
O	to
O	him
O	softly
O	The
O	truth
O	is
O	great
C	Thrym
O	that
O	my
O	dear
O	mistress
O	was
O	almost
O	starved
O	For
O	eight
O	days
C	Freia
O	has
O	eaten
O	nothing
O	at
O	all
O	so
O	eager
O	was
O	she
O	for
O	Jotunheim
O	Then
C	Thrym
O	was
O	delighted
O	you
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	He
O	forgave
O	his
O	hungry
O	bride
O	and
O	loved
O	her
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	heart
O	He
O	leaned
O	forward
O	to
O	give
O	her
O	a
O	kiss
O	raising
O	a
O	corner
O	of
O	her
O	veil
O	but
O	his
O	hand
O	dropped
O	suddenly
O	and
O	he
O	started
O	up
O	in
O	terror
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	caught
O	the
O	angry
O	flash
O	of
C	Thor
O	s
O	eye
O	which
O	was
O	glaring
O	at
O	him
O	through
O	the
O	bridal
O	veil
C	Thor
O	was
O	longing
O	for
O	his
O	hammer
O	Why
O	has
C	Freia
O	so
O	sharp
O	a
O	look
C	Thrym
O	cried
O	It
O	pierces
O	like
O	lightning
O	and
O	burns
O	like
O	fire
O	But
O	again
O	the
O	sly
C	waiting
C	maid
O	whispered
O	timidly
O	Oh
C	Thrym
O	be
O	not
O	amazed
O	The
O	truth
O	is
O	my
O	poor
O	mistress
O	s
O	eyes
O	are
O	red
O	with
O	wakefulness
O	and
O	bright
O	with
O	longing
O	For
O	eight
O	nights
C	Freia
O	has
O	not
O	known
O	a
O	wink
O	of
O	sleep
O	so
O	eager
O	was
O	she
O	for
O	Jotunheim
O	Then
O	again
C	Thrym
O	was
O	doubly
O	delighted
O	and
O	he
O	longed
O	to
O	call
O	her
O	his
O	very
O	own
O	dear
O	wife
O	Bring
O	in
O	the
O	wedding
O	gift
O	he
O	cried
O	Bring
O	in
C	Thor
O	s
O	hammer
O	Miölnir
O	and
O	give
O	it
O	to
C	Freia
O	as
O	I
O	promised
O	for
O	when
O	I
O	have
O	kept
O	my
O	word
O	she
O	will
O	be
O	mine
O	all
O	mine
O	Then
C	Thor
O	s
O	big
O	heart
O	laughed
O	under
O	his
O	woman
O	s
O	dress
O	and
O	his
O	fierce
O	eyes
O	swept
O	eagerly
O	down
O	the
O	hall
O	to
O	meet
O	the
O	servant
O	who
O	was
O	bringing
O	in
O	the
O	hammer
O	on
O	a
O	velvet
O	cushion
C	Thor
O	s
O	fingers
O	could
O	hardly
O	wait
O	to
O	clutch
O	the
O	stubby
O	handle
O	which
O	they
O	knew
O	so
O	well
O	but
O	he
O	sat
O	quite
O	still
O	on
O	the
O	throne
O	beside
O	ugly
O	old
C	Thrym
O	with
O	his
O	hands
O	meekly
O	folded
O	and
O	his
O	head
O	bowed
O	like
O	a
O	bashful
O	bride
O	The
O	giant
O	servant
O	drew
O	nearer
O	nearer
O	puffing
O	and
O	blowing
O	strong
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	beneath
O	the
O	mighty
O	weight
O	He
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	lay
O	it
O	at
C	Thor
O	s
O	feet
O	for
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	so
O	heavy
O	that
O	no
O	maiden
O	could
O	lift
O	it
O	or
O	hold
O	it
O	in
O	her
O	lap
O	when
O	suddenly
C	Thor
O	s
O	heart
O	swelled
O	and
O	he
O	gave
O	a
O	most
O	unmaidenly
O	shout
O	of
O	rage
O	and
O	triumph
O	With
O	one
O	swoop
O	he
O	grasped
O	the
O	hammer
O	in
O	his
O	iron
O	fingers
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	arm
O	he
O	tore
O	off
O	the
O	veil
O	that
O	hid
O	his
O	terrible
O	face
O	and
O	trampled
O	it
O	under
O	foot
O	then
O	he
O	turned
O	to
O	the
O	frightened
O	king
O	who
O	cowered
O	beside
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	throne
O	Thief
O	he
O	cried
C	Freia
O	sends
O	you
O	this
O	as
O	a
O	wedding
O	gift
O	And
O	he
O	whirled
O	the
O	hammer
O	about
O	his
O	head
O	then
O	hurled
O	it
O	once
O	twice
O	thrice
O	as
O	it
O	rebounded
O	to
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	stroke
O	as
O	of
O	lightning
C	Thrym
O	rolled
O	dead
O	from
O	his
O	throne
O	in
O	the
O	second
O	stroke
O	perished
O	the
O	whole
O	giant
O	household
O	these
O	ugly
O	enemies
O	of
O	the
O	Aesir
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	third
O	stroke
O	the
O	palace
O	itself
O	tumbled
O	together
O	and
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	like
O	a
O	toppling
O	playhouse
O	of
O	blocks
O	But
C	Loki
O	and
C	Thor
O	stood
O	safely
O	among
O	the
O	ruins
O	dressed
O	in
O	their
O	tattered
O	maiden
O	robes
O	a
O	quaint
O	and
O	curious
O	sight
O	and
C	Loki
O	full
O	of
O	mischief
O	now
O	as
O	ever
O	burst
O	out
O	laughing
O	Oh
C	Thor
O	if
O	you
O	could
O	he
O	began
O	but
C	Thor
O	held
O	up
O	his
O	hammer
O	and
O	shook
O	it
O	gently
O	as
O	he
O	said
O	Look
O	now
C	Loki
O	it
O	was
O	an
O	excellent
O	joke
O	and
O	so
O	far
O	you
O	have
O	done
O	well
O	after
O	your
O	crafty
O	fashion
O	which
O	likes
O	me
O	not
O	But
O	now
O	I
O	have
O	my
O	hammer
O	again
O	and
O	the
O	joke
O	is
O	done
O	From
O	you
O	nor
O	from
O	another
O	I
O	brook
O	no
O	laughter
O	at
O	my
O	expense
O	Henceforth
O	we
O	will
O	have
O	no
O	mention
O	of
O	this
O	masquerade
O	nor
O	of
O	these
O	rags
O	which
O	now
O	I
O	throw
O	away
O	Do
O	you
O	hear
O	red
O	laughter
O	And
C	Loki
O	heard
O	with
O	a
O	look
O	of
O	hate
O	and
O	stifled
O	his
O	laughter
O	as
O	best
O	he
O	could
O	for
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	good
O	to
O	laugh
O	at
O	him
O	who
O	holds
O	the
O	hammer
O	Not
O	once
O	after
O	that
O	was
O	there
O	mention
O	in
O	Asgard
O	of
O	the
O	time
O	when
C	Thor
O	dressed
O	him
O	as
O	a
O	girl
O	and
O	won
O	his
O	bridal
O	gift
O	from
C	Thrym
O	the
O	giant
O	But
O	Miölnir
O	was
O	safe
O	once
O	more
O	in
O	Asgard
O	and
O	you
O	and
O	I
O	know
O	how
O	it
O	came
O	there
O	so
O	someone
O	must
O	have
O	told
O	I
O	wonder
O	if
O	red
C	Loki
O	whispered
O	the
O	tale
O	to
O	some
O	outsider
O	after
O	all
O	Perhaps
O	it
O	may
O	be
O	so
O	for
O	now
O	he
O	knew
O	how
O	best
O	to
O	make
C	Thor
O	angry
O	and
O	from
O	that
O	day
O	when
C	Thor
O	forbade
O	his
O	laughing
C	Loki
O	hated
O	him
O	with
O	the
O	mean
O	little
O	hatred
O	of
O	a
O	mean
O	little
O	soul
O	Many
O	years
O	ago
O	on
O	the
O	sparsely
O	settled
O	prairies
O	of
O	America
O	there
O	lived
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	who
O	was
O	known
O	by
O	the
O	queer
O	name
O	of
C	Johnny
C	Appleseed
O	His
O	wife
O	had
O	died
O	long
O	ago
O	and
O	his
O	children
O	had
O	grown
O	up
O	and
O	scattered
O	to
O	the
O	corners
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	He
O	had
O	not
O	even
O	a
O	home
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	call
O	his
O	own
O	but
O	wandered
O	about
O	from
O	place
O	to
O	place
O	with
O	only
O	a
O	few
O	friends
O	and
O	little
O	or
O	no
O	money
O	His
O	face
O	was
O	wrinkled
O	his
O	hair
O	was
O	thin
O	and
O	grey
O	and
O	his
O	shoulders
O	stooped
O	His
O	clothes
O	were
O	old
O	and
O	ragged
O	and
O	his
O	hat
O	was
O	old
O	and
O	shabby
O	Yet
O	inside
O	of
O	him
O	was
O	a
O	heart
O	that
O	was
O	brave
O	and
O	true
O	and
O	he
O	felt
O	that
O	even
O	he
O	old
O	and
O	poor
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	could
O	be
O	of
O	use
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	because
O	he
O	loved
O	his
O	and
O	love
O	always
O	finds
O	something
O	to
O	do
O	As
O	he
O	trudged
O	along
O	the
O	lonely
O	road
O	from
O	town
O	to
O	town
O	or
O	made
O	for
O	himself
O	a
O	path
O	through
O	the
O	unbroken
O	forest
O	he
O	often
O	thought
O	of
O	the
O	good
O	God
O	and
O	of
O	how
O	all
O	men
O	were
O	children
O	of
O	the
O	One
O	Father
O	Sometimes
O	he
O	would
O	burst
O	out
O	singing
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	a
O	song
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	learned
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	young
O	man
O	Millions
O	loving
O	I

O	are
O	a
O	part
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	poem
O	you

O	some
O	day

O	And
O	they
O	once
O	so
O	stirred
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	musician
O	that
O	he
O	set
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	finest
O	music
O	the
O	world
O	has
O	ever
O	heard
O	And

O	the

O	God
O	and
O	the
O	great
O	music
O	of
O	a
O	loving
O	man
O	comforted
O	the
O	lonely
O	traveller
O	The
C	old
C	man
O	wandered
O	about
O	from
O	village
O	to
O	village
O	which
O	in
O	those
O	days
O	were
O	scattered
O	far
O	apart
O	with
O	miles
O	and
O	miles
O	of
O	prairie
O	land
O	stretching
O	between
O	them
O	and
O	sometimes
O	woodland
O	and
O	rivers
O	too
O	separated
O	one
O	village
O	from
O	the
O	next
O	At
O	night
O	he
O	usually
O	earned
O	his
O	crust
O	of
O	bread
O	and
O	lodgings
O	by
O	mending
O	the
O	teakettle
O	or
O	of
O	some
O	farmer
O	s
O	wife
O	or
O	by
O	soldering
O	on
O	the
O	handle
O	of
O	her
O	tin
O	cup
O	or
O	the
O	knob
O	to
O	her
O	as
O	he
O	always
O	carried
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	coat
O	pockets
O	a
O	small
O	charcoal
O	stove
O	and
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	solder
O	He
O	always
O	carried
O	under
O	his
O	arm
O	or
O	over
O	his
O	shoulder
O	a
O	green
O	baize
O	bag
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	mending
O	was
O	done
O	he
O	would
O	oftentimes
O	draw
O	out
O	of
O	this
O	green
O	bag
O	an
O	old
O	violin
O	and
O	begin
O	to
O	play
O	and
O	the
C	farmer
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	his
C	wife
O	and
O	the
C	children
O	would
O	gather
O	around
O	him
O	and
O	listen
O	to
O	his
O	strange
O	music
O	Sometimes
O	it
O	was
O	gay
O	and
O	sometimes
O	it
O	was
O	sad
O	but
O	always
O	sweet
O	Sometimes
O	he
O	sang
O	words
O	that
O	he
O	himself
O	had
O	written
O	and
O	sometimes
O	the
O	songs
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	written
O	by
O	the
O	great
O	masters
O	But
O	mending
O	broken
O	tinware
O	and
O	playing
O	an
O	old
O	violin
O	were
O	not
O	the
O	only
O	things
O	he
O	did
O	to
O	help
O	the
O	world
O	along
O	As
O	he
O	wandered
O	from
O	place
O	to
O	place
O	he
O	often
O	noticed
O	how
O	rich
O	the
O	soil
O	was
O	and
O	he
O	would
O	say
O	to
O	himself
O	Some
O	day
O	this
O	will
O	be
O	a
O	great
O	country
O	with
O	thousands
O	of
O	people
O	living
O	on
O	this
O	land
O	and
O	though
O	I
O	shall
O	never

O	them
O	they
O	may
O	never
O	read
O	my
O	verses
O	or
O	hear
O	my
O	name
O	still
O	I
O	can
O	help
O	them
O	and
O	add
O	some
O	things
O	to
O	their
O	lives
O	So
O	whenever
O	a
C	farmer
C	s
C	wife
O	gave
O	him
O	an
O	apple
O	to
O	eat
O	he
O	carefully
O	saved
O	every
O	seed
O	that
O	lay
O	hidden
O	in
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	apple
O	and
O	next
O	day
O	as
O	he
O	trudged
O	along
O	he
O	would
O	stoop
O	down
O	every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	and
O	plant
O	a
O	few
O	of
O	the
O	seeds
O	and
O	then
O	carefully
O	cover
O	them
O	with
O	the
O	rich
O	black
O	soil
O	of
O	the
O	prairie
O	Then
O	he
O	would
O	look
O	up
O	reverently
O	to
O	the
O	sky
O	and
O	say
O	I
O	can
O	but
O	plant
O	the
O	seed
O	dear
O	Lord
O	and
O	Thy
O	clouds
O	may
O	water
O	them
O	but
O	Thou
O	alone
O	can
O	give
O	the
O	increase
O	Thou
O	only
O	can
O	cause
O	this
O	tiny
O	seed
O	to
O	grow
O	into
O	a
O	tree
O	whose
O	fruit
O	shall
O	feed
O	my
O	Then
O	the
O	love
O	that
O	would
O	fill
O	his
O	heart
O	at
O	such
O	a
O	thought
O	would
O	cause
O	his
O	face
O	to
O	look
O	young
O	again
O	and
O	his
O	eyes
O	to
O	shine
O	as
O	an
O	angel
O	s
O	eyes
O	must
O	shine
O	and
O	oftentimes
O	he
O	would
O	sing
O	in
O	clear
O	rich
O	Millions
O	loving
O	I
O	embrace

O	Dwells
O	a
O	God
O	whose
O	love
O	is
O	true
O	And
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	God
O	dwelt
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	in
O	the
O	blue
O	sky
O	above
O	When
O	the
O	cold
O	winters
O	came
O	and
O	the

O	was
O	frozen
O	too
O	hard
O	for

O	to

O	seeds
O	he
O	still

O	until

O	his
O	soul
O	which

O	out
O	of

O	into
O	the

O	beyond

O	the

O	was
O	buried
O	by
O	some

O	who
O	felt
O	kindly
O	towards
O	the

O	done
O	any
O	real

O	And
O	soon

O	But
O	the
O	tiny
O	apple
O	seeds
O	took
O	root
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	grow
O	and
O	each
O	summer
O	the
O	young

O	grew
O	taller
O	and
O	each

O	they
O	grew

O	until

O	they
O	were

O	trees
O	and
O	then
O	they
O	were
O	old
O	enough
O	to

O	apples
O	As
O	people
O	moved
O	from
O	the

O	out
O	to
O	the

O	western
O	prairies
O	they
O	naturally
O	enough

O	for

O	the
C	young
C	men
O	gathered
O	the

O	for

O	to

O	in

O	in
O	the

O	the
C	fathers
O	gathered
O	the
O	ripe
O	red
O	and

O	apples
O	to
O	store
O	away
O	in
O	their
O	cellars
O	for

O	use
O	and
O	the
C	mothers
O	made
O	apple
O	sauce
O	and
O	apple
O	pies
O	and
O	apple
O	dumplings
O	of

O	and

O	played
O	under
O	the

O	but

O	from

O	These

O	until
O	the

O	In

O	we

O	In
O	woman
O	he

O	his

O	wrought
O	such
O	great
O	things
O	that

O	sculptor
O	He

O	a
O	passion
O	for

O	sufficed
O	him
O	Out
O	of

O	he

O	that
O	the

O	of

O	freed
O	from

O	of

O	One
O	day
O	as
O	he
O	chipped
O	and
O	chiselled
O	there
O	came
O	to
O	him
O	like
O	the
O	rough
O	sketch
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	picture
O	the
O	semblance
O	of
O	a
O	woman
O	How
O	it
O	came
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	Only
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	in
O	that
O	great
O	mass
O	of
O	pure
O	white
O	stone
O	there
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	imprisoned
O	the
O	exquisite
O	image
O	of
O	a
O	woman
O	a
O	woman
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	set
O	free
O	Slowly
O	gradually
O	the
O	woman
O	came
O	Soon
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	thing
O	that
O	his
O	art
O	had
O	ever
O	wrought
O	All
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	thought
O	that
O	a
O	woman
O	should
O	be
O	this
O	woman
O	was
O	Her
O	form
O	and
O	features
O	were
O	all
O	most
O	perfect
O	and
O	so
O	perfect
O	were
O	they
O	that
O	he
O	felt
O	very
O	sure
O	that
O	had
O	she
O	been
O	a
O	woman
O	indeed
O	most
O	perfect
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	the
O	soul
O	within
O	For
O	her
O	he
O	worked
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	worked
O	before
O	There
O	came
O	at
O	last
O	a
O	day
O	when
O	he
O	felt
O	that
O	another
O	touch
O	would
O	be
O	insult
O	to
O	the
O	exquisite
O	thing
O	he
O	had
O	created
O	He
O	laid
O	his
O	chisel
O	aside
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	gaze
O	at
O	the
O	Perfect
O	Woman
O	She
O	seemed
O	to
O	gaze
O	back
O	at
O	him
O	Her
O	parted
O	lips
O	were
O	ready
O	to
O	speak
O	to
O	smile
O	Her
O	hands
O	were
O	held
O	out
O	to
O	hold
O	his
O	hands
O	Then
C	Pygmalion
O	covered
O	his
O	eyes
O	He
O	the
O	hater
O	of
O	women
O	loved
O	a
O	woman
O	a
O	woman
O	of
O	chilly
O	marble
O	The
O	women
O	he
O	had
O	scorned
O	were
O	avenged
O	Day
O	by
O	day
O	his
O	passion
O	for
O	the
O	woman
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	creation
O	grew
O	and
O	grew
O	His
O	hands
O	no
O	longer
O	wielded
O	the
O	chisel
O	They
O	grew
O	idle
O	He
O	would
O	stand
O	under
O	the
O	great
O	pines
O	and
O	gaze
O	across
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	dream
O	strange
O	dreams
O	of
O	a
O	marble
O	woman
O	who
O	walked
O	across
O	the
O	waves
O	with
O	arms
O	outstretched
O	with
O	smiling
O	lips
O	and
O	who
O	became
O	a
O	woman
O	of
O	warm
O	flesh
O	and
O	blood
O	when
O	her
O	bare
O	feet
O	touched
O	the
O	yellow
O	sand
O	and
O	the
O	bright
O	sun
O	of
O	Cyprus
O	touched
O	her
O	marble
O	hair
O	and
O	turned
O	it
O	into
O	hair
O	of
O	living
O	gold
O	Then
O	he
O	would
O	hasten
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	studio
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	miracle
O	still
O	unaccomplished
O	and
O	would
O	passionately
O	kiss
O	the
O	little
O	cold
O	hands
O	and
O	lay
O	beside
O	the
O	little
O	cold
O	feet
O	the
O	presents
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	young

O	bright
O	shells
O	and
O	exquisite
O	precious
O	stones
O	birds
O	and
O	fragrant
O	flowers
O	shining
O	amber
O	and

O	that
O	sparkled
O	and
O	flashed
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	most
O	lovely
O	combinations
O	of
O	colour
O	that
O	the
O	mind
O	of

O	could
O	devise
O	Yet
O	more
O	he
O	did
O	for
O	he
O	spent
O	vast
O	sums
O	on
O	priceless
O	pearls
O	and

O	them
O	in

O	and
O	upon
O	her
O	cold
O	white
O	breast
O	and
O	the
O	merchants
O	wondered
O	who
O	could
O	be
O	the
O	one
O	upon

C	Pygmalion
O	lavished
O	the

O	To
O	his
O	divinity
O	he

O	the

O	of
O	Cyprus
O	the

O	of
O	the

O	through
O	the

O	in

O	hopeless
O	and

C	Galatea
O	For

O	he
O	decked
O	a

O	with
O	Tyrian

O	and
O	on
O	the

O	of

O	he
O	laid
O	the

O	head
O	of
O	the

O	woman
O	that

O	loved
O	So

O	but
O	on
O	this
O	day
O	he
O	spoke
O	not
O	as
O	a
O	but
O	as
O	a
O	child
O	who
O	was
O	half
O	afraid
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	asked
O	O
O	Aphrodite
O	he
O	said
O	who
O	can
O	do
O	all
O	things
O	give
O	me
O	I
O	pray
O	you
O	one
O	like
O	my
C	Galatea
O	for
O	my
O	wife
O	Give
O	me
O	my
C	Galatea
O	he
O	dared
O	not
O	say
O	but
O	Aphrodite
O	knew
O	well
O	the
O	words
O	he
O	would
O	fain
O	have
O	uttered
O	and
O	smiled
O	to
O	think
O	how
C	Pygmalion
O	at
O	last
O	was
O	on
O	his
O	knees
O	In
O	token
O	that
O	his
O	prayer
O	was
O	answered
O	three
O	times
O	she
O	made
O	the
O	flames
O	on
O	the
O	altar
O	shoot
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	fiery
O	point
O	and
C	Pygmalion
O	went
O	home
O	scarcely
O	daring
O	to
O	hope
O	not
O	allowing
O	his
O	gladness
O	to
O	conquer
O	his
O	fear
O	The
O	shadows
O	of
O	evening
O	were
O	falling
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	sacred
O	to
C	Galatea
O	On
O	the
O	couch
O	she
O	lay
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	entered
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	though
O	she
O	met
O	his
O	eyes
O	with
O	her
O	own
O	almost
O	it
O	seemed
O	that
O	she
O	smiled
O	at
O	him
O	in
O	welcome
O	He
O	quickly
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	kneeling
O	by
O	her
O	side
O	he
O	pressed
O	his
O	lips
O	on
O	those
O	lips
O	of
O	chilly
O	marble
O	So
O	many
O	times
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	it
O	before
O	and
O	always
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	though
O	the
O	icy
O	lips
O	that
O	could
O	never
O	live
O	sent
O	their
O	chill
O	right
O	through
O	his
O	heart
O	but
O	now
O	it
O	surely
O	seemed
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	lips
O	were
O	cold
O	no
O	longer
O	He
O	felt
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	hands
O	and
O	no
O	more
O	did
O	it
O	remain
O	heavy
O	and
O	cold
O	and
O	stiff
O	in
O	his
O	touch
O	but
O	lay
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	hand
O	soft
O	and
O	living
O	and
O	warm
O	He
O	softly
O	laid
O	his
O	fingers
O	on
O	the
O	marble
O	hair
O	and
O	lo
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	soft
O	and
O	wavy
O	burnished
O	golden
O	hair
O	of
O	his
O	desire
O	Again
O	reverently
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	laid
O	his
O	offerings
O	that
O	day
O	on
O	the
O	altar
O	of
O	Venus
C	Pygmalion
O	kissed
O	her
O	lips
O	And
O	then
O	did
C	Galatea
O	with
O	warm
O	and
O	rosy
O	cheeks
O	widely
O	open
O	her
O	eyes
O	like
O	pools
O	in
O	a
O	dark
O	mountain
O	stream
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	sun
O	is
O	shining
O	and
O	gaze
O	with
O	timid
O	gladness
O	into
O	his
O	own
O	There
O	are
O	no
O	after
O	tales
O	of
C	Pygmalion
O	and
C	Galatea
O	We
O	only
O	know
O	that
O	their
O	lives
O	were
O	happy
O	and
O	that
O	to
O	them
O	was
O	born
O	a
O	son
O	Paphos
O	from
O	whom
O	the
O	city
O	sacred
O	to
O	Aphrodite
O	received
O	its
O	name
O	Perhaps
O	Aphrodite
O	may
O	have
O	smiled
O	sometimes
O	to
O	watch
C	Pygmalion
O	once
O	the
O	scorner
O	of
O	women
O	the
O	adoring
O	servant
O	of
O	the
O	woman
O	that
O	his
O	own
O	hands
O	had
O	first
O	designed
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	Quest
O	of
O	the
O	Holy
O	Grail
O	was
O	ended
O	and
O	by
O	ones
O	and
O	twos
O	the
O	knights
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	Camelot
O	though
O	many
O	who
O	had
O	set
O	out
O	so
O	boldly
O	were
O	never
O	seen
O	again
O	about
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	Great
O	was
O	the
O	joy
O	of
C	King
C	Arthur
O	when
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	and
C	Sir
C	Bors
O	returned
O	for
O	so
O	long
O	had
O	they
O	been
O	away
O	that
O	almost
O	he
O	had
O	feared
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	perished
O	In
O	their
O	honor
O	there
O	was
O	high
O	festival
O	for
O	many
O	days
O	in
O	London
O	where
C	Arthur
O	then
O	had
O	his
O	court
O	and
O	the
C	King
O	made
O	proclamation
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	tournament
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	hold
O	at
O	Camelot
O	when
O	he
O	and
O	the
C	King
O	of
O	Nortgalis
O	would
O	keep
O	the
O	lists
O	against
O	all
O	comers
O	So
O	one
O	fair
O	morning
O	of
O	spring
C	King
C	Arthur
O	made
O	ready
O	to
O	ride
O	to
O	Camelot
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	knights
O	with
O	him
O	save
C	Launcelot
O	who
O	excused
O	himself
O	saying
O	that
O	an
O	old
O	wound
O	hindered
O	him
O	from
O	riding
O	But
O	when
O	the
C	King
O	sore
O	vexed
O	had
O	departed
O	the
C	queen
O	rebuked
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	go
O	and
O	prove
O	his
O	great
O	prowess
O	as
O	of
O	old
O	Madam
O	said
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	in
O	this
O	as
O	in
O	all
O	else
O	I
O	obey
O	you
O	at
O	your
O	bidding
O	I
O	go
O	but
O	know
O	that
O	in
O	this
O	tournament
O	I
O	shall
O	adventure
O	me
O	in
O	other
O	wise
O	than
O	ever
O	before
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	at
O	dawn
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	mounted
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	riding
O	forth
O	unattended
O	journeyed
O	all
O	that
O	day
O	till
O	as
O	evening
O	fell
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	little
O	town
O	of
O	Astolat
O	and
O	there
O	at
O	the
O	castle
O	sought
O	lodgment
O	for
O	that
O	night
O	The
O	old
O	Lord
O	of
O	Astolat
O	was
O	glad
O	at
O	his
O	coming
O	judging
O	him
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	noble
C	Knight
O	though
O	he
O	knew
O	him
O	not
O	for
O	it
O	was
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	s
O	will
O	to
O	remain
O	unknown
O	So
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	supper
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	lord
O	his
O	son
C	Sir
C	Lavaine
O	and
O	his
O	daughter
C	Elaine
O	whom
O	they
O	of
O	the
O	place
O	called
O	the
C	Fair
C	Maid
O	of
O	Astolat
O	As
O	they
O	sat
O	at
O	meat
O	the
O	baron
O	asked
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	if
O	he
O	rode
O	to
O	the
O	tournament
O	Yea
O	answered
C	Launcelot
O	and
O	right
O	glad
O	should
O	I
O	be
O	if
O	of
O	your
O	courtesy
O	ye
O	would
O	lend
O	me
O	a
O	shield
O	without
O	device
O	Right
O	willingly
O	said
O	his
O	host
O	ye
O	shall
O	have
O	my
O	son
O	Sir
O	Tirre
O	s
O	shield
O	He
O	was
O	but
O	lately
O	made
C	Knight
O	and
O	was
O	hurt
O	in
O	his
O	first
O	encounter
O	so
O	his
O	shield
O	is
O	bare
O	enough
O	If
O	ye
O	will
O	take
O	with
O	you
O	my
O	young
O	son
C	Sir
C	Lavaine
O	he
O	will
O	be
O	glad
O	to
O	ride
O	in
O	the
O	company
O	of
O	so
O	noble
O	a
C	Knight
O	and
O	will
O	do
O	you
O	such
O	service
O	as
O	he
O	may
O	I
O	shall
O	be
O	glad
O	indeed
O	of
O	his
O	fellowship
O	answered
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	courteously
O	Now
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	the
O	fair
C	Elaine
O	that
O	never
O	had
O	she
O	beheld
O	so
O	noble
O	a
C	Knight
O	as
O	this
O	stranger
O	and
O	seeing
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	gentle
O	and
O	courteous
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	strong
O	she
O	said
O	to
O	him
O	Fair
C	Knight
O	will
O	ye
O	wear
O	my
O	favor
O	at
O	this
O	tournament
O	For
O	never
O	have
O	I
O	found
C	Knight
O	yet
O	to
O	wear
O	my
O	crimson
O	sleeve
O	and
O	sure
O	am
O	I
O	that
O	none
O	other
O	could
O	ever
O	win
O	it
O	such
O	honor
O	Maiden
O	said
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	right
O	gladly
O	would
O	I
O	serve
O	you
O	in
O	aught
O	but
O	it
O	has
O	never
O	been
O	my
O	custom
O	to
O	wear
O	lady
O	s
O	favor
O	Then
O	shall
O	it
O	serve
O	the
O	better
O	for
O	disguise
O	answered
C	Elaine
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	pondered
O	her
O	words
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	said
O	Fair
O	maiden
O	I
O	will
O	do
O	for
O	you
O	what
O	I
O	have
O	done
O	for
O	none
O	and
O	will
O	wear
O	your
O	favor
O	So
O	with
O	great
O	glee
O	she
O	brought
O	it
O	him
O	a
O	crimson
O	velvet
O	sleeve
O	embroidered
O	with
O	great
O	pearls
O	and
O	fastened
O	it
O	in
O	his
O	helmet
O	Then
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	begged
O	her
O	to
O	keep
O	for
O	him
O	his
O	own
O	shield
O	until
O	after
O	the
O	tournament
O	when
O	he
O	would
O	come
O	for
O	it
O	again
O	and
O	tell
O	them
O	his
O	name
O	The
O	next
O	morn
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	took
O	his
O	departure
O	with
C	Sir
C	Lavaine
O	and
O	by
O	evening
O	they
O	were
O	come
O	to
O	Camelot
O	Forthwith
C	Sir
C	Lavaine
O	led
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	to
O	the
O	house
O	of
O	a
O	worthy
O	burgher
O	where
O	he
O	might
O	stay
O	in
O	privacy
O	undiscovered
O	by
O	those
O	of
O	his
O	acquaintance
O	Then
O	when
O	at
O	dawn
O	the
O	trumpets
O	blew
O	they
O	mounted
O	their
O	horses
O	and
O	rode
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	wood
O	hard
O	by
O	the
O	lists
O	and
O	there
O	they
O	abode
O	some
O	while
O	for
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	would
O	take
O	no
O	part
O	until
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	which
O	side
O	was
O	the
O	stronger
O	So
O	they
O	saw
O	how
C	King
C	Arthur
O	sat
O	high
O	on
O	a
O	throne
O	to
O	overlook
O	the
O	combat
O	while
O	the
C	King
C	of
C	Northgalis
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	fellowship
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	held
O	the
O	lists
O	against
O	their
O	opponents
O	led
O	by
C	King
O	Anguish
O	of
O	Ireland
O	and
O	the
C	King
O	of
O	Scots
O	Then
O	it
O	soon
O	appeared
O	that
O	the
O	two
O	kings
O	with
O	all
O	their
O	company
O	could
O	do
O	but
O	little
O	against
O	the
O	Knights
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	and
O	were
O	sore
O	pressed
O	to
O	maintain
O	their
O	ground
O	Seeing
O	this
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	said
O	to
C	Sir
C	Lavaine
O	Sir
C	Knight
O	will
O	ye
O	give
O	me
O	your
O	aid
O	if
O	I
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	rescue
O	of
O	the
O	weaker
O	side
O	For
O	it
O	seems
O	to
O	me
O	they
O	may
O	not
O	much
O	longer
O	hold
O	their
O	own
O	unaided
O	Sir
O	answered
C	Lavaine
O	I
O	will
O	gladly
O	follow
O	you
O	and
O	do
O	what
O	I
O	may
O	So
O	the
O	two
O	laid
O	their
O	lances
O	in
O	rest
O	and
O	charged
O	into
O	the
O	thickest
O	of
O	the
O	fight
O	and
O	with
O	one
O	spear
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	bore
O	four
O	knights
O	from
O	the
O	saddle
C	Lavaine
O	too
O	did
O	nobly
O	for
O	he
O	unhorsed
O	the
O	bold
C	Sir
C	Bedivere
O	and
C	Sir
C	Lucan
O	the
O	Butler
O	Then
O	with
O	their
O	swords
O	they
O	smote
O	lustily
O	on
O	the
O	left
O	hand
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	right
O	and
O	those
O	whom
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	aid
O	rallying
O	to
O	them
O	they
O	drove
O	the
O	Knights
O	of
O	the
O	Round
O	Table
O	back
O	a
O	space
O	So
O	the
O	fight
O	raged
O	furiously
C	Launcelot
O	ever
O	being
O	in
O	the
O	thickest
O	of
O	the
O	press
O	and
O	performing
O	such
O	deeds
O	of
O	valor
O	that
O	all
O	marvelled
O	to
O	see
O	him
O	and
O	would
O	fain
O	know
O	who
O	was
O	the
C	Knight
O	of
O	the
O	Crimson
O	Sleeve
O	But
O	the
O	knights
O	of
C	Arthur
O	s
O	court
O	felt
O	shame
O	of
O	their
O	discomfiture
O	and
O	in
O	especial
O	those
O	of
C	Launcelot
O	s
O	kin
O	were
O	wroth
O	that
O	one
O	should
O	appear
O	who
O	seemed
O	mightier
O	even
O	than
C	Launcelot
O	s
O	self
O	So
O	they
O	called
O	to
O	each
O	other
O	and
O	making
O	a
O	rally
O	directed
O	all
O	their
O	force
O	against
O	the
O	stranger
C	Knight
O	who
O	had
O	so
O	turned
O	the
O	fortunes
O	of
O	the
O	day
O	With
O	lances
O	in
O	rest
C	Sir
C	Lionel
C	Sir
C	Bors
O	and
C	Sir
C	Ector
O	bore
O	down
O	together
O	upon
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	and
C	Sir
C	Bors
O	spear
O	pierced
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	and
O	brought
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	earth
O	leaving
O	the
O	spear
O	head
O	broken
O	off
O	in
O	his
O	side
O	This
C	Sir
C	Lavaine
O	saw
O	and
O	immediately
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	might
O	he
O	rode
O	upon
O	the
C	King
O	of
O	Scots
O	unhorsed
O	him
O	and
O	took
O	his
O	horse
O	to
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	Now
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	felt
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	got
O	his
O	but
O	such
O	was
O	his
O	spirit
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	resolved
O	to
O	do
O	some
O	great
O	deed
O	while
O	yet
O	his
O	strength
O	remained
O	So
O	with
C	Lavaine
O	s
O	aid
O	he
O	got
O	upon
O	the
O	horse
O	took
O	a
O	spear
O	and
O	laying
O	it
O	in
O	rest
O	bore
O	down
O	one
O	after
O	the
O	other
C	Sir
C	Bors
C	Sir
C	Lionel
O	and
C	Sir
C	Ector
O	Next
O	he
O	flung
O	himself
O	into
O	the
O	thickest
O	of
O	the
O	fight
O	and
O	before
O	the
O	trumpets
O	sounded
O	the
O	signal
O	to
O	cease
O	he
O	had
O	unhorsed
O	thirty
O	good
O	knights
O	Then
O	the
O	Kings
O	of
O	Scotland
O	and
O	Ireland
O	came
O	to
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	and
O	said
C	Sir
C	Knight
O	we
O	thank
O	you
O	for
O	the
O	service
O	done
O	us
O	this
O	day
O	And
O	now
O	we
O	pray
O	you
O	come
O	with
O	us
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	prize
O	which
O	is
O	rightly
O	yours
O	for
O	never
O	have
O	we
O	seen
O	such
O	deeds
O	as
O	ye
O	have
O	done
O	this
O	day
O	My
O	fair
O	lords
O	answered
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	for
O	aught
O	that
O	I
O	have
O	accomplished
O	I
O	am
O	like
O	to
O	pay
O	dearly
O	I
O	beseech
O	you
O	suffer
O	me
O	to
O	depart
O	With
O	these
O	words
O	he
O	rode
O	away
O	full
O	gallop
O	followed
O	by
C	Sir
C	Lavaine
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	wood
O	he
O	called
C	Lavaine
O	to
O	him
O	saying
O	Gentle
C	Knight
O	I
O	entreat
O	you
O	draw
O	forth
O	this
O	spear
O	head
O	for
O	it
O	nigh
O	slayeth
O	me
O	Oh
O	my
O	dear
O	lord
O	said
C	Lavaine
O	I
O	fear
O	sore
O	to
O	draw
O	it
O	forth
O	lest
O	ye
O	die
O	If
O	ye
O	love
O	me
O	draw
O	it
O	out
O	answered
C	Launcelot
O	So
C	Lavaine
O	did
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	bidden
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	deathly
O	groan
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	fell
O	in
O	a
O	swoon
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	When
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	recovered
O	he
O	begged
C	Lavaine
O	to
O	help
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	lead
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	hermitage
O	hard
O	by
O	where
O	dwelt
O	a
O	hermit
O	who
O	in
O	bygone
O	days
O	had
O	been
O	known
O	to
C	Launcelot
O	for
O	a
O	good
C	Knight
O	and
O	true
O	So
O	with
O	pain
O	and
O	difficulty
O	they
O	journeyed
O	to
O	the
O	hermitage
C	Lavaine
O	oft
O	fearing
O	that
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	would
O	die
O	And
O	when
O	the
O	hermit
O	saw
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	all
O	pale
O	and
O	besmeared
O	with
O	blood
O	he
O	scarce
O	knew
O	him
O	for
O	the
O	bold
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	du
O	Lac
O	but
O	he
O	bore
O	him
O	within
O	and
O	dressed
O	his
O	wounds
O	and
O	bade
O	him
O	be
O	of
O	good
O	cheer
O	for
O	he
O	should
O	recover
O	So
O	there
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	abode
O	many
O	weeks
O	and
C	Sir
C	Lavaine
O	with
O	him
O	for
C	Lavaine
O	would
O	not
O	leave
O	him
O	such
O	love
O	had
O	he
O	for
O	the
O	good
C	Knight
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	for
O	his
O	lord
O	Now
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	known
O	that
O	the
O	victorious
C	Knight
O	had
O	departed
O	from
O	the
O	field
O	sore
O	wounded
C	Sir
C	Gawain
O	vowed
O	to
O	go
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	him
O	So
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
O	in
O	his
O	wanderings
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	Astolat
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	hearty
O	welcome
O	of
O	the
O	Lord
O	of
O	Astolat
O	who
O	asked
O	him
O	for
O	news
O	of
O	the
O	tournament
O	Then
C	Sir
C	Gawain
O	related
O	how
O	two
O	stranger
O	knights
O	bearing
O	white
O	shields
O	had
O	won
O	great
O	glory
O	and
O	in
O	especial
O	one
O	who
O	wore
O	in
O	his
O	helm
O	a
O	crimson
O	sleeve
O	had
O	surpassed
O	all
O	others
O	in
O	knightly
O	prowess
O	At
O	these
O	words
O	the
O	fair
C	Elaine
O	cried
O	aloud
O	with
O	delight
O	Maiden
O	said
C	Gawain
O	know
O	ye
O	this
C	Knight
O	Not
O	his
O	name
O	she
O	replied
O	but
O	full
O	sure
O	was
O	I
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	noble
C	Knight
O	when
O	I
O	prayed
O	him
O	to
O	wear
O	my
O	favor
O	Then
O	she
O	showed
C	Gawain
O	the
O	shield
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	kept
O	wrapped
O	in
O	rich
O	broideries
O	and
O	immediately
C	Sir
C	Gawain
O	knew
O	it
O	for
C	Launcelot
O	s
O	Alas
O	cried
O	he
O	without
O	doubt
O	it
O	was
C	Launcelot
O	himself
O	that
O	we
O	wounded
O	to
O	the
O	death
C	Sir
C	Bors
O	will
O	never
O	recover
O	the
O	woe
O	of
O	it
O	Then
O	on
O	the
O	morrow
C	Sir
C	Gawain
O	rode
O	to
O	London
O	to
O	tell
O	the
O	court
O	how
O	the
O	stranger
C	Knight
O	and
C	Launcelot
O	were
O	one
O	but
O	the
C	Fair
C	Maid
O	of
O	Astolat
O	rose
O	betimes
O	and
O	having
O	obtained
O	leave
O	of
O	her
O	father
O	set
O	out
O	to
O	search
O	for
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	and
O	her
O	brother
C	Lavaine
O	After
O	many
O	journeyings
O	she
O	came
O	one
O	day
O	upon
C	Lavaine
O	exercising
O	his
O	horse
O	in
O	a
O	field
O	and
O	by
O	him
O	she
O	was
O	taken
O	to
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	Then
O	indeed
O	her
O	heart
O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	grief
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	good
C	Knight
O	to
O	whom
O	she
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	crimson
O	sleeve
O	thus
O	laid
O	low
O	so
O	she
O	abode
O	in
O	the
O	hermitage
O	waiting
O	upon
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	and
O	doing
O	all
O	within
O	her
O	power
O	to
O	lessen
O	his
O	pain
O	After
O	many
O	weeks
O	by
O	the
O	good
O	care
O	of
O	the
O	hermit
O	and
O	the
O	fair
C	Elaine
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	was
O	so
O	far
O	recovered
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	bear
O	the
O	weight
O	of
O	his
O	armor
O	and
O	mount
O	his
O	horse
O	again
O	Then
O	one
O	morn
O	they
O	left
O	the
O	hermitage
O	and
O	rode
O	all
O	three
O	the
C	Fair
C	Maid
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	and
C	Sir
C	Lavaine
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	Astolat
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	much
O	joy
O	of
O	their
O	coming
O	After
O	brief
O	sojourn
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	desired
O	to
O	ride
O	to
O	court
O	for
O	he
O	knew
O	there
O	would
O	be
O	much
O	sorrow
O	among
O	his
O	kinsmen
O	for
O	his
O	long
O	absence
O	But
O	when
O	he
O	would
O	take
O	his
O	departure
C	Elaine
O	cried
O	aloud
O	Ah
O	my
O	lord
O	suffer
O	me
O	to
O	go
O	with
O	you
O	for
O	I
O	may
O	not
O	bear
O	to
O	lose
O	you
O	Fair
O	child
O	answered
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	gently
O	that
O	may
O	not
O	be
O	But
O	in
O	the
O	days
O	to
O	come
O	when
O	ye
O	shall
O	love
O	and
O	wed
O	some
O	good
C	Knight
O	for
O	your
O	sake
O	I
O	will
O	bestow
O	upon
O	him
O	broad
O	lands
O	and
O	great
O	riches
O	and
O	at
O	all
O	times
O	will
O	I
O	hold
O	me
O	ready
O	to
O	serve
O	you
O	as
O	a
O	true
C	Knight
O	may
O	Thus
O	spoke
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	but
O	the
O	fair
O	Elaine
O	answered
O	never
O	a
O	word
O	So
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	rode
O	to
O	London
O	where
O	the
O	whole
O	court
O	was
O	glad
O	of
O	his
O	coming
O	but
O	from
O	the
O	day
O	of
O	his
O	departure
O	the
C	Fair
C	Maid
O	drooped
O	and
O	pined
O	until
O	when
O	ten
O	days
O	were
O	passed
O	she
O	felt
O	that
O	her
O	end
O	was
O	at
O	hand
O	So
O	she
O	sent
O	for
O	her
O	father
O	and
O	two
O	brothers
O	to
O	whom
O	she
O	said
O	gently
O	Dear
O	father
O	and
O	brethren
O	I
O	must
O	now
O	leave
O	you
O	Bitterly
O	they
O	wept
O	but
O	she
O	comforted
O	them
O	all
O	she
O	might
O	and
O	presently
O	desired
O	of
O	her
O	father
O	a
O	boon
O	Ye
O	shall
O	have
O	what
O	ye
O	will
O	said
O	the
O	old
O	lord
O	for
O	he
O	hoped
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	yet
O	recover
O	Then
O	first
O	she
O	required
O	her
O	brother
C	Sir
C	Tirre
O	to
O	write
O	a
O	letter
O	word
O	for
O	word
O	as
O	she
O	said
O	it
O	and
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	written
O	she
O	turned
O	to
O	her
O	father
O	and
O	said
O	Kind
O	father
O	I
O	desire
O	that
O	when
O	I
O	am
O	dead
O	I
O	may
O	be
O	arrayed
O	in
O	my
O	fairest
O	raiment
O	and
O	placed
O	on
O	a
O	bier
O	and
O	let
O	the
O	bier
O	be
O	set
O	within
O	a
O	barge
O	with
O	one
O	to
O	steer
O	it
O	until
O	I
O	be
O	come
O	to
O	London
O	Then
O	perchance
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	will
O	come
O	and
O	look
O	upon
O	me
O	with
O	kindness
O	So
O	she
O	died
O	and
O	all
O	was
O	done
O	as
O	she
O	desired
O	for
O	they
O	set
O	her
O	looking
O	as
O	fair
O	as
O	a
O	lily
O	in
O	a
O	barge
O	all
O	hung
O	with
O	black
O	and
O	an
O	old
O	dumb
O	man
O	went
O	with
O	her
O	as
O	helmsman
O	Slowly
O	the
O	barge
O	floated
O	down
O	the
O	river
O	until
O	it
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	Westminster
O	and
O	as
O	it
O	passed
O	under
O	the
O	palace
O	walls
O	it
O	chanced
O	that
C	King
C	Arthur
O	and
C	Queen
C	Guenevere
O	looked
O	forth
O	from
O	a
O	window
O	Marvelling
O	much
O	at
O	the
O	strange
O	sight
O	together
O	they
O	went
O	forth
O	to
O	the
O	quay
O	followed
O	by
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	knights
O	Then
O	the
C	King
O	espied
O	the
O	letter
O	clasped
O	in
O	the
O	dead
O	maiden
O	s
O	hand
O	and
O	drew
O	it
O	forth
O	gently
O	and
O	broke
O	the
O	seal
O	And
O	thus
O	the
O	letter
O	ran
O	Most
O	noble
C	Knight
C	Sir
C	Launcelot
O	I
O	that

O	am

O	hither
O	to

O	burial
O	at
O	thy

O	a
O	workman
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	model
O	for
O	making
O	the
O	stock
O	of
O	a
O	saddle
O	When
O	that
O	was
O	done
O	I
O	covered
O	it
O	myself
O	with
O	velvet
O	and
O	leather
O	and
O	embroidered
O	it
O	with
O	gold
O	I
O	afterward
O	went
O	to
O	a
O	smith
O	who
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	bit
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	pattern
O	I
O	showed
O	him
O	and
O	also
O	some
O	stirrups
O	When
O	I
O	had
O	all
O	things
O	completed
O	I
O	presented
O	them
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	and
O	put
O	them
O	upon
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	horses
O	His
O	majesty
O	mounted
O	immediately
O	and
O	was
O	so
O	pleased
O	with
O	them
O	that
O	he
O	testified
O	his
O	satisfaction
O	by
O	large
O	presents
O	I
O	made
O	several
O	others
O	for
O	the
O	ministers
O	and
O	principal
O	officers
O	of
O	his

O	which
O	gained
O	me
O	great
O	reputation
O	and
O	regard
O	As
O	I
O	paid
O	my
O	court
O	very
O	constantly
O	to
O	the

O	he
O	said
O	to

O	I

O	thee
O	I
O	have
O	one

O	and
O	think
O	no

O	I
O	durst
O	not
O	resist
O	the

O	will
O	and

O	gave
O	me
O	one
O	of

O	of
O	his
O	court
O	noble
O	beautiful
O	and

O	and
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	we
O	lived
O	together
O	in
O	perfect
O	harmony
O	I
O	was
O	not
O	however
O	satisfied
O	with
O	my
O	banishment
O	therefore
O	designed
O	to

O	opportunity
O	and
O	to
O	return
O	to

O	and
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	place

O	they
O	took

O	manner
O	The
O	ceremony
O	being
O	over

O	was
O	again
O	covered
O	with
O	the

O	and
O	the
O	company
O	returned
O	I
O	mention
O	this
O	ceremony
O	the
O	more
O	particularly
O	because
O	I
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	weeks
O	time
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	principal
O	actor
O	on
O	a
O	similar
O	occasion
O	Alas
O	my
O	own
C	wife
O	fell
O	sick
O	and
O	died
O	I
O	made
O	every
O	remonstrance
O	I
O	could
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	not
O	to
O	expose
O	me
O	a
O	foreigner
O	to
O	this
O	inhuman
O	law
O	I
O	appealed
O	in
O	vain
O	The
C	king
O	and
O	all
O	his
O	court
O	with
O	the
O	most
O	considerable
O	persons
O	in
O	the
O	city
O	sought
O	to
O	soften
O	my
O	sorrow
O	by
O	honoring
O	the
O	funeral
O	ceremony
O	with
O	their
O	presence
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	termination
O	of
O	the
O	ceremony
O	I
O	was
O	lowered
O	into
O	the
O	pit
O	with
O	a
O	vessel
O	full
O	of
O	water
O	and
O	seven
O	loaves
O	As
O	I
O	approached
O	the
O	bottom
O	I
O	discovered
O	by
O	the
O	aid
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	light
O	that
O	came
O	from
O	above
O	the
O	nature
O	of
O	this
O	subterranean
O	place
O	It
O	seemed
O	an
O	endless
O	cavern
O	and
O	might
O	be
O	about
O	fifty
O	fathoms
O	deep
O	I
O	lived
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	there
O	upon
O	my
O	bread
O	and
O	water
O	when
O	one
O	day
O	just
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	exhaustion
O	I
O	heard
O	something
O	tread
O	and
O	breathing
O	or
O	panting
O	as
O	it
O	moved
O	I
O	followed
O	the
O	sound
O	The
O	animal
O	seemed
O	to
O	stop
O	sometimes
O	but
O	always
O	fled
O	and
O	breathed
O	hard
O	as
O	I
O	approached
O	I
O	pursued
O	it
O	for
O	a
O	considerable
O	time
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	I
O	perceived
O	a
O	light
O	resembling
O	a
O	star
O	I
O	went
O	on
O	sometimes
O	lost
O	sight
O	of
O	it
O	but
O	always
O	found
O	it
O	again
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	discovered
O	that
O	it
O	came
O	through
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	rock
O	which
O	I
O	got
O	through
O	and
O	found
O	myself
O	upon
O	the
O	seashore
O	at
O	which
O	I
O	felt
O	exceeding
O	joy
O	I
O	prostrated
O	myself
O	on
O	the
O	shore
O	to
O	thank
O	God
O	for
O	this
O	mercy
O	and
O	shortly
O	afterward
O	I
O	perceived
O	a
O	ship
O	making
O	for
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	I
O	was
O	I
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	with
O	the
O	linen
O	of
O	my
O	turban
O	and
O	called
O	to
O	the
O	crew
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	I
O	could
O	They
O	heard
O	me
O	and
O	sent
O	a
O	boat
O	to
O	bring
O	me
O	on
O	board
O	It
O	was
O	fortunate
O	for
O	me
O	that
O	these
O	people
O	did
O	not
O	inspect
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	they
O	found
O	me
O	but
O	without
O	hesitation
O	took
O	me
O	on
O	board
O	We
O	passed
O	by
O	several
O	islands
O	and
O	among
O	others
O	that
O	called
O	the
O	Isle
O	of
O	Bells
O	about
O	ten
O	days
O	sail
O	from
O	Serendib
O	with
O	a
O	regular
O	wind
O	and
O	six
O	from
O	that
O	of
O	Kela
O	where
O	we
O	landed
O	Lead
O	mines
O	are
O	found
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	also
O	Indian
O	canes
O	and
O	excellent
O	camphire
O	The
C	king
O	of
O	the
O	Isle
O	of
O	Kela
O	is
O	very
O	rich
O	and
O	powerful
O	and
O	the
O	Isle
O	of
O	Bells
O	which
O	is
O	about
O	two
O	days
O	journey
O	in
O	extent
O	is
O	also
O	subject
O	to
O	him
O	The
O	inhabitants
O	are
O	so
O	barbarous
O	that
O	they
O	still
O	eat
O	human
O	flesh
O	After
O	we
O	had
O	finished
O	our
O	traffic
O	in
O	that
O	island
O	we
O	put
O	to
O	sea
O	again
O	and
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	other
O	ports
O	at
O	last
O	I
O	arrived
O	happily
O	at
O	Bagdad
O	Out
O	of
O	gratitude
O	to
O	God
O	for
O	His
O	mercies
O	I
O	contributed
O	liberally
O	toward
O	the
O	support
O	of
O	several
O	mosques
O	and
O	the
O	subsistence
O	of
O	the
O	poor
O	and
O	enjoyed
O	myself
O	with
O	friends
O	in
O	festivities
O	and
O	amusements
O	Here
C	Sindbad
O	made
O	a

O	present
O	of
O	one
O	hundred
O	sequins
O	to
C	Hindbad
O	whom
O	he
O	requested
O	to

O	next
O	day
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	hour
O	to

O	with

O	and
O	hear
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	his
O	fifth
O	voyage
O	In
O	times
O	of
O	yore
O	when
O	wishes
O	were
O	both
O	heard
O	and
O	granted
O	lived
O	a
C	king
O	whose
O	daughters
O	were
O	all
O	beautiful
O	but
O	the
O	youngest
O	was
O	so
O	lovely
O	that
O	the
O	sun
O	himself
O	who
O	has
O	seen
O	so
O	much
O	wondered
O	at
O	her
O	beauty
O	every
O	time
O	he
O	looked
O	in
O	her
O	face
O	Now
O	near
O	the
C	king
O	s
O	castle
O	was
O	a
O	large
O	dark
O	forest
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	under
O	an
O	old
O	was
O	a
O	deep
O	well
O	When
O	the
O	day
O	was
O	very
O	hot
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	used
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	seat
O	herself
O	at
O	the
O	edge
O	of
O	the
O	cool
O	well
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	became
O	wearied
O	she
O	would
O	take
O	a
O	golden
O	ball
O	throw
O	it
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	and
O	catch
O	it
O	again
O	This
O	was
O	her
O	favourite
O	amusement
O	Once
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	her
O	golden
O	ball
O	instead
O	of
O	falling
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	little
O	hand
O	that
O	she
O	stretched
O	out
O	for
O	it
O	dropped
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	immediately
O	rolled
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	The
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	followed
O	it
O	with
O	her
O	eyes
O	but
O	the
O	ball
O	had
O	vanished
O	and
O	the
O	well
O	was
O	so
O	deep
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	could
O	see
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	Then
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	wept
O	louder
O	and
O	louder
O	every
O	minute
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	console
O	herself
O	at
O	all
O	While
O	she
O	was
O	thus
O	lamenting
O	some
O	one
O	called
O	to
O	her
O	What
O	is
O	the
O	matter
O	with
O	you
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	You
O	weep
O	so
O	that
O	you
O	would
O	touch
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	a
O	stone
O	She
O	looked
O	around
O	to
O	see
O	whence
O	the
O	voice
O	came
O	and
O	saw
O	a
C	frog
O	stretching
O	his
O	thick
O	ugly
O	head
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	Ah
O	it
O	is
O	you
O	old
O	said
O	she
O	I
O	am
O	crying
O	for
O	my
O	golden
O	ball
O	which
O	has
O	fallen
O	into
O	the
O	well
O	Be

O	dipped

O	again
O	picked
O	it
O	up

O	away
O	with
O	it
O	Wait
O	wait
O	cried
O	the
C	frog
O	take
O	me
O	with
O	you
O	I
O	cannot

O	as

O	obliged
O	to
O	plunge
O	again
O	to
O	the

O	all
O	the

O	from

O	little
O	gold
O	plate
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	sound
O	of
O	something
O	creeping
O	up
O	the
O	marble
O	staircase
O	splish
O	splash
O	and
O	when
O	it
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	top
O	it
O	knocked
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	cried
O	Youngest
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	open
O	to

O	She
O	ran
O	wishing

O	opened
O	the

O	there
O	sat
O	the

O	she
O	flung
O	it
O	hastily
O	to
O	again
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	at
O	table
O	feeling
O	very
O	very
O	uncomfortable
O	The
C	king
O	saw
O	that
O	her
O	heart
O	was
O	beating
O	violently
O	and
O	said
O	How
O	my
O	child
O	why
O	are
O	you
O	afraid
O	Is
O	a
O	giant
O	standing
O	outside
O	the
O	door
O	to
O	carry
O	you
O	off
O	Oh
O	no
O	answered
O	she
O	it
O	is
O	no
O	giant
O	but
O	a
O	nasty
C	frog
O	who
O	yesterday
O	when
O	I
O	was
O	playing
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	near
O	the
O	well
O	fetched
O	my
O	golden
O	ball
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	For
O	this
O	I
O	promised
O	him
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	my
O	companion
O	but
O	I
O	never
O	thought
O	he
O	could
O	come
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	well
O	Now
O	he
O	is
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	wants
O	to
O	come
O	in
O	Again
O	the
O	second
O	time
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	knock
O	and
O	a
O	voice
O	cried
O	Youngest
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	Open
O	to
O	me
O	Know
O	you
O	what
O	yesterday
O	You
O	promised
O	me
O	By
O	the
O	cool
O	water
O	Youngest
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	Open
O	to
O	me
O	Then
O	said
O	the
C	king
O	What
O	you
O	promised
O	you
O	must
O	perform
O	Go
O	and
O	open
O	the
O	door
O	She
O	went
O	and
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	the
C	frog
O	hopped
O	in
O	always
O	following
O	and
O	following
O	her
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	chair
O	There
O	he
O	sat
O	and
O	cried
O	out
O	Lift
O	me
O	up
O	to
O	you
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	She
O	refused
O	till
O	the
C	king
O	her
O	father
O	commanded
O	her
O	to
O	do
O	it
O	When
O	the
C	frog
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	he
O	said
O	Now
O	push
O	your
O	little
O	golden
O	plate
O	nearer
O	to
O	me
O	that
O	we
O	may
O	eat
O	together
O	She
O	did
O	as
O	he
O	desired
O	but
O	one
O	could
O	easily
O	see
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	it
O	unwillingly
O	The
C	frog
O	seemed
O	to
O	enjoy
O	his
O	dinner
O	very
O	much
O	but
O	every
O	morsel
O	she
O	ate
O	stuck
O	in
O	the
O	throat
O	of
O	the
O	poor
O	little
O	princess
O	Then
O	said
O	the
C	frog
O	I
O	have
O	eaten
O	enough
O	and
O	am
O	tired
O	carry
O	me
O	to
O	your
O	little
O	room
O	and
O	make
O	your
O	little
O	silken
O	bed
O	smooth
O	and
O	we
O	will
O	lay
O	ourselves
O	down
O	to
O	sleep
O	together
O	At
O	this
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	the
O	cold
C	frog
O	who
O	wanted
O	to
O	sleep
O	in
O	her
O	pretty
O	clean
O	bed
O	But
O	the
C	king
O	looked
O	angrily
O	at
O	her
O	and
O	said
O	again
O	What
O	you
O	have
O	promised
O	you
O	must
O	perform
O	The
C	frog
O	is
O	your
O	companion
O	It
O	was
O	no
O	use
O	to
O	complain
O	whether
O	she
O	liked
O	it
O	or
O	not
O	she
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	take
O	the
C	frog
O	with
O	her
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	little
O	bed
O	So
O	she
O	picked
O	him
O	up
O	with
O	two
O	fingers
O	hating
O	him
O	bitterly
O	the
O	while
O	and
O	carried
O	him
O	upstairs
O	but
O	when
O	she
O	got
O	into
O	bed
O	instead
O	of
O	lifting
O	him
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	she
O	threw
O	him
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	strength
O	against
O	the
O	wall
O	saying
O	Now
O	you
O	nasty
C	frog
O	there
O	will
O	be
O	an
O	end
O	of
O	you
O	But
O	what
O	fell
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	wall
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	dead
C	frog
O	but
O	a
O	living
O	young
O	prince
O	with
O	beautiful
O	and
O	loving
O	eyes
O	who
O	at
O	once
O	became
O	by
O	her
O	own
O	promise
O	and
O	her
O	father
O	s
O	will
O	her
O	dear
O	companion
O	and
O	husband
O	He
O	told
O	her
O	how
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	cursed
O	by
O	a
O	wicked
O	sorceress
O	and
O	that
O	no
O	one
O	but
O	the
C	king
O	s
O	youngest
O	daughter
O	could
O	release
O	him
O	from
O	his
O	enchantment
O	and
O	take
O	him
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	well
O	The
O	next
O	day
O	a
O	carriage
O	drove
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	with
O	eight
O	white
O	horses
O	having
O	white
O	feathers
O	on
O	their
O	heads
O	and
O	golden
O	reins
O	Behind
O	it
O	stood
O	the
O	servant
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	prince
O	called
O	the
C	Faithful
C	Henry
O	This
C	Faithful
C	Henry
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	grieved
O	when
O	his
O	master
O	was
O	changed
O	into
O	a
C	frog
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	compelled
O	to
O	have
O	three
O	iron
O	bands
O	fastened
O	round
O	his
O	heart
O	lest
O	it
O	should
O	break
O	Now
O	the
O	carriage
O	came
O	to
O	convey
O	the
O	prince
O	to
O	his
O	kingdom
O	so
O	the
C	Faithful
C	Henry
O	lifted
O	in
O	the
O	bride
O	and
O	bridegroom
O	and
O	mounted
O	behind
O	full
O	of
O	joy
O	at
O	his
O	lord
O	s
O	release
O	But
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	gone
O	a
O	short
O	distance
O	the
O	prince
O	heard
O	behind
O	him
O	a
O	noise
O	as
O	if
O	something
O	was
O	breaking
O	He
O	turned
O	round
O	and
O	cried
O	out
C	Henry
O	the
O	carriage
O	is
O	breaking
O	But
C	Henry
O	replied
O	No
O	sir
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	the
O	carriage
O	but
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	bands
O	from
O	my
O	heart
O	with
O	which
O	I
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	bind
O	it
O	up
O	or
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	broken
O	with
O	grief
O	while
O	you
O	sat
O	as
O	a
C	frog
O	at
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	well
O	Twice
O	again
O	this
O	happened
O	and
O	the
O	prince
O	always
O	thought
O	the
O	carriage
O	was
O	breaking
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	only
O	the
O	bands
O	breaking
O	off
O	from
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
C	Faithful
C	Henry
O	out
O	of
O	joy
O	that
O	his

O	of

O	had
O	escaped

O	one

O	a

O	match
O	into

C	queen
O	so
O	grand
O	and
O	tall
O	Thou
O	art
O	the
O	fairest
O	of
O	them
O	all
O	And
O	she
O	was
O	satisfied
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	the
C	mirror
O	always
O	told
O	the
O	truth
O	But
C	Snowdrop
O	grew
O	ever
O	taller
O	and
O	fairer
O	and
O	at
O	seven
O	years
O	old
O	was
O	beautiful
O	as
O	the
O	day
O	and
O	more
O	beautiful
O	than
O	the
C	queen
O	herself
O	So
O	once
O	when
O	the
C	queen
O	asked
O	of
O	her
C	mirror
O	Little
O	glass
O	upon
O	the
O	wall
O	Who
O	is
O	fairest
O	among
O	us
O	all
O	it
O	answered
O	Lady
C	queen
O	you
O	are
O	grand
O	and
O	tall
O	But
C	Snowdrop
O	is
O	fairest
O	of
O	you
O	all
O	Then
O	the
C	queen
O	was
O	startled
O	and
O	turned
O	yellow
O	and
O	green
O	with
O	envy
O	From
O	that
O	hour
O	she
O	so
O	hated
C	Snowdrop
O	that
O	she
O	burned
O	with
O	secret
O	wrath
O	whenever
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	maiden
O	Pride
O	and
O	envy
O	grew
O	apace
O	like
O	weeds
O	in
O	her
O	heart
O	till
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	rest
O	day
O	or
O	night
O	So
O	she
O	called
O	a
C	huntsman
O	and
O	said
O	Take
O	the
O	child
O	out
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	for
O	I
O	will
O	endure
O	her
O	no
O	longer
O	in
O	my
O	sight
O	Kill
O	her
O	and
O	bring
O	me
O	her
O	lungs
O	and
O	liver
O	as
O	tokens
O	that
O	you
O	have
O	done
O	it
O	The
C	huntsman
O	obeyed
O	and
O	led
O	the
O	child
O	away
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	drawn
O	his
O	and
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	pierce
C	Snowdrop
O	s
O	innocent
O	heart
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	and
O	said
O	Ah
O	dear
C	huntsman
O	spare
O	my
O	life
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	run
O	deep
O	into
O	the
O	wild
O	forest
O	and
O	never
O	more
O	come
O	home
O	The
C	huntsman
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	her
O	because
O	she
O	looked
O	so
O	lovely
O	and
O	said
O	Run
O	away
O	then
O	poor
O	child
O	The
O	wild
O	beasts
O	will
O	soon
O	make
O	an
O	end
O	of
O	thee
O	he
O	thought
O	but
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	a
O	stone
O	had
O	been
O	rolled
O	from
O	his
O	heart
O	because
O	he
O	had
O	avoided
O	taking
O	her
O	life
O	and
O	as
O	a
O	little
O	bear
O	came
O	by
O	just
O	then
O	he
O	killed
O	it
O	took
O	out
O	its
O	liver
O	and
O	lungs
O	and
O	carried
O	them
O	as
O	tokens
O	to
O	the
C	queen
O	She
O	made
O	the
O	cook
O	dress
O	them
O	with
O	salt
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	wicked
O	woman
O	ate
O	them
O	and
O	thought
O	she
O	had
O	eaten
O	Snowdrop
O	s
O	lungs
O	and
O	liver
O	The
O	poor
O	child
O	was
O	now
O	all
O	alone
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	forest
O	and
O	she
O	felt
O	frightened
O	as
O	she
O	looked
O	at
O	all
O	the
O	leafy
O	trees
O	and
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	So
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	run
O	and
O	ran
O	over
O	the
O	sharp
O	stones
O	and
O	through
O	the
O	thorns
O	and
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	passed
O	close
O	to
O	her
O	but
O	did
O	her
O	no
O	harm
O	She
O	ran
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	her
O	feet
O	could
O	carry
O	her
O	and
O	when
O	evening
O	closed
O	in
O	she
O	saw
O	a
O	little
O	house
O	and
O	went
O	into
O	it
O	to
O	rest
O	herself
O	Everything
O	in
O	the
O	house
O	was
O	very
O	small
O	but
O	I
O	cannot
O	tell
O	you
O	how
O	pretty
O	and
O	clean
O	it
O	was
O	There
O	stood
O	a
O	little
O	table
O	covered
O	with
O	a
O	white
O	tablecloth
O	on
O	which
O	were
O	seven
O	little
O	plates
O	each
O	little
O	plate
O	with
O	its
O	own
O	little
O	spoon
O	also
O	seven
O	little
O	knives
O	and
O	forks
O	and
O	seven
O	little
O	cups
O	Round
O	the
O	walls
O	stood
O	seven
O	little
O	beds
O	close
O	together
O	with
O	sheets
O	as
O	white
O	as
O	snow
C	Snowdrop
O	being
O	so
O	hungry
O	and
O	thirsty
O	ate
O	a
O	little
O	of
O	the
O	vegetables
O	and
O	bread
O	on
O	each
O	plate
O	and
O	drank
O	a
O	drop
O	of
O	wine
O	from
O	every
O	cup
O	for
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	like
O	to
O	empty
O	one
O	entirely
O	Then
O	being
O	very
O	tired
O	she
O	laid
O	herself
O	down
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	beds
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	make
O	herself
O	comfortable
O	for
O	one
O	was
O	too
O	long
O	and
O	another
O	too
O	short
O	The
O	seventh
O	luckily
O	was
O	just
O	right
O	so
O	there
O	she
O	stayed
O	said
O	her
O	prayers
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	grown
O	quite
O	dark
O	home
O	came
O	the
O	masters
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	seven
C	dwarfs
O	who
O	delved
O	and
O	mined
O	for
O	iron
O	among
O	the
O	mountains
O	They
O	lighted
O	their
O	seven
O	candles
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	light
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen
O	they
O	saw
O	that
O	some
O	one
O	had
O	been
O	there
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	quite
O	so
O	orderly
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	left
O	it
O	The
O	first
O	said
O	Who
O	has
O	been
O	sitting
O	on
O	my
O	stool
O	The
O	second
O	Who
O	has
O	eaten
O	off
O	my
O	plate
O	The
O	third
O	Who
O	has
O	taken
O	part
O	of
O	my
O	loaf
O	The
O	fourth
O	Who
O	has
O	touched
O	my
O	vegetables
O	The
O	fifth
O	Who
O	has
O	used
O	my
O	fork
O	The
O	sixth
O	Who
O	has
O	cut
O	with
O	my
O	knife
O	The
O	seventh
O	Who
O	has
O	drunk
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	little
O	cup
O	Then
O	the
O	first
C	dwarf
O	looked
O	about
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	slight
O	hollow
O	in
O	his
O	bed
O	so
O	he
O	asked
O	Who
O	has
O	been
O	lying
O	in
O	my
O	little
O	bed
O	The
O	others
O	came
O	running
O	and
O	each
O	called
O	out
O	Some
O	one
O	has
O	also
O	been
O	lying
O	in
O	my
O	bed
O	But
O	the
O	seventh
O	when
O	he
O	looked
O	in
O	his
O	bed
O	saw
C	Snowdrop
O	there
O	fast
O	asleep
O	He
O	called
O	the
O	others
O	who
O	flocked
O	round
O	with
O	cries
O	of
O	surprise
O	fetched
O	their
O	seven
O	candles
O	and
O	cast
O	the
O	light
O	on
C	Snowdrop
O	Oh
O	heaven
O	they
O	cried
O	what
O	a
O	lovely
O	child
O	and
O	were
O	so
O	pleased
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	wake
O	her
O	but
O	let
O	her
O	sleep
O	on
O	in
O	the
O	little
O	bed
O	The
O	seventh
C	dwarf
O	slept
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	companions
O	in
O	turn
O	an
O	hour
O	with
O	each
O	and
O	so
O	they
O	spent
O	the
O	night
O	When
O	it
O	was
O	morning
C	Snowdrop
O	woke
O	up
O	and
O	was
O	frightened
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	seven
C	dwarfs
O	They
O	were
O	very
O	friendly
O	however
O	and
O	inquired
O	her
O	name
C	Snowdrop
O	answered
O	she
O	How
O	have
O	you
O	found
O	your
O	way
O	to
O	our
O	house
O	further
O	asked
O	the
C	dwarfs
O	So
O	she
O	told
O	them
O	how
O	her
C	stepmother
O	had
O	tried
O	to
O	kill
O	her
O	how
O	the
C	huntsman
O	had
O	spared
O	her
O	life
O	and
O	how
O	she
O	had
O	run
O	the
O	whole
O	day
O	through
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	had
O	found
O	their
O	little
O	house
O	Then
O	the
C	dwarfs
O	said
O	If
O	thou
O	wilt
O	keep
O	our
O	house
O	cook
O	make
O	the
O	beds
O	wash

O	for
O	nothing
O	I
O	will
O	right
O	willingly
O	said
C	Snowdrop
O	So
O	she
O	dwelt
O	with
O	them
O	and
O	kept
O	their
O	house
O	in
O	order
O	Every
O	morning
O	they
O	went
O	out
O	among
O	the

O	to

O	and
O	came
O	home
O	ready
O	for

O	so
O	she
O	walked
O	up

O	she
O	felt
O	sure
O	that

O	had
O	deceived
O	her
O	and
O	that
C	Snowdrop
O	was
O	still

O	in
O	the

O	they
O	found
C	Snowdrop
O	lying
O	breathless
O	and
O	motionless
O	on
O	the

O	They
O	lifted
O	her
O	up
O	searched
O	whether
O	she
O	had
O	anything
O	poisonous
O	about
O	her
O	unlaced
O	her
O	combed
O	her

O	for
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	bring
O	the

O	back
O	to

O	They
O	laid
O	her
O	on
O	a
O	bier
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	seven
O	placed
O	themselves
O	round
O	it
O	and
O	mourned
O	for
O	her
O	three
O	long
O	days
O	Then
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	buried
O	her
O	but
O	that

O	still
O	looked
O	so
O	fresh
O	and
O	and
O	had
O	such
O	lovely
O	rosy
O	cheeks
O	We
O	cannot
O	lower
O	her
O	into
O	the
O	dark
O	earth
O	said
O	they
O	and
O	caused
O	a
O	transparent
O	coffin
O	of
O	glass
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	be
O	seen
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	and
O	laid
O	her
O	in
O	it
O	writing
O	her
O	name
O	outside
O	in
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	which
O	told
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	a
C	king
O	Then
O	they
O	placed
O	the
O	coffin
O	on
O	the
O	mountain
O	above
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	always
O	stayed
O	by
O	it
O	and
O	guarded
O	it
O	But
O	there
O	was
O	little
O	need
O	to
O	guard
O	it
O	for
O	even
O	the
O	wild
O	animals
O	came
O	and
O	mourned
O	for
C	Snowdrop
O	the
O	birds
O	likewise
O	first
O	an
O	owl
O	and
O	then
O	a
O	raven
O	and
O	afterwards
O	a
O	dove
O	Long
O	long
O	years
O	did
C	Snowdrop
O	lie
O	in
O	her
O	coffin
O	unchanged
O	looking
O	as
O	though
O	asleep
O	for

O	white
O	as
O	snow
O	red
O	as
O	blood
O	and
O	her
O	hair
O	was
O	black
O	as
O	ebony
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	a
C	king
O	chanced
O	to
O	wander
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	dwarf
O	s
O	house
O	for
O	a
O	night
O	s
O	shelter
O	He
O	saw
O	the
O	coffin
O	on
O	the
O	mountain
O	with
O	the
O	beautiful
C	Snowdrop
O	in
O	it
O	and
O	read
O	what
O	was
O	written
O	there
O	in
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	Then
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	the
C	dwarfs
O	Let
O	me
O	have
O	the
O	coffin
O	I
O	will
O	give
O	you
O	whatever
O	you
O	like
O	to
O	ask
O	for
O	it
O	But
O	the
C	dwarfs
O	answered
O	We
O	would
O	not
O	part
O	with
O	it
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	gold
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	He
O	said
O	again
O	Yet
O	give
O	it
O	me
O	for
O	I
O	cannot
O	live
O	without
O	seeing
C	Snowdrop
O	and
O	though
O	she
O	is
O	dead
O	I
O	will
O	prize
O	and
O	honour
O	her
O	as
O	my
O	beloved
O	Then
O	the
O	good
C	dwarfs
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	him
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	the
O	coffin
O	The
C	prince
O	had
O	it
O	borne
O	away
O	by
O	his
O	servants
O	They
O	happened
O	to
O	stumble
O	over
O	a
O	bush
O	and
O	the
O	shock
O	forced
O	the
O	bit
O	of
O	poisoned
O	apple
O	which
C	Snowdrop
O	had
O	tasted
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	throat
O	Immediately
O	she
O	opened
O	her
O	eyes
O	raised
O	the

O	sat
O	up
O	alive
O	once
O	more
O	Oh
O	heaven
O	cried
O	she
O	where

O	The
C	prince
O	answered
O	joyfully
O	Thou
O	art
O	with

O	and
O	told
O	her
O	what
