O	Long

O	a
O	monarch

O	a
O	very
O	honest
O	man
O	that
O	his
O	subjects
O	entitled
O	him
O	the
C	Good
C	King
O	One
O	day
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	out
O	hunting
O	a
O	little
O	white
O	rabbit
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	half
O	killed
O	by
O	his
O	hounds
O	leaped
O	right
O	into
O	his
O	majesty
O	s
O	arms
O	Said
O	he
O	caressing
O	it
O	This
O	poor
O	creature
O	has
O	put
O	itself
O	under
O	my
O	protection
O	and
O	I
O	will
O	allow
O	no
O	one
O	to
O	injure
O	it
O	So
O	he
O	carried
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	palace
O	had
O	prepared
O	for
O	it
O	a
O	neat
O	little
O	with
O	abundance
O	of
O	the
O	daintiest
O	food
O	such
O	as
O	rabbits
O	love
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	left
O	it
O	The
O	same
O	night
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	alone
O	in
O	his
O	chamber
O	there
O	appeared
O	to
O	him
O	a
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	She
O	was
O	dressed
O	neither
O	in
O	gold
O	nor
O	silver
O	nor
O	brocade
O	but
O	her
O	flowing
O	robes
O	were
O	white
O	as
O	snow
O	and
O	she
O	wore
O	a
O	garland
O	of
O	white
O	roses
O	on
O	her
O	head
O	The
C	Good
C	King
O	was
O	greatly
O	astonished
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	for
O	his
O	door
O	was
O	locked
O	and
O	he
O	wondered
O	how
O	so
O	dazzling
O	a
O	lady
O	could
O	possibly
O	enter
O	but
O	she
O	soon
O	removed
O	his
O	doubts
O	I
O	am
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Candide
O	said
O	she
O	with
O	a
O	smiling
O	and
O	gracious
O	air
O	Passing
O	through
O	the
O	wood
O	where
O	you
O	were
O	hunting
O	I
O	took
O	a
O	desire
O	to
O	know
O	if
O	you
O	were
O	as
O	good
O	as
O	men
O	say
O	you
O	are
O	I
O	therefore
O	changed
O	myself
O	into
O	a
O	white
O	rabbit
O	and
O	took
O	refuge
O	in
O	your
O	arms
O	You
O	saved
O	me
O	and
O	now
O	I
O	know
O	that
O	those
O	who
O	are
O	merciful
O	to
O	dumb

O	will

O	You

O	said

C	king
O	sighing
O	Still
O	he
O	felt
O	that
O	the
O	kindness
O	of
O	a
O	fairy
O	was
O	something
O	gained
O	for
O	his
O	son
O	and
O	died
O	not
O	long
O	after
O	content
O	and
O	at
O	peace
C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	mourned
O	deeply
O	for
O	he
O	dearly
O	loved
O	his
O	father
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	gladly
O	given
O	all
O	his
O	kingdoms
O	and
O	treasures
O	to
O	keep
O	him
O	in
O	life
O	a
O	little
O	longer
O	Two
O	days
O	after
O	the
C	Good
C	King
O	was
O	no
O	more
C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	was
O	sleeping
O	in
O	his
O	chamber
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	same
O	dazzling
O	vision
O	of
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Candide
O	I
O	promised
O	your
O	father
O	said
O	she
O	to
O	be
O	your
O	best
O	friend
O	and
O	in
O	pledge
O	of
O	this
O	take
O	what
O	I
O	now
O	give
O	you
O	and
O	she
O	placed
O	a
O	small
O	gold
O	ring
O	upon
O	his
O	finger
O	Poor
O	as
O	it
O	looks
O	it
O	is
O	more
O	precious
O	than
O	diamonds
O	for
O	whenever
O	you
O	do
O	ill
O	it
O	will
O	prick
O	your
O	finger
O	If
O	after
O	that
O	warning
O	you
O	still
O	continue
O	in
O	evil
O	you
O	will
O	lose
O	my
O	friendship
O	and
O	I
O	shall
O	become
O	your
O	direst
O	enemy
O	So
O	saying
O	she
O	disappeared
O	leaving
C	Cherry
O	in
O	such
O	amazement
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	believed
O	it
O	all
O	a
O	dream
O	save
O	for
O	the
O	ring
O	on
O	his
O	finger
O	He
O	was
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	so
O	good
O	that
O	the
O	ring
O	never
O	pricked
O	him
O	at
O	all
O	and
O	this
O	made
O	him
O	so
O	cheerful
O	and
O	pleasant
O	in
O	his
O	humour
O	that
O	everybody
O	called
O	him
O	Happy
C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	But
O	one
O	unlucky
O	day
O	he
O	was
O	out
O	hunting
O	and
O	found
O	no
O	sport
O	which
O	vexed
O	him
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	showed
O	his
O	ill
O	temper
O	by
O	his
O	looks
O	and
O	ways
O	He
O	fancied
O	his
O	ring
O	felt
O	very
O	tight
O	and
O	uncomfortable
O	but
O	as
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	prick
O	him
O	he
O	took
O	no
O	heed
O	of
O	this
O	until
O	his
O	palace
O	his
O	little
O	pet
C	dog
C	Bibi
O	jumped
O	up
O	upon
O	him
O	and
O	was
O	sharply
O	told
O	to
O	get
O	away
O	The
O	creature
O	accustomed
O	to
O	nothing
O	but
O	caresses
O	tried
O	to
O	attract
O	his
O	attention
O	by
O	pulling
O	at
O	his
O	garments
O	when
C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	turned
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	a
O	severe
O	kick
O	At
O	this
O	moment
O	he
O	felt
O	in
O	his
O	finger
O	a
O	prick
O	like
O	a
O	pin
O	What
O	nonsense
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	himself
O	The
O	fairy
O	must
O	be
O	making
O	game
O	of
O	me
O	Why
O	what
O	great
O	evil
O	have
O	I
O	done
O	I
O	the
O	master
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	empire
O	cannot
O	I
O	kick
O	my
O	own
C	dog
O	A
O	voice
O	replied
O	or
O	else
C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	imagined
O	it
O	No
O	sire
O	the
O	master
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	empire
O	has
O	a
O	right
O	to
O	do
O	good
O	but
O	not
O	evil
O	I
O	a
O	fairy
O	am
O	as
O	much
O	above
O	you
O	as
O	you
O	are
O	above
O	your
C	dog
O	I
O	might
O	punish
O	you
O	kill
O	you
O	if
O	I
O	chose
O	but
O	I
O	prefer
O	leaving
O	you
O	to
O	amend
O	your
O	ways
O	You
O	have
O	been
O	guilty
O	of
O	three
O	faults
O	bad
O	temper
O	passion
O	cruelty
O	do
O	better
O	The
C	Prince
O	promised
O	and
O	kept
O	his
O	word
O	awhile
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	brought
O	up
O	by
O	a
O	foolish
O	nurse
O	who
O	indulged
O	him
O	in
O	every
O	way
O	and
O	was
O	always
O	telling
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	a
C	king
O	one
O	day
O	when
O	he
O	might
O	do
O	as
O	he
O	liked
O	in
O	all
O	things
O	He
O	found
O	out
O	now
O	that
O	even
O	a
C	king
O	cannot
O	always
O	do
O	that
O	it
O	vexed
O	him
O	and
O	made
O	him
O	angry
O	His
O	ring
O	began
O	to
O	prick
O	him
O	so
O	often
O	that
O	his
O	little
O	finger
O	was
O	continually
O	bleeding
O	He
O	disliked
O	this
O	as
O	was
O	natural
O	and
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	consider
O	whether
O	it
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	easier
O	to
O	throw
O	the
O	ring
O	away
O	altogether
O	than
O	to
O	be
O	constantly
O	annoyed
O	by
O	it
O	It
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	queer
O	thing
O	for
O	a
C	king
O	to
O	have
O	always
O	a
O	spot
O	of
O	blood
O	on
O	his
O	finger
O	At
O	last
O	unable
O	to
O	put
O	up
O	with
O	it
O	any
O	more
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	ring
O	off
O	and
O	hid
O	it
O	where
O	he
O	would
O	never
O	see
O	it
O	and
O	believed
O	himself
O	the
O	happiest
O	of
O	men
O	for
O	he
O	could
O	now
O	do
O	exactly
O	what
O	he
O	liked
O	He
O	did
O	it
O	and
O	became
O	every
O	day
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	miserable
O	One
O	day
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	young
O	girl
O	so
O	beautiful
O	that
O	being
O	always
O	accustomed
O	to
O	have
O	his
O	own
O	way
O	he
O	immediately
O	determined
O	to
O	espouse
O	her
O	He
O	never
O	doubted
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	only
O	too
O	glad
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	a
C	queen
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	very
O	poor
O	But
C	Zelia
O	was
O	her
O	name
O	answered
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	astonishment
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	rather
O	not
O	marry
O	him
O	Do
O	I
O	displease
O	you
O	asked
O	the
C	Prince
O	into
O	whose
O	mind
O	it
O	had
O	never
O	entered
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	displease
O	anybody
O	Not
O	at
O	all
O	my
C	Prince
O	said
O	the
O	honest
O	You
O	are
O	very
O	handsome
O	very
O	charming
O	but
O	you
O	are
O	not
O	like
O	your
O	father
O	the
C	Good
C	King
O	I
O	will
O	not
O	be
O	your
C	queen
O	for
O	you
O	would
O	make
O	me
O	miserable
O	At
O	these
O	words
O	the
O	prince
O	s
O	love
O	seemed
O	all
O	to
O	turn
O	to
O	hatred
O	he
O	gave
O	orders
O	to
O	his
O	guards
O	to
O	convey
C	Zelia
O	to
O	a
O	prison
O	near
O	the
O	palace
O	and
O	then
O	took
O	counsel
O	with
O	his
O	foster
O	brother
O	the
O	one
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	ill
O	companions
O	who
O	most
O	incited
O	him
O	to
O	do
O	wrong
O	Sir
O	said
O	this
O	man
O	if
O	I
O	were
O	in
O	your
O	majesty
O	s
O	place
O	I
O	would
O	never
O	vex
O	myself
O	about
O	a
O	poor
O	silly
O	girl
O	Feed
O	her
O	on
O	bread
O	and
O	water
O	till
O	she
O	comes
O	to
O	her
O	senses
O	and
O	if
O	she
O	still
O	refuses
O	you
O	let
O	her
O	die
O	in
O	torment
O	as
O	a
O	warning
O	to
O	your
O	other
O	subjects
O	should
O	they
O	venture
O	to
O	dispute
O	your
O	will
O	You
O	will
O	be
O	disgraced
O	should
O	you
O	suffer
O	yourself
O	to
O	be
O	conquered
O	by
O	a
O	simple
O	girl
O	But
O	said
C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	shall
O	I
O	not
O	be
O	disgraced
O	if
O	I
O	harm
O	a
O	creature
O	so
O	perfectly
O	innocent
O	No
O	one
O	is
O	innocent
O	who
O	disputes
O	your
O	majesty
O	s
O	authority
O	said
O	the
O	courtier
O	bowing
O	and
O	it
O	is
O	better
O	to
O	commit
O	an
O	injustice
O	than
O	allow
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	supposed
O	you
O	can
O	ever
O	be
O	contradicted
O	with
O	impunity
O	This
O	touched
C	Cherry
O	on
O	his
O	weak
O	point
O	his
O	good
O	impulses
O	faded
O	he
O	resolved
O	once
O	more
O	to
O	ask
C	Zelia
O	if
O	she
O	would
O	marry
O	him
O	and
O	if
O	she
O	again
O	refused
O	to
O	sell
O	her
O	as
O	a
O	slave
O	Arrived
O	at
O	the
O	cell
O	in
O	which
O	she
O	was
O	confined
O	what
O	was
O	his
O	astonishment
O	to
O	find
O	her
O	gone
O	He
O	knew
O	not
O	who
O	to
O	accuse
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	kept
O	the
O	key
O	in
O	his
O	pocket
O	the
O	whole
O	time
O	At
O	last
O	the
O	suggested
O	that
O	the
O	escape
O	of
C	Zelia
O	might
O	have
O	been
O	contrived
O	by
O	an
O	old
O	man
C	Suliman
O	by
O	name
O	the
O	prince
O	s
O	former
O	tutor
O	who
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	one
O	who
O	now
O	ventured
O	to
O	blame
O	him
O	for
O	anything
O	that
O	he
O	did
C	Cherry
O	sent
O	immediately
O	and
O	ordered
O	his
O	old
O	friend
O	to
O	be
O	brought
O	to
O	him
O	loaded
O	heavily
O	with
O	irons
O	Then
O	full
O	of
O	fury
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	shut
O	himself
O	up
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	chamber
O	where
O	he
O	went
O	raging
O	to
O	and
O	fro
O	till
O	startled
O	by
O	a
O	noise
O	like
O	a
O	clap
O	of
O	thunder
O	The
C	Fairy
C	Candide

O	before
O	him

O	in
O	a
O	severe
O	voice
O	I
O	promised

O	to
O	give

O	a

O	heard
O	these

O	to
O	his
O	horror
O	he
O	found

O	transformed
O	into
O	what

O	He
O	was

O	At
O	the

O	distant
O	forest
O	where
O	standing
O	on
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	a
O	stream
O	he
O	saw
O	reflected
O	in
O	the

O	his
O	own
O	frightful
O	shape
O	and
O	heard
O	a

O	Look
O	at

O	and
O	know
O	thy
O	soul
O	has
O	become
O	a
O	thousand

C	Cherry
O	recognised
O	the
O	voice
O	of

O	and
O	in
O	his
O	rage
O	would
O	have
O	sprung
O	upon

O	and
O	devoured
O	her
O	but
O	he
O	saw
O	nothing
O	and
O	the

O	voice
O	said
O	behind
O	him
O	Cease
O	thy

O	to

O	of

O	along
O	with
O	them
O	to
O	the

O	of

O	There
O	great
O	rejoicings
O	were

O	and
O	the
O	asking
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	about
O	were
O	told
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	because
C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	the
O	torment
O	of
O	his
O	subjects
O	had
O	just
O	been
O	struck
O	dead
O	by
O	a

O	just
O	punishment
O	of
O	all
O	his
O	crimes
O	Four
O	courtiers
O	his

O	had
O	wished
O	to
O	divide
O	his
O	throne
O	between

O	but
O	the
O	people
O	had
O	risen
O	up
O	against
O	them
O	and
O	offered
O	the
O	crown
O	to
C	Suliman
O	the
O	old
O	tutor
O	whom
C	Cherry
O	had
O	ordered
O	to
O	be
O	arrested
O	All
O	this
O	the
O	poor
O	monster
O	heard
O	He
O	even
O	saw
C	Suliman
O	sitting
O	upon
O	his
O	own
O	throne
O	and
O	trying
O	to
O	calm
O	the
O	populace
O	by
O	representing
O	to
O	them
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not

C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	was
O	dead
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	return
O	one
O	day
O	to
O	with
O	honour
O	the
O	crown
O	which
C	Suliman
O	only
O	consented
O	to
O	wear
O	as
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	viceroy
O	I
O	know
O	his
O	heart
O	said
O	the
O	honest
O	and
O	faithful
O	old
O	man
O	it
O	is
O	tainted
O	but
O	not
O	corrupt
O	If
O	alive
O	he
O	may
O	reform
O	yet
O	and
O	be
O	all
O	his
O	father
O	over
O	again
O	to
O	you
O	his
O	people
O	whom
O	he
O	has
O	caused
O	to
O	suffer
O	so
O	much
O	These
O	words
O	touched
O	the
O	poor
O	beast
O	so
O	deeply
O	that
O	he
O	ceased
O	to
O	beat
O	himself
O	against
O	the
O	iron
O	bars
O	of
O	the
O	cage
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	hunters
O	carried
O	him
O	about
O	became
O	gentle
O	as
O	a
O	lamb
O	and
O	suffered
O	himself
O	to
O	be
O	taken
O	quietly
O	to
O	a
O	menagerie
O	where
O	were
O	kept
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	strange
O	and
O	ferocious
O	animals
O	a
O	place
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	himself
O	often
O	visited
O	as
O	a
O	boy
O	but
O	never
O	thought
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	shut
O	up
O	there
O	himself
O	However
O	he
O	owned
O	he
O	had
O	deserved
O	it
O	all
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	make
O	amends
O	by
O	showing
O	himself
O	very
O	obedient
O	to
O	his
O	keeper
O	This
O	man
O	was
O	almost
O	as
O	great
O	a
O	brute
O	as
O	the
O	animals
O	he
O	had
O	charge
O	of
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	ill
O	humour
O	he
O	used
O	to
O	beat
O	them
O	without
O	rhyme
O	or
O	reason
O	One
O	day
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	sleeping
O	a
O	tiger
O	broke
O	loose
O	and
O	leaped
O	upon
O	him
O	eager
O	to
O	devour
O	him
C	Cherry
O	at
O	first
O	felt
O	a
O	thrill
O	of
O	pleasure
O	at
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	being
O	revenged
O	then
O	seeing
O	how
O	helpless
O	the
O	man
O	was
O	he
O	wished
O	himself
O	free
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	defend
O	him
O	Immediately
O	the
O	doors
O	of
O	his
O	cage
O	opened
O	The
O	keeper
O	waking
O	up
O	saw
O	the
O	strange
O	beast
O	leap
O	out
O	and
O	imagined
O	of
O	course
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	be
O	slain
O	at
O	once
O	Instead
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	tiger
O	lying
O	dead
O	and
O	the
O	strange
O	beast
O	creeping
O	up
O	and
O	laying
O	itself
O	at
O	his
O	feet
O	to
O	be
O	caressed
O	But
O	as
O	he
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	stroke
O	it
O	a
O	voice
O	was
O	heard
O	saying
O	Good
O	actions
O	never
O	go
O	unrewarded
O	and
O	instead
O	of
O	the
O	frightful
O	monster
O	there
O	crouched
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	nothing
O	but
O	a
O	pretty
O	little
C	dog
C	Cherry
O	delighted
O	to
O	find
O	himself
O	thus
O	metamorphosed
O	caressed
O	the
O	keeper
O	in
O	every
O	possible
O	way
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	man
O	took
O	him
O	up
O	into
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	carried
O	him
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	related
O	this
O	wonderful
O	story
O	from
O	beginning
O	to
O	end
O	The
C	queen
O	wished
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	charming
O	little
C	dog
O	and
C	Cherry
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	exceedingly
O	happy
O	could
O	he
O	have
O	forgotten
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	originally
O	a
O	man
O	and
O	a
C	king
O	He
O	was
O	lodged
O	most
O	elegantly
O	had
O	the
O	richest
O	of
O	collars
O	to
O	adorn
O	his
O	neck
O	and
O	heard
O	himself
O	praised
O	continually
O	But
O	his
O	beauty
O	rather
O	brought
O	him
O	into
O	trouble
O	for
O	the
C	queen
O	afraid
O	lest
O	he
O	might
O	grow
O	too
O	large
O	for
O	a
O	pet
O	took
O	advice
O	of
O	who
O	ordered
O	that
O	he
O	should
O	be
O	fed
O	entirely
O	upon
O	bread
O	and
O	that
O	very
O	sparingly
O	so
O	poor
C	Cherry
O	was
O	sometimes
O	nearly
O	starved
O	One
O	day
O	when
O	they
O	gave
O	him
O	his
O	crust
O	for
O	breakfast
O	a
O	fancy
O	seized
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	eat
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	so
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	bread
O	in
O	his
O	mouth
O	and
O	trotted
O	away
O	towards
O	a
O	stream
O	which
O	he
O	knew
O	and
O	where
O	he
O	sometimes
O	stopped
O	to
O	drink
O	But
O	instead
O	of
O	the
O	stream
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	splendid
O	palace
O	glittering
O	with
O	gold
O	and
O	precious
O	stones
O	Entering
O	the
O	doors
O	was
O	a
O	crowd
O	of
O	men
O	and
O	women
O	magnificently
O	dressed
O	and
O	within
O	there
O	was
O	singing
O	and
O	dancing
O	and
O	good
O	cheer
O	of
O	all
O	sorts
O	Yet
O	however
O	grandly
O	and
O	gaily
O	the
O	people
O	went
O	in
C	Cherry
O	noticed
O	that
O	those
O	who
O	came
O	out
O	were
O	pale
O	thin
O	ragged
O	covered
O	with
O	wounds
O	and
O	sores
O	Some
O	of
O	them
O	dropped
O	dead
O	at
O	once
O	others
O	dragged
O	themselves
O	on
O	a
O	little
O	way
O	and
O	then
O	lay
O	down
O	dying
O	of
O	hunger
O	and
O	vainly
O	begged
O	a
O	morsel
O	of
O	bread
O	from
O	others
O	who
O	were
O	entering
O	in
O	who
O	never
O	took
O	the
O	least
O	notice
O	of
O	them
C	Cherry
O	perceived
O	one
O	woman
O	who
O	was
O	trying
O	feebly
O	to
O	gather
O	and
O	eat
O	some
O	green
O	herbs
O	Poor
O	thing
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	himself
O	I
O	know
O	what
O	it
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	hungry
O	and
O	I
O	want
O	my
O	breakfast
O	badly
O	enough
O	but
O	still
O	it
O	will
O	not
O	kill
O	me
O	to
O	wait
O	till
O	and
O	my
O	crust
O	may
O	save
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	this
O	poor
O	woman
O	So
O	the
O	little
C	dog
O	ran
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	dropped
O	his
O	bread
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	she
O	picked
O	it
O	up
O	and
O	ate
O	it
O	with
O	avidity
O	Soon
O	she
O	looked
O	quite
O	recovered
O	and
C	Cherry
O	delighted
O	was
O	trotting
O	back
O	again
O	to
O	his
O	kennel
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	loud
O	cries
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	young
O	girl
O	dragged
O	by
O	four
O	men
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	trying
O	to
O	compel
O	her
O	to
O	enter
O	Oh
O	how
O	he
O	wished
O	himself
O	a
O	monster
O	again
O	as
O	when
O	he
O	slew
O	the
O	tiger
O	for
O	the
O	young
O	girl
O	was
O	no
O	other
O	than
O	his
O	beloved
C	Zelia
O	Alas
O	what
O	could
O	a
O	poor
O	little
C	dog
O	do
O	to
O	defend
O	her
O	But
O	he
O	ran
O	forward
O	and
O	barked
O	at
O	the
O	men
O	and
O	bit
O	their
O	heels
O	until
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	chased
O	him
O	away
O	with
O	heavy
O	blows
O	And
O	then
O	he
O	lay
O	down
O	outside
O	the
O	determined
O	to
O	watch
O	and
O	see
O	what
O	had
O	become
O	of
C	Zelia
O	Conscience
O	pricked
O	him
O	now
O	What
O	thought
O	he
O	I
O	am
O	furious
O	against
O	these
O	wicked
O	men
O	who
O	are
O	carrying
O	her
O	away
O	and
O	did
O	I
O	not
O	do
O	the
O	same
O	myself
O	Did
O	I
O	not
O	cast
O	her
O	into
O	prison
O	and
O	intend
O	to
O	sell
O	her
O	as
O	a
O	slave
O	Who
O	knows
O	how
O	much
O	more
O	wickedness
O	I
O	might
O	not
O	have
O	done
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	others
O	if
O	heaven
O	s
O	justice
O	had
O	not
O	stopped
O	me
O	in
O	time
O	While
O	he
O	lay
O	thinking
O	and
O	repenting
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	window
O	open
O	and
O	saw
C	Zelia
O	throw
O	out
O	of
O	it
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	dainty
O	meat
C	Cherry
O	who
O	felt
O	hungry
O	enough
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	was
O	just
O	about
O	to
O	eat
O	it
O	when
O	the
O	woman
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	his
O	crust
O	snatched
O	him
O	up
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	Poor
O	little
O	beast
O	cried
O	she
O	patting
O	him
O	every
O	bit
O	of
O	food
O	in
O	that
O	palace
O	is
O	poisoned
O	you
O	shall
O	not
O	touch
O	a
O	morsel
O	And
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	the
O	voice
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	repeated
O	again
O	Good
O	actions
O	never
O	go
O	unrewarded
O	and
C	Cherry
O	found
O	himself
O	changed
O	into
O	a
O	beautiful
O	little
O	white
O	pigeon
O	He
O	remembered
O	with
O	joy
O	that
O	white
O	was
O	the
O	colour
O	of
O	the
C	Fairy
C	Candide
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	hope
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	taking
O	him
O	into
O	favour
O	again
O	So
O	he
O	stretched
O	his
O	wings
O	delighted
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	now
O	have
O	a
O	chance
O	of
O	approaching
O	his
O	fair
C	Zelia
O	He
O	flew
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	and
O	finding
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	open
O	entered
O	and
O	sought
O	everywhere
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	find
C	Zelia
O	Then
O	in
O	despair
O	he
O	flew
O	out
O	again
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	over
O	the
O	world
O	until
O	he
O	beheld
O	her
O	once
O	more
O	He
O	took
O	flight
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	traversed
O	many
O	countries
O	swiftly
O	as
O	a
O	bird
O	can
O	but
O	found
O	no
O	trace
O	of
O	his
O	beloved
O	At
O	length
O	in
O	a
O	desert
O	sitting
O	beside
O	an
O	old
O	hermit
O	in
O	his
O	cave
O	and
O	partaking
O	with
O	him
O	his
O	frugal
O	repast
C	Cherry
O	saw
O	a
O	poor
O	and
O	recognised
C	Zelia
O	Transported
O	with
O	joy
O	he
O	flew
O	in
O	perched
O	on
O	her
O	shoulder
O	and
O	expressed
O	his
O	delight
O	and
O	affection
O	by
O	a
O	thousand
O	caresses
O	She
O	charmed
O	with
O	the
O	pretty
O	little
O	pigeon
O	caressed
O	it
O	in
O	her
O	turn
O	and
O	promised
O	it
O	that
O	if
O	it
O	would
O	stay
O	with
O	her
O	she
O	would
O	love
O	it
O	always
O	What
O	have
O	you
O	done
C	Zelia
O	said
O	the
O	hermit
O	smiling
O	and
O	while
O	he
O	spoke
O	the
O	white
O	pigeon
O	vanished
O	and
O	there
O	stood
C	Prince
C	Cherry
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	natural
O	form
O	Your
O	enchantment
O	ended
C	Prince
O	when
C	Zelia
O	promised
O	to

O	lived
O	in

O	The

O	the

O	or
O	of
O	a

O	They
O	climbed
O	the

O	toward

O	the

O	was
O	below

O	then
O	it
O	rushed

O	spread
O	out

O	For

O	and

C	Sol
C	Cardin
O	reached
O	the
O	settlement
O	on
O	the
O	following
O	day
O	and
O	heard
O	the

O	In

O	he

O	in
O	a

O	It
O	seems

O	if

O	get
O	its
O	full

O	Very
O	few
O	foreigners
O	travel
O	in
O	Sweden
O	in
O	the
O	winter
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	intense
O	cold
O	As
O	you
O	go
O	northward
O	from
O	Stockholm
O	the
O	capital
O	the
O	country
O	becomes
O	ruder
O	and
O	wilder
O	and
O	the
O	climate
O	more
O	severe
O	In
O	the
O	sheltered
O	valleys
O	along
O	the
O	Gulf
O	of
O	Bothnia
O	and
O	the
O	rivers
O	which
O	empty
O	into
O	it
O	there
O	are
O	farms
O	and
O	villages
O	for
O	a
O	distance
O	of
O	seven
O	or
O	eight
O	hundred
O	miles
O	after
O	which
O	disappear
O	and
O	nothing
O	will
O	grow
O	in
O	the
O	short
O	cold
O	summers
O	except
O	potatoes
O	and
O	a
O	little
O	barley
O	Farther
O	inland
O	there
O	are
O	great
O	forests

O	where
O	bears
O	wolves
O	and
O	herds
O	of
O	wild
O	reindeer
O	make
O	their
O	home
O	No
O	people
O	could
O	live
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	country
O	unless
O	they
O	were
O	very
O	industrious
O	and
O	thrifty
C	I
O	made
O	my
O	journey
O	in
O	the
O	winter
O	because
C	I
O	was
O	on
O	my
O	way
O	to
O	Lapland
O	where
O	it
O	is
O	easier
O	to
O	travel
O	when
O	the
O	swamps
O	and
O	rivers
O	are
O	frozen
O	and
O	the
O	can
O	fly
O	along
O	over
O	the
O	smooth
O	snow
O	It
O	was
O	very
O	cold
O	indeed
O	the
O	greater
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	time
O	the
O	days
O	were
O	short
O	and
O	dark
O	and
O	if
C	I
O	had
O	not
O	found
O	the
O	people
O	so
O	kind
O	so
O	cheerful
O	and
O	so
O	honest
C	I
O	should
O	have
O	felt
O	inclined
O	to
O	turn
O	back
O	more
O	than
O	once
O	But
C	I
O	do
O	not
O	think
O	there
O	are
O	better
O	people
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	than
O	those
O	who
O	live
O	in
O	Norrland
O	which
O	is
O	a
O	Swedish
O	province
O	commencing
O	about
O	two
O	hundred
O	miles
O	north
O	of
O	Stockholm
O	They
O	are
O	a
O	hale
O	strong
O	race
O	with
O	yellow
O	hair
O	and
O	bright
O	blue
O	eyes
O	and
O	the
O	handsomest
O	teeth
C	I
O	ever
O	saw
O	They
O	live
O	plainly
O	but
O	very
O	comfortably
O	in
O	snug
O	wooden
O	houses
O	with
O	double
O	windows
O	and
O	doors
O	to
O	keep
O	out
O	the
O	cold
O	and
O	since
O	they
O	cannot
O	do
O	much
O	work
O	they
O	spin
O	and
O	weave
O	and
O	mend
O	their
O	farming
O	implements
O	in
O	the
O	large
O	family
O	room
O	thus
O	enjoying
O	the
O	winter
O	in
O	spite
O	of
O	its
O	severity
O	They
O	are
O	very
O	happy
O	and
O	contented
O	and
O	few
O	of
O	them
O	would
O	be
O	willing
O	to
O	leave
O	that
O	cold
O	country
O	and
O	make
O	their
O	homes
O	in
O	a
O	warmer
O	climate
O	Here
O	there
O	are
O	neither
O	railroads
O	nor
O	stages
O	but
O	the
O	government
O	has
O	established
O	at
O	distances
O	varying
O	from
O	ten
O	to
O	twenty
O	miles
O	At
O	each
O	station
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	horses
O	and
O	sometimes
O	vehicles
O	are
O	kept
O	but
O	generally
O	the
O	traveler
O	has
O	his
O	own
O	sled
O	and
O	simply
O	hires
O	the
O	horses
O	from
O	one
O	station
O	to
O	another
O	These
O	horses
O	are
O	either
O	furnished
O	by
O	the
O	keeper
O	of
O	the
O	station
O	or
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	neighboring
O	farmers
O	and
O	when
O	they
O	are
O	wanted
O	a
O	man
O	or
O	boy
O	goes
O	along
O	with
O	the
O	traveler
O	to
O	bring
O	them
O	back
O	It
O	would
O	be
O	quite
O	an
O	independent
O	and
O	convenient
O	way
O	of
O	traveling
O	if
O	the
O	horses
O	were
O	always
O	ready
O	but
O	sometimes
O	you
O	must
O	wait
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	more
O	before
O	they
O	can
O	be
O	furnished
C	I
C	had
O	my
O	own
O	little
O	sled
O	filled
O	with
O	hay
O	and
O	covered
O	with
O	to
O	keep
O	me
O	warm
O	So
O	long
O	as
O	the
O	weather
O	was
O	not
O	too
O	cold
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	pleasant
O	to
O	speed
O	along
O	through
O	the
O	dark
O	forests
O	over
O	the
O	frozen
O	rivers
O	or
O	past
O	farm
O	after
O	farm
O	in
O	the
O	sheltered
O	valleys
O	up
O	hill
O	and
O	down
O	until
O	long
O	after
O	the
O	stars
O	came
O	out
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	get
O	a
O	warm
O	supper
O	in
O	some
O	post
O	cottage
O	while
O	the
O	cheerful
O	people
O	sang
O	or
O	told
O	stories
O	around
O	the
O	fire
O	The
O	cold
O	increased
O	a
O	little
O	every
O	day
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	but
C	I
O	became
O	gradually
O	accustomed
O	to
O	it
O	and
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	fancy
O	that
O	the
O	Arctic
O	climate
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	difficult
O	to
O	endure
O	as
C	I
C	had
O	supposed
O	At
O	first
O	the
O	thermometer
O	fell
O	to
O	zero
O	then
O	it
O	went
O	down
O	ten
O	degrees
O	below
O	then
O	twenty
O	and
O	finally
O	thirty
O	Being
O	dressed
O	in
O	thick
O	furs
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
C	I
O	did
O	not
O	suffer
O	greatly
O	but
C	I
O	was
O	very
O	glad
O	when
O	the
O	people
O	assured
O	me
O	that
O	such
O	extreme
O	cold
O	never
O	lasted
O	more
O	than
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	days
C	Boys
O	of
O	twelve
O	or
O	fourteen
O	very
O	often
O	went
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	bring
O	back
O	their
O	father
O	s
O	horses
O	and
O	so
O	long
O	as
O	those
O	lively
O	fellows
O	could
O	face
O	the
O	weather
O	it
O	would
O	not
O	do
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	be
O	afraid
O	One
O	night
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	wonderful
O	aurora
O	in
O	the
O	sky
O	The
O	streamers
O	of
O	red
O	and
O	blue
O	light
O	darted
O	hither
O	and
O	thither
O	chasing
O	each
O	other
O	up
O	the
O	zenith
O	and
O	down
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	northern
O	horizon
O	with
O	a
O	rapidity
O	and
O	a
O	brilliance
O	which
C	I
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	before
O	There
O	will
O	be
O	a
O	storm
O	soon
O	said
O	my
O	one
O	always
O	comes
O	after
O	these
O	lights
O	Next
O	morning
O	the
O	sky
O	was
O	overcast
O	and
O	the
O	short
O	day
O	was
O	as
O	dark
O	as
O	our
O	twilight
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	quite
O	so
O	cold
O	and
C	I
O	travelled
O	onward
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	possible
O	There
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	tract
O	of
O	wild
O	and
O	country
O	before
O	me
O	and
C	I
O	wished
O	to
O	get
O	through
O	it
O	before
O	stopping
O	for
O	the
O	night
O	Unfortunately
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	two
O	were
O	travelling
O	the
O	same
O	way
O	and
O	had
O	taken
O	the
O	horses
O	so
C	I
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	wait
O	at
O	the
O	stations
O	until
O	other
O	horses
O	were
O	brought
O	from
O	the
O	neighbouring
O	farms
O	This
O	delayed
O	me
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	at
O	seven
O	o
O	clock
O	in
O	the
O	evening
C	I
O	had
O	still
O	one
O	more
O	station
O	of
O	three
O	Swedish
O	miles
O	before
O	reaching
O	the
O	village
O	where
C	I
O	intended
O	to
O	spend
O	the
O	night
O	Now
O	a
O	Swedish
O	mile
O	is
O	nearly
O	equal
O	to
O	seven
O	English
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	station
O	was
O	at
O	least
O	twenty
O	miles
O	long
C	I
O	decided
O	to
O	take
O	supper
O	while
O	the
O	horse
O	was
O	eating
O	his
O	feed
O	They
O	had
O	not
O	expected
O	any
O	more
O	travellers
O	at
O	the
O	station
O	and
O	were
O	not
O	prepared
C	The
C	keeper
O	had
O	gone
O	on
O	with
O	the
O	two
O	but
O	his
C	wife
O	a
O	friendly
O	woman
O	prepared
O	me
O	some
O	excellent
O	coffee
O	potatoes
O	and
O	stewed
O	upon
O	which
C	I
O	made
O	an
O	excellent
O	meal
O	The
O	house
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	border
O	of
O	a
O	large
O	dark
O	forest
O	and
O	the
O	roar
O	of
O	the
O	icy
O	northern
O	wind
O	in
O	the
O	trees
O	seemed
O	to
O	increase
O	while
C	I
O	waited
O	in
O	the
O	warm
O	room
C	I
O	did
O	not
O	feel
O	inclined
O	to
O	go
O	forth
O	into
O	the
O	wintry
O	storm
O	but
O	having
O	set
O	my
O	mind
O	on
O	reaching
O	the
O	village
O	that
O	night
C	I
O	was
O	loath
O	to
O	turn
O	back
O	It
O	is
O	a
O	bad
O	night
O	said
O	the
C	woman
O	and
O	my
O	husband
O	will
O	certainly
O	stay
O	at
O	Umea
O	until
O	morning
O	His
O	name
O	is
C	Neils
C	Petersen
O	and
C	I
O	think
O	you
O	will
O	find
O	him
O	at
O	the
O	when
O	you
O	get
O	there
C	Lars
O	will
O	take
O	you
O	and
O	they
O	can
O	come
O	back
O	together
O	Who
O	is
C	Lars
C	I
O	asked
O	My
O	son
O	said
O	she
O	He
O	is
O	getting
O	the
O	horse
O	ready
O	There
O	is
O	nobody
O	else
O	about
O	the
O	house
O	Just
O	then
O	the
O	door
O	opened
O	and
O	in
O	came
C	Lars
O	He
O	was
O	about
O	twelve
O	years
O	old
O	but
O	his
O	face
O	was
O	so
O	rosy
O	his
O	eyes
O	so
O	clear
O	and
O	round
O	and
O	blue
O	and
O	his
O	golden
O	hair
O	was
O	blown
O	back
O	from
O	his
O	face
O	in
O	such
O	silky
O	curls
O	that
O	he
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	even
O	younger
C	I
O	was
O	surprised
O	that
O	his
O	mother
O	should
O	be
O	willing
O	to
O	send
O	him
O	twenty
O	miles
O	through
O	the
O	dark
O	woods
O	on
O	such
O	a
O	night
O	Come
O	here
C	Lars
C	I
O	said
O	Then
C	I
O	took
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	hand
O	and
O	asked
O	Are
O	you
O	not
O	afraid
O	to
O	go
O	so
O	far
O	He
O	looked
O	at
O	me
O	with
O	wondering
O	eyes
O	and
O	smiled
O	and
O	his
O	mother
O	made
O	haste
O	to
O	You
O	need
O	have
O	no
O	fear
O	sir
C	Lars
O	is
O	young
O	but
O	he
O	ll
O	take
O	you
O	safe
O	enough
O	If
O	the
O	storm
O	don
O	t
O	get
O	worse
O	you
O	ll
O	be
O	at
O	Umea
O	by
O	eleven
O	o
O	clock
C	I
O	was
O	again
O	on
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	remaining
O	but
O	while
C	I
O	was
O	deliberating
O	with
O	myself
O	the
O	boy
O	had
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	overcoat
O	of
O	tied
O	the
O	lappets
O	of
O	his
O	fur
O	cap
O	under
O	his
O	chin
O	and
O	a
O	thick
O	woolen
O	scarf
O	around
O	his
O	nose
O	and
O	mouth
O	so
O	that
O	only
O	the
O	round
O	blue
O	eyes
O	were
O	visible
O	and
O	then
O	his
O	mother
O	took
O	down
O	the
O	mittens
O	of
O	hare
O	s
O	fur
O	from
O	the
O	stove
O	where
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	hung
O	to
O	dry
O	He
O	put
O	them
O	on
O	took
O	a
O	short
O	leather
O	whip
O	and
O	was
O	ready
C	I
O	wrapped
O	myself
O	in
O	my
O	furs
O	and
O	we
O	went
O	out
O	together
O	The
O	driving
O	snow
O	cut
O	me
O	in
O	the
O	face
O	like
O	needles
O	but
C	Lars
O	did
O	not
O	mind
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	He
O	jumped
O	into
O	the
O	sled
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	filled
O	with
O	fresh
O	soft
O	hay
O	tucked
O	in
O	the
O	at
O	the
O	sides
O	and
O	we
O	cuddled
O	together
O	on
O	the
O	narrow
O	seat
O	making
O	everything
O	close
O	and
O	warm
O	before
O	we
O	set
O	out
C	I
O	could
O	not
O	see
O	at
O	all
O	when
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	was
O	shut
O	and
O	the
O	horse
O	started
O	on
O	the
O	journey
O	The
O	night
O	was
O	dark
O	the
O	snow
O	blew
O	incessantly
O	and
O	the
O	dark
O	roared
O	all
O	around
O	us
C	Lars
O	however
O	knew
O	the
O	way
O	and
O	somehow
O	or
O	other
O	we
O	kept
O	the
O	beaten
O	track
O	He
O	talked
O	to
O	the
O	horse
O	so
O	constantly
O	and
O	so
O	cheerfully
O	that
O	after
O	a
O	while
O	my
O	own
O	spirits
O	began
O	to
O	rise
O	and
O	the
O	way
O	seemed
O	neither
O	so
O	long
O	nor
O	so
O	disagreeable
O	Ho
O	there
O	Axel
O	he
O	would
O	say
O	Keep
O	to
O	the
O	road
O	not
O	too
O	far
O	to
O	the
O	left
O	Well
O	done
O	Here
O	s
O	a
O	level
O	now
O	trot
O	a
O	bit
O	So
O	we
O	went
O	on
O	sometimes
O	up
O	hill
O	sometimes
O	down
O	hill
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	as
O	it
O	seemed
C	I
O	began
O	to
O	grow
O	chilly
O	and
O	even
C	Lars
C	handed
O	me
O	the
O	reins
O	while
O	he
O	swung
O	and
O	beat
O	his
O	arms
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	blood
O	in
O	circulation
O	He
O	no
O	longer
O	sang
O	little
O	songs
O	and
O	fragments
O	of
O	hymns
O	as
O	when
O	we
O	first
O	set
O	out
O	but
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	in
O	the
O	least
O	alarmed
O	or
O	even
O	impatient
O	Whenever
C	I
O	asked
O	as
C	I
O	did
O	about
O	every
O	five
O	minutes
O	Are
O	we
O	nearly
O	there
O	he
O	always
O	answered
O	A
O	little
O	farther
O	Suddenly
O	the
O	wind
O	seemed
O	to
O	increase
O	Ah
O	said
O	he
O	now
C	I
O	know
O	where
O	we
O	are
O	it
O	s
O	one
O	mile
O	more
O	But
O	one
O	mile
O	you
O	must
O	remember
O	meant
O	seven
C	Lars
O	checked
O	the
O	horse
O	and
O	peered
O	anxiously
O	from
O	side
O	to
O	side
O	in
O	the
O	darkness
C	I
O	looked
O	also
O	but
O	could
O	see
O	nothing
O	What
O	is
O	the
O	matter
C	I
O	finally
O	asked
O	We
O	have
O	got
O	past
O	the
O	hills
O	on
O	the
O	left
O	he
O	said
O	The
O	country
O	is
O	open
O	to
O	the
O	wind
O	and
O	here
O	the
O	snow
O	drifts
O	worse
O	than
O	anywhere
O	else
O	on
O	the
O	road
O	If
O	there
O	have
O	been
O	no
O	ploughs
O	out
O	we
O	ll
O	have
O	trouble
O	You
O	must
O	know
O	that
O	the
O	farmers
O	along
O	the
O	road
O	are
O	obliged
O	to
O	turn
O	out
O	with
O	their
O	horses
O	and
O	oxen
O	and
O	plough
O	down
O	the
O	drifts
O	whenever
O	the
O	road
O	is
O	blocked
O	up
O	by
O	a
O	storm
O	In
O	less
O	than
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	we
O	could
O	see
O	that
O	the
O	horse
O	was
O	sinking
O	in
O	the
O	deep
O	snow
O	He
O	plunged
O	bravely
O	forward
O	but
O	made
O	scarcely
O	any
O	headway
O	and
O	presently
O	became
O	so
O	exhausted
O	that
O	he
O	stood
O	quite
O	still
C	Lars
O	and
C	I
O	arose
O	from
O	the
O	seat
O	and
O	looked
O	around
O	For
O	my
O	part
C	I
O	saw
O	nothing
O	except
O	some
O	very
O	indistinct
O	shapes
O	of
O	trees
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	sign
O	of
O	an
O	opening
O	through
O	them
O	In
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	the
O	horse
O	started
O	again
O	and
O	with
O	great
O	labour
O	carried
O	us
O	a
O	few
O	yards
O	farther
O	Shall
O	we
O	get
O	out
O	and
O	try
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	road
O	said
C	I
O	It
O	s
O	no
O	use
C	Lars
O	answered
O	In
O	these
O	drifts
O	we
O	would
O	sink
O	to
O	the
O	waist
O	Wait
O	a
O	little
O	and
O	we
O	shall
O	get
O	through
O	this
O	one
O	It
O	was
O	as
O	he
O	said
O	Another
O	pull
O	brought
O	us
O	through
O	the
O	deep
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	drift
O	and
O	we
O	reached
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	snow
O	was
O	quite
O	shallow
O	But
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	the
O	hard
O	smooth
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	we
O	could
O	feel
O	that
O	the
O	ground
O	was
O	uneven
O	and
O	covered
O	with
O	roots
O	and
O	bushes
O	Bidding
O	Axel
O	stand
O	still
C	Lars
O	jumped
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	sled
O	and
O	began
O	wading
O	around
O	among
O	the
O	trees
O	Then
C	I
O	got
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	but
O	had
O	not
O	proceeded
O	ten
O	steps
O	before
C	I
O	began
O	to
O	sink
O	so
O	deeply
O	into
O	the
O	loose
O	snow
O	that
C	I
O	was
O	glad
O	to
O	extricate
O	myself
O	and
O	return
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	desperate
O	situation
O	and
C	I
O	wondered
O	how
O	we
O	should
O	ever
O	get
O	out
O	of
O	it
C	I
O	shouted
O	to
C	Lars
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	guide
O	him
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	he
O	also
O	came
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	sled
O	If
C	I
O	knew
O	where
O	the
O	road
O	is
O	said
O	he
C	I
O	could
O	get
O	into
O	it
O	again
O	But
C	I
O	don
O	t
O	know
O	and
C	I
O	think
O	we
O	must
O	stay
O	here
O	all
O	night
O	We
O	shall
O	freeze
O	to
O	death
O	in
O	an
O	hour
C	I
O	cried
C	I
O	was
O	already
O	chilled
O	to
O	the
O	bone
O	The
O	wind
O	had
O	made
O	me
O	very
O	drowsy
O	and
C	I
O	knew
O	that
O	if
C	I
O	slept
C	I
O	should
O	soon
O	be
O	frozen
O	Oh
O	no
O	exclaimed
C	Lars
O	cheerfully
C	I
O	am
O	a
O	Norrlander
O	and
O	Norrlanders
O	never
O	freeze
C	I
O	went
O	with
O	the
O	men
O	to
O	the
O	last
O	winter
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	mountains
O	and
O	we
O	were
O	several
O	nights
O	in
O	the
O	snow
O	Besides
C	I
O	know
O	what
O	my
O	father
O	did
O	with
O	a
O	gentleman
O	from
O	Stockholm
O	on
O	this
O	very
O	road
O	and
O	we
O	ll
O	do
O	it
O	What
O	was
O	it
O	Let
O	me
O	take
O	care
O	of
O	Axel
O	first
O	said
C	Lars
O	We
O	can
O	spare
O	him
O	some
O	hay
O	and
O	one
O	It
O	was
O	a
O	slow
O	and
O	difficult
O	task
O	to
O	unharness
O	the
O	horse
O	but
O	we
O	accomplished
O	it
O	at
O	last
C	Lars
O	then
O	led
O	him
O	under
O	the
O	drooping
O	branches
O	of
O	a
O	tied
O	him
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	gave
O	him
O	an
O	armful
O	of
O	hay
O	and
O	fastened
O	the
O	upon
O	his
O	back
O	Axel
O	began
O	to
O	eat
O	as
O	if
O	perfectly
O	satisfied
O	with
O	the
O	arrangement
O	The
O	Norrland
O	horses
O	are
O	so
O	accustomed
O	to
O	cold
O	that
O	they
O	seem
O	comfortable
O	in
O	a
O	temperature
O	where
O	one
O	of
O	ours
O	would
O	freeze
O	When
O	this
O	was
O	done
C	Lars
O	spread
O	the
O	remaining
O	hay
O	evenly
O	over
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	sled
O	and
O	covered
O	it
O	with
O	the
O	skins
O	which
O	he
O	tucked
O	in
O	very
O	firmly
O	on
O	the
O	side
O	toward
O	the
O	wind
O	Then
O	lifting
O	them
O	up
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	he
O	Now
O	take
O	off
O	your
O	fur
O	coat
O	quick
O	lay
O	it
O	over
O	the
O	hay
O	and
O	then
O	creep
O	under
O	it
C	I
O	obeyed
O	as
O	rapidly
O	as
O	possible
O	For
O	an
O	instant
C	I
O	shuddered
O	in
O	the
O	icy
O	air
O	but
O	the
O	next
O	moment
C	I
O	lay
O	stretched
O	in
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	sled
O	sheltered
O	from
O	the
O	storm
C	I
O	held
O	up
O	the
O	ends
O	of
O	the
O	while
C	Lars
O	took
O	off
O	his
O	coat
O	and
O	crept
O	in
O	beside
O	me
O	Then
O	he
O	drew
O	the
O	skins
O	down
O	and
O	pressed
O	the
O	hay
O	against
O	them
O	When
O	the
O	wind
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	entirely
O	excluded
C	Lars
O	said
O	we
O	must
O	pull
O	off
O	our
O	boots
O	untie
O	our
O	scarfs
O	and
O	so
O	loosen
O	our
O	clothes
O	that
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	feel
O	tight
O	upon
O	any
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	body
O	When
O	this
O	was
O	done
O	and
O	we
O	lay
O	close
O	together
O	warming
O	each
O	other
C	I
O	found
O	that
O	the
O	chill
O	gradually
O	passed
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	blood
O	My
O	hands
O	and
O	feet
O	were
O	no
O	longer
O	numb
O	a
O	delightful
O	feeling
O	of
O	comfort
O	crept
O	over
O	me
O	and
C	I
O	lay
O	as
O	snugly
O	as
O	in
O	the
O	best
O	bed
C	I
O	was
O	surprised
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	although
O	my
O	head
O	was
O	covered
C	I
O	did
O	not
O	feel
O	stifled
O	Enough
O	air
O	came
O	in
O	under
O	the
O	skins
O	to
O	prevent
O	us
O	from
O	feeling
O	oppressed
O	There
O	was
O	barely
O	room
O	for
O	the
O	two
O	of
O	us
O	to
O	lie
O	with
O	no
O	chance
O	of
O	turning
O	over
O	or
O	rolling
O	about
O	In
O	five
O	minutes
C	I
O	think
O	we
O	were
O	asleep
O	and
C	I
O	dreamed
O	of
O	gathering
O	peaches
O	on
O	a
O	warm
O	August
O	day
O	at
O	home
O	In
O	fact
C	I
O	did
O	not
O	wake
O	up
O	thoroughly
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	neither
O	did
C	Lars
O	though
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	me
O	that
O	we
O	both
O	talked
O	in
O	our
O	sleep
O	But
O	as
C	I
O	must
O	have
O	talked
O	English
O	and
O	he
O	Swedish
O	there
O	could
O	have
O	been
O	no
O	connection
O	between
O	our
O	remarks
C	I
O	remember
O	that
O	his
O	warm
O	soft
O	hair
O	pressed
O	against
O	my
O	chin
O	and
O	that
O	his
O	feet
O	reached
O	no
O	farther
O	than
O	my
O	knees
O	Just
O	as
C	I
O	was
O	beginning
O	to
O	feel
O	a
O	little
O	cramped
O	and
O	stiff
O	from
O	lying
O	so
O	still
C	I
O	was
O	suddenly
O	aroused
O	by
O	the
O	cold
O	wind
O	on
O	my
O	face
C	Lars
O	had
O	risen
O	up
O	on
O	his
O	elbow
O	and
O	was
O	peeping
O	out
O	from
O	under
O	the
O	skins
C	I
O	think
O	it
O	must
O	be
O	near
O	six
O	o
O	clock
O	he
O	said
O	The
O	sky
O	is
O	clear
O	and
C	I
O	can
O	see
O	the
O	big
O	star
O	We
O	can
O	start
O	in
O	another
O	hour
C	I
O	felt
O	so
O	much
O	refreshed
O	that
C	I
O	was
O	for
O	setting
O	out
O	immediately
O	but
C	Lars
O	remarked
O	very
O	sensibly
O	that
O	is
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	possible
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	road
O	While
O	we
O	were
O	talking
O	Axel
O	neighed
O	There
O	they
O	are
O	cried
C	Lars
O	and
O	immediately
O	began
O	to
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	boots
O	his
O	scarf
O	and
O	heavy
O	coat
C	I
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	time
O	we
O	were
O	ready
O	we
O	heard
O	shouts
O	and
O	the
O	crack
O	of
O	whips
O	We
O	harnessed
O	Axel
O	to
O	the
O	sled
O	and
O	proceeded
O	slowly
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	of
O	the
O	sound
O	which
O	came
O	as
O	we
O	presently
O	saw
O	from
O	a
O	company
O	of
O	farmers
O	out
O	thus
O	early
O	to
O	plough
O	the
O	road
O	They
O	had
O	six
O	pairs
O	of
O	horses
O	geared
O	to
O	a
O	wooden
O	frame
O	something
O	like
O	the
O	bow
O	of
O	a
O	ship
O	pointed
O	in
O	front
O	and
O	spreading
O	out
O	to
O	a
O	breadth
O	of
O	ten
O	or
O	twelve
O	feet
O	This
O	machine
O	not
O	only
O	cut
O	through
O	the
O	drifts
O	but
O	packed
O	the
O	snow
O	leaving
O	a
O	good
O	solid
O	road
O	behind
O	it
O	After
O	it
O	had
O	passed
O	we
O	sped
O	along
O	merrily
O	in
O	the
O	cold
O	morning
O	twilight
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	than
O	an
O	hour
O	reached
O	the
O	at
O	Umeae
O	where
O	we
O	found
C	Lars
C	father
O	prepared
O	to
O	return
O	home
O	He
O	waited
O	nevertheless
O	until
C	Lars
O	had
O	eaten
O	a
O	good
O	warm
O	breakfast
O	when
C	I
O	said
O	to
O	both
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	towards
O	Lapland
O	Some
O	weeks
O	afterwards
O	on
O	my
O	return
O	to
O	Stockholm
C	I
O	stopped
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	little
O	station
O	This
O	time
O	the
O	weather
O	was
O	mild
O	and
O	bright
O	and
O	the
C	father
O	would
O	have
O	gone
O	with
O	me
O	to
O	the
O	next
O	but
C	I
O	preferred
O	to
O	take
O	my
O	little
O	and
O	He
O	was
O	so
O	quiet
O	and
O	cheerful
O	and
O	fearless
O	that
O	although
C	I
O	had
O	been
O	nearly
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	world
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	away
O	from
O	home
O	although
C	I
O	was
O	a
O	man
O	and
O	he
O	a
O	young
O	boy
C	I
O	felt
O	that
C	I
O	had
O	learned
O	a
O	lesson
O	from
O	him
O	and
O	might
O	probably
O	learn
O	many
O	more
O	if
C	I
O	should
O	know
O	him
O	better
O	We
O	had
O	a
O	merry
O	trip
O	of
O	two
O	or
O	three
O	hours
O	and
O	then
C	I
O	took
O	leave
O	of
C	Lars
O	forever
O	It
O	is
O	the
O	custom
O	nowadays
O	for
O	scientists
O	and
O	for
O	other
O	scholarly
O	people
O	to
O	take
O	hold
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	myths
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	to
O	pieces
O	and
O	to
O	find
O	some
O	deep
O	hidden
O	meaning
O	in
O	each
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	story
O	So
O	you
O	will
O	find
O	that
O	some
O	will
O	tell
O	you
O	that
C	Orpheus
O	is
O	the
O	personification
O	of
O	the
O	winds
O	which
O	tear
O	up
O	trees
O	as
O	they
O	course
O	along
O	chanting
O	their
O	wild
O	music
O	and
O	that
C	Eurydice
O	is
O	the
O	morning
O	with
O	its
O	beauty
O	Others
O	say
O	that
C	Orpheus
O	is
O	the
O	mythological
O	expression
O	of
O	the
O	delight
O	which
O	music
O	gives
O	to
O	the
O	primitive
O	races
O	while
O	yet
O	others
O	accept
O	without
O	hesitation
O	the
O	idea
O	that
C	Orpheus
O	is
O	the
O	sun
O	that
O	when
O	day
O	is
O	done
O	plunges
O	into
O	the
O	black
O	abyss
O	of
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	vain
O	hope
O	of
O	overtaking
O	his
O	lost
O	bride
C	Eurydice
O	the
O	rosy
O	dawn
O	And
O	whether
O	they
O	be
O	right
O	or
O	wrong
O	it
O	would
O	seem
O	that
O	the
O	sadness
O	that
O	comes
O	to
O	us
O	sometimes
O	as
O	the
O	day
O	dies
O	and
O	the
O	last
O	of
O	the
O	sun
O	s
O	rays
O	vanish
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	hills
O	and
O	valleys
O	dark
O	and
O	cold
O	the
O	sorrowful
O	feeling
O	that
O	we
O	cannot
O	understand
O	when
O	in
O	country
O	places
O	we
O	hear
O	music
O	coming
O	from
O	far
O	away
O	or
O	listen
O	to
O	the
O	plaintive
O	song
O	of
O	the
O	bird
O	are
O	things
O	that
O	very
O	specially
O	belong
O	to
O	the
O	story
O	of
C	Orpheus
O	In
O	the
O	country
O	of
O	Thrace
O	surrounded
O	by
O	all
O	the
O	best
O	gifts
O	of
O	the
O	gods
C	Orpheus
O	was
O	born
O	His
O	father
O	was
C	Apollo
O	the
O	god
O	of
O	music
O	and
O	of
O	song
O	his
O	mother
O	the

C	Calliope
C	Apollo
O	gave
O	his
O	little
O	son
O	a
O	lyre
O	and
O	himself
O	taught
O	him
O	how
O	to
O	play
O	it
O	It
O	was
O	not
O	long
O	before
O	all
O	the
O	wild
O	things
O	in
O	the
O	woods
O	of

O	crept
O	out
O	from
O	the

O	and
O	from
O	the
O	holes
O	and
O	caves
O	in
O	the
O	rocks
O	to
O	listen
O	to

O	all
O	ceased

O	that

O	their
O	secrets
O	to
O	the

O	for
O	their
O	lord
O	and
O	the
O	proudest
O	trees
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	bowed
O	their
O	heads
O	that
O	they
O	might
O	not
O	miss
O	one
O	exquisite
O	sigh
O	that

O	drew
O	from

O	strings
O	Nor
O	man

O	not

O	played

O	and
O	the

O	of

O	ran
O	to

O	felt
O	on

O	and
O	smiled
O	well
O	content
O	While

O	played

O	seem
O	as
O	though
O	the

O	gained
O	hearts
O	Nay
O	the

O	Not

O	he
O	would
O	find

O	left
O	once
O	more
O	to

O	cruel
O	loneliness
O	Too
O	overwhelming
O	for

O	was
O	the
O	doubt
O	So
O	nearly
O	there
O	they
O	were
O	that
O	the

O	was
O	no

O	that
O	of

O	when

O	fall
O	upon

O	seemed
O	no

O	for

O	to
O	wait
O	Swiftly
O	he
O	turned
O	and

O	but
O	before

C	Eurydice

O	from

O	Farewell
O	she

O	Farewell
O	and

O	a
O	sigh
O	of

O	grief
O	In
O	mad
O	desperation
C	Orpheus
O	sought

C	Orpheus
O	waited

O	at

O	And
O	when
O	they
O	looked
O	round
O	they
O	found
O	out
O	that

O	every

O	in
O	which

O	a

O	off

O	it
O	was

O	the

O	when

O	fell
O	the

O	said
O	Go
O	and
O	bolt
O	the

O	and
O	then
O	they
O	seated
O	themselves
O	on
O	the

O	took
O	her
O	spectacles
O	and

O	out
O	of

O	perhaps
O	it

O	a

O	who
O	seeks
O	shelter
O	went
O	and
O	pushed
O	the

O	back
O	and
O	thought
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	poor
O	man
O	but
O	a
C	bear
O	stretched
O	his
O	thick
O	black

O	into

O	fluttered
O	about

O	However
O	the
C	bear
O	began
O	to

O	not
O	be
O	frightened

O	no

O	lay
O	yourself
O	down

O	only
O	take

O	she
O	called
O	out

O	both
O	came
O	out

O	by
O	degrees
O	the

O	fetched
O	a

O	and
O	swept
O	the

O	clean
O	and
O	he
O	stretched
O	himself
O	before

O	growled
O	softly
O	like

O	and
O	the
O	children
O	played
O	tricks
O	with
O	the
O	awkward
O	guest
O	They
O	pulled
O	his
O	hair
O	set
O	their
O	feet
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	and
O	rolled
O	him
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	or
O	took
O	a
O	hazel
O	rod
O	and
O	beat
O	him
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	growled
O	they
O	laughed
O	The
C	bear
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	pleased
O	with
O	this
O	frolic
O	only
O	when
O	they
O	became
O	too
O	mischievous
O	he
O	called
O	out
O	Children
O	leave
O	me
O	alone
O	Little
O	and
O	You
O	will
O	strike
O	your
O	lover
O	dead
O	When
O	bedtime
O	came
O	and
O	the
O	others
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	the
C	mother
O	said
O	to
O	the
C	bear
O	You
O	can
O	lie
O	there
O	on
O	the
O	hearth
O	and
O	then
O	you
O	will
O	be
O	sheltered
O	from
O	the
O	cold
O	and
O	the
O	bad
O	weather
O	At
O	daybreak
O	the
O	two
O	children
O	let
O	him
O	out
O	and
O	he
O	trotted
O	over
O	the
O	snow
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	Henceforward
O	the
C	bear
O	came
O	every
O	evening
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	hour
O	laid
O	himself
O	on
O	the
O	hearth
O	and
O	allowed
O	the
O	children
O	to
O	play
O	with
O	him
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	they
O	liked
O	and
O	they
O	became
O	so
O	used
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	door
O	was
O	never
O	bolted
O	until
O	their
O	black
O	companion
O	had
O	arrived
O	When
O	spring
O	came
O	and
O	everything
O	was
O	green
O	out
O	of
O	doors
O	the
C	bear
O	said
O	one
O	morning
O	to
O	Now
O	I
O	must
O	go
O	away
O	and
O	may
O	not
O	come
O	again
O	the
O	whole
O	summer
O	Where
O	are
O	you
O	going
O	dear
C	bear
O	asked
O	I
O	must
O	go
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	and
O	guard
O	my
O	treasures
O	from
O	the
O	bad
O	dwarfs
O	in
O	winter
O	when
O	the
O	ground
O	is
O	frozen
O	hard
O	they
O	have
O	to
O	stay
O	underneath
O	and
O	cannot
O	work
O	their
O	way
O	through
O	but
O	now
O	that
O	the
O	sun
O	has
O	thawed
O	and
O	warmed
O	the
O	earth
O	they
O	break
O	through
O	come
O	up
O	seek
O	and
O	steal
O	what
O	is
O	once
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	and
O	lies
O	in
O	their
O	caverns
O	does
O	not
O	come
O	so
O	easily
O	into
O	daylight
O	again
O	was
O	quite
O	sorrowful
O	at
O	parting
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	unbolted
O	the
O	door
O	for
O	him
O	and
O	the
C	bear
O	ran
O	out
O	the
O	hook
O	of
O	the
O	door
O	caught
O	him
O	and
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	his
O	skin
O	tore
O	off
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	seen
O	gold
O	shining
O	through
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	not
O	sure
O	But
O	the
C	bear
O	ran
O	quickly
O	away
O	and
O	soon
O	disappeared
O	behind
O	the
O	trees
O	After
O	some
O	time
O	their
C	mother
O	sent
O	the
O	children
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	to
O	collect
O	faggots
O	They
O	found
O	there
O	a
O	large
O	tree
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	cut
O	down
O	and
O	lay
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	by
O	the
O	trunk
O	something
O	was
O	jumping
O	up
O	and
O	down
O	but
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	As
O	they
O	came
O	nearer
O	they
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
C	dwarf
O	with
O	an
O	old
O	withered
O	face
O	and
O	a
O	beard
O	a
O	yard
O	long
O	The
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	beard
O	was
O	stuck
O	fast
O	in
O	a
O	cleft
O	in
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	jumped
O	about
O	like
O	a
O	dog
O	on
O	a
O	rope
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	to
O	help
O	himself
O	He
O	stared
O	at
O	the
O	girls
O	with
O	his
O	fiery
O	red
O	eyes
O	and
O	screamed
O	out
O	Why
O	do
O	you
O	stand
O	there
O	Can
O	t
O	you
O	come
O	and
O	render
O	me
O	some
O	assistance
O	What
O	is
O	the
O	matter
O	with
O	you
O	little
O	man
O	asked
O	Stupid
O	little
O	goose
O	answered
O	the
C	dwarf
O	I
O	wanted
O	to
O	chop
O	the
O	tree
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	have
O	some
O	small
O	pieces
O	of
O	wood
O	for
O	the
O	kitchen
O	we
O	only
O	want
O	little
O	bits
O	with
O	thick
O	logs
O	the
O	small
O	quantity
O	of
O	food
O	that
O	we
O	cook
O	for
O	ourselves
O	we
O	are
O	not
O	like
O	you
O	great
O	greedy
O	people
O	burns
O	directly
O	I
O	had
O	driven
O	the
O	wedge
O	well
O	in
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	all
O	going
O	on
O	right
O	but
O	the
O	detestable
O	wood
O	was
O	too
O	smooth
O	and
O	sprang
O	out
O	unexpectedly
O	and
O	the
O	tree
O	closed
O	up
O	so
O	quickly
O	that
O	I
O	could
O	not
O	pull
O	my
O	beautiful
O	white
O	beard
O	out
O	now
O	it
O	is
O	sticking
O	there
O	and
O	I

O	you

O	crying
O	out
O	How
O	ugly
O	you
O	are
O	how
O	ugly
O	you
O	are
O	The
O	children
O	took
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	of
O	trouble
O	but
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	pull
O	the
O	beard
O	out
O	it
O	stuck
O	too
O	fast
O	I
O	will
O	run
O	and
O	fetch
O	somebody

O	Rose
O	red
O	You

O	you
O	are
O	two
O	too
O	many
O	for

O	now
O	Can
O	t
O	you
O	think
O	of
O	anything
O	better
O	Only
O	don
O	t
O	be
O	impatient
O	said
O	I
O	have
O	thought
O	of
O	something
O	and
O	she
O	took
O	her
O	little
O	scissors
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	pocket
O	and
O	cut
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	beard
O	off
O	As
O	soon
O	as
O	the
C	dwarf
O	felt
O	himself
O	free
O	he
O	seized
O	a
O	sack
O	filled
O	with
O	gold
O	that
O	was
O	sticking
O	between
O	the
O	roots
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	pulling
O	it
O	out
O	he
O	growled
O	to
O	himself
O	You
O	rude
O	people
O	to
O	cut
O	off
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	my
O	beautiful
O	beard
O	May
O	evil
O	reward
O	you
O	Then
O	he
O	threw
O	his
O	sack
O	over
O	his
O	shoulders
O	and
O	walked
O	away
O	without
O	once
O	looking
O	at
O	the
O	children
O	Some
O	time
O	afterwards
O	and
O	Rose
O	red
O	wished
O	to
O	catch
O	some
O	fish
O	for
O	dinner
O	As
O	they
O	came
O	near
O	to
O	the
O	stream
O	they
O	saw
O	that
O	something
O	like
O	a
O	grasshopper
O	was
O	jumping
O	towards
O	the
O	water
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	going
O	to
O	spring
O	in
O	They
O	ran
O	on
O	and
O	recognised
O	the
C	dwarf
O	Where
O	are
O	you
O	going
O	asked
O	You
O	don
O	t
O	want
O	to
O	go
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	I
O	am
O	not
O	such
O	a
O	fool
O	as
O	that
O	cried
O	the
C	dwarf
O	Don
O	t
O	you
O	see
O	the
O	detestable
O	fish
O	wants
O	to
O	pull
O	me
O	in
O	The
O	little
O	fellow
O	had
O	been
O	sitting
O	there
O	fishing
O	and
O	unluckily
O	the
O	wind
O	had
O	entangled
O	his
O	beard
O	with
O	the
O	line
O	When
O	directly
O	afterwards
O	a
O	great
O	fish
O	bit
O	at
O	his
O	hook
O	the
O	weak
O	creature
O	could
O	not
O	pull
O	him
O	out
O	so
O	the
O	fish
O	was
O	pulling
O	the
C	dwarf
O	into
O	the
O	water
O	It
O	is
O	true
O	he
O	caught
O	hold
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	reeds
O	and
O	rushes
O	but
O	that
O	did
O	not
O	help
O	him
O	much
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	follow
O	all
O	the
O	movements
O	of
O	the
O	fish
O	and
O	was
O	in
O	imminent
O	danger
O	of
O	being
O	drowned
O	The
O	girls
O	coming
O	at
O	the
O	right
O	time
O	held
O	him
O	fast
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	get
O	the
O	beard
O	loose
O	from
O	the
O	line
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	beard
O	and
O	line
O	were
O	entangled
O	fast
O	together
O	There
O	was
O	nothing
O	to
O	do
O	but
O	to
O	pull
O	out
O	the
O	scissors
O	and
O	to
O	cut
O	off
O	the
O	beard
O	in
O	doing
O	which
O	a
O	little
O	piece
O	of
O	it
O	was
O	lost
O	When
O	the
C	dwarf
O	saw
O	that
O	he
O	cried
O	out
O	Is
O	that
O	manners
O	you
O	goose
O	to
O	disfigure
O	one
O	s
O	face
O	so
O	Is
O	it
O	not
O	enough
O	that
O	you
O	once
O	cut
O	my
O	beard
O	shorter
O	But
O	now
O	you
O	have
O	cut
O	the
O	best
O	part
O	of
O	it
O	off
O	I
O	dare
O	not
O	be
O	seen
O	by
O	my
O	people
O	I
O	wish
O	you
O	had
O	had
O	to
O	run
O	and
O	had
O	lost
O	the
O	soles
O	of
O	your
O	shoes
O	Then
O	he
O	fetched
O	a
O	sack
O	of
O	pearls
O	that
O	lay
O	among
O	the
O	rushes
O	and
O	without
O	saying
O	a
O	word
O	more
O	he
O	dragged
O	it
O	away
O	and
O	disappeared
O	behind
O	a
O	stone
O	Soon
O	after
O	the
C	mother
O	sent
O	the
O	two
O	girls
O	to
O	the
O	town
O	to
O	buy
O	cotton
O	needles
O	cord
O	and
O	tape
O	The
O	road
O	led
O	them
O	by
O	a
O	heath
O	scattered
O	over
O	which
O	lay
O	great
O	masses
O	of
O	rock
O	There
O	they
O	saw
O	a
O	large
O	bird
O	hovering
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	it
O	flew
O	round
O	and
O	round
O	just
O	above
O	them
O	always
O	sinking
O	lower
O	and
O	lower
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	it
O	settled
O	down
O	by
O	a
O	rock
O	not
O	far
O	distant
O	Directly
O	after
O	they
O	heard
O	a
O	piercing
O	wailing
O	cry
O	They
O	ran
O	up
O	and
O	saw
O	with
O	horror
O	that
O	the
O	eagle
O	had
O	seized
O	their
O	old
O	acquaintance
O	the
C	dwarf
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	carry
O	him
O	off
O	The
O	compassionate
O	children
O	instantly
O	seized
O	hold
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	man
O	held
O	him
O	fast
O	and
O	struggled
O	so
O	long
O	that
O	the
O	eagle
O	let
O	his
O	prey
O	go
O	When
O	the
C	dwarf
O	had
O	recovered
O	from
O	his
O	first
O	fright
O	he
O	called
O	out
O	in
O	his
O	shrill
O	voice
O	Could
O	not
O	you
O	deal
O	rather
O	more
O	gently
O	with
O	me
O	You
O	have
O	torn
O	my
O	thin
O	coat
O	all
O	in
O	tatters
O	awkward
O	clumsy
O	creatures
O	that
O	you
O	are
O	Then
O	he
O	took
O	a
O	sack
O	of
O	precious
O	stones
O	and
O	slipped
O	behind
O	the
O	rock
O	again
O	into
O	his
O	den
O	The
O	girls
O	who
O	were
O	used
O	to
O	his
O	ingratitude
O	went
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	and
O	completed
O	their
O	business
O	in
O	the
O	town
O	As
O	they
O	were
O	coming
O	home
O	again
O	over
O	the
O	heath
O	they
O	surprised
O	the
C	dwarf
O	who
O	had
O	emptied
O	his
O	sack
O	of
O	precious
O	stones
O	on
O	a
O	little
O	clean
O	place
O	and
O	had
O	not
O	thought
O	that
O	any
O	one
O	would
O	come
O	by
O	there
O	so
O	late
O	The
O	evening
O	sun
O	shone
O	on
O	the
O	glittering
O	stones
O	which
O	looked
O	so
O	beautiful
O	in
O	all
O	their
O	colours
O	that
O	the
O	children
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	standing
O	still
O	to
O	gaze
O	Why
O	do
O	you
O	stand
O	there
O	gaping
O	cried
O	the
C	dwarf
O	his
O	face
O	turning
O	vermilion

O	he
O	was
O	going
O	away
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	loud
O	roaring
O	and
O	a
O	black
C	bear
O	trotted
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	towards
O	them
O	The
C	dwarf
O	sprang
O	up
O	terrified
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	to
O	his
O	lurking
O	hole
O	again
O	the
C	bear
O	was
O	already
O	close
O	upon
O	him
O	Then
O	he
O	called
O	out
O	in
O	anguish
O	Dear
O	Mr
C	bear
O	spare
O	me
O	and
O	you
O	shall

O	with
O	a
O	poor

O	little
O	fellow
O	like
O	me
O	You
O	would
O	scarcely
O	feel
O	me
O	between
O	your
O	teeth
O	Rather
O	seize
O	those
O	two
O	wicked
O	girls
O	they
O	will
O	be
O	tender
O	morsels
O	for
O	you
O	as
O	fat
O	as
O	young
O	quails
O	pray
O	eat
O	them
O	at
O	once
O	The
C	bear
O	without
O	troubling
O	himself
O	to
O	answer
O	gave
O	the
O	malicious
O	creature
O	one
O	single
O	stroke
O	with
O	his
O	paw
O	and
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	move
O	again
O	The
O	girls
O	had
O	run
O	away
O	but
O	the
C	bear
O	called
O	after
O	them
O	and
O	do
O	not
O	be
O	frightened
O	wait
O	I
O	will
O	go
O	with
O	you
O	Recognising
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	their
O	old
O	friend
O	they
O	stood
O	still
O	and
O	when
O	the
C	bear
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	them
O	his
O	skin
O	suddenly
O	fell
O	off
O	and
O	behold
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	a
C	bear
O	but
O	a
O	handsome
O	young
O	man
O	dressed
O	all
O	in
O	gold
O	I
O	am
O	a
O	king
O	s
O	son
O	said
O	he
O	I
O	was
O	changed
O	by
O	the
O	wicked
C	dwarf
O	who
O	had
O	stolen
O	all
O	my
O	treasures
O	into
O	a
O	wild
C	bear
O	and
O	obliged
O	to

O	should
O	be
O	freed
O	by
O	his
O	death
O	Now
O	he
O	has
O	received
O	his
O	punishment
O	So
O	they
O	all
O	went
O	home
O	together
O	to
O	the
O	widow
O	s
O	cottage
O	and
O	was
O	married
O	to
O	the
O	prince
O	and
O	to
O	his
O	brother
O	They
O	divided
O	between
O	them
O	the

O	treasures
O	which
O	the
C	dwarf
O	had
O	amassed
O	The

O	she
O	took
O	the

O	a

O	deified
O	Even
O	if
O	it
O	be
O	so
O	it
O	is
O	good
O	to
O	think
O	that
O	a
O	race
O	of

O	could
O	worship
O	one
O	whose

O	But
O	yet
O	another

C	Odin
O	would

O	answered
O	he
O	asked
O	refuse

O	to

O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	the

O	of

O	And
C	Odin
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	mount
O	his

O	he
O	found

O	Thus
O	he
O	tried

O	and
O	to

O	to

O	Only
O	one
O	among

O	as

O	North
O	Sea
O	beat

O	in

O	had
O	malice
O	in
O	his
O	heart
O	as
O	he
O	beheld
O	the
O	wonder
O	In
O	the
O	evil
O	heart
O	of
C	Loki
O	there
O	came
O	a
O	desire
O	to
O	overthrow
O	the
O	god
O	who
O	was
O	beloved
O	by
O	all
O	gods
O	and
O	by
O	all
O	men
O	He
O	hated
O	him
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	pure
O	and
O	the
O	mind
O	of
C	Loki
O	was
O	as
O	a
O	stream
O	into
O	which
O	all
O	the
O	filth
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	is
O	discharged
O	He
O	hated
O	him
O	because
C	Baldur
O	was
O	truth
O	and
O	loyalty
O	and
O	he
C	Loki
O	was
O	treachery
O	and
O	dishonour
O	He
O	hated
O	him
O	because
O	to
C	Loki
O	there
O	came
O	never
O	a
O	thought
O	that
O	was
O	not
O	full
O	of
O	meanness
O	and
O	greed
O	and
O	cruelty
O	and
O	vice
O	and
C	Baldur
O	was
O	indeed
O	one
O	peur
O	et
O	sans
O	Thus
C	Loki
O	taking
O	upon
O	himself
O	the
O	form
O	of
O	a
O	woman
O	went
O	to
O	Fensalir
O	the

O	all
O	silver
O	and
O	gold
O	where
O	dwelt
C	Freya
O	the

O	of
C	Baldur
O	The
O	goddess
O	sat
O	in
O	happy
O	majesty
O	spinning
O	the
O	clouds
O	and
O	when
C	Loki
O	apparently
O	a
O	gentle
O	old
O	woman
O	passed
O	by
O	where
O	she
O	sat
O	and
O	then
O	paused
O	and
O	asked
O	as
O	if
O	amazed
O	what
O	were
O	the
O	shouts
O	of
O	merriment
O	that
O	she

O	the

O	goddess
O	replied
O	All

O	on

O	have
O	sworn
O	to
O	me
O	never
O	to
O	injure
C	Baldur
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	gods
O	use
O	their
O	weapons
O	against
O	him
O	in
O	vain
C	Baldur
O	is
O	safe
O	for
O	evermore
O	All
O	things
O	queried
C	Loki
O	And
C	Freya
O	answered
O	All
O	things
O	but
O	the
O	mistletoe
O	No
O	harm
O	can
O	come
O	to
O	him
O	from
O	a
O	thing
O	so
O	weak
O	that
O	it
O	only
O	lives
O	by
O	the
O	lives
O	of
O	others
O	Then
O	the
O	vicious
O	heart
O	of
C	Loki
O	grew
O	joyous
O	Quickly
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	where
O	the
O	mistletoe
O	grew
O	cut
O	a
O	slender
O	green
O	branch
O	shaped
O	it
O	into
O	a
O	point
O	and
O	sought
O	the
O	blind
O	god
C	Hodur
C	Hodur
O	stood
O	aside
O	while
O	the
O	other
O	gods
O	merrily
O	pursued
O	their
O	sport
O	Why
O	dost
O	thou
O	not
O	take
O	aim
O	at
C	Baldur
O	with
O	a
O	weapon
O	that
O	fails
O	and
O	so
O	join
O	in
O	the
O	laughter
O	asked
C	Loki
O	And
C	Hodur
O	sadly
O	made
O	answer
O	Well
O	dost
O	thou
O	know
O	that
O	darkness
O	is
O	my
O	lot
O	nor
O	have
O	I
O	ought
O	to
O	cast
O	at
O	my
O	brother
O	Then
C	Loki
O	placed
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	the
O	shaft
O	of
O	mistletoe
O	and
O	guided
O	his
O	aim
O	and
O	well
O	and
O	surely
C	Hodur
O	cast
O	the
O	dart
O	He
O	waited
O	then
O	for
O	the
O	merry
O	laughter
O	that
O	followed
O	ever
O	on
O	the
O	onslaught
O	of
O	those
O	against

O	The

O	in

O	brought
C	Freya
O	to

C	Freya
O	s
O	grief
O	was
O	a
O	grief
O	that
O	refused
O	to
O	be
O	comforted
O	but
O	when
O	the

O	knew
O	not

O	she
O	quickly

C	Hel
O	a

O	then
O	if
C	Baldur

O	here
C	Baldur
O	stops
O	Let

O	The

C	Baldur
