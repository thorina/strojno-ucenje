O	then

O	placed
O	the

O	it

C	bobo

O	the

O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	late
O	but
O	he

O	things
O	should
O	be
O	exactly
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	before
O	he
O	opened
O	the
O	cover
O	of
O	the
O	ebony
O	box
O	something
O	like
O	a
O	winged
O	white
O	flame
O	escaped
O	from
O	it
O	and
O	flew
O	hissing
O	through
O	the
O	air
O	to
O	the
O	sun
O	as
O	for
O	the
O	sun
O	itself
O	turning
O	round
O	like
O	a
O	cartwheel
O	and
O	hissing

O	and
O	sure
O	enough
O	there
O	was
O	brave
O	little
C	tilda
O	standing
O	alone
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	field
O	waiting
O	for
O	the
C	dragon
O	to
O	come
O	and
O	take
O	her
O	away
O	lumbering
O	heavily
O	along
O	like
O	a
O	monstrous
O	turtle
O	and
O	snorting
O	blue
O	smoke
O	the
C	dragon
O	was
O	advancing
O	toward
O	her
C	bobo
O	ran
O	down
O	into
O	the
O	field
O	and
O	stood
O	beside
C	tilda
O	ready
O	to
O	defend
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	end
O	the
C	dragon
O	came
O	nearer
O	and
O	nearer
O	suddenly
O	angered
O	by
O	the
O	sight
O	of
C	bobo
O	and
O	his
O	drawn
O	sword
O	he
O	roared
O	angrily
O	but
O	continued
O	to
O	approach
C	bobo
O	struck
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	his
O	sword
O	the
O	blade
O	broke
O	upon
O	his
O	steely
O	scales
O	the
C	dragon
O	roared
O	again
O	now
O	just
O	as
O	the
C	dragon
O	s
O	mouth
O	was
O	its
O	widest
C	bobo
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	searching
O	his
O	pockets
O	desperately
O	hurled
O	into
O	it
O	the
O	lost
O	temper
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	perfectly
O	terrific
O	bang
O	as
O	if
O	a
O	million
O	balloons
O	had
O	blown
O	up
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	for

O	blown
O	up
O	the
O	lost
O	temper
O	had
O	finished
O	him
O	only
O	one
O	fragment
O	of
O	him
O	a
O	tiny
O	bit
O	of
O	a
O	claw

O	found
O	everybody
O	you
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	began
O	to
O	cry
O	hurrah
O	and
O	hooray
O	and
O	soon
O	they
O	were
O	firing
O	off
O	cannon
O	and
O	ringing
O	all
O	the
O	bells
O	then
C	tilda
O	s
O	father
O	took
O	her
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	real
O	princess
O	the
O	grand
O	cross
O	of

O	conferred
O	upon

O	by
C	princess
C	zenza
O	who

O	asked
O	his

O	treated
O	him
O	so
O	shabbily
O	this
C	bobo
O	gave
O	readily
O	a
O	wonderful
O	fete
O	was
O	held
O	when
O	the
O	rejoicings

O	over
C	bobo
O	and
C	tilda
O	were
O	married
O	and
O	lived
O	happily
O	together
O	all
O	their
O	days
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	rescued
C	sir
C	percivale
O	from
O	the
O	twenty
O	knights
O	who
O	beset

C	sir
C	galahad
O	rode
O	on

O	till
O	nightfall
O	when
O	he
O	sought
O	shelter
O	at
O	a
O	little
O	hermitage
O	thither
O	there
O	came
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	a
O	damsel
O	who
O	desired
O	to
O	speak
O	with
C	sir
C	galahad
O	so
O	he
O	arose
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	her
C	galahad
O	said
O	she
O	arm

O	so
O	they
O	rode
O	together
O	until
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	to
O	the
O	seashore
O	and
O	there
O	the
O	damsel
O	showed
C	galahad
O	a
O	great
O	ship
O	into
O	which
O	he
O	must
O	enter
O	then
O	she

O	they
O	abode
O	in

O	until

O	then
O	as

O	all
O	sat
O	at

O	that
O	night
O	suddenly
O	the

O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	a

O	light
O	and
O	the

O	all
O	in

O	there
O	after

O	they
O	found
O	it
O	ruled
O	by
O	a

O	gathered
O	together
O	to

O	their
C	king
O	and
O	while
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	council
O	came
O	a
O	voice
O	bidding
O	them
O	take
O	as
O	their
C	king
O	the
O	youngest
O	of
O	the
O	three
O	knights
O	whom
C	estorause
O	had
O	thrown
O	into

O	so
O	in

O	they
O	hastened
O	to
O	the

O	and
O	releasing
O	the

O	knights
O	made
C	galahad
C	king
O	as
O	the

O	had
O	bidden
O	them
O	thus
C	sir
C	galahad
O	became

O	of
O	the

O	in
O	far
O	babylon
O	he

O	morning
O	early
O	he
O	and
O	the

O	two
O	knights
O	his
O	fellows
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	chapel
O	and
O	there
O	they
O	saw
O	kneeling
O	in
O	prayer
O	an
O	aged
O	man
O	robed
O	as
O	a
C	bishop
O	and
O	round
O	him
O	hovered
O	many
O	angels
O	the
O	knights
O	fell
O	on
O	their
O	knees
O	in
O	awe
O	and
O	reverence
O	whereupon
O	he
O	that

O	a
C	bishop
O	turned
O	to
O	them
O	and
O	said
O	i

O	and

O	am
O	come
O	to

O	you
O	the

O	the

O	vessel
O	in
O	a

O	such
O	as
O	almost
O	blinded
O	them
C	sir
C	bors
O	and
C	sir
C	percivale
O	when
O	at
O	length
O	they
O	were
O	recovered
O	from
O	the
O	brightness
O	of
O	that
O	glory
O	looked
O	up
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	the
O	holy
C	joseph
O	and
O	the
O	wondrous
O	vessel
O	had
O	passed
O	from
O	their
O	sight
O	then
O	they
O	went
O	to
C	sir
C	galahad
O	where
O	he
O	still
O	knelt
O	as
O	in
O	prayer
O	and
O	behold
O	he
O	was
O	dead
O	for
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	with

O	even

O	in
O	the
O	moment
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	the
O	vision
O	his
O	soul
O	had
O	gone
O	back
O	to
O	god
O	so
O	the
O	two
O	knights
O	buried
O	him
O	in
O	that
O	far
O	city
O	themselves
O	mourning
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	people
O	with

O	and
O	immediately
O	after

C	percivale
O	put
O	off
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	took
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	a
O	monk
O	living
O	a
O	devout
O	and
O	holy

C	sir
C	bors
O	armed
O	him
O	and
O	bidding
O	farewell
O	to
O	the

O	sailed
O	away
O	until

O	he
O	came

O	to

O	stepmother
O	who

O	upon
C	graciosa
O	she
O	caused

O	standing
O	at
O	the

C	grognon

O	o
C	percinet

O	i
O	not
O	return
O	your

O	it

O	she

O	of

O	be
O	only
O	too
O	happy
O	to
O	become
O	his

O	indeed
O	he
O	felt
O	so
O	sure
O	of

O	that
O	he
O	refurnished
O	the

O	not

O	returned
O	her
O	best
O	thanks
O	to

O	not

O	which
O	the

O	had
O	sent
O	her

O	she

O	a
O	box
O	of
O	english
O	pins
O	which
O	were
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	of

O	returned
O	alone
O	and
O	unsuccessful
O	all
O	the

O	was
O	very
O	much
O	affected
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	himself
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	might
O	now
O	there
O	was
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	household
O	a
O	young
O	gentleman
O	named
C	avenant
O	beautiful
O	as
O	the

O	besides
O	being
O	at
O	once
O	so
O	amiable
O	and
O	so
O	wise
O	that
O	the

O	confided
O	to

O	all
O	his

O	if
O	the

O	to

O	the

O	back
O	with

O	repeated
O	the
O	saying
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	manner
O	that
O	it
O	appeared
O	as
O	if
C	avenant
O	thought
O	so
O	much
O	of
O	himself
O	and
O	his
O	beauty
O	and
O	felt
O	sure
O	the

O	would
O	have
O	followed
O	him
O	all
O	over
O	the

O	which

O	so
O	much
O	that

O	commanded
C	avenant
O	to
O	be
O	imprisoned
O	in
O	a
O	high
O	tower
O	and
O	left
O	to
O	die
O	there
O	of
O	hunger
O	the
O	guards
O	accordingly
O	carried
O	off
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	who
O	had
O	quite
O	forgotten
O	his
O	idle
O	speech
O	and
O	had
O	not
O	the
O	least
O	idea
O	what
O	fault
O	he
O	had
O	committed
O	they
O	him
O	very
O	much
O	and
O	then

O	him
O	with
O	nothing
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	only
O	water
O	to
O	drink
O	this
O	however
O	kept
O	him
O	alive
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	days
O	during
O	which
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	cease
O	to
O	complain
O	aloud
O	and
O	to
O	call
O	upon
O	the
C	king
O	saying
O	o
C	king
O	what
O	harm
O	have
O	i
O	done
O	you
O	have
O	no
O	subject
O	more

O	than
O	i
O	never

O	i
O	had
O	a
O	thought
O	which
O	could
O	offend
O	you
O	and
O	it
O	so
O	befell
O	that
O	the

O	coming
O	by
O	chance
O	or
O	else
O	with
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	remorse
O	past
O	the
O	tower
O	was
O	touched
O	by
O	the
O	voice
O	of
O	the
O	young
C	avenant
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	once
O	so
O	much
O	regarded

O	of

O	overheard
O	these
O	words
O	the
O	tears
O	rushed
O	into

O	o
O	sire
O	what

O	so
O	much
O	about

O	qualities
O	which

O	with
O	me
O	i
O	believe
O	it
O	said
O	the
C	king
O	with
O	an
O	angry
O	look
O	at
O	those
O	who
O	had
O	spoken
O	ill
O	of
O	his
O	favourite
O	he
O	then
O	gave
C	avenant
O	a
O	free
O	pardon
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	back
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	court
O	after

O	much
O	supper
O	as

O	very
O	well
O	please
O	your
O	majesty
O	replied
C	avenant
O	cheerfully
O	i
O	will
O	depart
O	the
C	king
O	overjoyed
O	with
O	his
O	willingness
O	and
O	hopefulness
O	would
O	have
O	furnished
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	still
O	more
O	magnificent
O	equipage
O	and
O	suite
O	than
O	the
O	first
O	ambassador
O	but
C	avenant
O	refused
O	to
O	take
O	anything
O	except
O	a
O	good
O	horse
O	to
O	ride
O	and
O	letters
O	of
O	introduction
O	to
O	the
C	princess
O	s
O	father
O	the
C	king
O	embraced
O	him
O	and
O	eagerly
O	saw
O	him
O	depart
O	it
O	was
O	on
O	a
O	monday
O	morning
O	when
O	without
O	any
O	pomp
O	or
O	show
C	avenant
O	thus
O	started
O	on
O	his
O	mission
O	he
O	rode
O	slowly
O	and
O	meditatively
O	pondering
O	over
O	every
O	possible
O	means
O	of
O	persuading
O	the
C	fair
C	one
C	with
C	golden
C	locks
O	to
O	marry
O	the
C	king
O	but
O	even
O	after
O	several
O	days
O	journey
O	towards
O	her
O	country
O	no
O	clear
O	project
O	had
O	entered
O	into
O	his
O	mind
O	one
O	morning
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	started
O	at
O	break
O	of
O	day
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	great
O	meadow
O	with
O	a
O	stream
O	running
O	through
O	it
O	along
O	which
O	were
O	planted
O	willows
O	and
O	poplars
O	it
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	pleasant
O	rippling
O	stream
O	that
O	he
O	dismounted
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	its
O	banks
O	there
O	he
O	perceived
O	gasping
O	on
O	the
O	grass
O	a
O	large
O	golden
O	carp
O	which
O	in
O	leaping
O	too
O	far
O	after
O	gnats
O	had
O	thrown
O	itself
O	quite
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	and
O	now
O	lay
O	dying
O	on
O	the
O	greensward
C	avenant
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	it
O	and
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	hungry
O	and
O	the
O	fish
O	was
O	very
O	fat
O	and
O	he
O	would
O	well
O	enough
O	have
O	liked
O	it
O	for
O	his
O	breakfast
O	still
O	he
O	lifted
O	it
O	gently
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	back
O	into
O	the
O	stream
O	no
O	sooner
O	had
O	the
O	carp
O	touched
O	the
O	fresh
O	cool
O	water
O	than
O	it
O	revived
O	and
O	swam
O	away
O	but
O	shortly
O	returning
O	it
O	spoke
O	to
O	him
O	from
O	the
O	water
O	in
O	this
O	wise
C	avenant
O	i
O	thank
O	you
O	for
O	your
O	good
O	deed
O	i
O	was
O	dying
O	and
O	you
O	have
O	saved
O	me
O	i
O	will
O	recompense
O	you
O	for
O	this
O	one
O	day
O	after
O	this
O	pretty
O	little
O	speech
O	the
O	fish
O	popped
O	down
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	stream
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	carp
O	leaving
C	avenant
O	very
O	much
O	astonished
O	as
O	was
O	natural
O	another
O	day
O	he
O	met
O	with
O	a
O	raven
O	that
O	was
O	in
O	great
O	distress
O	being
O	pursued
O	by
O	an
O	eagle
O	which
O	would
O	have
O	swallowed
O	him
O	up
O	in
O	no
O	time
O	see
O	thought
C	avenant
O	how
O	the
O	stronger
O	oppress
O	the
O	weaker
O	what
O	right
O	has
O	an
O	eagle
O	to
O	eat
O	up
O	a
O	raven
O	so
O	taking
O	his
O	bow
O	and
O	arrow
O	which
O	he
O	always
O	carried
O	he
O	shot
O	the
O	eagle
O	dead
O	and
O	the
O	raven
O	delighted
O	perched
O	in
O	safety
O	on
O	an
O	opposite
O	tree
C	avenant
O	screeched
O	he
O	though
O	not
O	in
O	the
O	sweetest
O	voice
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	you
O	have
O	generously
O	succoured
O	me
O	a
O	poor
O	miserable
O	raven
O	i
O	am
O	not
O	ungrateful
O	and
O	i
O	will
O	recompense
O	you
O	one
O	day
O	thank
O	you
O	said
C	avenant
O	and
O	continued
O	his
O	road
O	entering
O	in
O	a
O	thick
O	wood
O	so
O	dark
O	with
O	the
O	shadows
O	of
O	early
O	morning
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	scarcely
O	find
O	his
O	way
O	he
O	heard
O	an
C	owl
O	hooting
O	like
O	an
C	owl
O	in
O	great
O	tribulation
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	caught
O	by
O	the
O	nets
O	spread
O	by
O	birdcatchers
O	to
O	entrap
O	finches
O	larks
O	and
O	other
O	small
O	birds
O	what
O	a
O	pity
O	thought
C	avenant
O	that
O	men
O	must
O	always
O	torment
O	poor
O	birds
O	and
O	beasts
O	who
O	have
O	done
O	them
O	no
O	harm
O	so
O	he
O	took
O	out
O	his
O	knife
O	cut
O	the
O	net
O	and
O	let
O	the
C	owl
O	go
O	free
O	she
O	went
O	sailing
O	up
O	into
O	the
O	air
O	but
O	immediately
O	returned
O	hovering
O	over
O	his
O	head
O	on
O	her
O	brown
O	wings
C	avenant
O	said
O	she
O	at
O	daylight
O	the
O	birdcatchers
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	here
O	and
O	i
O	should
O	have
O	been
O	caught
O	and
O	killed
O	i
O	have
O	a
O	grateful
O	heart
O	i
O	will
O	recompense
O	you
O	one
O	day
O	these
O	were
O	the
O	three
O	principal
O	adventures
O	that
O	befell
C	avenant
O	on
O	his
O	way
O	to
O	the
O	kingom
O	of
O	the
C	fair
C	one
C	with
C	golden
C	locks
O	arrived
O	there
O	he
O	dressed
O	himself
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	care
O	in
O	a
O	habit
O	of
O	silver
O	brocade
O	and
O	a
O	hat
O	adorned
O	with
O	plumes
O	of
O	scarlet
O	and
O	white
O	he
O	threw
O	over

O	the

O	into

O	well
O	corked
C	avenant
O	thanked

O	and
O	joyfully
O	took
O	once
O	more
O	the

O	to
O	the
O	city
O	the
C	fair
C	one
C	with

O	had
O	no

O	to

O	she
O	consented
O	to

O	back
O	with

O	her
O	suite
O	to
O	his
O	master

O	on
O	the

O	thither
O	she
O	saw
O	so
O	much
O	of
O	him
O	and
O	found
O	him
O	so
O	charming
O	that
C	avenant
O	might
O	have
O	married
O	her
O	himself
O	had
O	he
O	chosen
O	but
O	he
O	would
O	not

O	been
O	false
O	to
O	his
O	master
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	beauties
O	under
O	the
O	sun
O	at

O	they

O	at
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	city
O	and
O	the
C	fair
C	one
C	with
C	golden
C	locks
O	became
O	his

O	and
O	queen
O	but
O	she
O	still
O	loved
C	avenant
O	in
O	her
O	heart
O	and
O	often
O	said
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	her
O	but
O	for
C	avenant
O	i
O	should
O	not
O	be

O	he

O	done
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	impossible
O	deeds
O	for
O	my
O	sake
O	he
O	has
O	fetched
O	me
O	the

O	of
O	beauty
O	and
O	i
O	shall
O	never
O	grow
O	old
O	in
O	short
O	i
O	owe
O	him
O	everything
O	and
O	she
O	praised
O	him
O	in
O	this
O	sort
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	at
O	length
O	the
C	king
O	became
O	jealous
O	and
O	though
C	avenant
O	gave
O	him
O	not
O	the
O	slightest
O	cause
O	of
O	offence
O	he
O	shut
O	him
O	up
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	high
O	tower
O	once
O	more
O	but
O	with
O	irons
O	on
O	his
O	hands
O	and
O	feet
O	and
O	a
O	cruel
O	jailer
O	besides
O	who
O	fed
O	him
O	with
O	bread
O	and
O	water
O	only
O	his
O	sole
O	companion
O	was
O	his
O	little
C	dog
C	cabriole
O	when
O	the
C	fair
C	one
C	with
C	golden
C	locks
O	heard
O	of
O	this
O	she
O	reproached
O	her
O	husband
O	for
O	his
O	ingratitude
O	and
O	then
O	throwing
O	herself
O	at
O	his
O	knees
O	implored
O	that
C	avenant
O	might
O	be
O	set
O	free
O	but
O	the
C	king
O	only
O	said
O	she
O	loves
O	him
O	and
O	refused
O	her
O	prayer
O	the
O	queen
O	entreated
O	no
O	more
O	but
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	deep
O	melancholy
O	when
O	the
C	king
O	saw
O	it
O	he
O	thought
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	care
O	for
O	him
O	because
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	handsome
O	enough
O	and
O	that
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	wash
O	his
O	face
O	with
O	her
O	water
O	of
O	beauty
O	it
O	would
O	make
O	her
O	love
O	him
O	more
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	she
O	kept
O	it
O	in
O	a
O	cabinet
O	in
O	her
O	chamber
O	where
O	she
O	could
O	find
O	it
O	always
O	now
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	a
O	in
O	cleaning
O	out
O	this
O	cabinet
O	had
O	the
O	very
O	day
O	before
O	knocked
O	down
O	the
O	phial
O	which
O	was
O	broken
O	in
O	a
O	thousand
O	pieces
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	contents
O	were
O	lost
O	very
O	much
O	alarmed
O	she
O	then
O	remembered
O	seeing
O	in
O	a
O	cabinet
O	belonging
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	a
O	similar
O	phial
O	this
O	she
O	fetched
O	and
O	put
O	in
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	one
O	in
O	which
O	was
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	beauty
O	but
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	phial
O	contained
O	the
O	water
O	of
O	death
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	poison
O	used
O	to
O	destroy
O	great
O	criminals
O	that
O	is
O	noblemen
O	gentlemen
O	and
O	such
O	like
O	instead
O	of
O	hanging
O	them
O	or
O	cutting
O	their
O	heads
O	off
O	like
O	common
O	people
O	they
O	were
O	compelled
O	to
O	wash
O	their
O	faces
O	with
O	this
O	water
O	upon
O	which
O	they
O	fell
O	asleep
O	and
O	woke
O	no
O	more
O	so
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	taking
O	up
O	this
O	phial
O	believing
O	it
O	to

O	clustered
O	round
O	the

O	and
O	lovely
O	widow
O	whispered
O	softly
O	to
O	madam
O	do
O	not
O	forget
O	poor
C	avenant
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	disposed
O	to
O	do
O	so
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	his
O	little
C	dog
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	enough
O	to
O	remind
O	her
O	of
O	him
O	his
O	many
O	sufferings
O	and
O	his
O	great
O	fidelity
O	she
O	rose
O	up
O	without

O	to
O	anybody

O	confined
O	there
O	with

O	time
O	in

O	at

O	the

O	the

O	this
O	was
O	not
O	an

O	opening
O	for
O	a

C	alice
O	replied
O	rather
O	shyly
O	hardly

O	tone

O	again
O	this

O	until
O	it
O	chose
O	to
O	speak
O	again
O	in
O	a
O	minute
O	or
O	two
O	the

O	out
O	of

O	and
O	yawned
O	once
O	or

O	itself
O	then
O	it
O	got
O	down
O	off
O	the
O	mushroom
O	and
O	crawled
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	grass
O	merely
O	remarking

C	alice
O	to
O	herself
O	of
O	the
O	mushroom
O	said
O	the
C	caterpillar
O	just
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	had
O	asked
O	it
O	aloud
O	and
O	in
O	another
O	moment
O	it
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	sight
C	alice
O	remained
O	looking
O	thoughtfully
O	at
O	the
O	mushroom
O	for
O	a
O	minute
O	trying
O	to
O	make
O	out
O	which
O	were
O	the
O	two
O	sides
O	of
O	it
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	perfectly
O	round
O	she
O	found
O	this
O	a
O	very
O	difficult
O	question
O	however
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	stretched
O	her
O	arms
O	round
O	it
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	they
O	would
O	go
O	and
O	broke
O	off
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	the
O	edge
O	with
O	each
O	hand
O	and
O	now
O	which
O	is
O	which
O	she
O	said
O	to
O	herself
O	and
O	nibbled
O	a
O	little
O	of
O	the
O	bit
O	to
O	try
O	the
O	effect
O	the
O	next
O	moment
O	she
O	felt
O	a
O	violent
O	blow
O	underneath
O	her
O	chin
O	it
O	had
O	struck
O	her
O	foot
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	frightened
O	by
O	this
O	very
O	sudden
O	change
O	but
O	she
O	felt
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	time
O	to
O	be
O	lost
O	as
O	she
O	was
O	shrinking
O	rapidly
O	so
O	she
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	at
O	once
O	to
O	eat
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	other
O	bit
O	her
O	chin
O	was
O	pressed
O	so
O	closely
O	against
O	her
O	foot
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	hardly
O	room
O	to
O	open
O	her
O	mouth
O	but
O	she
O	did
O	it
O	at
O	last
O	and
O	managed
O	to
O	swallow
O	a
O	morsel
O	of
O	the
O	bit
O	come
O	my
O	head
O	s
O	free
O	at
O	last
O	said
C	alice
O	in
O	a
O	tone
O	of
O	delight
O	which
O	changed
O	into
O	alarm
O	in
O	another
O	moment
O	when
O	she
O	found
O	that
O	her
O	shoulders
O	were
O	nowhere
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	all
O	she
O	could
O	see
O	when
O	she
O	looked
O	down
O	was
O	an
O	immense
O	length
O	of
O	neck
O	which
O	seemed
O	to
O	rise
O	like
O	a
O	stalk
O	out
O	a
O	sea
O	of
O	green
O	leaves
O	that
O	lay
O	far
O	below
O	her
O	what
O	all
O	that
O	green
O	stuff

C	alice
O	and
O	where
O	my

O	got
O	to

O	oh
O	my
O	poor
O	hands
O	how
O	is

O	i

O	see
O	you
O	she
O	was
O	moving
O	them
O	about
O	as

O	spoke
O	but
O	no
O	result
O	seemed
O	to
O	follow
O	except
O	a
O	little
O	shaking
O	among
O	the
O	distant
O	green
O	leaves
O	as
O	there
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	no
O	chance
O	of
O	getting
O	her
O	hands
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	head
O	she
O	tried
O	to
O	get
O	her
O	head
O	down
O	to
O	and
O	was
O	delighted
O	to
O	find
O	that
O	her
O	neck
O	would
O	bend
O	about
O	easily
O	in
O	any
O	direction
O	like
O	a
O	serpent
O	she
O	had
O	just
O	succeeded
O	in
O	curving
O	it
O	down
O	into
O	a
O	graceful
O	zigzag
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	dive
O	in
O	among
O	the
O	leaves
O	which
O	she
O	found
O	to
O	be
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	tops
O	of
O	the
O	trees
O	under
O	which

O	had
O	been
O	wandering

O	sharp
O	hiss
O	made

O	back
O	in

O	hurry
O	a
O	large
C	pigeon
O	had
O	flown
O	into

O	violently

O	indignantly
O	let

O	i
O	say
O	again
O	repeated
O	the

O	but
O	in
O	a
O	more
O	subdued
O	tone
O	and

O	with
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	sob
O	i

O	tried
O	every

O	just
O	as
O	i
O	d
O	taken
O	the

O	in
O	the
O	wood

O	raw
O	well

O	then
O	said
O	the
C	pigeon
O	in
O	a
O	sulky
O	tone
O	as
O	it
O	settled
O	down
O	again
O	into

C	alice
O	crouched
O	down
O	among

O	as
O	well
O	as
O	she
O	could
O	for
O	her
O	neck
O	kept
O	getting
O	entangled
O	among
O	the
O	branches
O	and
O	every
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	she
O	had
O	to
O	stop
O	and
O	untwist
O	it
O	after
O	a
O	while
O	she
O	remembered

O	she
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	very
O	carefully
O	nibbling
O	first
O	at
O	one
O	and
O	then
O	at
O	the
O	other
O	and
O	growing
O	sometimes
O	taller
O	and
O	sometimes
O	shorter
O	until
O	she
O	had
O	succeeded
O	in
O	bringing
O	herself
O	down
O	to
O	her
O	usual
O	height
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	long
O	since
O	she
O	had
O	been
O	anything
O	near
O	the
O	right
O	size
O	that
O	it
O	felt
O	quite
O	strange
O	at
O	first
O	but
O	she
O	got
O	used
O	to
O	it
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	and
O	began
O	talking
O	to
O	herself
O	as
O	usual
O	come
O	there
O	s
O	half
O	my
O	plan
O	done
O	now
O	how
O	puzzling
O	all
O	these
O	changes
O	are
O	i
O	m
O	never
O	sure
O	what
O	i
O	m
O	going
O	to
O	be
O	from
O	one
O	minute
O	to
O	another
O	however
O	i
O	ve
O	got
O	back
O	to
O	my
O	right
O	size
O	the
O	next
O	thing
O	is
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	that
O	beautiful
O	that
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	i
O	wonder
O	as
O	she
O	said
O	this
O	she
O	came
O	suddenly
O	upon
O	an
O	open
O	place
O	with
O	a
O	little
O	house
O	in
O	it
O	about
O	four
O	feet
O	high
O	whoever
O	lives
O	there
O	thought
C	alice
O	it
O	ll
O	never
O	do
O	to
O	come
O	upon
O	them
O	size
O	why
O	i
O	should
O	frighten
O	them
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	wits
O	so
O	she
O	began
O	nibbling
O	at
O	the
O	bit
O	again
O	and
O	did
O	not
O	venture
O	to
O	go
O	near
O	the
O	house
O	till
O	she
O	had
O	brought
O	herself
O	down
O	to
O	nine
O	inches
O	high
O	long
O	ago
O	there
O	lived
O	a
O	monarch
O	who
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	very
O	honest
O	man
O	that
O	his
O	subjects
O	entitled
O	him
O	the
C	good
C	king
O	one
O	day
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	out
O	hunting
O	a
O	little
O	white
O	rabbit
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	half
O	killed
O	by
O	his
O	hounds
O	leaped
O	right
O	into
O	his
O	majesty
O	s
O	arms
O	said
O	he
O	caressing
O	it
O	this
O	poor
O	creature
O	has
O	put
O	itself
O	under
O	my
O	protection
O	and
O	i
O	will
O	allow
O	no
O	one
O	to
O	injure
O	it
O	so
O	he
O	carried
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	palace
O	had
O	prepared
O	for
O	it
O	a
O	neat
O	little
O	with
O	abundance
O	of
O	the
O	daintiest
O	food
O	such
O	as
O	rabbits
O	love
O	and
O	there
O	he
O	left
O	it
O	the
O	same
O	night
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	alone
O	in
O	his
O	chamber
O	there
O	appeared
O	to
O	him
O	a
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	she
O	was
O	dressed
O	neither
O	in
O	gold
O	nor
O	silver
O	nor
O	brocade
O	but
O	her
O	flowing
O	robes
O	were
O	white
O	as
O	snow
O	and
O	she
O	wore
O	a
O	garland
O	of
O	white
O	roses
O	on
O	her
O	head
O	the
C	good
C	king
O	was
O	greatly
O	astonished
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	for
O	his
O	door
O	was
O	locked
O	and
O	he
O	wondered
O	how
O	so
O	dazzling
O	a
O	lady
O	could
O	possibly
O	enter
O	but
O	she
O	soon
O	removed
O	his
O	doubts

O	wood
O	where
O	you
O	were
O	hunting
O	i
O	took

O	therefore

O	rabbit
O	and

O	refuge
O	in
O	your

O	said
O	the
C	king
O	sighing
O	still
O	he
O	felt
O	that

O	something
O	gained
O	for

O	after

C	prince
C	cherry
O	was
O	sleeping
O	in

O	chamber
O	when
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	same
O	dazzling
O	vision
O	of
O	the
C	fairy
C	candide
O	i
O	promised
O	your
O	father

O	in

O	of
O	this
O	take
O	what
O	i
O	now
O	give
O	you
O	and
O	she
O	placed
O	a
O	small
O	gold
O	ring
O	upon
O	his
O	finger
O	poor
O	as
O	it
O	looks
O	it
O	is
O	more
O	precious
O	than
O	diamonds
O	for
O	whenever
O	you
O	do
O	ill
O	it
O	will
O	prick
O	your

O	continue
O	in
O	evil
O	you

O	enemy
O	so
O	saying
O	she
O	disappeared
O	leaving
C	cherry
O	in
O	such
O	amazement
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	believed
O	it
O	all
O	a
O	dream
O	save
O	for
O	the
O	ring
O	on
O	his
O	finger
O	he
O	was
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	so
O	good
O	that
O	the
O	ring
O	never
O	pricked
O	him
O	at
O	all
O	and
O	this
O	made
O	him
O	so
O	cheerful
O	and
O	pleasant
O	in
O	his
O	humour
O	that
O	everybody
O	called
O	him
O	happy
C	prince
C	cherry
O	but
O	one
O	unlucky
O	day
O	he
O	was
O	out
O	hunting
O	and
O	found
O	no
O	sport
O	which
O	vexed
O	him
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	showed
O	his
O	ill
O	temper
O	by
O	his
O	looks
O	and
O	ways
O	he
O	fancied
O	his
O	ring
O	felt
O	very
O	tight
O	and
O	uncomfortable
O	but
O	as
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	prick
O	him
O	he
O	took
O	no
O	heed
O	of
O	this
O	until
O	his
O	palace
O	his
O	little
O	pet
C	dog
C	bibi
O	jumped
O	up
O	upon
O	him
O	and
O	was
O	sharply
O	told
O	to
O	get
O	away
O	the
O	creature
O	accustomed
O	to
O	nothing
O	but
O	caresses
O	tried
O	to
O	attract
O	his
O	attention
O	by
O	pulling
O	at
O	his
O	garments
O	when
C	prince
C	cherry
O	turned
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	a
O	severe
O	kick
O	at
O	this
O	moment
O	he
O	felt
O	in
O	his
O	finger
O	a
O	prick
O	like
O	a
O	pin
O	what
O	nonsense
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	himself
O	the
O	fairy
O	must
O	be
O	making
O	game
O	of
O	me
O	why
O	what
O	great
O	evil
O	have
O	i
O	done
O	i
O	the
O	master
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	empire
O	cannot
O	i
O	kick
O	my
O	own
C	dog
O	a
O	voice
O	replied
O	or
O	else
C	prince
C	cherry
O	imagined
O	it
O	no
O	sire
O	the
O	master
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	empire
O	has
O	a
O	right
O	to
O	do
O	good
O	but
O	not
O	evil
O	i
O	a
O	fairy
O	am
O	as
O	much
O	above
O	you
O	as
O	you
O	are
O	above
O	your
C	dog
O	i
O	might
O	punish
O	you
O	kill
O	you
O	if
O	i
O	chose
O	but
O	i
O	prefer
O	leaving
O	you
O	to
O	amend
O	your
O	ways
O	you
O	have
O	been
O	guilty
O	of
O	three
O	faults
O	bad
O	temper
O	passion
O	cruelty
O	do
O	better
O	the
C	prince
O	promised
O	and
O	kept
O	his
O	word
O	awhile
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	brought
O	up
O	by
O	a
O	foolish
O	nurse
O	who
O	indulged
O	him
O	in
O	every
O	way
O	and
O	was
O	always
O	telling
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	be
O	a
C	king
O	one
O	day
O	when
O	he
O	might
O	do
O	as
O	he
O	liked
O	in
O	all
O	things
O	he
O	found
O	out
O	now
O	that
O	even
O	a
C	king
O	cannot
O	always
O	do
O	that
O	it
O	vexed
O	him
O	and
O	made
O	him
O	angry
O	his
O	ring
O	began
O	to
O	prick
O	him
O	so
O	often
O	that
O	his
O	little
O	finger
O	was
O	continually
O	bleeding
O	he
O	disliked
O	this
O	as
O	was
O	natural
O	and
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	consider
O	whether
O	it
O	would
O	not
O	be
O	easier
O	to
O	throw
O	the
O	ring
O	away
O	altogether
O	than
O	to
O	be
O	constantly
O	annoyed
O	by
O	it
O	it
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	queer
O	thing
O	for
O	a
C	king
O	to
O	have
O	always
O	a
O	spot
O	of
O	blood
O	on
O	his
O	finger
O	at
O	last
O	unable
O	to
O	put
O	up
O	with
O	it
O	any
O	more
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	ring
O	off
O	and
O	hid
O	it
O	where
O	he
O	would
O	never
O	see
O	it
O	and
O	believed
O	himself
O	the

O	very
O	obedient
O	to

O	bread
O	and
O	that
O	very
O	sparingly
O	so
O	poor
C	cherry
O	was
O	sometimes
O	nearly
O	starved
O	one
O	day
O	when
O	they
O	gave
O	him
O	his
O	crust
O	for
O	breakfast
O	a
O	fancy
O	seized
O	him
O	to
O	go
O	and
O	eat
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	so
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	bread
O	in
O	his
O	mouth
O	and
O	trotted
O	away
O	towards
O	a
O	stream
O	which
O	he
O	knew
O	and
O	where
O	he
O	sometimes
O	stopped
O	to
O	drink
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	the
O	stream
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	splendid
O	palace
O	glittering
O	with
O	gold
O	and
O	precious
O	stones
O	entering
O	the
O	doors
O	was
O	a
O	crowd
O	of
O	men
O	and
O	women
O	magnificently
O	dressed
O	and
O	within
O	there
O	was
O	singing
O	and
O	dancing
O	and
O	good
O	cheer
O	of
O	all
O	sorts
O	yet
O	however
O	grandly
O	and
O	gaily
O	the
O	people
O	went
O	in
C	cherry
O	noticed
O	that
O	those
O	who
O	came
O	out
O	were
O	pale
O	thin
O	ragged
O	covered
O	with
O	wounds
O	and
O	sores
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	dropped
O	dead
O	at
O	once
O	others
O	dragged
O	themselves
O	on
O	a
O	little
O	way
O	and
O	then
O	lay
O	down
O	dying
O	of
O	hunger
O	and
O	vainly
O	begged
O	a
O	morsel
O	of
O	bread
O	from
O	others
O	who
O	were
O	entering
O	in
O	who
O	never
O	took
O	the
O	least
O	notice
O	of
O	them
C	cherry
O	perceived
O	one
O	woman
O	who
O	was
O	trying
O	feebly
O	to
O	gather
O	and
O	eat
O	some
O	green
O	herbs
O	poor
O	thing
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	himself
O	i
O	know
O	what
O	it
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	hungry
O	and
O	i
O	want
O	my
O	breakfast
O	badly
O	enough
O	but
O	still
O	it
O	will
O	not
O	kill
O	me
O	to
O	wait
O	till
O	and
O	my
O	crust
O	may
O	save
O	the
O	life
O	of
O	this
O	poor
O	woman
O	so
O	the
O	little
C	dog
O	ran
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	dropped
O	his
O	bread
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	she
O	picked
O	it
O	up
O	and
O	ate
O	it
O	with
O	avidity
O	soon
O	she
O	looked
O	quite
O	recovered
O	and
C	cherry
O	delighted
O	was
O	trotting
O	back
O	again
O	to
O	his
O	kennel
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	loud
O	cries
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	young
O	girl
O	dragged
O	by
O	four
O	men
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	trying
O	to
O	compel
O	her
O	to
O	enter
O	oh
O	how
O	he
O	wished
O	himself
O	a
O	monster
O	again
O	as
O	when
O	he
O	slew
O	the
O	tiger
O	for
O	the
O	young
O	girl
O	was
O	no
O	other
O	than
O	his
O	beloved
C	zelia
O	alas
O	what
O	could
O	a
O	poor
O	little
C	dog
O	do
O	to
O	defend
O	her
O	but
O	he
O	ran
O	forward
O	and
O	barked
O	at
O	the
O	men
O	and
O	bit
O	their
O	heels
O	until
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	chased
O	him
O	away
O	with
O	heavy
O	blows
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	lay
O	down
O	outside
O	the
O	determined
O	to
O	watch
O	and
O	see
O	what
O	had
O	become
O	of
C	zelia
O	conscience
O	pricked
O	him
O	now
O	what
O	thought
O	he
O	i
O	am
O	furious
O	against
O	these
O	wicked
O	men
O	who
O	are
O	carrying
O	her
O	away
O	and
O	did
O	i
O	not
O	do
O	the
O	same
O	myself
O	did
O	i
O	not
O	cast

O	into
O	prison
O	and
O	intend
O	to
O	sell
O	her
O	as
O	a
O	slave
O	who
O	knows
O	how
O	much
O	more
O	wickedness
O	i
O	might
O	not

O	to

O	if
O	heaven
O	s
O	justice
O	had
O	not
O	stopped
O	me
O	in
O	time
O	while
O	he
O	lay
O	thinking
O	and
O	repenting
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	window
O	open
O	and
O	saw
C	zelia
O	throw
O	out
O	of
O	it
O	a
O	bit
O	of
O	dainty
O	meat
C	cherry
O	who
O	felt
O	hungry
O	enough
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	was
O	just
O	about
O	to
O	eat
O	it
O	when
O	the
O	woman
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	his
O	crust
O	snatched
O	him
O	up
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	poor
O	little
O	beast
O	cried
O	she
O	patting
O	him
O	every
O	bit
O	of
O	food
O	in
O	that
O	palace
O	is
O	poisoned
O	you
O	shall
O	not
O	touch
O	a
O	morsel
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	the
O	voice
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	repeated
O	again
O	good
O	actions
O	never
O	go
O	unrewarded
O	and
C	cherry
O	found
O	himself
O	changed
O	into
O	a
O	beautiful
O	little
O	white
O	pigeon
O	he
O	remembered
O	with
O	joy
O	that
O	white
O	was
O	the
O	colour
O	of
O	the
C	fairy
C	candide
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	hope
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	taking
O	him
O	into
O	favour
O	again
O	so
O	he
O	stretched
O	his
O	wings
O	delighted
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	now
O	have
O	a
O	chance
O	of
O	approaching
O	his
O	fair
C	zelia
O	he
O	flew
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	and
O	finding
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	open
O	entered
O	and
O	sought
O	everywhere
O	but
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	find
C	zelia
O	then
O	in
O	despair
O	he
O	flew
O	out
O	again
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	over
O	the
O	world
O	until
O	he
O	beheld
O	her
O	once
O	more
O	he
O	took
O	flight
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	traversed
O	many
O	countries
O	swiftly
O	as
O	a
O	bird
O	can
O	but
O	found
O	no
O	trace
O	of
O	his
O	beloved
O	at
O	length
O	in
O	a
O	desert
O	sitting
O	beside
O	an

O	and
O	partaking
O	with

C	cherry
O	saw
O	a
O	poor
O	and
O	recognised
C	zelia
O	transported
O	with
O	joy
O	he
O	flew
O	in
O	perched
O	on
O	her
O	shoulder
O	and
O	expressed
O	his
O	delight
O	and
O	affection
O	by
O	a
O	thousand
O	caresses
O	she
O	charmed

O	pigeon
O	caressed
O	it
O	in

O	she
O	would
O	love
O	it
O	always
O	what

O	her
O	to

O	amended
O	and
O	you
O	may
O	both
O	live
O	happy
O	if

O	will
O	because
O	your
O	union
O	is
O	founded
O	upon
O	mutual
O	esteem
C	cherry
O	and

O	themselves
O	at
O	the
O	feet
O	of
O	the

O	it
O	is
O	said
O	that
O	the

O	was
O	so
O	blameless
O	and
O	strict
O	in
O	all

C	fairy
O	to

O	a
O	place
O	altogether
O	as
O	pleasant
O	as
O	the

O	and
O	accordingly

O	in
O	a
O	chariot
O	drawn
O	by

O	in

O	to

O	sitting
O	by
O	the
O	fairy
O	who
O	then
O	by
O	her
O	art
O	made

O	appear
O	extremely
O	beautiful
O	had
O	not
O	the

O	been
O	sensible
O	of
O	the

O	obtained
O	the

O	to

O	on

O	there
O	one

O	then
O	yes
O	replied
O	the
C	king
O	i
O	was
O	that
O	was
O	the
O	detested
C	desert
C	fairy
O	who
O	was
O	carrying
O	me
O	to
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	i
O	must
O	have
O	languished
O	out
O	all
O	my
O	days
O	had
O	it

O	for
O	a
O	kind
C	mermaid
O	by
O	whose

O	that
O	i
O	am
O	now

O	uttered
O	these

O	he
O	threw
O	himself
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	but
O	catching
O	hold
O	of
O	her
O	gown
O	he
O	unfortunately
O	let
O	go
O	the
O	magic
O	sword
O	which
O	the
C	yellow
C	dwarf
O	no
O	sooner
O	discovered
O	than
O	leaping
O	from
O	behind
O	a
O	shrub
O	where
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	concealed
O	he
O	ran
O	and
O	seized
O	it
O	by
O	two
O	cabalistical
O	words
O	he
O	then
O	conjured
O	up
O	a
O	couple
O	of
O	giants
O	who
O	laid
O	the
C	king
O	in
O	irons
O	now
O	said
O	the
C	dwarf
O	my
O	rival
O	s
O	fate
O	is
O	in
O	my
O	own
O	hands
O	however
O	if
O	he
O	will
O	consent
O	to
O	my

O	with
O	the
C	princess
O	he
O	shall
O	have
O	his
O	life

O	the

O	i
O	scorn
O	thy
O	favour
O	on
O	such
O	terms
O	the
C	dwarf
O	was
O	so
O	exasperated
O	by
O	this
O	reply
O	that
O	he
O	instantly
O	stabbed
O	the
C	king
O	to
O	the
O	heart
O	the
O	disconsolate
C	princess
O	stood
O	a
O	moment
O	petrified
O	and
O	then
O	exclaimed
O	thou
O	hideous
O	creature
O	since
O	entreaties
O	could
O	not
O	avail
O	thee
O	perhaps
O	thou
O	now
O	reliest
O	upon
O	force
O	but
O	thou
O	shalt
O	be
O	disappointed
O	i
O	will
O	die
O	for
O	the
O	love
O	i
O	have
O	for
O	the
C	king
C	of
C	the
C	golden
C	mines
O	and
O	so
O	saying
O	she
O	sank
O	down
O	upon
O	his
O	body
O	and
O	expired
O	without
O	a
O	sigh
O	thus
O	ended
O	the
O	fate
O	of
O	these
O	two
O	faithful
O	lovers
O	whom
O	the
C	mermaid
O	very
O	much
O	regretted
O	but
O	as
O	all
O	her
O	power
O	lay
O	in
O	the
O	sword
O	she
O	could
O	only
O	change
O	them
O	into
O	two
O	which
O	preserving
O	a
O	constant
O	and
O	mutual
O	affection
O	still
O	fondly
O	unite
O	their
O	branches
O	together
O	i
O	soon
O	again
O	grew
O	weary
O	of
O	living
O	a
O	life
O	of
O	idleness
O	and
O	hardening
O	myself
O	against
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	any
O	danger
O	i
O	embarked
O	with
O	some
C	merchants
O	on
O	another
O	long
O	voyage
O	we
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	ports
O	where
O	we
O	traded
O	one
O	day
O	we
O	were
O	overtaken
O	by
O	a
O	dreadful
O	tempest
O	which
O	drove
O	us
O	from
O	our
O	course
O	the
O	storm
O	continued
O	several
O	days
O	and
O	brought
O	us
O	before
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	an
O	island
O	which
O	the
C	captain
O	was
O	very
O	unwilling
O	to
O	enter
O	but
O	we
O	were
O	obliged
O	to
O	cast
O	anchor
O	when
O	we
O	had
O	furled
O	our
O	sails
O	the
C	captain
O	told
O	us
O	that
O	this
O	and
O	some
O	other
O	neighboring
O	islands
O	were
O	inhabited
O	by
O	hairy
O	savages
O	who
O	would
O	speedily
O	attack
O	us
O	and
O	though
O	they
O	were
O	but
O	dwarfs
O	yet
O	that
O	we
O	must
O	make
O	no
O	resistance
O	for
O	they
O	were
O	more
O	in
O	number
O	than
O	the
O	locusts
O	and
O	if
O	we
O	happened
O	to
O	kill
O	one
O	they
O	would
O	all
O	fall
O	upon
O	us
O	and
O	destroy
O	us
O	we
O	soon
O	found
O	that
O	what
O	the
C	captain
O	had
O	told
O	us
O	was
O	but
O	too
O	true
O	an
O	innumerable
O	multitude
O	of
O	frightful
O	savages
O	about
O	two
O	feet
O	high
O	covered
O	all
O	over
O	with
O	red
O	hair
O	came
O	swimming
O	toward
O	us
O	and
O	encompassed
O	our
O	ship
O	they
O	chattered
O	as
O	they
O	came
O	near
O	but
O	we
O	understood
O	not
O	their
O	language
O	they
O	climbed
O	up
O	the
O	sides
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	with
O	such
O	agility
O	as
O	surprised
O	us
O	they
O	took
O	down
O	our
O	sails
O	cut
O	the
O	cable
O	and
O	hauling
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	made
O	us
O	all
O	get
O	out
O	and
O	afterward
O	carried
O	the
O	ship
O	into
O	another
O	island
O	whence
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	as
O	we
O	advanced
O	we
O	perceived
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	a
O	vast
O	pile
O	of
O	building
O	and
O	made
O	toward
O	it
O	we
O	found
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	palace
O	elegantly
O	built
O	and
O	very
O	lofty
O	with
O	a
O	gate
O	of
O	ebony
O	of
O	two
O	leaves
O	which
O	we
O	opened
O	we
O	saw
O	before
O	us
O	a
O	large
O	apartment
O	with
O	a
O	porch
O	having
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	a
O	heap
O	of
O	human
O	bones
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	a
O	vast
O	number
O	of
O	we
O	trembled
O	at
O	this
O	spectacle
O	and
O	were
O	seized
O	with
O	deadly
O	apprehension
O	when
O	suddenly
O	the
O	gate
O	of
O	the
O	apartment
O	opened
O	with
O	a
O	loud
O	crash
O	and
O	there
O	came
O	out
O	the
O	horrible
O	figure
O	of
O	a
O	black
O	man
O	as
O	tall
O	as
O	a
O	lofty
O	tree
O	he
O	had
O	but
O	one
O	eye
O	and
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	his
O	forehead
O	where
O	it
O	blazed
O	bright
O	as
O	a
O	burning
O	coal
O	his
O	fore
O	teeth
O	were
O	very
O	long
O	and
O	sharp
O	and
O	stood
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	mouth
O	which
O	was
O	as
O	deep
O	as
O	that
O	of
O	a
O	horse
O	his
O	upper
O	lip
O	hung
O	down
O	upon
O	his
O	breast
O	his
O	ears
O	resembled
O	those
O	of
O	an
O	elephant
O	and
O	covered
O	his
O	shoulders
O	and
O	his
O	nails
O	were
O	as
O	long
O	and
O	crooked
O	as
O	the
O	talons
O	of
O	the
O	greatest
O	birds
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	so
O	frightful
O	a
O	genie
O	we
O	became
O	insensible
O	and
O	lay
O	like
O	dead
O	men
O	at
O	last
O	we
O	came
O	to
O	ourselves
O	and
O	saw
O	him
O	sitting
O	in
O	the
O	porch
O	looking
O	at
O	us
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	considered
O	us
O	well
O	he
O	advanced
O	toward
O	us
O	and
O	laying
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	me
O	took
O	me
O	up
O	by
O	the
O	nape
O	of
O	my
O	neck
O	and
O	turned
O	me
O	round
O	as
O	a
O	butcher
O	would
O	do
O	a
O	sheep
O	s
O	head
O	after
O	having
O	examined
O	me
O	and
O	perceiving
O	me
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	lean
O	that
O	i
O	had
O	nothing
O	but
O	skin
O	and
O	bone
O	he
O	let
O	me
O	go
O	he
O	took
O	up
O	all
O	the
O	rest
O	one
O	by
O	one
O	and
O	viewed
O	them
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	the
C	captain
O	being
O	the
O	fattest
O	he
O	held
O	him
O	with
O	one
O	hand
O	as
O	i
O	would
O	do
O	a
O	sparrow
O	and
O	thrust
O	a
O	spit
O	through
O	him
O	he
O	then
O	kindled
O	a
O	great
O	fire
O	roasted
O	and
O	ate
O	him
O	in
O	his
O	apartment
O	for
O	his
O	supper
O	having
O	finished
O	his
O	repast
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	porch
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	snoring
O	louder
O	than
O	thunder
O	he
O	slept
O	thus
O	till
O	morning
O	as
O	to
O	ourselves
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	possible
O	for
O	us
O	to
O	enjoy
O	any
O	rest
O	so
O	that
O	we
O	passed
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	painful
O	apprehension
O	that
O	can
O	be
O	imagined
O	when
O	day
O	appeared
O	the
C	giant
O	awoke
O	got
O	up
O	went
O	out
O	and
O	left
O	us
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	the
O	next
O	night
O	we
O	determined
O	to
O	revenge
O	ourselves
O	on
O	the
O	brutish
C	giant
O	and
O	did
O	so
O	in
O	the
O	following
O	manner
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	again
O	finished
O	his
O	inhuman
O	supper
O	on
O	another
O	of
O	our
O	seamen
O	he
O	lay
O	down
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	and
O	fell
O	asleep
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	we
O	heard
O	him
O	snore
O	according
O	to
O	his
O	custom
O	nine
O	of
O	the
O	boldest
O	among
O	us
O	and
O	myself
O	took
O	each
O	of
O	us
O	a
O	spit
O	and
O	putting
O	the
O	points
O	of
O	them
O	into
O	his
O	fire
O	till
O	they
O	were
O	burning
O	hot
O	we
O	thrust
O	them
O	into
O	his
O	eye
O	all
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	blinded
O	him
O	the
O	pain
O	made
O	him
O	break
O	out
O	into
O	a
O	frightful
O	yell
O	he
O	started
O	up
O	and
O	stretched
O	out
O	his
O	hands
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	sacrifice
O	i
O	some
O	of
O	us
O	to
O	his
O	rage
O	but
O	we
O	ran
O	to
O	such
O	places
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	reach
O	and
O	after
O	having
O	sought
O	for
O	us
O	in
O	vain
O	he
O	groped
O	for
O	the
O	gate
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	howling
O	in
O	agony
O	we
O	immediately
O	left
O	the
O	palace
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	where
O	we
O	made
O	some
O	rafts
O	each
O	large
O	enough
O	to
O	carry
O	three
O	men
O	with
O	some
O	timber
O	that
O	lay
O	about
O	in
O	great
O	quantities
O	we
O	waited
O	till
O	day
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	get
O	upon
O	them
O	for
O	we
O	hoped
O	if
O	the
C	giant
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	by
O	sunrising
O	and
O	give
O	over
O	his
O	howling
O	which
O	we
O	still
O	heard
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	prove
O	to
O	be
O	dead
O	and
O	if
O	that
O	happened
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	case
O	we
O	resolved
O	to
O	stay
O	in
O	that
O	island
O	and
O	not
O	to
O	risk
O	our
O	lives
O	upon
O	the
O	rafts
O	but
O	day
O	had
O	scarcely
O	appeared
O	when
O	we
O	perceived
O	our
O	cruel
O	enemy
O	accompanied
O	by
O	two
O	others
O	almost
O	of
O	the
O	same
O	size
O	leading
O	him
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	more
O	coming
O	before
O	him
O	at
O	a
O	quick
O	pace
O	we
O	did
O	not
O	hesitate
O	to
O	take
O	to
O	our
O	rafts
O	and
O	put
O	to
O	sea
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	speed
O	we
O	could
O	the
C	giants
O	who
O	perceived
O	this
O	took
O	up
O	great
O	stones
O	and
O	running
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	entered
O	the
O	water
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	middle
O	and
O	threw
O	so
O	exactly
O	that
O	they
O	sunk
O	all
O	the
O	rafts
O	but
O	that
O	i
O	was
O	upon
O	and
O	all
O	my
O	companions
O	except
O	the
O	two
O	with
O	me
O	were
O	drowned
O	we
O	rowed
O	with
O	all
O	our
O	might
O	and
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	reach
O	of
O	the
C	giants
O	but
O	when
O	we
O	got
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	we
O	were
O	exposed
O	to
O	the
O	mercy
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	and
O	winds
O	and
O	spent
O	that
O	day
O	and
O	the
O	following
O	night
O	under
O	the
O	most
O	painful
O	uncertainty
O	as
O	to
O	our
O	fate
O	but
O	next
O	morning
O	we
O	had
O	the
O	good
O	fortune
O	to
O	be
O	thrown
O	upon
O	an
O	island
O	where
O	we
O	landed
O	with
O	much
O	joy
O	we
O	found
O	excellent
O	fruit
O	which
O	afforded
O	us
O	great
O	relief
O	and
O	recruited
O	our
O	strength
O	at
O	night
O	we
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	on
O	the
O	but
O	were
O	awakened
O	by
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	a
C	serpent
O	of
O	surprising
O	length
O	and
O	thickness
O	whose
O	scales
O	made
O	a
O	rustling
O	noise
O	as
O	he
O	wound
O	himself
O	along
O	it
O	swallowed
O	up
O	one
O	of
O	my
O	comrades
O	notwithstanding
O	his
O	loud
O	cries
O	and
O	the
O	efforts
O	he
O	made
O	to
O	extricate
O	himself
O	from
O	it
O	dashing
O	him
O	several
O	times
O	against
O	the
O	ground
O	it
O	crushed
O	him
O	and
O	we
O	could
O	hear
O	it
O	gnaw
O	and
O	tear
O	the
O	poor
O	fellow
O	s
O	bones
O	though
O	we
O	had
O	fled
O	to
O	a
O	considerable
O	distance
O	the
O	following
O	day
O	to
O	our
O	great
O	terror
O	we
O	saw
O	the
C	serpent
O	again
O	when
O	i
O	exclaimed
O	o
O	heaven
O	to
O	what
O	dangers
O	are
O	we
O	exposed
O	we
O	rejoiced
O	yesterday
O	at
O	having
O	escaped
O	from
O	the
O	cruelty
O	of
O	a
C	giant
O	and
O	the
O	rage
O	of
O	the
O	waves
O	now
O	are
O	we
O	fallen
O	into
O	another
O	danger
O	equally
O	dreadful
O	as
O	we
O	walked
O	about
O	we
O	saw
O	a
O	large
O	tall
O	tree
O	upon
O	which
O	we
O	designed
O	to
O	pass
O	the
O	following
O	night
O	for
O	our
O	security
O	and
O	having
O	satisfied
O	our
O	hunger
O	with
O	fruit
O	we
O	mounted
O	it
O	accordingly
O	shortly
O	after
O	the
C	serpent
O	came
O	hissing
O	to
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	raised
O	itself
O	up
O	against
O	the
O	trunk
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	meeting
O	with
O	my
O	comrade
O	who
O	sat
O	lower
O	than
O	i
O	swallowed
O	him
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	went
O	off
O	i
O	remained
O	upon
O	the
O	tree
O	till
O	it
O	was
O	day
O	and
O	then
O	came
O	down
O	more
O	like
O	a
O	dead
O	man
O	than
O	one
O	alive
O	expecting
O	the
O	same
O	fate
O	with
O	my
O	two
O	companions
O	this
O	filled
O	me
O	with
O	horror
O	and
O	i
O	advanced
O	some
O	steps
O	to
O	throw
O	myself
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	but
O	i
O	withstood
O	this
O	dictate
O	of
O	despair
O	and
O	submitted
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	god
O	who
O	disposes
O	of
O	our
O	lives
O	at
O	his
O	pleasure
O	in
O	the
O	meantime
O	i
O	collected
O	together
O	a
O	great
O	quantity
O	of
O	small
O	wood
O	brambles
O	and
O	dry
O	thorns
O	and
O	making
O	them
O	up
O	into
O	fagots
O	made
O	a
O	wide
O	circle
O	with
O	them
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	also
O	tied
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	branches
O	over
O	my
O	head
O	having
O	done
O	this
O	when
O	the
O	evening
O	came
O	i
O	shut
O	myself
O	up
O	within
O	this
O	circle
O	with
O	the
O	melancholy
O	satisfaction
O	that
O	i
O	had
O	neglected
O	nothing
O	which
O	could
O	preserve
O	me
O	from
O	the
O	cruel
O	destiny
O	with
O	which
O	i
O	was
O	threatened
O	the
C	serpent
O	failed
O	not
O	to
O	come
O	at
O	the
O	usual
O	hour
O	and
O	went
O	round
O	the
O	tree
O	seeking
O	for
O	an
O	opportunity
O	to
O	devour
O	me
O	but
O	was
O	prevented
O	by
O	the
O	rampart
O	i
O	had
O	made
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	lay
O	till
O	day
O	like
O	a
O	cat
O	watching
O	in
O	vain
O	for
O	a
O	mouse
O	that
O	has
O	fortunately
O	reached
O	a
O	place
O	of
O	safety
O	when
O	day
O	appeared
O	he
O	retired
O	but
O	i
O	dared
O	not
O	leave
O	my
O	fort
O	until
O	the
O	sun
O	arose
O	god
O	took
O	compassion
O	on
O	my
O	hopeless
O	state
O	for
O	just
O	as
O	i
O	was
O	going
O	in
O	a
O	fit
O	of
O	desperation
O	to
O	throw
O	myself
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	i
O	perceived
O	a
O	ship
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	i
O	called
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	i
O	could
O	and
O	unfolding
O	the
O	linen
O	of
O	my
O	turban
O	displayed
O	it
O	that

O	the

O	the
O	crew
O	perceived
O	me
O	and
O	the
C	captain
O	sent
O	his
O	boat
O	for
O	me
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	i
O	came
O	on
O	board
O	the
C	merchants

O	to

O	came
O	into
O	that
O	desert

O	befallen
O	me
O	the

O	among

O	several

O	they
O	were
O	cannibals
O	and
O	as
O	to
O	the

O	they
O	added
O	that
O	there
O	were
O	abundance
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	that
O	they
O	hid
O	themselves
O	by
O	day

O	abroad
O	by
O	night
O	after

O	testified
O	their
O	joy
O	at
O	my
O	escaping
O	so
O	many
O	dangers
O	they
O	brought
O	me
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	their
O	provisions
O	and
O	took
O	me
O	before
O	the
C	captain
O	who
O	seeing
O	that
O	i
O	was
O	in
O	rags
O	gave
O	me
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	suits
O	looking
O	steadfastly
O	upon
O	him
O	i

O	the
O	person
O	who
O	in
O	my
O	second
O	voyage
O	had
O	left

O	in
O	the

O	i
O	fell

O	and
O	sailed
O	without

O	or
O	sending
O	to
O	seek
O	for
O	me
O	i
O	was
O	not

O	believing
O	me
O	to

O	dead
O	did
O	not

O	me
O	i
O	rejoice
O	that

O	rectified
O	my
O	fault
O	there
O	are
O	your
O	goods
O	which
O	i
O	always
O	took
O	care
O	to

O	i
O	took
O	them
O	from

O	and
O	made
O	him
O	my
O	acknowledgments
O	for
O	his
O	care
O	of
O	them
O	we
O	continued
O	at
O	sea
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	islands
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	landed
O	at
O	that
O	of
O	salabat
O	where
O	is
O	obtained
O	which
O	is
O	much
O	used
O	in
O	medicine
O	from
O	the
O	isle
O	of
O	salabat
O	we
O	went
O	to
O	another
O	where
O	i
O	furnished
O	myself
O	with
O	cloves
O	cinnamon
O	and
O	other
O	spices
O	as
O	we
O	sailed
O	from
O	this
O	island
O	we
O	saw
O	a
O	tortoise
O	twenty
O	cubits
O	in
O	length
O	and
O	breadth
O	we
O	observed
O	also
O	an
O	amphibious
O	animal
O	like
O	a
O	cow
O	which
O	gave
O	milk
O	its
O	skin
O	is
O	so
O	hard
O	that
O	they
O	usually
O	make
O	bucklers
O	of
O	it
O	i
O	saw
O	another
O	which
O	had
O	the
O	shape
O	and
O	color
O	of
O	a
O	camel
O	in
O	short
O	after
O	a
O	long
O	voyage
O	i
O	arrived
O	at
O	bussorah
O	and
O	thence
O	returned
O	to
O	bagdad
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	wealth
O	that
O	i
O	knew
O	not
O	its
O	extent
O	i
O	gave
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	to
O	the
O	poor
O	and
O	bought
O	another
O	considerable
O	estate
O	in
O	addition
O	to
O	what
O	i
O	had
O	already
O	thus
C	sindbad
O	finished
O	the
O	story
O	of
O	his
O	third
O	voyage
O	he
O	gave
O	another
O	hundred
O	sequins
O	to
C	hindbad
O	and
O	invited
O	him
O	to
O	dinner
O	again
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	to
O	hear
O	a
C	miller
O	dying
O	divided
O	all
O	his
O	property
O	between
O	his
O	three
O	children
O	this
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	simple
O	matter
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	leave
O	but
O	his
O	mill
O	his
O	ass
O	and
O	his
C	cat
O	so
O	he
O	made
O	no
O	will
O	and
O	called
O	in
O	no
O	lawyer
O	who
O	would
O	probably
O	have
O	taken
O	a
O	large
O	slice
O	out
O	of
O	these
O	poor
O	possessions
O	the
O	eldest
O	son
O	took
O	the
O	mill
O	the
O	second
O	the
O	ass
O	while
O	the
O	third
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	content
O	himself
O	with
O	the
C	cat
O	at
O	which
O	he
O	grumbled
O	very
O	much
O	my
O	brothers
O	said
O	he
O	by
O	putting
O	their
O	property
O	together
O	may
O	gain
O	an
O	honest
O	livelihood
O	but
O	there
O	is
O	nothing
O	left
O	for
O	me
O	except
O	to
O	die
O	of
O	hunger
O	unless
O	indeed
O	i
O	were
O	to
O	kill
O	my
C	cat
O	and
O	eat
O	him
O	and
O	make
O	a
O	coat
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	skin
O	which
O	would
O	be
O	very
O	scanty
O	clothing
O	the
C	cat
O	who
O	heard
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	talking
O	to
O	himself
O	sat
O	up
O	on
O	his
O	four
O	paws
O	and
O	looking
O	at
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	grave
O	and
O	wise
O	air
O	said
O	master
O	i
O	think
O	you
O	had
O	better
O	not
O	kill
O	me
O	i
O	shall
O	be
O	much
O	more
O	useful
O	to
O	you
O	alive
O	how
O	so
O	asked
O	his
O	master
O	you
O	have
O	but
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	a
O	sack
O	and
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	boots
O	such
O	as
O	gentlemen
O	wear
O	when
O	they
O	go
O	shooting
O	and
O	you
O	will
O	find
O	you
O	are
O	not
O	so
O	ill
O	off
O	as
O	you
O	suppose
O	now
O	though
O	the
O	young
O	miller
O	did
O	not
O	much
O	depend
O	upon
O	the
C	cat
O	s
O	words
O	still
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	rather
O	surprising
O	that
O	a
C	cat
O	should
O	speak
O	at
O	all
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	before
O	now
O	seen
O	him
O	show
O	so
O	much
O	adroitness
O	and
O	cleverness
O	in
O	catching
O	rats
O	and
O	mice
O	that
O	it
O	seemed
O	advisable
O	to
O	trust
O	him
O	a
O	little
O	farther
O	especially
O	as
O	poor
O	young
O	fellow
O	he
O	had
O	nobody
O	else
O	to
O	trust
O	when
O	the
C	cat
O	got
O	his
O	boots
O	he
O	drew
O	them
O	on
O	with
O	a
O	grand
O	air
O	and
O	slinging
O	his
O	sack
O	over
O	his
O	shoulder
O	and
O	drawing
O	the
O	cords
O	of
O	it
O	round
O	his
O	neck
O	he
O	marched
O	bravely
O	to
O	a
O	hard
O	by
O	with
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	well
O	acquainted
O	then
O	putting
O	some
O	bran
O	and
O	lettuces
O	into
O	his
O	bag
O	and
O	stretching
O	himself
O	out
O	beside
O	it
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	dead
O	he
O	waited
O	till
O	some
O	fine
O	fat
O	young
O	rabbit
O	ignorant
O	of
O	the
O	wickedness
O	and
O	deceit
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	should
O	peer
O	into
O	the
O	sack
O	to
O	eat
O	the
O	food
O	that
O	was
O	inside
O	this
O	happened
O	very
O	shortly
O	for
O	there
O	are
O	plenty
O	of
O	foolish
O	young
O	rabbits
O	in
O	every
O	warren
O	and
O	when
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	who
O	really
O	was
O	a
O	splendid
O	fat
O	fellow
O	put
O	his
O	head
O	inside
O	master
C	puss
O	drew
O	the
O	cords
O	immediately
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	and
O	killed
O	him
O	without
O	mercy
O	then
O	very
O	proud
O	of
O	his
O	prey
O	he
O	marched
O	direct

O	at
O	different
O	times
O	brought
O	him
O	so
O	many

O	of
O	my

O	to
O	the

O	of
O	the
C	king
O	s
O	carriage
O	and
O	told
O	a
O	long
O	and
O	pitiful
O	story
O	about
O	some
O	thieves
O	who
O	while

O	bathing
O	had
O	come
O	and
O	carried
O	away
O	all

O	so
O	that

O	until
O	they
O	arrived
O	then
O	being
O	handsome
O	and
O	his
O	new
O	clothes
O	became
O	him
O	so
O	well
O	that
O	he
O	looked
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	marquis
O	all
O	his
O	days
O	and
O	advanced
O	with
O	an
O	air
O	of
O	respectful
O	ease
O	to
O	offer
O	his
O	thanks
O	to
O	his
O	majesty
O	the

O	received
O	him
O	courteously
O	and
O	the

O	him
O	very
O	much
O	indeed
O	so
O	charming
O	did
O	he
O	appear
O	to
O	her
O	that

O	to
O	her
O	father
O	to
O	invite
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	carriage
O	with
O	them
O	which
O	you
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	did
O	not
O	refuse
O	the
C	cat
O	delighted
O	at
O	the
O	success
O	of
O	his
O	scheme
O	went
O	away
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	and
O	ran
O	so
O	swiftly
O	that
O	he
O	kept
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	ahead
O	of
O	the
O	royal
O	carriage
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	till
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	some
O	peasants
O	who
O	were
O	mowing
O	in
O	a
O	meadow
O	good
O	people
O	said
O	he
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	firm
O	voice
O	the
C	king
O	is
O	coming
O	past
O	here
O	shortly
O	and
O	if
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	say
O	that
O	the
O	field
O	you
O	are
O	mowing
O	belongs
O	to
O	my
O	lord
O	the
C	marquis
C	of
C	carabas
O	you
O	shall
O	all
O	be
O	chopped
O	as
O	small
O	as
O	so
O	when
O	the
C	king
O	drove
O	by
O	and
O	asked
O	whose
O	meadow
O	it
O	was
O	where
O	there
O	was
O	such
O	a
O	splendid
O	crop
O	of
O	hay
O	the
O	mowers
O	all
O	answered
O	trembling
O	that
O	it
O	belonged
O	to
O	my
O	lord
O	the
C	marquis
C	of
C	carabas
O	you
O	have
O	very
O	fine
O	land
C	marquis
O	said
O	his
O	majesty
O	to
O	the
O	miller
O	s
O	son
O	who
O	bowed
O	and
O	answered
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	bad
O	meadow
O	take
O	it
O	altogether
O	then
O	the
C	cat
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	where
O	the
O	reapers
O	were
O	reaping
O	with
O	all
O	their
O	might
O	he
O	bounded
O	in
O	upon
O	them
O	the
C	king
O	is
O	coming
O	past
O	and
O	if
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	tell
O	him
O	that
O	this
O	wheat
O	belongs
O	to
O	my
O	lord
O	the
C	marquis
C	of
C	carabas
O	i
O	will
O	have
O	you
O	every
O	one
O	chopped
O	as
O	small
O	as
O	the
O	reapers
O	very
O	much
O	alarmed
O	did
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	bid
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	congratulated
O	the
C	marquis
O	upon
O	possessing
O	such
O	beautiful
O	fields
O	laden
O	with
O	such
O	an
O	abundant
O	harvest
O	they
O	drove
O	on
O	the
C	cat
O	always
O	running
O	before
O	and
O	saying
O	the
O	same
O	thing
O	to
O	everybody
O	he
O	met
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	to
O	declare
O	the
O	whole
O	country
O	belonged
O	to
O	his
O	master
O	so
O	that
O	even
O	the
C	king
O	was
O	astonished
O	at
O	the
O	vast
O	estate
O	of
O	my
O	lord
O	the
C	marquis
C	of
C	carabas
O	but
O	now
O	the
C	cat
O	arrived
O	at
O	a
O	great
O	castle
O	where
O	dwelt
O	an
C	ogre
O	to
O	whom
O	belonged
O	all
O	the
O	land
O	through
O	which
O	the
O	royal
O	equipage
O	had
O	been
O	driving
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	cruel
O	tyrant
O	and
O	his
O	tenants
O	and
O	servants
O	were
O	terribly
O	afraid
O	of
O	him
O	which
O	accounted
O	for
O	their
O	being
O	so
O	ready
O	to
O	say
O	whatever
O	they
O	were
O	told
O	to
O	say
O	by
O	the
C	cat
O	who
O	had
O	taken
O	pains
O	to
O	inform
O	himself
O	of
O	all
O	about
O	the
C	ogre
O	so
O	putting
O	on
O	the
O	boldest
O	face
O	he
O	could
O	assume
C	puss
O	marched
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	castle
O	with
O	his
O	boots
O	on
O	and
O	asked
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	owner
O	of
O	it
O	saying
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	on
O	his
O	travels
O	but
O	did
O	not
O	wish
O	to
O	pass
O	so
O	near
O	the
O	castle
O	of
O	such
O	a
O	noble
O	gentleman
O	without
O	paying
O	his
O	respects
O	to
O	him
O	when
O	the
C	ogre
O	heard
O	this
O	message
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	received
O	the
C	cat
O	as
O	civilly
O	as
O	an
C	ogre
O	can
O	and
O	begged
O	him
O	to
O	walk
O	in
O	and
O	repose
O	himself
O	thank
O	you
O	sir
O	said
O	the
C	cat
O	but
O	first
O	i
O	hope
O	you
O	will
O	satisfy
O	a
O	traveller
O	s
O	curiosity
O	i
O	have
O	heard
O	in
O	far
O	countries
O	of
O	your
O	many
O	remarkable
O	qualities
O	and
O	especially
O	how
O	you
O	have
O	the
O	power
O	to
O	change
O	yourself
O	into
O	any
O	sort
O	of
O	beast
O	you
O	choose
O	a
O	lion
O	for
O	instance
O	or
O	an
O	elephant
O	that
O	is
O	quite
O	true
O	replied
O	the
C	ogre
O	and
O	lest
O	you
O	should
O	doubt
O	it
O	i
O	will
O	immediately
O	become
O	a
O	lion
O	he
O	did
O	so
O	and
O	the
C	cat
O	was
O	so
O	frightened
O	that
O	he
O	sprang
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	roof
O	of
O	the
O	castle
O	and
O	hid
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	gutter
O	a
O	proceeding
O	rather
O	inconvenient
O	on
O	account
O	of
O	his
O	boots
O	which
O	were
O	not
O	exactly
O	fitted
O	to
O	walk
O	with
O	upon
O	tiles
O	at
O	length
O	perceiving
O	that
O	the
C	ogre
O	had
O	resumed
O	his
O	original
O	form
O	he
O	came
O	down
O	again
O	stealthily
O	and
O	confessed
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	very
O	much
O	frightened
O	but
O	sir
O	said
O	he
O	it
O	may
O	be
O	easy
O	enough
O	for
O	such
O	a
O	big
O	gentleman
O	as
O	you
O	to
O	change
O	himself
O	into
O	a
O	large
O	animal
O	i
O	do
O	not
O	suppose
O	you
O	can
O	become
O	a
O	small
O	one
O	a
O	rat
O	or
O	mouse
O	for
O	instance
O	i
O	have
O	heard
O	that
O	you
O	can
O	still
O	for
O	my
O	part
O	i
O	consider
O	it
O	quite
O	impossible
O	impossible
O	cried
O	the
O	other
O	indignantly
O	you
O	shall
O	see
O	and
O	immediately
O	the
C	cat
O	saw
O	the
C	ogre
O	no
O	longer
O	but
O	a
O	little
O	mouse
O	running
O	along
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	this
O	was
O	exactly
O	what
O	he
O	wanted
O	and
O	he
O	did
O	the
O	very
O	best
O	a
C	cat
O	could
O	do
O	and
O	the
O	most
O	natural
O	under
O	the
O	circumstances
O	he
O	sprang
O	upon
O	the
O	mouse
O	and
O	gobbled
O	it
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	trice
O	so
O	there
O	was
O	an
O	end
O	of
O	the
C	ogre
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	the
C	king
O	had
O	arrived
O	opposite
O	the
O	castle
O	and
O	was
O	seized
O	with
O	a
O	strong
O	desire
O	to
O	enter
O	it
O	the
C	cat
O	hearing
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	the
O	ran
O	forward
O	in
O	a
O	great
O	hurry
O	and
O	standing
O	at
O	the
O	gate
O	said
O	in
O	a
O	loud
O	voice
O	welcome
O	sire
O	to

C	gosling
O	back
O	to
O	the

O	scarcely

O	they

O	tenderly
O	and
O	skipped
O	about
O	as
O	lively
O	as
O	a
O	tailor
O	at
O	his
O	wedding
O	but
O	the

C	goose
O	said
O	now
O	go

O	rumbling
O	and
O	tumbling
O	what

O	crying
O	loudly
O	the

O	the

O	by

O	because
O	he
O	was

O	and
O	the

O	all

O	and
O	loyalty
O	and
O	he
C	loki
O	was
O	treachery

C	loki
O	taking
O	upon

O	dwelt
C	freya
O	the

O	the

O	apparently
O	a

O	woman
O	passed
O	by
O	where
O	she
O	sat

O	what

O	the

C	baldur

O	all

O	queried
C	loki

O	answered

O	the

O	no

O	grew

O	quickly
O	he
O	went

O	grew
O	cut
O	a

C	hodur
C	hodur

O	to

O	to
O	the

O	they

O	at

O	the

O	they

O	toss
O	about

O	faint

O	saw

O	certain
O	death
O	before

O	at
O	length
O	on
O	the
O	evening
O	of
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	they
O	discovered
O	an
O	island
O	of
O	tolerable
O	magnitude
O	and
O	surrounded
O	by
O	a
O	number

C	orm

O	for

O	came
O	near
O	it
O	there
O	suddenly
O	rose
O	a
O	violent
O	wind
O	and
O	the

O	rolled
O	every
O	moment
O	higher
O	and
O	higher
O	he
O	turned
O	about
O	with
O	a
O	view
O	of
O	approaching
O	it
O	on
O	another
O	side
O	but
O	with
O	no
O	better
O	success
O	his
O	vessel
O	as
O	often
O	as
O	it
O	neared
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	driven
O	back
O	as
O	if
O	by

O	god
O	help
O	us
O	he
O	cried
O	and
O	crossed
O	himself
O	and
O	looked
O	on
O	poor
C	aslog
O	who
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	dying
O	of
O	weakness
O	before
O	his
O	eyes
O	but
O	scarcely
O	had
O	the
O	exclamation
O	passed
O	his
O	lips
O	when
O	the
O	storm
O	ceased
O	the
O	waves
O	subsided
O	and
O	the
O	vessel
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	shore
O	without
O	encountering
O	any
O	hindrance
C	orm
O	jumped
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	some
O	mussels
O	that
O	he
O	found
O	on
O	the
O	strand
O	strengthened
O	and
O	revived
O	the
O	exhausted
C	aslog
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	soon
O	able
O	to
O	leave
O	the
O	boat
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	overgrown
O	with
O	low
O	dwarf
O	shrubs
O	and
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	uninhabited
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	reached
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	it
O	they
O	discovered
O	a
O	house
O	which
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	half
O	under
O	the
O	surface
O	of
O	the
O	earth
O	in
O	the
O	hope
O	of
O	meeting
O	with
O	human
O	help
O	the
O	wanderers
O	approached
O	it
O	they
O	listened
O	but
O	the
O	most
O	perfect
O	silence
O	reigned
O	there
C	orm
O	at
O	length
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	they
O	both
O	walked
O	in
O	but
O	what
O	was
O	their
O	surprise
O	to
O	find
O	everything
O	regulated
O	and
O	arranged
O	as
O	if
O	for
O	inhabitants
O	yet
O	not
O	a
O	single
O	living
O	creature
O	visible
O	the
O	fire
O	was
O	burning
O	on
O	the
O	hearth
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	and
O	a
O	kettle
O	with
O	fish
O	hung
O	on
O	it
O	apparently
O	only
O	waiting
O	for
O	some
O	one
O	to
O	take
O	it
O	up
O	and
O	eat
O	it
O	the
O	beds
O	were
O	made
O	and
O	ready
O	to
O	receive
O	their
O	wearied
O	tenants
C	orm
O	and
C	aslog
O	stood
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	dubious
O	and
O	looked
O	on
O	with
O	a
O	certain
O	degree
O	of
O	awe
O	but
O	at
O	last
O	overcome
O	by
O	hunger
O	they
O	took
O	up
O	the
O	food
O	and
O	ate
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	satisfied
O	their
O	appetites
O	and
O	still
O	discovered
O	no
O	human
O	being
O	they
O	gave
O	way
O	to
O	weariness
O	and
O	laid
O	themselves
O	in
O	the
O	beds
O	which
O	looked
O	so
O	peaceful
O	and
O	inviting
O	to
O	their
O	wearied
O	limbs
O	they
O	had
O	expected
O	to
O	be
O	awakened
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	by
O	the
O	owners
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	on
O	their
O	return
O	home
O	but
O	their
O	expectation
O	was
O	not
O	fulfilled
O	they
O	slept
O	undisturbed
O	till
O	the
O	morning
O	sun
O	shone
O	in
O	upon
O	them
O	no
O	one
O	appeared
O	on
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	following
O	days
O	and
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	some
O	invisible
O	power
O	had
O	made
O	ready
O	the
O	house
O	for
O	their
O	reception
O	they
O	spent
O	the
O	whole
O	summer
O	in
O	perfect
O	happiness
O	they
O	were
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	solitary
O	yet
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	miss
O	mankind
O	the
O	wild
O	birds
O	eggs
O	and
O	the
O	fish
O	they
O	caught
O	yielded

O	provisions
O	in

O	when
O	autumn
O	came
C	aslog
O	brought
O	forth
O	a
O	son
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	their
O	joy
O	at
O	this
O	they
O	were
O	surprised
O	by
O	a
O	wonderful
O	apparition
O	the
O	door
O	opened
O	on
O	a
O	sudden
O	and
O	an
O	old
O	woman
O	stepped
O	in
O	she
O	wore
O	a
O	handsome
O	blue
O	dress
O	there
O	was
O	something
O	proud
O	but
O	at
O	the

O	time
O	something
O	strange
O	in
O	her
O	appearance
O	do
O	not
O	be
O	afraid
O	said
O	she
O	at

O	at

O	they

O	sight
O	then
O	presented

O	to

O	the

O	where
C	orm

O	lived

O	not

O	one
O	he
O	could
O	clearly
O	perceive
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	blue
O	lights
O	were
O	borne
O	by
C	dwarfs
O	whose
O	pale
O	faces
O	with
O	their
O	huge
O	noses
O	and
O	red
O	eyes
O	disfigured
O	too
O	by
O	birds
O	bills
O	and
O	owls
O	eyes
O	were
O	supported
O	by
O	misshapen
O	bodies
O	and
O	they
O	tottered
O	and
O	wabbled
O	about
O	here
O	and
O	there
O	so
O	that
O	they
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	merry
O	and
O	in
O	pain
O	suddenly
O	the
O	circle
O	opened
O	the
O	little
O	ones
O	retired
O	on
O	each
O	side
O	and
C	guru
O	was
O	the
O	woman
C	guru
O	whom
C	orm
O	recognised
O	immediately
O	though
O	she
O	had
O	risen
O	in
O	stature
O	and
O	size
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	be
O	almost
O	as
O	gigantic
O	as
O	the
O	stone
O	man
O	advanced
O	towards
O	it
O	she
O	threw
O	both
O	her
O	arms
O	round
O	the
O	image
O	which
O	immediately
O	seemed
O	to
O	receive
O	life
O	and
O	motion
O	then
O	the
C	dwarfs
O	with
O	wonderful
O	capers
O	and
O	grimaces
O	began
O	a
O	song
O	or
O	to
O	speak
O	more
O	properly
O	a
O	howl
O	with
O	which
O	the
O	whole
O	island
O	resounded
O	and
O	almost
O	trembled
O	at
O	the
O	noise
C	orm
O	quite
O	terrified
O	drew
O	in
O	his
O	head
O	and
O	he
O	and
C	aslog
O	remained
O	in
O	the
O	dark
O	so
O	still
O	that
O	they
O	hardly
O	ventured
O	to
O	draw
O	their
O	breath
O	the
O	procession
O	moved
O	on
O	towards
O	the
O	house
O	as
O	might
O	be
O	clearly
O	perceived
O	by
O	the
O	nearer
O	approach
O	of
O	the
O	shouting
O	and
O	crying
O	they
O	were
O	now
O	all
O	come
O	in
O	light
O	and
O	active
O	the
C	dwarfs
O	were
O	heard
O	jumping
O	about
O	on
O	the
O	benches
O	and
O	heavy
O	and
O	loud
O	sounded
O	at
O	intervals
O	the
O	steps
O	of
O	the
O	giants
C	orm
O	and
O	his
O	wife
O	listened
O	to
O	the
O	clattering
O	of
O	the
O	plates
O	and
O	the
O	shouts
O	of
O	joy
O	with
O	which
O	they
O	celebrated
O	their
O	banquet
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	over
O	and
O	midnight
O	drew
O	near
O	they
O	began
O	to
O	dance
O	to
O	that
O	ravishing
O	which
O	some
O	have
O	heard
O	in
O	the
O	rocky
O	glens
O	and
O	learned
O	by
O	listening
O	to
O	the
O	underground
O	musicians
O	as
O	soon
O	as
C	aslog
O	caught
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	this
O	air
O	she
O	felt
O	an
O	irresistible
O	longing
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	dance
O	nor
O	was
C	orm
O	able
O	to
O	keep
O	her
O	back

O	she
O	or
O	my
O	heart

O	burst
O	she
O	took
O	her
O	child
O	and
O	placed
O	herself
O	at
O	the
O	extreme
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	loft
O	whence
O	without
O	being
O	observed
O	she
O	could
O	see
O	all
O	that

O	long
O	did
O	she
O	gaze
O	without
O	taking
O	off
O	her
O	eyes
O	for
O	an
O	instant
O	on
O	the
O	dance
O	on
O	the
O	bold
O	and
O	wonderful
O	springs
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	creatures
O	who
O	seemed
O	to
O	float
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	and
O	not
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	to
O	touch
O	the
O	ground
O	while
O	the
O	ravishing
O	melody
O	of
O	the
O	elves
O	filled
O	her
O	whole
O	soul
O	the
O	child
O	meanwhile
O	which
O	lay
O	in
O	her
O	arms
O	grew
O	sleepy
O	and
O	drew
O	its
O	breath
O	heavily
O	and
O	without
O	ever
O	thinking
O	on
O	the
O	promise
O	she
O	had
O	given
O	the
O	old
O	woman

O	the
O	cross
O	over
O	the

O	spoken

O	cry

O	over

O	out
O	at

O	a
O	few
O	minutes
O	the

O	accordingly

C	ali
C	baba
O	who
O	expected
O	a

O	the

O	have
O	been
O	occupied
O	for

O	boldly
O	into

O	as
O	much
O	of
O	the
O	gold
O	coin
O	which

O	carry
O	when

O	had
O	loaded
O	them
O	with

O	to

O	the

O	he

O	great
O	admiration
O	to

O	riches
O	than
O	he
O	had
O	expected
O	from

O	baba
O	s

O	he
O	quickly

O	as
O	he
O	could
O	carry
O	at
O	the

O	he

O	it
O	open
O	and
O	instead

O	amazed
O	to

O	remained
O	fast

O	with

O	walked
O	distractedly
O	up

O	down
O	the
O	cave
O	without

O	the

O	regard
O	to
O	the

O	that
O	were
O	round
O	him
O	about
O	noon
O	the
C	robbers
O	visited
O	their
O	cave
O	at
O	some
O	distance
O	they
O	saw
O	cassim

O	mules
O	straggling
O	about
O	the
O	rock
O	with
O	great
O	chests

O	alarmed
O	at

O	galloped
O	full
O	speed
O	to
O	the
O	cave
O	they
O	drove
O	away
O	the
O	mules
O	who
O	strayed
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	so
O	far
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	soon
O	out
O	of

O	and
O	went
O	directly
O	with
O	their
O	naked
O	sabres
O	in
O	their
O	hands
O	to
O	the
O	door

O	on
O	their
C	captain
O	pronouncing
O	the

O	words
O	immediately
O	opened
C	cassim
O	who
O	heard
O	the
O	noise
O	of
O	the
O	horses
O	feet
O	at
O	once
O	guessed
O	the
O	arrival
O	of
O	the
C	robbers
O	and
O	resolved
O	to
O	make
O	one
O	effort
O	for
O	his
O	life
O	he
O	rushed
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	and
O	no
O	sooner
O	saw
O	the
O	door
O	open
O	than
O	he
O	ran
O	out
O	and
O	threw
O	the
O	leader
O	down
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	escape
O	the
O	other
C	robbers
O	who
O	with
O	their
O	cimeters
O	soon
O	deprived
O	him
O	of
O	life
O	the
O	first
O	care
O	of
O	the
C	robbers
O	after
O	this
O	was
O	to
O	examine
O	the
O	cave
O	they
O	found
O	all
O	the
O	bags
O	which
C	cassim
O	had
O	brought
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	to

O	load
O	his

O	and

O	them
O	again
O	to

O	but
O	they
O	did
O	not
O	miss
O	what
C	ali
C	baba
O	had
O	taken
O	away
O	before
O	then
O	holding
O	a
O	council
O	and
O	deliberating
O	upon
O	this
O	occurrence
O	they
O	guessed
O	that
C	cassim
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	could
O	not
O	get
O	out
O	again
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	imagine
O	how
O	he
O	had
O	learned
O	the
O	secret
O	words
O	by
O	which
O	alone
O	he
O	could
O	enter
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	deny
O	the
O	fact
O	of
O	his
O	being
O	there
O	and
O	to

O	or
O	accomplice
O	who
O	should
O	attempt
O	the
O	same
O	thing
O	they
O	agreed
O	to
O	cut
C	cassim
O	s
O	body
O	into
O	four
O	quarters
O	to
O	hang
O	two

O	no
O	sooner
O	taken
O	this
O	resolution
O	than
O	they
O	put
O	it
O	in

O	and
O	when

O	had
O	nothing

O	to

O	them
O	left
O	the

O	of

O	well

O	they
O	mounted
O	their

O	again
O	and
O	to
O	attack
O	the
O	caravans
O	they
O	might
O	meet
O	in
O	the
O	meantime
C	cassim
C	s

O	she
O	ran
O	to
C	ali

O	gone
O	to
O	the

O	i

O	afraid
O	some
O	misfortune

O	happened
O	to

C	ali

O	waited
O	patiently
O	till
O	midnight
O	then
O	her
O	fear
O	redoubled
O	and
O	her
O	grief
O	was
O	the
O	more
O	sensible
O	because

O	was
O	forced
O	to

O	to

O	she
O	repented

O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	day
O	went

O	the

O	coming
C	ali
C	baba

O	first
O	to

O	affliction
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	the

O	horror
O	at
O	the

O	sight
O	of
O	his

O	after

O	into
O	the

O	was
O	chalked
O	in
O	the

O	manner
O	and
O	in
O	the

O	place
O	and
O	showing
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	guide
O	asked

O	which

O	that
O	or
O	the

O	the

O	so
O	confounded
O	that
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	answer
O	to
O	make
O	but
O	still
O	more
O	puzzled
O	when
O	he
O	and
O	the
C	captain
O	saw
O	five
O	or
O	six
O	houses
O	similarly
O	marked
O	he
O	assured
O	the
C	captain
O	with
O	an
O	oath
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	marked
O	but
O	one
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	who

O	so
O	that

O	could
O	not
O	distinguish
O	the
O	house
O	which
O	the
O	cobbler
O	had
O	stopped
O	at
O	the
C	captain
O	finding
O	that
O	their
O	design
O	had
O	proved
O	abortive
O	went
O	directly
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	rendezvous
O	and
O	told
O	his
O	troop
O	that
O	they
O	had
O	lost
O	their
O	labor
O	and
O	must
O	return
O	to
O	their
O	cave
O	he
O	himself
O	set
O	them
O	the
O	example
O	and
O	they
O	all
O	returned
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	when
O	the
O	troop
O	was
O	all
O	got
O	together
O	the
C	captain
O	told
O	them
O	the
O	reason
O	of
O	their
O	returning
O	and
O	presently
O	the
O	conductor
O	was
O	declared
O	by
O	all
O	worthy
O	of
O	death
O	he
O	condemned
O	himself
O	acknowledging
O	that
O	he
O	ought
O	to
O	have
O	taken
O	better
O	precaution
O	and
O	prepared
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	stroke
O	from
O	him
O	who
O	was
O	appointed
O	to
O	cut
O	off
O	his
O	head
O	but
O	as
O	the
O	safety
O	of
O	the
O	troop
O	required
O	the
O	discovery
O	of
O	the
O	second
O	intruder
O	into
O	the
O	cave
O	another
O	of

O	himself
O	and
O	his
O	offer
O	being
O	accepted
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	corrupted
C	baba
C	mustapha
O	as
O	the

O	done

O	not
O	long
O	after
C	morgiana
O	whose

O	out
O	and
O	seeing
O	the
O	red
O	chalk
O	and
O	arguing
O	with
O	herself
O	as
O	she
O	had
O	done
O	before

O	the
O	other
O	neighbors

O	in
O	the

O	the
O	robber
O	at
O	his
O	return
O	to
O	his
O	company
O	valued
O	himself
O	much
O	on
O	the
O	precaution
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	which
O	he
O	looked
O	upon
O	as
O	an
O	infallible
O	way
O	of
O	distinguishing
O	ali
O	baba
O	s

O	from
O	the

O	and
O	the
C	captain
O	and
O	all
O	of
O	them
O	thought
O	it
O	must
O	succeed
O	they
O	conveyed
O	themselves
O	into
O	the
O	town
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	precaution
O	as
O	before
O	but
O	when
O	the
O	robber
O	and
O	his
C	captain
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	street
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	same
O	difficulty
O	at
O	which
O	the
C	captain
O	was
O	enraged
O	and
O	the
O	robber
O	in
O	as
O	great
O	confusion
O	as
O	his
O	predecessor
O	thus
O	the
C	captain
O	and
O	his
O	troop
O	were
O	forced
O	to
O	retire
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	and
O	much
O	more
O	dissatisfied
O	while
O	the
O	robber
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	the
O	author
O	of
O	the
O	mistake
O	underwent
O	the
O	same
O	punishment
O	which
O	he
O	willingly
O	submitted
O	to
O	the
C	captain
O	having
O	lost
O	two
O	brave
O	fellows
O	of
O	his
O	troop
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	diminishing
O	it
O	too
O	much
O	by
O	pursuing
O	this
O	plan
O	to
O	get
O	information
O	of
O	the
O	residence
O	of
O	their
O	plunderer
O	he
O	found
O	by
O	their
O	example
O	that
O	their
O	heads
O	were
O	not
O	so
O	good
O	as
O	their
O	hands
O	on
O	such
O	occasions
O	and
O	therefore
O	resolved
O	to
O	take
O	upon
O	himself
O	the
O	important
O	commission
O	accordingly
O	he
O	went
O	and
O	addressed
O	himself
O	to
C	baba
C	mustapha
O	who
O	did
O	him
O	the
O	same
O	service
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	to
O	the
O	other
C	robbers
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	set
O	any
O	particular
O	mark
O	on
O	the
O	house
O	but
O	examined
O	and
O	observed
O	it
O	so
O	carefully
O	by
O	passing
O	often
O	by
O	it
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	impossible
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	mistake
O	it
O	the
C	captain
O	well
O	satisfied
O	with

O	into
O	the
O	cave
O	where
O	the
O	troop
O	waited
O	for
O	him
O	said
O	now
O	comrades
O	nothing
O	can
O	prevent
O	our
O	full
O	revenge
O	as
O	i
O	am
O	certain
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	and
O	in
O	my
O	way
O	hither
O	i
O	have
O	thought
O	how
O	to
O	put
O	it
O	into
O	execution

O	can
O	form
O	a
O	better
O	expedient
O	let

O	told
O	them
O	his
O	contrivance

O	as
O	they
O	approved
O	of
O	it
O	ordered
O	them
O	to
O	go
O	into
O	the
O	villages
O	about

O	buy
O	nineteen

O	the

O	empty
O	in
O	two

O	time
O	the
C	robbers
O	had
O	purchased
O	the

O	and
O	as
O	the

O	of
O	the
O	jars
O	were
O	rather
O	too
O	narrow
O	for
O	his
O	purpose
O	the

O	to

C	morgiana

O	such
O	a

C	ali
C	baba
O	who
O	immediately

O	you
O	that
O	my

O	you
O	higher
O	proofs
O	of
O	its
O	sincerity
O	which
O	i
O	now
O	do
O	by

O	addressing
O	himself
O	to
O	his

O	he
O	said
O	i
O	believe
O	you
O	son
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	dutiful
O	a
O	child
O	that
O	you
O	will

O	friendship
O	with
O	a
O	treacherous
O	design
O	to
O	take
O	away
O	my

O	and
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	succeeded
O	there
O	is
O	no

O	but
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	sacrificed
O	you

O	consider
O	that
O	by

O	to
O	the
O	marriage
O	not
O	only
O	because
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	disobey
O	his
O	father
O	but
O	also
O	because
O	it
O	was
O	agreeable
O	to
O	his
O	inclination
O	after
O	this
O	they
O	thought
O	of
O	burying
O	the
C	captain
O	of
O	the
C	robbers
O	with

O	days
O	afterward
C	ali

C	mustapha
O	with
O	great

O	to

O	cave
O	for
O	a
O	whole
O	year
O	as
O	he
O	supposed

O	at
O	the

O	to

O	he
O	mounted
O	his

O	he
O	alighted
O	tied
O	his

O	he
O	entered
O	the

O	by
O	the

O	he
O	found
O	things
O	in
O	judged
O	that
O	nobody
O	had
O	been
O	there
O	since
O	the

O	had
O	fetched
O	the

O	for
O	his
O	shop
O	from
O	this
O	time
O	he
O	believed

O	person
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	who
O	had
O	the

O	and
O	that
O	all
O	the
O	treasure
O	was
O	at

O	he
O	put

O	some

O	he
O	carried
O	his

O	taught

O	the
O	secret

O	upon
O	a
O	time
O	a
O	wicked
O	nobleman
O	rose
O	in
O	rebellion
O	against

O	rightful
O	king
O	and
O	taking
O	the
O	royal
O	forces
O	by

O	presently
O	the

O	realized
O	that

O	lost
O	all
O	afternoon
O	however
O	she
O	trudged
O	bravely
O	on
O	through

O	and
O	the
O	cold
O	her

O	sinking
O	as

O	late
O	in

O	through

O	from
O	a
O	little
O	grove
O	of
O	cedars
O	by
O	the

O	lake
O	the

O	but
O	his

O	were
O	vain
O	for
O	the

O	woman
O	was
O	so
O	weak

O	the

O	now
O	while

O	every

C	garabin

O	of
O	this

O	my
O	pretty
C	daughter
O	why

O	weeping
O	so
O	bitterly
O	ah

O	and

O	the

C	man
O	said
O	what

O	you
O	give
O	me
O	if

O	it
O	for

O	spun
O	and
O	all
O	the

O	were
O	full
O	of

O	the

O	and
O	was
O	greatly
O	astonished
O	and
O	overjoyed
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	but
O	it
O	only
O	made
O	his
O	heart
O	the
O	more
O	greedy
O	of
O	gold
O	he
O	put
O	the
C	daughter
O	into
O	another
O	much
O	larger
O	room
O	full
O	of
O	straw
O	and

O	the
O	poor
O	helpless
O	maiden
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	when
O	once
O	more
O	the
O	door
O	flew
O	open
O	the
C	little
C	man

O	spin
O	this
O	straw
O	into

O	my

O	answered
O	the
O	maiden
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	took
O	the
O	ring
O	began
O	to
O	turn
O	the
O	wheel
O	and
O	by

O	morning
O	all
O	the

O	but
O	was
O	not
O	yet
O	satisfied
O	with
O	the

O	so
O	he
O	put
O	the

O	into
O	a
O	still
O	larger
O	room
O	full
O	of
O	straw
O	and

O	this
O	during
O	the

O	and
O	if

O	it
O	you

O	i
O	shall
O	never
O	find
O	a
O	richer
O	wife
O	in
O	the

O	world
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the

O	was
O	alone
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	came
O	the
O	third
O	time
O	and
O	said
O	what
O	will
O	you
O	give
O	me
O	if
O	i
O	again
O	spin
O	all
O	this
O	straw
O	for
O	you
O	i
O	have
O	nothing
O	more
O	to
O	give
O	you
O	answered
O	the
O	girl
O	then
O	promise
O	if
O	you
O	become
O	queen
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	your
O	first
C	child
O	who

O	be
O	or
O	how
O	things
O	may
O	turn
O	out
O	between
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	thought
O	the
O	girl
O	but
O	in
O	her
O	perplexity
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	herself
O	so
O	she
O	promised
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	what
O	he
O	desired
O	and
O	he
O	spun
O	all
O	the
O	straw
O	into
O	gold
O	when
O	the
C	king
O	came
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	his
O	orders
O	had
O	been
O	obeyed
O	he
O	married
O	the
O	maiden
O	and
O	the
O	beautiful
C	daughter
O	became
O	a
O	queen
O	after
O	a
O	year
O	had
O	passed
O	she
O	brought
O	a
O	lovely
O	baby
O	into
O	the
O	world
O	but
O	quite
O	forgot
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	till
O	he
O	walked
O	suddenly
O	into
O	her
O	chamber
O	and
O	said
O	give
O	me
O	what
O	you
O	promised
O	me
O	the
O	queen
O	was
O	frightened
O	and
O	offered
O	the
O	dwarf
O	all
O	the
O	riches
O	of
O	the
O	kingdom
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	only
O	leave
O	her
O	her
C	child
O	but
O	he
O	answered
O	no
O	something
O	living
O	is
O	dearer
O	to
O	me
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	treasures
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	then
O	the
O	queen
O	began
O	to
O	grieve
O	and
O	to
O	weep
O	so
O	bitterly
O	that
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	took
O	pity
O	upon
O	her
O	and
O	said

O	three
O	days

O	time
O	you

O	you
O	shall
O	keep
O	the
C	child
O	all
O	night
O	long
O	the
O	queen
O	thought
O	over
O	every

O	she
O	had
O	ever
O	heard
O	and
O	sent
O	a
O	messenger
O	through

O	to

O	came
O	again
O	she
O	began
O	with
O	caspar
O	melchoir
O	balthazar
O	and
O	repeated
O	each
O	after
O	each
O	all
O	the

O	she
O	knew
O	or
O	had
O	heard

O	at
O	each
O	one
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	said
O	that

O	the
O	second
O	day
O	she
O	again
O	sent

O	about
O	in
O	all
O	directions
O	to
O	ask
O	how
O	the
O	people
O	were
O	called
O	and
O	repeated
O	to
O	the
C	little
C	man
O	the
O	strangest
O	names
O	she
O	could
O	hear
O	of
O	or
O	imagine
O	to
O	each
O	he
O	answered
O	always
O	that
O	is
O	not
O	my
O	name
O	the
O	third
O	day
O	the
O	messenger
O	returned
O	and
O	said
O	i
O	have
O	not
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	single
O	new

O	sunk
O	into

O	to
O	the

O	near
O	here
O	though
O	so
O	surrounded
O	by

C	old
C	woman
O	madam

O	saluted
O	the

O	then
O	conducted
O	her
O	by
O	a

O	which
O	strange
O	to

O	to

O	the

O	proud
O	of

O	caused
O	her

O	down
O	on
O	a
O	bank
O	of
O	moss
O	but
O	passed
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	extreme
O	terror
O	hearing
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	roaring
O	around
O	her
O	and
O	often
O	forgetting
O	that

O	a

O	trying
O	to
O	save

O	by

O	a

O	like
O	a
O	human
O	being

O	reassured
O	her
O	a
O	little
O	she
O	admired
O	for

O	the

O	beauty
O	of
O	dawn
O	and
O	when
O	the
O	sun
O	rose
O	it
O	appeared
O	to
O	her
O	such
O	a
O	marvellous
O	sight
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	take
O	her
O	eyes
O	from
O	it
O	she
O	was
O	strangely
O	comforted
O	spite
O	of
O	all
O	her
O	misfortune
O	by
O	the

O	which
O	now
O	for

O	she
O	beheld
O	in
O	daylight
O	the
C	fairy
C	tulip
O	who
O	loved
C	désirée
O	was
O	very
O	sorry
O	for
O	her
O	although
O	somewhat
O	offended
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	had
O	not
O	taken
O	her
O	advice
O	and
O	detained
O	the
C	princess
O	safe
O	in
O	her
O	tower
O	till
O	she
O	was
O	fifteen
O	however
O	she
O	would
O	not
O	leave
O	her
O	a
O	prey
O	to
O	the
O	malice
O	of
O	the
C	fairy
C	of
C	the
C	fountain
O	so
O	contrived
O	invisibly
O	to
O	conduct
O	the
O	faithful
C	gilliflower
O	to
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	the
O	poor
O	forlorn
O	hind
O	reposed
O	as
O	soon
O	as
C	désirée
O	saw
O	her
O	she
O	leaped
O	the
O	stream
O	and
O	came
O	towards
O	her
O	former
O	companion
O	lavishing
O	on
O	her
O	a
O	thousand
O	caresses
O	at
O	first
C	gilliflower
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	astonished
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	taken
O	notice
O	of
O	by
O	a
O	deer
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	but
O	looking
O	at
O	it
O	attentively
O	she
O	saw
O	two
O	great
O	tears
O	rolling
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	soft
O	eyes
O	and
O	some
O	instinct
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	her
O	dear
C	princess
O	she
O	took
O	the
O	forefeet
O	of
O	the
O	hind
O	and
O	kissed
O	them
O	as
O	respectfully
O	as
O	if
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	her
O	mistress
O	s
O	hands
O	she
O	spoke
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	though
O	the
O	hind
O	could
O	not
O	reply
O	yet
O	it
O	was
O	clear
O	she
O	understood
O	for
O	the
O	tears
O	flowed
O	faster
O	than
O	ever
O	and
O	she
O	showed
O	by
O	as
O	much
O	intelligence
O	as
O	a
O	dumb
O	beast
O	could
O	possibly
O	evince
O	that
O	she
O	responded
O	to
O	the
O	love
O	of
O	the
O	faithful
O	girl
O	when
C	gilliflower
O	promised
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	never
O	quit
O	her
O	by
O	a
O	hundred
O	little
O	signs
O	the
O	poor
O	hind
O	tried
O	to
O	express
O	how
O	happy
O	she
O	was
O	they
O	passed
O	the
O	day
O	together
C	désirée
O	leading
O	her
O	companion
O	to
O	a
O	place
O	where
O	she
O	had
O	seen
O	plenty
O	of
O	wild
O	fruits
O	so
O	that
C	gilliflower
O	who
O	was
O	dying
O	of
O	hunger
O	became
O	strengthened
O	and
O	refreshed
O	but
O	when
O	night
O	came
O	the
O	girl
O	s
O	terrors
O	returned
O	dear
O	hind
O	said
O	she
O	where

O	we
O	sleep
O	if
O	we
O	stay
O	here
O	the
O	wild

O	where
O	we
O	can
O	hide
O	the
O	poor
O	hind
O	shook
O	her
O	pretty
O	head
O	and
O	the
O	tears
O	again
O	began
O	to
O	flow
O	almost
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	were
O	a
O	human
O	being
O	her
O	tears
O	melted
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
C	fairy
C	tulip
O	who
O	had
O	watched
O	her
O	invisibly
O	all
O	the
O	time
O	and
O	now
O	made

O	known
O	appearing
O	suddenly
O	in
O	a
O	shady
O	alley
O	of
O	the
O	wood
C	gilliflower
O	and
O	the

O	threw

O	at

O	the

O	licking
O	her

O	the

O	her

O	too
O	much
O	power
O	but
O	i
O	can
O	shorten
O	her
O	term
O	of
O	punishment
O	and
O	soften
O	it
O	a
O	little
O	by
O	granting
O	that
O	during
O	every
O	night
O	she
O	becomes
O	a

O	though
O	as
O	soon

O	again
O	wander
O	about
O	as
O	a
O	hind
O	of
O	the

O	it
O	was
O	a
O	great
O	comfort
O	to

O	a
O	woman
O	every
O	night
O	and
O	the

O	showed

O	joy
O	by

O	the

O	came
O	to
O	a

O	an
C	old
C	woman
O	making
O	a
O	basket
O	of

O	my
O	good
O	woman

O	here
O	yes
O	truly
O	replied
O	the
C	old
C	woman
O	and

O	into
O	a
O	room
O	where
O	were

O	hung
O	with

O	with

O	and
O	comfortable
O	as
O	possible
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	grew
O	dark
O	the
C	princess
O	recovered
O	her
O	own

O	who
O	on

O	then

O	in

O	when
O	morning
O	broke
C	gilliflower
O	was
O	awakened
O	by
O	a
O	scratching
O	and
O	there
O	she

O	the

O	just
O	as
O	much
O	a
O	hind
O	as
O	before

O	deer
O	sprang
O	out
O	quickly
O	and
O	disappeared
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	now
O	by
O	an
O	extraordinary
O	chance
O	it
O	happened
O	that
C	prince
C	warrior
O	wandering
O	about
O	indifferent
O	to
O	where
O	he
O	went
O	lost

C	becafico
O	the

O	seeking
O	for
O	fruits
O	to
O	satisfy
O	their
O	hunger
O	reached
O	the
O	same
O	where
O	the
C	old
C	woman
O	lived
O	and
O	being
O	received
O	kindly
O	asked
O	her
O	for
O	some

O	for

O	she
O	put

O	to
O	give
O	it
O	to
O	him
O	when
O	her
O	charity
O	made
O	her
O	offer
O	the
O	wanderers
O	shelter
O	for
O	the
O	night
O	it
O	is
O	a
O	poor

O	said

O	save
O	you
O	from
O	being
O	eaten
O	up
O	by
O	wolves
O	and
O	lions
O	so
O	the
C	prince
O	was
O	persuaded
O	and
O	the
C	old
C	woman
O	who
O	appeared
O	ignorant
O	of

O	admitted

O	and
C	becafico
O	cautiously
O	so
O	as

O	the

O	who

O	thus
O	the
O	two

O	it
O	the
C	prince
O	rarely
O	slept
O	much
O	his
O	sorrow
O	was
O	still
O	too
O	great

O	when
O	the

O	of

O	shone
O	through

O	window
O	he
O	arose
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	into
O	the

O	there
O	he
O	wandered
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	without
O	finding
O	any
O	sure
O	track
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	came
O	upon
O	a
O	sort

O	overhung
O	with

O	and
O	carpeted

O	now
O	the

O	until

O	tree
O	over

O	the

O	she
O	approached

O	it
O	did
O	not

O	but
O	instead
O	of

O	and
O	he
O	almost
O	fancied
O	she
O	understood
O	all
O	the

O	things
O	he
O	said
O	to

O	so
O	time

O	grew
O	dusk
O	my

O	hind
O	said
O	he
O	i

O	stream
O	where
O	you

O	and
O	then
O	we

O	stole
O	away
O	and
O	had
O	only
O	time
O	to
O	reach
O	the

O	when
O	the
O	transformation
O	happened
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	hind
O	but
O	a
O	weeping
C	princess
O	who
O	threw
O	herself
O	on
O	the
O	bed
O	beside
O	the

C	gilliflower
O	i
O	have

O	he
O	was
O	the
O	hunter
O	who
O	has
O	pursued
O	me
O	these
O	two
O	days
O	and
O	has
O	taken
O	me
O	at
O	last
O	but
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	slay
O	me
O	he
O	saved
O	and
O	caressed
O	me
O	ah
O	he
O	is
O	gentler
O	and
O	sweeter
O	even
O	than
O	the

O	here
O	she
O	began
O	again
O	to
O	weep
O	but
C	gilliflower
O	consoled
O	her
O	and
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	wondering
O	much
O	how
O	this
O	adventure
O	would
O	end
O	the
C	prince
O	returning
O	from
O	the

O	missed
O	his

O	white
O	hind
O	and
O	came
O	back
O	to
C	becafico
O	full
O	of
O	grief
O	mingled
O	with
O	a
O	certain
O	anger
O	at
O	the
O	ingratitude
O	of
O	the
O	creature
O	to
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	kind
O	but
O	at
O	break
O	of
O	day
O	he
O	rose
O	determined
O	again
O	to
O	pursue
O	her
O	she
O	however
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	avoid
O	him
O	took
O	a
O	quite
O	different
O	route
O	still
O	the
O	forest
O	was
O	not
O	so
O	large
O	but
O	that
O	at

O	he
O	saw
O	her
O	leaping
O	and
O	bounding
O	among
O	the
O	bushes
O	seized
O	by
O	an
O	irresistible
O	impulse
O	he
O	shot
O	an
O	arrow
O	after

O	struck
O	her
O	she
O	felt
O	a
O	violent
O	pain
O	dart
O	through
O	one
O	of
O	her
O	slender
O	limbs
O	and
O	fell
O	helpless
O	on
O	the
O	grass
O	when
O	the
C	prince
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	he
O	was
O	overcome
O	with
O	remorse
O	for
O	his
O	cruelty
O	he
O	took
O	a
O	handful
O	of
O	herbs
O	and
O	bound
O	up
O	her
O	wound
O	made
O	her
O	a
O	bed
O	of
O	branches
O	and
O	moss
O	laid
O	her
O	head
O	upon
O	his
O	knees
O	and
O	wept
O	over

O	you
O	will
O	hate
O	me
O	when

O	cherished
O	her
O	all
O	day
O	and
O	towards

O	he
O	knotted
O	a

O	with
O	the
O	intention
O	of
O	gently
O	leading
O	her
O	home
O	but
O	she
O	struggled
O	with

O	and
O	the
O	struggle
O	was
O	so
O	sore
O	that

O	heard
O	a

O	although
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	thirsty
O	but
O	said

O	what
O	you

O	for
O	my
O	thirst
O	is
O	getting
O	unbearable
O	and
O	when
O	they

O	to
O	the

O	the

C	sister
O	heard

O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the

O	drop
O	touched
O	his
O	lips
O	there
O	he
O	lay
O	a
O	white
C	roe
O	the
O	little
C	sister
O	cried
O	over
O	her
O	poor
O	bewitched
C	brother
O	and
O	the

O	cried
O	also
O	as
O	he
O	rested
O	mournfully
O	beside
O	her
O	at
O	last
O	the

O	said
O	never
O	mind
O	dear
C	roe
O	i
O	will
O	never
O	forsake
O	you
O	so
O	she
O	took
O	off
O	her
O	golden
O	garter
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	round
O	the

O	s
O	neck
O	then
O	pulled
O	some

O	and
O	wove
O	them
O	into
O	a
O	cord
O	to
O	this
O	she
O	tied
O	the
O	little
O	animal
O	and
O	led
O	him
O	on
O	and
O	they
O	both
O	went
O	still
O	deeper
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	when
O	they
O	had
O	gone
O	a
O	long
O	long
O	way
O	they
O	came
O	at
O	last
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	house
O	into
O	which
O	the
O	maiden
O	peeped
O	and
O	as

O	was
O	empty
O	she
O	thought
O	here
O	we
O	may
O	stay
O	and
O	live
O	so
O	she
O	made
O	a
O	pretty
O	bed
O	of
O	leaves
O	and
O	moss
O	for
O	the
C	roe
O	and
O	every
O	morning
O	she
O	went
O	out
O	and
O	gathered
O	roots
O	berries
O	and
O	nuts
O	for
O	herself
O	and
O	for
O	the
C	roe
O	she
O	brought
O	tender
O	grass
O	which
O	he
O	ate
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	hand
O	and
O	played
O	about
O	and
O	was
O	very
O	happy
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	when
O	the
O	little
C	sister
O	was
O	tired
O	and
O	had
O	said
O	her
O	prayers
O	she
O	laid
O	her
O	head
O	upon
O	the
C	roe
O	who
O	was
O	her
O	pillow
O	and
O	went
O	sweetly
O	to
O	sleep
O	and
O	if
O	her
C	brother
O	had
O	only
O	kept
O	his
O	proper
O	shape
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	led
O	a
O	very
O	happy
O	life
O	they
O	had
O	lived
O	alone
O	in
O	this
O	way
O	during
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	when
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	the

O	held
O	a

O	hunt
O	in

O	through

O	might
O	be
O	heard
O	the
O	blowing
O	of
O	horns
O	the
O	barking
O	of
O	dogs
O	and
O	the
O	joyous
O	cries
O	of
O	the
O	hunters
O	which
O	when
O	the
O	little
C	roe
O	heard
O	he
O	was
O	almost
O	beside
O	himself
O	with
O	delight
O	oh
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	his
C	sister
O	let
O	me
O	go
O	and
O	see
O	the
O	hunt
O	i

O	refrain
O	and
O	he
O	begged
O	hard
O	till
O	she
O	consented
O	but
O	said
O	she
O	when
O	you
O	return
O	at
O	evening
O	i
O	shall
O	have
O	shut
O	my

O	knock
O	and
O	say
O	my

O	let
O	me
O	in
O	but
O	if

O	so
O	i
O	shall
O	not
O	open
O	the
O	door
O	now
O	off
O	sprang
O	the
C	roe
O	and
O	was
O	so
O	happy
O	to
O	find
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	open
O	air
O	the
C	king
O	and
O	his
C	huntsmen
O	saw
O	the
O	beautiful
O	beast
O	and
O	set
O	off
O	after
O	him
O	but
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	catch
O	him
O	for
O	when
O	they
O	thought
O	they
O	had
O	certainly
O	got
O	him
O	he
O	sprang
O	over
O	a
O	bush
O	and
O	disappeared
O	when
O	it
O	was
O	dark
O	he
O	galloped
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	little

O	knocked
O	and
O	cried
O	my

O	and
O	rested
O	all
O	night
O	on
O	his
O	pretty
O	little
O	bed
O	next
O	morning
O	the
O	hunt
O	began
O	again
O	and
O	when
O	the
C	roe
O	heard
O	the
O	blast
O	of
O	the
O	horns
O	and
O	the
O	ho
O	ho
O	of
O	the

O	he
O	could
O	not

O	his
C	sister
O	opened
O	the

O	and
O	said
O	but
O	mind
O	you
O	must
O	be
O	back
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	and
O	make
O	your
O	little
O	speech
O	that

O	you
O	in
O	when

O	band
O	once
O	more
O	they
O	all
O	rode
O	after

O	but
O	he
O	was
O	too
O	quick
O	and
O	agile
O	for
O	them
O	this
O	chase
O	lasted
O	the
O	whole
O	day
O	at

O	towards

O	the

O	surrounded
O	him
O	and
O	wounded
O	him
O	with
O	an
O	arrow
O	in
O	the

O	so
O	that
O	he
O	was

O	go
O	slowly
O	one

O	creeping
O	softly
O	after

O	out
O	quite
O	silently
O	through

O	of
O	the
O	sentinels
O	whether
O	any

O	she
O	went
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	and
O	told

O	he
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	nursery
O	and
O	there
O	at
O	midnight
O	the
O	dead
C	queen

O	nursed
O	and
O	fondled
O	the

O	the

O	could
O	no

O	contain
O	himself
O	but
O	sprang
O	forward
O	and
O	cried
O	thou

O	surely
O	be
O	no
O	one
O	but
O	my

O	dear
O	wife
O	she
O	replied

O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	she

O	blooming
O	then
O	she
O	related

O	the

O	committed
O	on

O	i

O	for
O	a

O	notwithstanding
O	the

O	who
O	did
O	all
O	in
O	their
O	power
O	to
O	dissuade
O	me
O	instead
O	of
O	taking
O	my
O	way
O	by
O	the
O	persian

O	i
O	travelled

O	through
O	several
O	provinces
O	of

O	and
O	the
O	indies
O	and
O	arrived
O	at
O	a
O	seaport
O	where
O	i
O	embarked
O	in
O	a
O	ship
O	the
O	captain
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	bound
O	on
O	a
O	long
O	voyage
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	and
O	the
O	pilot
O	lost
O	their
O	course
O	suddenly
O	we
O	saw
O	the
O	captain
O	quit
O	his
O	rudder
O	uttering
O	loud
O	lamentations
O	he
O	threw
O	off
O	his
O	turban
O	pulled
O	his
O	beard
O	and
O	beat
O	his
O	head
O	like
O	a
O	madman
O	we
O	asked
O	him
O	the
O	reason
O	and
O	he
O	answered
O	that
O	we
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	dangerous
O	place
O	in
O	all
O	the
O	ocean
O	a
O	rapid
O	current
O	carries
O	the
O	ship
O	along
O	with
O	it
O	and
O	we
O	shall
O	all
O	perish
O	in
O	less
O	than
O	a
O	quarter
O	of
O	an
O	hour
O	pray
O	to
O	god
O	to
O	deliver
O	us
O	from
O	this
O	peril
O	we
O	cannot
O	escape
O	if
O	he
O	do
O	not
O	take
O	pity
O	on
O	us
O	at
O	these
O	words
O	he
O	ordered
O	the
O	sails
O	to
O	be
O	lowered
O	but
O	all
O	the
O	ropes
O	broke
O	and
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	carried
O	by
O	the
O	current
O	to
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	an
O	inaccessible
O	mountain
O	where
O	she
O	struck
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	pieces
O	yet
O	in
O	such
O	a
O	manner
O	that
O	we
O	saved
O	our
O	lives
O	our
O	provisions
O	and
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	our
O	goods
O	the
O	mountain
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	which
O	we
O	were
O	was
O	covered
O	with

O	with
O	a
O	vast
O	number
O	of
O	human
O	bones

O	with
O	an
O	incredible
O	quantity
O	of
O	goods
O	and
O	riches
O	of
O	all
O	kinds
O	these
O	objects
O	served
O	only
O	to
O	augment
O	our
O	despair
O	in
O	all
O	other
O	places
O	it
O	is
O	usual
O	for
O	rivers
O	to
O	run
O	from

O	into
O	the

O	but
O	here
O	a
O	river
O	of
O	fresh
O	water
O	runs
O	from

O	into
O	a
O	dark
O	cavern
O	whose
O	entrance
O	is
O	very
O	high
O	and
O	spacious
O	what
O	is
O	most
O	remarkable
O	in
O	this
O	place
O	is
O	that
O	the
O	stones
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	are
O	of
O	crystal
O	rubies
O	or
O	other

O	here
O	is
O	also
O	a
O	sort
O	of
O	fountain
O	of
O	pitch
O	or
O	bitumen
O	that
O	runs
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	which
O	the
O	fish
O	swallow
O	and
O	evacuate
O	soon
O	afterward

O	up
O	on
O	the
O	beach
O	in
O	great
O	quantities
O	trees
O	also
O	grow
O	here
O	most
O	of
O	which
O	are
O	of
O	wood
O	of
O	aloes
O	equal
O	in
O	goodness
O	to
O	those
O	of

O	the
O	description

O	it

O	when

O	the

O	a
O	calm
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	force
O	of
O	the
O	current
O	carries
O	them
O	ashore
O	and
O	what
O	completes
O	the
O	misfortune
O	is
O	that
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	possibility
O	of
O	ascending
O	the
O	mountain
O	or
O	of
O	escaping
O	by

O	we
O	continued
O	upon
O	the
O	shore
O	at
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	mountain
O	in
O	a
O	state
O	of
O	despair
O	and
O	expected
O	death
O	every
O	day
O	on
O	our
O	first
O	landing
O	we
O	had
O	divided
O	our
O	provisions
O	as
O	equally
O	as
O	we
O	could
O	and
O	thus
O	every
O	one
O	lived
O	a
O	longer
O	or
O	shorter
O	time
O	according
O	to
O	his
O	temperance
O	and
O	the
O	use
O	he
O	made
O	of
O	his
O	provisions
O	i
O	survived
O	all
O	my
O	companions
O	and
O	when
O	i
O	buried
O	the
O	last
O	i
O	had
O	so
O	little
O	provisions
O	remaining
O	that
O	i
O	thought
O	i
O	could
O	not
O	long
O	survive
O	and
O	i
O	dug
O	a
O	grave
O	resolving
O	to
O	lie
O	down
O	in
O	it
O	because
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	one
O	left
O	to
O	pay
O	me
O	the

O	it
O	pleased
O	god
O	once
O	more
O	to
O	take
O	compassion
O	on
O	me
O	and
O	put
O	it
O	in
O	my
O	mind
O	to
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	which
O	ran
O	into
O	the
O	great
O	cavern
O	considering
O	its
O	probable
O	course
O	with
O	great
O	attention
O	i
O	said
O	to
O	myself
O	this
O	river
O	which
O	runs
O	thus
O	underground
O	must
O	somewhere
O	have
O	an
O	issue
O	if
O	i
O	make
O	a
O	raft
O	and
O	leave
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	current
O	it
O	will
O	convey
O	me
O	to
O	some
O	inhabited
O	country
O	or
O	i
O	shall
O	perish
O	if
O	i
O	be
O	drowned
O	i
O	lose
O	nothing
O	but
O	only
O	change
O	one
O	kind
O	of
O	death
O	for
O	another
O	i
O	immediately
O	went
O	to
O	work
O	upon
O	large
O	pieces
O	of
O	timber
O	and
O	cables
O	for
O	i
O	had
O	a
O	choice
O	of
O	them
O	from
O	the
O	wrecks
O	and
O	tied
O	them
O	together
O	so
O	strongly
O	that
O	i
O	soon
O	made
O	a
O	very
O	solid
O	raft
O	when
O	i
O	had
O	finished
O	i
O	loaded
O	it
O	with
O	some
O	chests
O	of
O	rubies
O	emeralds
O	ambergris
O	rock
O	crystal
O	and
O	bales
O	of
O	rich
O	stuffs
O	having
O	balanced
O	my
O	cargo
O	exactly
O	and
O	fastened
O	it
O	well
O	to
O	the
O	raft
O	i
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	with
O	two
O	oars
O	that
O	i
O	had
O	made
O	and
O	leaving
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	course
O	of
O	the
O	river
O	resigned
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	god
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	i
O	entered
O	the
O	cavern
O	i
O	lost
O	all
O	light
O	and
O	the
O	stream
O	carried
O	me
O	i
O	knew
O	not
O	whither
O	thus
O	i
O	floated
O	on
O	in
O	perfect
O	darkness
O	and
O	once
O	found
O	the
O	arch
O	so
O	low
O	that
O	it
O	very
O	nearly
O	touched
O	my
O	head
O	which
O	made
O	me
O	cautious
O	afterward
O	to
O	avoid
O	the
O	like
O	danger
O	all
O	this
O	while
O	i
O	ate
O	nothing
O	but
O	what
O	was
O	just
O	necessary
O	to
O	support
O	nature
O	yet
O	notwithstanding
O	my
O	frugality
O	all
O	my
O	provisions
O	were
O	spent
O	then
O	i
O	became
O	insensible
O	i
O	cannot
O	tell
O	how
O	long
O	i
O	continued
O	so
O	but
O	when
O	i
O	revived
O	i
O	was
O	surprised
O	to
O	find
O	myself
O	in
O	an
O	extensive
O	plain
O	on
O	the
O	brink
O	of
O	a
O	river
O	where
O	my
O	raft
O	was
O	tied
O	among
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	negroes
O	i
O	got
O	up
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	i
O	saw
O	them
O	and
O	saluted
O	them
O	they
O	spoke
O	to
O	me
O	but
O	i
O	did
O	not
O	understand
O	their
O	language
O	i
O	was
O	so
O	transported
O	with
O	joy
O	that
O	i
O	knew
O	not
O	whether
O	i
O	was
O	asleep
O	or
O	awake
O	but
O	being
O	persuaded
O	that
O	i
O	was
O	not
O	asleep
O	i
O	recited
O	the
O	following
O	words

O	aloud
O	call
O	upon
O	the
O	almighty

O	about
O	anything
O	else
O	shut
O	thy

O	and
O	while
O	thou
O	art
O	asleep
O	god
O	will
O	change
O	thy
O	bad
O	fortune
O	into
O	good
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	negroes
O	who
O	understood
C	arabic
O	hearing
O	me
O	speak
O	thus
O	came
O	toward
O	me
O	and
O	said
O	brother
O	be
O	not
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	us
O	we
O	are
O	inhabitants
O	of
O	this

O	from
O	this
O	river
O	which
O	comes
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	neighboring
O	mountain
O	we
O	saw
O	your
O	raft
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	us
O	swam
O	into
O	the
O	river
O	and
O	brought
O	it
O	hither
O	where
O	we
O	fastened
O	it
O	as
O	you
O	see
O	until
O	you
O	should
O	awake
O	pray
O	tell
O	us
O	your
O	history
O	whence
O	did
O	you
O	come
O	i
O	begged
O	of
O	them
O	first
O	to
O	give
O	me
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	then
O	i
O	would
O	satisfy
O	their
O	curiosity
O	they
O	gave
O	me
O	several
O	sorts
O	of
O	food
O	and
O	when
O	i
O	had
O	satisfied
O	my
O	hunger
O	i
O	related

O	which
O	they
O	listened
O	to
O	with

O	i
O	grew
O	weary
O	of
O	an
O	indolent
O	life
O	and
O	i
O	put
O	to
O	sea
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	with
C	merchants
O	of
O	known
O	probity
O	we
O	embarked
O	on
O	board
O	a
O	good
O	ship
O	and
O	after
O	recommending
O	ourselves
O	to
O	god
O	set
O	sail
O	we
O	traded
O	from
O	island
O	to
O	island
O	and
O	exchanged
O	commodities
O	with
O	great
O	profit
O	one
O	day
O	we
O	landed
O	on
O	an
O	island
O	covered
O	with
O	several
O	sorts
O	of
O	but
O	we
O	could
O	see
O	neither
O	man
O	nor
O	animal
O	we
O	walked
O	in
O	the
O	meadows
O	along
O	the
O	streams
O	that
O	watered
O	them
O	while
O	some
O	diverted
O	themselves
O	with
O	gathering
O	flowers
O	and
O	others
O	fruits
O	i
O	took
O	my
O	wine
O	and
O	provisions
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	near
O	a
O	stream
O	between
O	two
O	high
O	trees
O	which
O	formed
O	a
O	thick
O	shade
O	i
O	made
O	a
O	good
O	meal
O	and
O	afterward
O	fell
O	asleep
O	i
O	cannot
O	tell
O	how
O	long
O	i
O	slept
O	but
O	when
O	i
O	awoke
O	the
O	ship
O	was
O	gone
O	in
O	this
O	sad
O	condition
O	i
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	die
O	with
O	grief
O	i
O	cried
O	out
O	in
O	agony
O	beat
O	my
O	head
O	and
O	breast
O	and
O	threw
O	myself
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	where
O	i
O	lay
O	some
O	time
O	in
O	despair
O	i
O	upbraided
O	myself
O	a
O	hundred
O	times
O	for
O	not
O	being
O	content
O	with
O	the
O	produce
O	of
O	my
O	first
O	voyage
O	that
O	might
O	have
O	sufficed
O	me
O	all
O	my
O	life
O	but
O	all
O	this
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	and
O	my
O	repentance
O	came
O	too
O	late
O	at
O	last
O	i
O	resigned
O	myself
O	to
O	the
O	will
O	of
O	god
O	not
O	knowing
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	i
O	climbed
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	a
O	lofty
O	tree
O	from
O	which
O	i
O	looked
O	about
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	i
O	could
O	discover
O	anything
O	that
O	could
O	give
O	me
O	hopes
O	when
O	i
O	gazed
O	toward
O	the
O	sea
O	i
O	could
O	see
O	nothing
O	but
O	sky
O	and
O	water
O	but
O	looking
O	over
O	the
O	land
O	i
O	beheld
O	something
O	white
O	and
O	coming
O	down
O	i
O	took
O	what
O	provision
O	i
O	had
O	left
O	and
O	went
O	toward
O	it
O	the
O	distance
O	being
O	so
O	great
O	that
O	i
O	could
O	not
O	distinguish
O	what
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	i
O	approached
O	i
O	thought
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	white
O	dome
O	of
O	a
O	prodigious
O	height
O	and
O	extent
O	and
O	when
O	i
O	came
O	up
O	to
O	it
O	i
O	touched
O	it
O	and
O	found
O	it
O	to
O	be
O	very
O	smooth
O	i
O	went
O	round
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	open
O	on
O	any
O	side
O	but
O	saw
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	and
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	climbing
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	smooth
O	it
O	was
O	at
O	least
O	fifty
O	paces
O	round
O	by
O	this
O	time
O	the
O	sun
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	set
O	and
O	all
O	of
O	a
O	sudden
O	the
O	sky
O	became
O	as
O	dark
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	covered
O	with
O	a
O	thick
O	cloud
O	i
O	was
O	much
O	astonished
O	at
O	this
O	sudden
O	darkness
O	but
O	much
O	more
O	when
O	i
O	found
O	it
O	occasioned
O	by
O	a
O	bird
O	of
O	a
O	monstrous
O	size
O	that
O	came
O	flying
O	toward
O	me
O	i
O	remembered
O	that
O	i
O	had
O	often
O	heard
O	mariners
O	speak
O	of
O	a
O	miraculous
O	bird
O	called
O	the
C	roc
O	and
O	conceived
O	that
O	the
O	great
O	dome
O	which
O	i
O	so
O	much
O	admired
O	must
O	be
O	its
O	egg
O	in
O	short
O	the
O	bird
O	alighted
O	and
O	sat
O	over
O	the
O	egg
O	as
O	i
O	perceived
O	her
O	coming
O	i
O	crept
O	close
O	to
O	the
O	egg
O	so
O	that
O	i
O	had
O	before
O	me
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	legs
O	of
O	the
O	bird
O	which
O	was
O	as
O	big
O	as
O	the
O	trunk
O	of
O	a
O	tree
O	i
O	tied
O	myself
O	strongly
O	to
O	it
O	with
O	my
O	turban
O	in
O	hopes
O	that
O	the
C	roc
O	next
O	morning
O	would
O	carry
O	me
O	with
O	her
O	out
O	of
O	this
O	desert
O	island
O	after
O	having
O	passed
O	the
O	night
O	in
O	this
O	condition
O	the
O	bird
O	flew
O	away
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	daylight
O	and
O	carried
O	me
O	so
O	high
O	that
O	i
O	could
O	not
O	discern
O	the
O	earth
O	she
O	afterward
O	descended
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	rapidity
O	that
O	i
O	lost
O	my
O	senses
O	but
O	when
O	i
O	found
O	myself
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	i
O	speedily
O	untied
O	the
O	knot
O	and
O	had
O	scarcely
O	done
O	so
O	when
O	the
C	roc
O	having
O	taken
O	up
O	a
O	serpent
O	of
O	monstrous
O	length
O	in
O	her
O	bill
O	flew
O	away
O	the
O	spot
O	where
O	it
O	left
O	me
O	was
O	encompassed
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	by
O	mountains
O	that
O	seemed
O	to
O	reach
O	above
O	the
O	clouds
O	and
O	so
O	steep
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	no
O	possibility
O	of
O	getting
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	valley
O	this
O	was
O	a
O	new
O	perplexity
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	i
O	compared
O	this
O	place
O	with
O	the
O	desert
O	island
O	from
O	which
O	the
C	roc
O	had
O	brought
O	me
O	i
O	found
O	that

O	gained
O	nothing
O	by
O	the
O	change
O	as
O	i
O	walked
O	through
O	this
O	valley
O	i
O	perceived
O	it
O	was
O	strewn
O	with
O	diamonds
O	some
O	of
O	which
O	were
O	of
O	a
O	surprising
O	bigness
O	i
O	took
O	pleasure
O	in
O	looking
O	upon
O	them
O	but
O	shortly
O	saw
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	such
O	objects
O	as
O	greatly
O	diminished
O	my
O	satisfaction
O	and
O	which
O	i
O	could
O	not
O	view
O	without
O	terror
O	namely
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	serpents
O	so
O	monstrous
O	that
O	the
O	least
O	of
O	them
O	was
O	capable
O	of
O	swallowing
O	an
O	elephant
O	they
O	retired
O	in
O	the
O	daytime
O	to
O	their
O	dens
O	where
O	they
O	hid
O	themselves
O	from
O	the
C	roc
O	their
O	enemy
O	and
O	came
O	out
O	only
O	in
O	the
O	night
O	i
O	spent
O	the
O	day
O	in
O	walking
O	about
O	in
O	the
O	valley
O	resting
O	myself
O	at
O	times
O	in
O	such
O	places
O	as
O	i
O	thought
O	most
O	convenient
O	when
O	night
O	came
O	on
O	i
O	went
O	into
O	a
O	cave
O	where
O	i
O	thought
O	i
O	might
O	repose
O	in
O	safety
O	i
O	secured
O	the
O	entrance
O	which
O	was
O	low
O	and
O	narrow
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	to
O	preserve
O	me
O	from
O	the
O	serpents
O	but
O	not
O	so
O	far
O	as
O	to
O	exclude
O	the
O	light
O	i
O	supped
O	on
O	part
O	of
O	my
O	provisions
O	but
O	the
O	serpents
O	which
O	began
O	hissing
O	round
O	me
O	put
O	me
O	into
O	such
O	extreme
O	fear
O	that
O	i
O	did
O	not
O	sleep
O	when
O	day
O	appeared
O	the
O	serpents
O	retired
O	and
O	i
O	came
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	cave
O	trembling
O	i
O	can
O	justly
O	say
O	that
O	i
O	walked
O	upon
O	diamonds
O	without
O	feeling
O	any
O	inclination
O	to
O	touch
O	them
O	at
O	last
O	i
O	sat
O	down
O	and
O	notwithstanding
O	my
O	apprehensions
O	not
O	having
O	closed
O	my
O	eyes
O	during
O	the

O	asleep
O	after

O	eaten
O	a
O	little

O	but
O	i
O	had
O	scarcely
O	shut
O	my
O	eyes
O	when
O	something
O	that
O	fell
O	by
O	me
O	with
O	a
O	great
O	noise
O	awaked
O	me
O	this

O	a
O	large
O	piece
O	of
O	raw
O	meat
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	i
O	saw
O	several
O	others
O	fall
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	rocks
O	in
O	different
O	places
O	i
O	had
O	always

O	what

O	heard
O	sailors

O	to
O	obtain
O	jewels
O	from
O	thence
O	but
O	now
O	i
O	found
O	that

O	had
O	stated
O	nothing
O	but
O	the
O	truth
O	for
O	the
O	fact
O	is
O	that
O	the
C	merchants
O	come
O	to
O	the

O	off
O	the

O	i
O	perceived

O	tied
O	it
O	close
O	round

O	then

O	the

O	the

O	to

O	one
O	of

O	those

O	surprised
O	at
O	the

O	size
O	and
O	perfection

O	without

O	myself
O	out
O	of

O	the

O	had
O	enjoyed
O	all
O	these
O	pleasures
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	he
O	grew
O	tired
O	of
O	them
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	keep
O	company
O	with
O	young
O	noblemen
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	with
O	whom
O	he
O	sat
O	up
O	all
O	night
O	drinking
O	and
O	playing
O	cards
O	so
O	that
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	years
O	he
O	spent
O	all
O	his
O	fortune
O	he
O	was
O	now
O	very
O	sorry
O	for
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	too
O	late
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	but
O	to
O	work
O	at
O	some
O	trade
O	to
O	support
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	child
O	for
O	all
O	this
O	the
O	lady
C	graciana
O	never
O	found
O	fault
O	with
O	him
O	but
O	still
O	loved
O	her
O	husband
O	the
O	same
O	as
O	before
O	saying
O	dear
C	theodorus
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	i
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	how
O	to

O	at

O	if

O	you
O	in
O	earning
O	money
O	i
O	will

O	you
O	to

O	it
O	so
C	theodorus
O	set
O	to
O	work
O	and
O	though
O	the
O	lady
C	graciana
O	had
O	always
O	been
O	used
O	only
O	to
O	ring
O	her

O	for

O	that

O	wanted
O	she
O	now
O	scoured
O	the

O	and
O	washed
O	the

O	with
O	her
O	own
O	hands
O	they
O	went
O	on
O	in
O	this
O	manner
O	till
C	fortunatus
O	was
O	sixteen
O	years
O	of
O	age
O	when
O	that
O	time
O	came
O	one
O	day
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	sitting
O	at
O	dinner
C	theodorus
O	fixed
O	his
O	eyes
O	on
O	his
O	son
O	and
O	sighed
O	deeply
O	what
O	is
O	the

O	with
O	you
O	father
O	said
C	fortunatus
O	ah
O	my
O	child
O	said
C	theodorus
O	i
O	have
O	reason
O	enough
O	to
O	be
O	sorry
O	when
O	i
O	think
O	of
O	the
O	noble
O	fortune
O	which
O	i
O	have
O	spent
O	and
O	that

O	will
O	force
O	you
O	to
O	labour
O	for
O	your
O	living
O	father
O	replied
C	fortunatus
O	do
O	not
O	grieve
O	about
O	it
O	i
O	have
O	often
O	thought
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	time
O	i
O	should
O	do
O	something
O	for
O	myself
O	and
O	though
O	i
O	have
O	not
O	been
O	brought
O	up
O	to
O	any
O	trade
O	yet
O	i
O	hope
O	i
O	can
O	contrive
O	to
O	support
O	myself
O	somehow
O	when
C	fortunatus
O	had
O	done
O	his
O	dinner
O	he
O	took
O	his
O	hat
O	and
O	walked
O	to
O	the
O	thinking
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	could
O	do
O	so
O	as
O	to
O	be
O	no
O	longer
O	a
O	burden
O	to
O	his
O	parents
O	just
O	as
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	the
C	earl
O	of
O	flanders
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	to
O	jerusalem
O	was

O	his
C	servants
O	to
O	set
O	sail
O	for
O	flanders
C	fortunatus
O	now
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	offer
O	himself
O	to
O	be
O	the
C	earl
O	s
O	page
O	when
O	the
C	earl
O	saw
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	lad
O	and
O	heard
O	the
O	quick
O	replies
O	which
O	he
O	made
O	to
O	his
O	questions
O	he
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	his
O	service
O	so
O	at
O	once
O	they
O	all
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	on
O	their
O	way
O	the
O	ship
O	stopped
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	at
O	the
O	port
O	of
O	venice
O	where
C	fortunatus
O	saw
O	many
O	strange
O	things
O	which
O	made
O	him
O	wish
O	still
O	more
O	to
O	travel
O	and
O	taught
O	him
O	much
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	before
O	soon
O	after
O	this
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	flanders
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	long
O	on
O	shore
O	before
O	the
C	earl
O	his
O	master
O	was
O	married
O	to
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	the
O	duke
O	of

O	the

O	with
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	public
O	feasting
O	and
O	games
O	on
O	horseback
O	called
O	tilts
O	which
O	lasted
O	many
O	days
O	and
O	among
O	the
O	rest
O	the
C	earl
O	s
O	lady
O	gave
O	two
O	jewels
O	as
O	prizes
O	to
O	be
O	played
O	for
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	a
O	hundred
O	crowns
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	was
O	won
O	by
C	fortunatus
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	by
C	timothy
O	a
O	servant
O	of
O	the
O	duke
O	of
O	burgundy
O	who
O	afterwards
O	ran
O	another
O	tilt
O	with
C	fortunatus
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	winner
O	was
O	to
O	have
O	both
O	the
O	jewels
O	so
O	they
O	tilted
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	fourth
O	course
C	fortunatus
O	hoisted
C	timothy
O	a
O	full
O	spear
O	s
O	length
O	from
O	his
O	horse
O	and
O	thus
O	won
O	both
O	the
O	jewels
O	which
O	pleased
O	the
C	earl
O	and
C	countess
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	they
O	praised
C	fortunatus
O	and
O	thought
O	better
O	of
O	him
O	than
O	ever
O	at
O	this
O	time
O	also
C	fortunatus
O	had
O	many
O	rich
O	presents
O	given
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	lords
O	and
O	ladies
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	but
O	the
O	high
O	favour
O	shown
O	him
O	made
O	his
O	jealous
O	and
O	one
O	named
C	robert
O	who
O	had
O	always
O	pretended
O	a
O	great
O	friendship
O	for
C	fortunatus
O	made
O	him
O	believe
O	that
O	for
O	all
O	his
O	seeming
O	kindness
O	the
C	earl
O	in
O	secret
O	envied
O	him
O	his
O	great
O	skill
O	in
O	tilting
C	robert
O	said
O	too
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	the
C	earl
O	give
O	private
O	orders
O	to
O	one
O	of
O	his
C	servants
O	to
O	find
O	some
O	way
O	of
O	killing
O	him
O	next
O	day
O	while
O	they
O	should
O	all
O	be
O	out
O	hunting
C	fortunatus
O	thanked
O	the
O	wicked
C	robert
O	for
O	what
O	he
O	thought
O	a
O	great
O	kindness
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	at
O	daybreak
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	swiftest
O	horse
O	in
O	the
C	earl
O	s
O	stables
O	and
O	left
O	the
O	country
O	when
O	the
C	earl
O	heard
O	that
C	fortunatus
O	had
O	gone
O	away
O	in
O	a
O	hurry
O	he
O	was
O	much
O	surprised
O	and
O	asked
O	all
O	his
C	servants
O	what
O	they
O	knew
O	about
O	the
O	matter
O	but
O	they
O	all
O	denied
O	knowing
O	anything
O	of
O	it
O	or
O	why
O	he
O	had
O	left
O	them
O	the
C	earl
O	then
O	said
C	fortunatus
O	was
O	a
O	lad
O	for
O	whom
O	i
O	had
O	a
O	great
O	esteem
O	i
O	am
O	sure
O	some
O	of
O	you
O	must
O	have
O	given
O	him
O	an
O	affront
O	if
O	i
O	discover
O	it
O	i
O	shall
O	not
O	fail
O	to
O	punish
O	the
O	guilty
O	person
O	in
O	the
O	meantime
C	fortunatus
O	when
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	out
O	of
O	the
C	earl
O	s
O	country
O	stopped
O	at
O	an
O	inn
O	to
O	refresh
O	himself
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	reckon
O	how
O	much
O	he
O	had
O	about
O	him
O	he
O	took
O	out
O	all
O	his
O	fine
O	clothes
O	and
O	jewels
O	and
O	could
O	not
O	help
O	putting
O	them
O	on
O	he
O	then
O	looked
O	at
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	glass
O	and
O	thought
O	that
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	he
O	was
O	quite
O	a
O	fine
O	smart
O	fellow
O	next
O	he
O	took
O	out
O	his
O	purse
O	and
O	counted
O	the
O	money
O	that
O	had
O	been
O	given
O	him
O	by
O	the
O	lords
O	and
O	ladies
O	of
O	the
C	earl
O	s
O	court
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	in
O	all
O	he
O	had
O	five
O	hundred
O	crowns
O	so
O	he
O	bought
O	a
O	horse
O	and
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	send
O	back
O	the
O	one
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	taken
O	from
O	the
C	earl
O	s
O	stable
O	he
O	then
O	set
O	off
O	for
O	calais
O	crossed
O	the
O	channel
O	landed
O	safely
O	at
O	dover
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	to
O	london
O	where
O	he
O	soon
O	made
O	his
O	way
O	into
O	genteel
O	company
O	and
O	had
O	once
O	the
O	honour
O	to
O	dance
O	with
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	a
O	duke
O	at
O	the
O	lord
O	mayor
O	s
O	ball
O	this
O	sort
O	of
O	life
O	as
O	anybody
O	may
O	well
O	think
O	soon
O	made
O	away
O	with
O	his
O	little
O	stock
O	of
O	money
O	when
C	fortunatus
O	found
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	a
O	penny
O	left
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	going
O	back
O	again
O	to
O	france
O	and
O	soon
O	after
O	went
O	on
O	board
O	a
O	ship
O	bound
O	to
O	picardy
O	he
O	landed
O	in
O	that
O	country
O	but
O	finding
O	no
O	employment
O	he
O	set
O	off
O	for
O	brittany
O	when
O	he
O	lost
O	his
O	way
O	in
O	crossing
O	a
O	wood
O	and
O	was
O	forced
O	to
O	stay
O	in
O	it
O	all
O	night
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	he
O	was
O	little
O	better
O	off
O	for
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	no
O	path
O	so
O	he
O	walked
O	about
O	from
O	one
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	wood
O	to
O	another
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	on
O	the
O	evening
O	of
O	the
O	second
O	day
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	spring
O	at
O	which
O	he
O	drank
O	very
O	heartily
O	but
O	still
O	he
O	had
O	nothing
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	die
O	with
O	hunger
O	when
O	night
O	came
O	on
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	growling
O	of
O	wild
O	beasts
O	so
O	he
O	climbed
O	up
O	a
O	high
O	tree
O	for
O	safety
O	and
O	he
O	had
O	hardly
O	seated
O	himself
O	in
O	it
O	before
O	a
O	lion
O	walked
O	fiercely
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	spring
O	to
O	drink
O	this
O	made
O	him
O	very
O	much
O	afraid
O	when
O	the
O	lion
O	had
O	gone
O	away
O	a
O	bear
O	came
O	to
O	drink
O	also
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	moon
O	shone
O	very
O	bright
O	the
O	beast
O	looked
O	up
O	and
O	saw
C	fortunatus
O	and
O	straightway
O	began
O	to
O	climb
O	up
O	the
O	tree
O	to
O	get
O	at
O	him
C	fortunatus
O	drew
O	his
O	sword
O	and
O	sat
O	quiet
O	till
O	the
O	bear
O	was
O	come
O	within
O	arm
O	s
O	length
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	ran
O	him
O	through
O	the
O	body
O	this
O	drove
O	the
O	bear
O	so
O	very
O	savage
O	that
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	great
O	spring
O	to
O	get
O	at
O	him
O	but
O	the
O	bough
O	broke
O	and
O	down
O	he
O	fell
O	and
O	lay
O	sprawling
O	and
O	howling
O	on
O	the
O	ground
C	fortunatus
O	now
O	looked
O	around
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	saw
O	no
O	more
O	wild
O	beasts
O	near
O	he
O	thought
O	this
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	good
O	time
O	to
O	get
O	rid
O	of
O	the
O	bear
O	at
O	once
O	so
O	down
O	he
O	came
O	and
O	killed
O	him
O	at
O	a
O	single
O	blow
O	being
O	almost
O	starved
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	food
O	the
O	poor
O	youth
O	stooped
O	down
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	suck
O	the
O	blood
O	of
O	the
O	bear
O	but
O	looking
O	round
O	once
O	more
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	any
O	wild
O	beasts
O	were
O	coming
O	he

O	ate
O	quite
O	enough
O	and

O	did
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	desired
O	and
O	pleased
O	the
O	sultan
O	very
O	much
O	by
O	telling
O	him
O	the
O	many
O	odd
O	adventures
O	he
O	had
O	met

O	the
O	manner
O	of
O	his
O	first
O	becoming
O	known
O	to

O	the

O	to
O	maintain
O	the

O	of
O	his

O	was
O	greatly
O	pleased
O	with
O	what
O	he
O	had
O	heard
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	possessed
O	a
O	more
O	curious
O	thing
O	than
O	any
C	fortunatus
O	had
O	told
O	him
O	of

O	then
O	led
O	him
O	into
O	a
O	room
O	almost
O	filled
O	with

O	opened
O	a
O	large
O	closet
O	and
O	took
O	out
O	a
O	cap
O	which
O	he
O	said
O	was
O	of
O	greater
O	value
O	than
O	all
O	the
O	rest
C	fortunatus
O	thought
O	the
O	sultan
O	was
O	joking
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	many
O	a
O	better
O	cap
O	than
O	that
O	ah
O	said
O	the
O	sultan
O	that
O	is
O	because
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	its
O	value
O	whoever
O	puts
O	this
O	cap
O	on

O	and
O	wishes
O	to

C	fortunatus
O	took
O	up
O	the

O	on

O	head
O	and
O	could
O	not

O	on

O	the

O	that

O	back
O	to
O	famagosta
O	in

O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	sail
O	and
O	there
O	being
O	a
O	brisk
O	gale
O	they
O	were
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	in
O	half
O	an
O	hour
O	before
O	the
O	sultan
O	had
O	even
O	time
O	to
O	repent
O	of
O	his
O	folly
O	for
O	letting
C	fortunatus
O	try
O	the

O	head
O	the
O	ship
O	came
O	safe
O	to
O	famagosta
O	after
O	a
O	happy
O	passage
O	and
C	fortunatus
O	found
O	his
O	wife
O	and
O	children
O	well
O	but
C	lord
O	and
O	his
O	lady
O	had
O	died
O	of
O	old
O	age
O	and
O	were
O	buried
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	grave
C	fortunatus
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	take
O	great
O	pleasure
O	in
O	teaching
O	his
O	two
O	boys
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	useful
O	learning
O	and
O	also
O	such
O	manly
O	sports
O	as
O	wrestling
O	and
O	tilting
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	he
O	thought
O	about
O	the
O	curious
O	cap
O	which
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	home
O	and
O	then
O	would
O	wish
O	he
O	could
O	just
O	take
O	a
O	peep
O	at
O	what
O	was
O	passing
O	in
O	other
O	countries
O	which
O	wish
O	was
O	always
O	fulfilled
O	but
O	he
O	never
O	stayed
O	there
O	more
O	than
O	an
O	hour
O	or
O	two
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	lady
C	cassandra
O	did
O	not
O	miss
O	him
O	and
O	was
O	no
O	longer
O	made
O	uneasy
O	by
O	his
O	love
O	of
O	travelling
O	at
O	last
C	fortunatus
O	began
O	to
O	grow
O	old
O	and
O	the
O	lady
C	cassandra
O	fell
O	sick
O	and
O	died
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	her
O	caused
O	him
O	so
O	much
O	grief
O	that
O	soon
O	after
O	he
O	fell
O	sick
O	too
O	as
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	long
O	to
O	live
O	he
O	called
O	his
O	two
O	sons
O	to
O	his
O	bedside
O	and
O	told
O	them
O	the
O	secrets
O	of
O	the
O	purse
O	and
O	the
O	cap
O	which
O	he
O	begged
O	they
O	would
O	not
O	on
O	any
O	account
O	make
O	known
O	to
O	others
O	follow
O	my
O	example
O	said
O	he
O	i
O	have
O	had
O	the
O	purse
O	these
O	forty
O	years
O	and
O	no
O	living
O	person
O	knew
O	from
O	what
O	source
O	i
O	obtained
O	my
O	riches
O	he
O	then
O	told
O	them
O	to
O	make
O	use
O	of
O	the
O	purse
O	between
O	them
O	and
O	to
O	live
O	together
O	in
O	friendship
O	and
O	embracing
O	them
O	died
O	soon
O	after

O	buried
O	with
O	great
O	pomp
O	by
O	the
O	side
O	of

O	so
O	many

O	such
O	a

O	a
O	little
O	of
O	his
O	incense
O	into
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	pronounced
O	two
O	magical
O	words
O	when
O	the
O	stone
O	which
O	had
O	closed
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	staircase
O	moved
O	into
O	its
O	place
O	with
O	the
O	earth
O	over
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	manner
O	as
O	it
O	lay
O	at
O	the
O	arrival
O	of
O	the
C	magician
O	and
C	aladdin
O	this
O	action
O	of
O	the
C	magician
O	plainly
O	revealed
O	to
C	aladdin
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	no
O	uncle
O	of
O	his
O	but
O	one
O	who
O	designed
O	him
O	evil
O	the
O	truth
O	was
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	learned
O	from
O	his
O	magic
O	books
O	the
O	secret
O	and
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	this
O	wonderful
O	lamp
O	the
O	owner
O	of
O	which
O	would
O	be
O	made
O	richer
O	than
O	any
O	earthly
O	ruler
O	and
O	hence
O	his
O	journey
O	to
O	china
O	his
O	art
O	had
O	also
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	permitted
O	to
O	take
O	it
O	himself
O	but
O	must
O	receive
O	it
O	as
O	a
O	voluntary
O	gift
O	from
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	another
O	person
O	hence
O	he
O	employed
O	young
C	aladdin
O	and
O	hoped
O	by
O	a
O	mixture
O	of
O	kindness
O	and
O	authority
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	obedient
O	to
O	his
O	word
O	and
O	will
O	when
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	his
O	attempt
O	had
O	failed
O	he
O	set
O	out
O	to
O	return
O	to
O	africa
O	but
O	avoided
O	the
O	town
O	lest
O	any
O	person
O	who
O	had
O	seen
O	him
O	leave
O	in
O	company
O	with
C	aladdin
O	should
O	make
O	inquiries
O	after
O	the
O	youth
C	aladdin
O	being
O	suddenly
O	enveloped
O	in
O	darkness
O	cried
O	and
O	called
O	out
O	to
O	his
O	uncle
O	to
O	tell
O	him
O	he
O	was
O	ready
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	the
O	lamp
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	since
O	his
O	cries
O	could
O	not
O	be
O	heard
O	he
O	descended
O	to
O	the
O	bottom
O	of
O	the
O	steps
O	with
O	a
O	design
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	the
O	palace
O	but
O	the
O	door
O	which
O	was
O	opened
O	before
O	by
O	enchantment
O	was
O	now
O	shut
O	by
O	the
O	same
O	means
O	he
O	then
O	redoubled
O	his
O	cries
O	and
O	tears
O	sat
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	steps
O	without
O	any
O	hopes
O	of
O	ever
O	seeing
O	light
O	again
O	and
O	in
O	an
O	expectation
O	of
O	passing
O	from
O	the
O	present
O	darkness
O	to
O	a
O	speedy
O	death
O	in
O	this
O	great
O	emergency
O	he
O	said
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	strength
O	or
O	power
O	but
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	and
O	high
O	god
O	and
O	in
O	joining
O	his
O	hands
O	to
O	pray
O	he
O	rubbed
O	the
O	ring
O	which
O	the
C	magician
O	had
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	finger
O	immediately
O	a
C	genie
O	of
O	frightful
O	aspect
O	appeared
O	and
O	said
O	what
O	wouldst
O	thou
O	have
O	i
O	am
O	ready
O	to

O	the
O	other
C	slaves
O	of
O	that
O	ring
O	at
O	another
O	time
C	aladdin
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	frightened
O	at
O	the
O	sight
O	of
O	so
O	extraordinary
O	a
O	figure
O	but
O	the
O	danger
O	he
O	was
O	in
O	made
O	him
O	answer
O	without
O	hesitation
O	whoever
O	thou
O	art
O	deliver
O	me
O	from
O	this
O	place
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	spoken
O	these
O	words
O	than
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	on
O	the
O	very
O	spot
O	where
O	the
C	magician
O	had
O	last
O	left
O	him
O	and
O	no

O	he
O	made
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	home
O	when
O	he
O	got
O	within
O	his

O	the
O	joy
O	to
O	see
O	her
O	and
O	his
O	weakness
O	for
O	want
O	of
O	sustenance
O	made
O	him
O	so
O	faint
O	that
O	he
O	remained
O	for
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	as
O	dead
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	recovered
O	he
O	related

O	in
O	their
O	complaints
O	of
O	the

O	very
O	soundly
O	till
O	late
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	when
O	the

O	it
O	where
O	you
O	please
O	i
O	had
O	rather
O	you
O	would
O	sell
O	it
O	than

O	of
O	being
O	frightened
O	to

O	you

O	part

O	with

O	who
O	as
O	our

O	are

O	devils
O	with

O	mother
O	replied
C	aladdin
O	i
O	shall
O	now
O	take
O	care
O	how
O	i
O	sell
O	a
O	lamp
O	which
O	may
O	be
O	so
O	serviceable
O	both
O	to
O	you
O	and
O	me
O	that
O	false
O	and
O	wicked
C	magician
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	undertaken
O	so
O	long
O	a

O	to
O	secure
O	this
O	wonderful
O	lamp
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	known
O	its
O	value
O	to
O	exceed
O	that
O	of
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	and
O	since
O	we
O	have
O	honestly
O	come
O	by
O	it
O	let
O	us
O	make
O	a
O	profitable
O	use
O	of

O	however
O	since
O	the

O	you
O	so
O	much
O	i
O	will
O	take
O	it
O	out

O	it
O	the

O	the

O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
C	aladdin
O	who
O	could
O	not
O	bear
O	the
O	thought
O	of
O	hunger
O	putting
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	silver
O	dishes
O	under
O	his
O	vest
O	went
O	out
O	early
O	to
O	sell
O	it
O	and
O	addressing
O	himself
O	to
O	a
O	jew
O	whom
O	he
O	met
O	in
O	the
O	streets
O	took
O	him
O	aside
O	and
O	pulling
O	out
O	the
O	plate
O	asked
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	buy
O	it
O	the
O	cunning
O	jew
O	took
O	the
O	dish
O	examined
O	it
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	found
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	good
O	silver
O	asked
C	aladdin
O	at
O	how
O	much
O	he
O	valued
O	it
C	aladdin
O	who
O	had
O	never
O	been
O	used
O	to
O	such
O	traffic
O	told
O	him
O	he
O	would
O	trust
O	to
O	his
O	judgment
O	and
O	honor
O	the
O	jew
O	was
O	somewhat
O	confounded
O	at
O	this
O	plain
O	dealing
O	and
O	doubting
O	whether
C	aladdin
O	understood
O	the
O	material
O	or
O	the
O	full
O	value
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	offered
O	to
O	sell
O	took
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	gold
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	purse
O	and
O	gave
O	it
O	him
O	though
O	it
O	was
O	but
O	the
O	sixtieth
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	worth
O	of
O	the
O	plate
C	aladdin
O	taking
O	the
O	money
O	very
O	eagerly
O	retired
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	haste
O	that
O	the
O	jew
O	not
O	content
O	with
O	the
O	exorbitancy
O	of
O	his
O	profit
O	was
O	vexed
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	penetrated
O	into
O	his
O	ignorance
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	run
O	after
O	him
O	to
O	endeavor
O	to
O	get
O	some
O	change
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	piece
O	of
O	gold
O	but
O	he
O	ran
O	so
O	fast
O	and
O	had
O	got
O	so
O	far
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	have
O	been
O	impossible
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	overtake
O	him
O	before
C	aladdin
O	went
O	home
O	he
O	called
O	at
O	a
O	baker
O	s
O	bought
O	some
O	cakes
O	of
O	bread
O	changed
O	his
O	money
O	and
O	on
O	his
O	return
O	gave
O	the
O	rest
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	who
O	went
O	and
O	purchased
O	provisions
O	enough
O	to
O	last
O	them
O	some
O	time
O	after
O	this
O	manner
O	they
O	lived
O	till
C	aladdin
O	had
O	sold
O	the
O	twelve
O	dishes
O	singly
O	as
O	necessity
O	pressed
O	to
O	the
O	jew
O	for
O	the
O	same
O	money
O	who
O	after
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	durst
O	not
O	offer
O	him
O	less
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	losing
O	so
O	good
O	a
O	bargain
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	sold
O	the
O	last
O	dish
O	he
O	had
O	recourse
O	to
O	the
O	tray
O	which
O	weighed
O	ten
O	times
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	the
O	dishes
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	carried
O	it
O	to
O	his
O	old
O	purchaser
O	but
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	too
O	large
O	and
O	cumbersome
O	therefore
O	he
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	bring
O	him
O	home
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	s
O	where
O	after
O	the
O	jew
O	had
O	examined
O	the
O	weight
O	of
O	the
O	tray
O	he
O	laid
O	down
O	ten
O	pieces
O	of
O	gold
O	with
O	which
C	aladdin
O	was
O	very
O	well
O	satisfied
O	when
O	all
O	the
O	money
O	was
O	spent
C	aladdin
O	had
O	recourse
O	again
O	to
O	the
O	lamp
O	he
O	took
O	it
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	looked
O	for
O	that
O	part
O	where
O	his
O	mother
O	had
O	rubbed
O	it
O	with
O	the
O	sand
O	rubbed
O	it
O	also
O	when
O	the
C	genie
O	immediately
O	appeared
O	and
O	said
O	what
O	wouldst
O	thou
O	have
O	i
O	am
O	ready
O	to
O	obey
O	thee
O	as
O	thy
C	slave

O	the
C	slave
O	of
O	all
O	those
O	who
O	have
O	that
O	lamp
O	in
O	their

O	and
O	the
O	other
C	slaves
O	of
O	the

O	i
O	am
O	hungry
O	said
C	aladdin
O	bring
O	me
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	the
C	genie
O	disappeared
O	and
O	presently
O	returned
O	with
O	a
O	tray
O	the
O	same
O	number
O	of
O	covered
O	dishes
O	as
O	before
O	set
O	them
O	down
O	and
O	vanished
O	as
O	soon
O	as
C	aladdin
O	found
O	that
O	their
O	provisions
O	were
O	again
O	expended
O	he
O	took
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	dishes
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	his
O	jew
O	chapman
O	but
O	passing
O	by
O	a
O	goldsmith
O	s
O	shop
O	the
O	goldsmith
O	perceiving
O	him
O	called
O	to
O	him
O	and
O	said
O	my
O	lad
O	i
O	imagine
O	that
O	you
O	have
O	something
O	to
O	sell
O	to
O	the
O	jew
O	whom
O	i
O	often
O	see
O	you
O	visit
O	but
O	perhaps
O	you
O	do
O	not
O	know
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	the
O	greatest
O	rogue
O	even
O	among
O	the
O	jews
O	i
O	will
O	give
O	you
O	the
O	full
O	worth
O	of
O	what
O	you
O	have
O	to
O	sell
O	or
O	i
O	will
O	direct
O	you
O	to
O	other
O	merchants
O	who
O	will
O	not
O	cheat
O	you
O	this
O	offer
O	induced
C	aladdin
O	to
O	pull
O	his
O	plate
O	from
O	under
O	his
O	vest
O	and
O	show
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	goldsmith
O	who
O	at
O	first
O	sight
O	saw
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	made
O	of
O	the
O	finest
O	silver
O	and
O	asked
O	him
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	sold
O	such
O	as
O	that
O	to
O	the
O	jew
O	when
C	aladdin
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	sold
O	him
O	twelve
O	such
O	for
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	gold
O	each
O	what
O	a
O	villain
O	cried
O	the
O	goldsmith
O	but
O	added
O	he
O	my
O	son
O	what
O	is
O	past
O	cannot
O	be
O	recalled
O	by
O	showing
O	you
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	this
O	plate
O	which
O	is
O	of
O	the
O	finest
O	silver
O	we
O	use
O	in
O	our
O	shops
O	i
O	will
O	let
O	you
O	see
O	how
O	much
O	the
O	jew
O	has
O	cheated
O	you
O	the
O	goldsmith
O	took
O	a
O	pair
O	of
O	scales
O	weighed
O	the
O	dish
O	and
O	assured
O	him
O	that
O	his
O	plate
O	would
O	fetch
O	by
O	weight
O	sixty
O	pieces
O	of
O	gold
O	which
O	he
O	offered
O	to
O	pay
O	down
O	immediately
C	aladdin
O	thanked
O	him
O	for
O	his
O	fair
O	dealing
O	and
O	never
O	after
O	went
O	to
O	any
O	other
O	person
O	though
C	aladdin
O	and
O	his
O	mother
O	had
O	an
O	inexhaustible
O	treasure
O	in
O	their
O	lamp
O	and
O	might
O	have
O	had
O	whatever
O	they
O	wished
O	for
O	yet
O	they
O	lived
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	frugality
O	as
O	before
O	and
O	it
O	may
O	easily
O	be
O	supposed
O	that
O	the
O	money
O	for
O	which
C	aladdin
O	had
O	sold
O	the
O	dishes
O	and
O	tray
O	was
O	sufficient
O	to
O	maintain
O	them
O	some
O	time
O	during
O	this
O	interval
C	aladdin
O	frequented
O	the
O	shops
O	of
O	the
O	principal
O	merchants
O	where
O	they
O	sold
O	cloth
O	of
O	gold
O	and
O	silver
O	linens
O	silk
O	stuffs
O	and
O	jewelry
O	and
O	oftentimes
O	joining
O	in
O	their
O	conversation
O	acquired
O	a
O	knowledge
O	of
O	the
O	world
O	and
O	a
O	desire
O	to
O	improve
O	himself
O	by
O	his
O	acquaintance
O	among
O	the
O	jewellers
O	he
O	came
O	to
O	know
O	that
O	the
O	fruits
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	gathered
O	when
O	he
O	took
O	the
O	lamp
O	were
O	instead
O	of
O	colored
O	glass
O	stones
O	of
O	inestimable
O	value
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	the
O	prudence
O	not
O	to
O	mention
O	this
O	to
O	anyone
O	not
O	even
O	to
O	his
O	mother
O	one
O	day
O	as
C	aladdin
O	was
O	walking
O	about
O	the

O	he
O	heard
O	an

O	commanding
O	the

O	to
O	shut
O	up

O	daughter
O	went
O	to
O	the

O	and
O	returned
O	this
O	proclamation
O	inspired
C	aladdin
O	with
O	an
O	eager
O	desire
O	to
O	see
O	the
C	princess
O	s
O	face

O	behind
O	the

O	of
O	the

O	by
O	a

O	patience
O	at
O	last
O	i
O	believe
O	he
O	was
O	heartily

O	i

O	staying
O	so
O	long
O	but
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	harm
O	done
O	i

O	he
O	began
O	crying
O	who

O	ones
O	as
O	he

O	that
O	the

O	rebuked

O	answered
O	the

O	laughing
O	still
O	who
O	can
O	forbear
O	laughing
O	to
O	see
O	an

O	i

O	one
O	upon
O	a

O	of
O	the
O	prince
O	aladdin

O	for

O	without

O	the

O	had
O	to
O	keep

O	entered
O	into
O	the

O	and
O	commanded
O	a

O	the

O	his

O	to

O	rather

O	he

O	to

O	and
O	the

O	as
O	it

O	wont
O	to
O	do
O	the
C	king
O	lifted
O	up
O	his
O	foot
O	thinking
O	nothing
O	would
O	be
O	so
O	easy
O	as
O	to
O	tread
O	on
O	the

O	himself
O	mistaken
C	minon
O	was
O	the
O	creature
O	s
O	name
O	twisted
O	itself
O	round
O	so
O	sharply
O	that
O	the

O	only
O	hurt
O	his
O	own
O	foot
O	by
O	stamping
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	for
O	eight

O	the

O	so
O	very

O	it
O	at

O	the

O	the

O	into

O	man
O	who
O	regarded
O	the

O	with
O	flashing
O	eyes
O	you
O	must
O	marry
O	the
C	princess
O	cried
O	he
O	because
O	you
O	have
O	broken
O	the
O	enchantment
O	in
O	which
O	i
O	held
O	her
O	but
O	i
O	will
O	be
O	revenged
O	on
O	you
O	you
O	shall
O	have
O	a
O	son
O	with
O	a
O	nose
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	that
O	he
O	made
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	a
O	curve
O	of
O	half
O	a
O	foot
O	yet
O	he
O	shall
O	believe
O	it
O	is
O	just
O	like
O	all
O	other
O	noses
O	and
O	shall
O	be
O	always
O	unfortunate
O	till
O	he

O	out
O	it

O	anybody
O	of
O	this
O	threat
O	of
O	mine
O	you
O	shall
O	die
O	on
O	the

O	so
O	saying
O	the
O	magician
O	disappeared
O	the
C	king
O	who
O	was
O	at
O	first
O	much
O	terrified
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	laugh
O	at
O	this
O	adventure
O	my
O	son
O	might
O	have
O	a
O	worse
O	misfortune
O	than
O	too
O	long
O	a
O	nose
O	thought
O	he
O	at
O	least
O	it
O	will
O	hinder
O	him
O	neither
O	in
O	seeing
O	nor
O	hearing
O	i
O	will
O	go
O	and
O	find
O	the
C	princess
O	and
O	marry
O	her
O	at
O	once
O	he
O	did
O	so
O	but
O	he
O	only
O	lived
O	a
O	few
O	months
O	after
O	and
O	died
O	before
O	his
O	little
O	son
O	was
O	born
O	so
O	that
O	nobody
O	knew
O	anything
O	about
O	the
O	secret
O	of
O	the
O	nose
O	the
O	little
C	prince
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	wished
O	for
O	that
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	world
O	they
O	agreed
O	to
O	call
O	him
C	prince
C	wish
O	he
O	had
O	beautiful
O	blue
O	eyes
O	and
O	a
O	sweet
O	little
O	mouth
O	but
O	his
O	nose
O	was
O	so
O	big
O	that
O	it
O	covered
O	half
O	his
O	face
O	the
O	queen
O	his
O	mother
O	was
O	inconsolable
O	but
O	her
O	ladies
O	tried
O	to
O	satisfy
O	her
O	by
O	telling
O	her
O	that
O	the
O	nose
O	was
O	not
O	nearly
O	so
O	large
O	as
O	it
O	seemed
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	grow
O	smaller
O	as
O	the
C	prince
O	grew
O	bigger
O	and
O	that
O	if
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	a
O	large
O	nose
O	was
O	indispensable
O	to
O	a
O	hero
O	all
O	great
O	soldiers
O	they
O	said
O	had
O	great
O	noses
O	as
O	everybody
O	knew
O	the
O	queen
O	was
O	so
O	very
O	fond
O	of
O	her
O	son
O	that
O	she
O	listened
O	eagerly
O	to
O	all
O	this
O	comfort
O	shortly
O	she
O	grew
O	so
O	used
O	to
O	the
C	prince
O	s
O	nose
O	that
O	it
O	did
O	not
O	seem
O	to
O	her
O	any
O	larger
O	than
O	ordinary
O	noses
O	of
O	the
O	court
O	where
O	in
O	process
O	of
O	time
O	everybody
O	with
O	a
O	long
O	nose
O	was
O	very
O	much
O	admired
O	and
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	people
O	who
O	had
O	only
O	snubs
O	were
O	taken
O	very
O	little
O	notice
O	of
O	great
O	care
O	was
O	observed
O	in
O	the
O	education
O	of
O	the
C	prince
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	speak
O	they
O	told
O	him
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	amusing
O	tales
O	in
O	which
O	all
O	the
O	bad
O	people
O	had
O	short
O	noses
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	good
O	people
O	had
O	long
O	ones
O	no
O	person
O	was
O	suffered
O	to
O	come

O	who
O	had
O	not
O	a
O	nose
O	of
O	more
O	than
O	ordinary
O	length
O	nay
O	to
O	such
O	an
O	extent
O	did
O	the
O	courtiers
O	carry
O	their
O	fancy
O	that
O	the
O	noses
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	little
O	babies
O	were
O	ordered
O	to
O	be
O	pulled
O	out
O	as
O	far
O	as
O	possible
O	several
O	times
O	a
O	day
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	make
O	them
O	grow
O	but
O	grow
O	as
O	they
O	would
O	they
O	never
O	could
O	grow
O	as
O	long
O	as
O	that
O	of
C	prince
C	wish
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	old
O	enough
O	his
O	tutor
O	taught
O	him
O	history
O	and
O	whenever
O	any
O	great
C	king
O	or
O	lovely
C	princess
O	was
O	referred
O	to
O	the
O	tutor
O	always
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	mention
O	that
O	he
O	or
O	she
O	had
O	a
O	long
O	nose
O	all
O	the
O	royal
O	apartments
O	were
O	filled
O	with
O	pictures
O	and
O	portraits
O	having
O	this
O	peculiarity
O	so
O	that
O	at
O	last
C	prince
C	wish
O	began
O	to
O	regard
O	the
O	length
O	of
O	his
O	nose
O	as
O	his
O	greatest
O	perfection
O	and
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	had
O	it
O	an
O	inch
O	less
O	even
O	to
O	save
O	his
O	crown
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	twenty
O	years
O	old
O	his
O	mother
O	and
O	his
O	people
O	wished
O	him
O	to
O	marry
O	they
O	procured
O	for
O	him
O	the
O	likenesses
O	of
O	many
O	princesses
O	but
O	the
O	one
O	he
O	preferred
O	was
C	princess
C	darling
O	daughter
O	of
O	a
O	powerful
O	monarch
O	and
O	heiress
O	to
O	several
O	kingdoms
O	alas
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	beauty
O	this
C	princess
O	had
O	one
O	great
O	misfortune
O	a
O	little
O	nose
O	which
O	every
O	one
O	else
O	said
O	made
O	her
O	only
O	the
O	more
O	bewitching
O	but
O	here
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
C	prince
C	wish
O	the
O	courtiers
O	were
O	thrown
O	by
O	it
O	into
O	the
O	utmost
O	perplexity
O	they
O	were
O	in
O	the
O	habit
O	of
O	laughing
O	at
O	all
O	small
O	noses
O	but
O	how
O	dared
O	they
O	make
O	fun
O	of
O	the
O	nose
O	of
C	princess
C	darling
O	two
O	unfortunate
O	gentlemen
O	whom

O	so

O	from

O	court
O	and

O	after
O	this
O	the
O	courtiers
O	became
O	alarmed
O	and
O	tried
O	to
O	correct
O	their
O	habit
O	of
O	speech
O	but
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	found

O	in
O	constant
O	difficulties
O	had
O	not
O	one
O	clever

O	struck
O	out
O	a

O	made

C	darling
O	however
O	in

O	remarkable
O	fact
O	the

O	length
O	of

O	the

O	more
O	polite
O	ladies
O	and
O	gentlemen
O	whom
O	he
O	met
O	in

O	used
O	to

O	to
O	keep
O	from

O	and
O	to
O	get
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	could
O	so
O	the
O	poor
C	prince
O	became
O	gradually
O	quite
O	forlorn
O	and
O	solitary
O	he
O	thought
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	was
O	mad
O	but
O	still
O	he
O	never
O	thought
O	of
O	there
O	being
O	anything
O	queer
O	about
O	his

O	at

O	almost
O	breaking
O	his

O	she
O	felt
O	sorry
O	for
O	him
O	and
O	wished
O	to
O	help
O	him
O	in
O	spite
O	of

O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	the

O	till
O	he
O	had

O	so
O	she
O	went
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	the
C	princess
O	and
O	being
O	more
O	powerful
O	than

O	a
O	good
C	fairy
O	and
O	he
O	was
O	an

O	magician
O	she
O	got

O	for

O	he
O	dashed

O	and
O	succeeded
O	in
O	breaking
O	a

O	she
O	put
O	up

O	it
O	was
O	in
O	vain
C	prince
C	wish

O	that

O	she
O	handled
O	it
O	so
O	awkwardly

O	carelessly
O	that
O	the
O	point
O	pierced
O	her

O	though
O	it
O	was
O	so
O	small
O	a
O	wound
O	she
O	fainted

O	the

O	frightened
C	old
C	woman

O	shortly
O	came
O	the

O	in

O	who
O	tried
O	every

O	to
O	restore
O	their

O	but
O	all
O	their
O	care
O	was
O	useless
O	she
O	lay
O	beautiful
O	as
O	an
O	angel
O	the

O	still
O	lingering
O	in
O	her

O	softly
O	stirred

O	that
O	their
O	daughter
O	would
O	not
O	sleep
O	for
O	ever
O	though
O	after
O	one
O	hundred

O	it
O	was

O	her
O	awakening
O	until

O	they
O	determined
O	to

O	they
O	sent
O	away
O	all
O	the
O	physicians
O	and
O	attendants
O	and
O	themselves
O	sorrowfully
O	laid
O	her
O	upon
O	a

O	of
O	embroidery
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	elegant
O	apartment
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	there
O	she
O	slept

O	a
O	sleeping
O	angel
O	still
O	when
O	this
O	misfortune
O	happened
O	the
O	kindly
O	young
C	fairy
O	who
O	had
O	saved
O	the
C	princess
O	by
O	changing

O	leagues
O	away
O	in

O	but
O	being
O	informed
O	of
O	everything
O	she
O	arrived
O	speedily
O	in
O	a
O	chariot
O	of
O	fire
O	drawn
O	by
O	dragons
O	the
C	king
O	was
O	somewhat
O	startled
O	by
O	the
O	sight
O	but
O	nevertheless
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	door
O	of
O	his
O	palace
O	and
O	with
O	a
O	mournful
O	countenance
O	presented
O	her
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	descend
O	the

O	condoled
O	with
O	his
O	majesty
O	and
O	approved
O	of

O	then
O	being
O	a
C	fairy
O	of
O	great
O	common
O	sense
O	and
O	foresight
O	she
O	suggested
O	that
O	the
C	princess
O	awakening
O	after
O	a
O	hundred
O	years
O	in
O	this
O	ancient
O	castle
O	might
O	be
O	a
O	good
O	deal
O	embarrassed
O	especially
O	with
O	a
O	young
C	prince
O	by
O	her
O	side
O	to
O	find
O	herself
O	alone
O	accordingly
O	without
O	asking
O	any
O	one
O	s
O	leave
O	she
O	touched
O	with
O	her
O	magic
O	wand
O	the
O	entire
O	population
O	of
O	the
O	palace
O	except

O	kind
O	consideration
O	for
O	the
O	feelings
O	of

C	puffy
O	who
O	had
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	beside

O	looked
O	so
O	sweet

O	once
O	a

O	was
O	not

O	taking

O	in
O	case

O	be
O	attacked
O	they

O	into
O	the

O	deep
O	pits
O	covering
O	them
O	with
O	a
O	little
O	earth
O	laid
O	over
O	some

O	for

O	returning
O	to
O	the
O	spot
O	at

O	they
O	perceived
O	that

O	of

O	had
O	been
O	broken
O	into
O	during
O	the

O	quite
O	uncovered

O	were
O	disputing
O	the
O	honour
O	of
O	first

O	when
O	they
O	heard
O	issue
O	from

O	mild
O	and
O	supplicating
O	voice

O	it
O	is
O	perhaps
O	some
O	unfortunate
O	little
O	wandering
O	child
O	how
O	lucky
O	that
O	we
O	did
O	not
O	draw
O	the

O	they
O	approached
O	and
O	distinguished
O	a

O	lady
O	richly
O	dressed
O	wearing
O	on
O	her
O	head
O	a
O	cluster
O	of
O	diamonds
O	which
O	shone
O	like
O	a
O	star
O	she
O	appeared
O	very
O	young
O	and
O	was
O	trembling
O	with
O	cold
O	much
O	rain
O	had
O	fallen
O	during
O	the
O	night
O	and
O	her

O	even
O	more
O	than

O	however
O	to
O	struggle
O	and
O	to
O	make
O	signs
O	for
O	relief
O	when
O	three
O	enormous
O	wolves
O	appeared
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	the

O	but
O	who
O	resolve
O	to

O	round
O	his
O	body
O	and
O	let

O	down
O	into
O	the

O	lady
O	on

O	then
O	stretched

O	on
O	the
O	grass
O	for

O	fainted
O	and
O	now
O	the

O	them
O	when

O	these

O	were
O	instantly
O	turned
O	into
O	three
O	little
O	lambs
O	and

O	the

O	of
O	the
O	lady
O	who
O	slowly
O	returned
O	to

O	my

O	felt
O	unable

O	to
O	see
O	whether

O	an
O	expression
O	too
O	stern
O	and
O	hypocritical
O	to
O	invite
O	her
O	confidence
O	she
O	therefore
O	walked
O	silently
O	forward
O	and
O	when
O	near
O	the
O	cottage
O	felt
O	so
O	uneasy
O	that
O	for
O	the
O	first

O	by
O	a
O	great

O	that
O	you

O	me
O	against

O	this
O	reasoning
O	appeared
O	so
O	just
O	to
O	the
C	prince
O	who
O	felt
O	himself
O	affected
O	by
O	a
O	passion
O	such
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	never

O	answer
O	and

O	much
O	dejected
O	recalling
O	all
O	the
O	words
O	of
O	the
O	stranger
O	and
O	almost
O	reproaching
O	herself
O	for

O	behaved
O	so
O	harshly
O	to
O	him

O	to

O	this
O	gentleman

O	repulsed
O	so

O	me
O	several
C	merchants
O	of
O	different
O	nations
O	with
O	their
O	merchandise
O	we
O	sailed
O	with
O	the
O	first
O	fair
O	wind
O	and
O	after
O	a
O	long
O	navigation
O	the
O	first
O	place
O	we
O	touched
O	at
O	was
O	a
O	desert
O	island
O	where
O	we
O	found
O	an
O	egg
O	of
O	a
O	roc
O	equal
O	in
O	size
O	to
O	that
O	i
O	formerly
O	mentioned
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	young
O	roc
O	in
O	it
O	just
O	ready
O	to
O	be
O	hatched
O	and
O	its
O	beak
O	had
O	begun
O	to
O	break
O	the
O	egg
O	the
C	merchants
O	who
O	landed
O	with
O	me
O	broke
O	the
O	egg
O	with
O	hatchets
O	and
O	made
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	it
O	pulled
O	out
O	the
O	young
O	roc
O	piecemeal
O	and
O	roasted
O	it
O	i
O	had
O	in
O	vain
O	entreated
O	them
O	not
O	to
O	meddle
O	with
O	the
O	egg
O	scarcely
O	had
O	they
O	finished
O	their
O	repast
O	when
O	there
O	appeared
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	at
O	a
O	considerable
O	distance
O	two
O	great
O	clouds
O	the
C	captain
O	of
O	my
O	ship
O	knowing
O	by
O	experience
O	what
O	they
O	meant
O	said
O	they
O	were
O	the
O	male
O	and
O	female
O	parents
O	of
O	the
O	roc
O	and
O	pressed
O	us
O	to
O	embark
O	with
O	all
O	speed
O	to
O	prevent
O	the
O	misfortune
O	which
O	he
O	saw
O	would
O	otherwise
O	befall
O	us
O	the
O	two
O	rocs
O	approached
O	with
O	a
O	frightful
O	noise
O	which
O	they
O	redoubled
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	the
O	egg
O	broken
O	and
O	their
O	young
O	one
O	gone
O	they
O	flew
O	back
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	and
O	disappeared
O	for
O	some
O	time
O	while
O	we
O	made
O	all
O	the
O	sail
O	we
O	could
O	to
O	endeavor
O	to
O	prevent
O	that
O	which
O	unhappily
O	befell
O	us
O	they
O	soon
O	returned
O	and
O	we
O	observed
O	that
O	each
O	of
O	them
O	carried
O	between
O	its
O	talons
O	an
O	enormous
O	rock
O	when
O	they
O	came
O	directly
O	over
O	my
O	ship
O	they
O	hovered
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	let
O	go
O	his
O	rock
O	but
O	by
O	the
O	dexterity
O	of
O	the
O	steersman
O	it
O	missed
O	us
O	and
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	the
O	other
O	so
O	exactly
O	hit
O	the
O	middle
O	of
O	the
O	ship
O	as
O	to
O	split
O	it
O	into
O	pieces
O	the
O	mariners
O	and
O	passengers
O	were
O	all
O	crushed
O	to
O	death
O	or
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	i
O	myself
O	was
O	of
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	the
O	latter
O	but
O	as
O	i
O	came
O	up
O	again
O	i
O	fortunately
O	caught
O	hold
O	of
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	the
O	wreck
O	and
O	swimming
O	sometimes
O	with
O	one
O	hand
O	and
O	sometimes
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	but
O	always
O	holding
O	fast
O	the
O	plank
O	the
O	wind
O	and
O	the
O	tide
O	favoring
O	me
O	i
O	came
O	to
O	an
O	island
O	and
O	got
O	safely
O	ashore
O	i
O	sat
O	down
O	upon
O	the
O	grass
O	to
O	recover
O	myself
O	from
O	my
O	fatigue
O	after
O	which
O	i
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	island
O	to
O	explore
O	it
O	it
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	delicious
O	garden
O	i
O	found
O	trees
O	everywhere
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	bearing
O	green
O	and
O	others
O	ripe
O	fruits
O	and
O	streams
O	of
O	fresh
O	pure
O	water
O	i
O	ate
O	of
O	the
O	fruits
O	which
O	i
O	found
O	excellent
O	and
O	drank
O	of
O	the
O	water
O	which
O	was
O	very
O	light
O	and
O	good
O	when
O	i
O	was
O	a
O	little
O	advanced
O	into
O	the
O	island
O	i
O	saw
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	who
O	appeared
O	very
O	weak
O	and
O	infirm
O	he
O	was
O	sitting
O	on
O	the
O	bank
O	of
O	a
O	stream
O	and
O	at
O	first
O	i
O	took
O	him
O	to
O	be
O	one
O	who
O	had
O	been
O	shipwrecked
O	like
O	myself
O	i
O	went
O	toward
O	him
O	and
O	saluted
O	him
O	but
O	he
O	only
O	slightly
O	bowed
O	his
O	head
O	i
O	asked
O	him
O	why
O	he
O	sat
O	so
O	still
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	answering
O	me
O	he
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	for
O	me
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	upon
O	my
O	back
O	and
O	carry
O	him
O	over
O	the
O	brook
O	i
O	believed
O	him
O	really
O	to
O	stand
O	in
O	need
O	of
O	my
O	assistance
O	took
O	him
O	upon
O	my
O	back
O	and
O	having
O	carried
O	him
O	over
O	bade
O	him
O	get
O	down
O	and
O	for
O	that
O	end
O	stooped
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	get
O	off
O	with
O	ease
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	doing
O	so
O	which
O	i
O	laugh
O	at
O	every
O	time
O	i
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	who
O	to
O	me
O	appeared
O	quite
O	decrepit
O	threw
O	his
O	legs
O	nimbly
O	about
O	my
O	neck
O	he
O	sat
O	astride
O	upon
O	my
O	shoulders
O	and
O	held
O	my
O	throat
O	so
O	tight
O	that
O	i
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	strangled
O	me
O	and
O	i
O	fainted
O	away
O	notwithstanding
O	my
O	fainting
O	the
O	old
O	fellow
O	still
O	kept
O	his
O	seat
O	upon
O	my
O	neck
O	when
O	i
O	had
O	recovered
O	my
O	breath
O	he
O	thrust
O	one
O	of
O	his
O	feet
O	against
O	my
O	side
O	and
O	struck
O	me
O	so
O	rudely
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	that
O	he
O	forced
O	me
O	to
O	rise
O	up
O	against
O	my
O	will
O	having
O	arisen
O	he
O	made
O	me
O	carry
O	him
O	under
O	the
O	trees
O	and
O	forced
O	me
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	to
O	stop
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	gather
O	and
O	eat
O	fruit
O	he
O	never
O	left
O	his
O	seat
O	all
O	day
O	and
O	when
O	i
O	lay
O	down
O	to
O	rest
O	at
O	night
O	he
O	laid
O	himself
O	down
O	with
O	me
O	holding
O	still
O	fast
O	about
O	my
O	neck
O	every
O	morning
O	he
O	pinched
O	me
O	to
O	make
O	me
O	awake
O	and
O	afterward
O	obliged
O	me
O	to
O	get
O	up
O	and
O	walk
O	and
O	spurred
O	me
O	with
O	his
O	feet
O	one
O	day
O	i
O	found
O	several
O	dry
O	calabashes
O	that
O	had
O	fallen
O	from
O	a
O	tree
O	i
O	took
O	a
O	large
O	one
O	and
O	after
O	cleaning
O	it
O	pressed
O	into
O	it
O	some
O	juice
O	of
O	grapes
O	which
O	abounded
O	in
O	the
O	island
O	having
O	filled
O	the
O	calabash
O	i
O	put
O	it
O	by
O	in
O	a
O	convenient
O	place
O	and
O	going
O	thither
O	again
O	some
O	days
O	after
O	i
O	tasted
O	it
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	wine
O	so
O	good
O	that
O	it
O	gave
O	me
O	new
O	vigor
O	and
O	so
O	exhilarated
O	my
O	spirits
O	that
O	i
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	and
O	dance
O	as
O	i
O	carried
O	my
O	burden
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	perceiving
O	the
O	effect
O	which
O	this
O	had
O	upon
O	me
O	and
O	that
O	i
O	carried
O	him
O	with
O	more
O	ease
O	than
O	before
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	sign
O	to
O	give
O	him
O	some
O	of
O	it
O	i
O	handed
O	him
O	the
O	calabash
O	and
O	the
O	liquor
O	pleasing
O	his
O	palate
O	he
O	drank
O	it
O	off
O	there
O	being
O	a
O	considerable
O	quantity
O	of
O	it
O	he
O	soon
O	began
O	to
O	sing
O	and
O	to
O	move
O	about
O	from
O	side
O	to
O	side
O	in
O	his
O	seat
O	upon
O	my
O	shoulders
O	and
O	by
O	degrees
O	to
O	loosen
O	his
O	legs
O	from
O	about
O	me
O	finding
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	press
O	me
O	as
O	before
O	i
O	threw
O	him
O	upon
O	the
O	ground
O	where
O	he
O	lay
O	without
O	motion
O	i
O	then
O	took
O	up
O	a
O	great
O	stone
O	and
O	slew
O	him
O	i
O	was
O	extremely
O	glad
O	to
O	be
O	thus
O	freed
O	for
O	ever
O	from
O	this
O	troublesome
O	fellow
O	i
O	now
O	walked
O	toward
O	the
O	beach
O	where
O	i
O	met
O	the
O	crew
O	of
O	a
O	ship
O	that
O	had
O	cast
O	anchor
O	to
O	take
O	in
O	water
O	they
O	were
O	surprised
O	to
O	see
O	me
O	but
O	more
O	so
O	at
O	hearing
O	the
O	particulars
O	of
O	my
O	adventures
O	you
O	fell
O	said
O	they
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	are
O	the
O	first
O	who
O	ever
O	escaped
O	strangling
O	by
O	his
O	malicious
O	embraces
O	he
O	never
O	quitted
O	those
O	he
O	had
O	once
O	made
O	himself
O	master
O	of
O	till
O	he
O	had
O	destroyed
O	them
O	and
O	he
O	has
O	made
O	this
O	island
O	notorious
O	by
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	men
O	he
O	has
O	slain
O	they
O	carried
O	me
O	with
O	them
O	to
O	the
C	captain
O	who
O	received
O	me
O	with
O	great
O	kindness
O	he
O	put
O	out
O	again
O	to
O	sea
O	and
O	after
O	some
O	days
O	sail
O	we
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	harbor
O	of
O	a
O	great
O	city
O	the
O	houses
O	of
O	which
O	overhung
O	the
O	sea
O	one
O	of
O	the
C	merchants
O	who
O	had
O	taken
O	me
O	into
O	his
O	friendship
O	invited
O	me
O	to
O	go
O	along
O	with
O	him
O	he
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	large
O	sack
O	and
O	having
O	recommended
O	me
O	to
O	some
O	people
O	of
O	the
O	town
O	who
O	used
O	to
O	gather
O	cocoanuts
O	desired
O	them
O	to
O	take
O	me
O	with
O	them
O	go
O	said
O	he
O	follow
O	them
O	and
O	act
O	as
O	you
O	see
O	them
O	do
O	but
O	do
O	not
O	separate
O	from
O	them
O	otherwise
O	you
O	may
O	endanger
O	your
O	life
O	having
O	thus
O	spoken
O	he
O	gave
O	me
O	provisions
O	for
O	the
O	journey
O	and
O	i
O	went
O	with
O	them
O	we
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	thick
O	forest
O	of
O	cocoa
O	trees
O	very
O	lofty
O	with
O	trunks
O	so
O	smooth
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	possible
O	to
O	climb
O	to
O	the
O	branches
O	that
O	bore
O	the
O	fruit
O	when
O	we
O	entered
O	the
O	forest
O	we
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	apes
O	of
O	several
O	sizes
O	who
O	fled
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	perceived
O	us
O	and
O	climbed
O	to
O	the
O	tops
O	of
O	the
O	trees
O	with
O	amazing
O	swiftness
O	the
C	merchants
O	with
O	whom
O	i
O	was
O	gathered
O	stones
O	and
O	threw
O	them
O	at
O	the
O	apes
O	on
O	the
O	trees
O	i
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	and
O	the
O	apes
O	out
O	of
O	revenge
O	threw
O	coconuts
O	at
O	us
O	so
O	fast
O	and
O	with
O	such
O	gestures
O	as
O	sufficiently
O	testified
O	their
O	anger
O	and
O	resentment
O	we
O	gathered
O	up
O	the
O	cocoanuts
O	and
O	from
O	time
O	to
O	time
O	threw
O	stones
O	to
O	provoke
O	the
O	apes
O	so
O	that
O	by
O	this
O	stratagem
O	we
O	filled
O	our
O	bags
O	with
O	cocoanuts
O	i
O	thus
O	gradually
O	collected
O	as
O	many
O	cocoanuts
O	as
O	produced
O	me
O	a
O	considerable
O	sum
O	having
O	laden
O	our
O	vessel
O	with
O	cocoanuts
O	we
O	set
O	sail
O	and
O	passed
O	by
O	the
O	islands
O	where
O	pepper
O	grows
O	in
O	great
O	plenty
O	from
O	thence
O	we
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	isle
O	of
O	comari
O	where
O	the
O	best
O	species

O	which
O	i
O	wasted
O	in
O	riotous
O	living
O	i
O	quickly
O	perceived
O	that
O	i
O	was
O	misspending
O	my
O	time
O	which
O	is
O	of
O	all
O	things
O	the
O	most
O	valuable
O	i

O	and
O	again
O	wisdom
O	is
O	good
O	with
O	an
O	inheritance
O	i
O	resolved
O	to
O	walk
O	in
O	my

O	s
O	ways
O	and
O	i
O	entered
O	into
O	a
O	contract
O	with
O	some

O	through

O	gulf
O	at

O	i
O	was
O	troubled
O	with
O	but
O	speedily
O	recovered
O	my
O	health
O	in
O	our
O	voyage
O	we
O	touched
O	at
O	several
O	islands
O	where
O	we
O	sold

O	one
O	day
O	we
O	were

O	and
O	resembling
O	a

O	while
O	we
O	were

O	and
O	we
O	were

O	upon
O	to
O	speedily
O	lest

O	all
O	be
O	lost
O	for

O	still
O	upon
O	the

O	when
O	it
O	disappeared
O	into
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	i

O	only
O	time
O	to
O	catch
O	hold
O	of
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	wood
O	that

O	my
O	life
O	when
O	happily
O	a
O	wave
O	threw
O	me
O	on
O	an
O	island
O	the

O	a
O	fine

O	voyage
O	they
O	deserve
O	your

O	even
O	more
O	than

O	of
O	the

O	upon
O	which
O	every

O	held
O	his
O	peace

O	a
O	powerful
O	and
O	wealthy
C	king
O	having
O	lost
O	his
O	wife
O	was
O	so
O	inconsolable
O	that
O	he
O	shut
O	himself
O	up
O	for
O	eight
O	entire
O	days
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	cabinet
O	where
O	he
O	spent
O	his
O	time
O	in
O	knocking
O	his
O	head
O	against
O	the
O	wall
O	until
O	the
O	courtiers
O	were
O	afraid
O	he
O	would
O	kill
O	himself
O	they
O	accordingly
O	placed
O	stuffed
O	mattresses
O	over
O	every
O	wall
O	and
O	allowed
O	all
O	his
O	subjects
O	who
O	desired
O	to
O	pay
O	him
O	a
O	visit
O	trusting
O	that
O	something
O	would
O	be
O	said
O	to
O	alleviate
O	his
O	grief
O	but
O	neither
O	grave
O	nor
O	lively
O	discourse
O	made
O	any
O	impression
O	upon
O	him
O	he
O	scarcely
O	heard
O	what
O	was
O	spoken
O	at
O	last
O	there
O	presented
O	herself
O	before
O	him
O	a
O	lady
O	covered
O	from
O	head
O	to
O	foot
O	in
O	a
O	long
O	crape
O	veil
O	who
O	wept
O	and
O	sobbed
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	the
C	king
O	noticed
O	her
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	come
O	like
O	the
O	rest
O	to
O	console
O	him
O	but
O	rather
O	to
O	encourage
O	his
O	grief
O	she
O	herself
O	had
O	lost
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	husbands
O	and
O	here
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	so
O	profusely
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	wonder
O	her
O	eyes
O	were
O	not
O	melted
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	head
O	the
C	king
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	in
O	company
O	and
O	to
O	talk
O	to
O	her
O	of
O	his
O	dear
O	wife
O	she
O	did
O	the
O	same
O	of
O	her
O	dear
O	husband
O	in
O	fact
O	they
O	talked
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	they
O	talked
O	their
O	sorrow
O	quite
O	away
O	then
O	lifting
O	up
O	her
O	veil
O	she
O	showed
O	lovely
O	blue
O	eyes
O	and
O	dark
O	eyelashes
O	the
C	king
O	noticed
O	her
O	more
O	and
O	more
O	he
O	spoke
O	less
O	and
O	less
O	of
O	the
O	departed
C	queen
O	by
O	and
O	by
O	he
O	ceased
O	to
O	speak
O	of
O	her
O	at
O	all
O	the
O	end
O	was
O	that
O	he
O	courted
O	the
O	inconsolable
O	lady
O	in
O	the
O	black
O	veil
O	and
O	married
O	her
O	by
O	his
O	first
O	marriage
O	he
O	had
O	one
O	daughter
O	called
C	florina
O	or
O	the
O	little
O	flora
O	because
O	she
O	was
O	so
O	fresh
O	and
O	lovely
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	of
O	his
O	second
O	marriage
O	she
O	was
O	quite
O	fifteen
O	years
O	old
O	the
O	new
C	queen
O	also
O	had
O	a
O	daughter
O	who
O	was
O	being
O	brought
O	up
O	by
O	her
O	godmother
O	the
C	fairy
C	soussio
O	name
O	was
C	troutina
O	because
O	her
O	complexion
O	was
O	all
O	spotted
O	like
O	a
O	trout
O	s
O	back
O	indeed
O	she
O	was
O	altogether
O	ugly
O	and
O	disagreeable
O	and
O	when
O	contrasted
O	with
C	florina
O	the
O	difference
O	between
O	the
O	two
O	made
O	the
O	mother
O	so
O	envious
O	that
O	she
O	and
C	troutina
O	spared
O	no
O	pains
O	to
O	make
O	the
O	princess
O	s
O	life
O	unhappy
O	and
O	to
O	speak
O	ill
O	of
O	her
O	to
O	her
O	father
O	one
O	day
O	the
C	king
O	observed
O	that
O	both
O	girls
O	were
O	now
O	old
O	enough
O	to
O	be
O	married
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	intended
O	to
O	choose
O	for
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	the
O	first
O	prince
O	who
O	visited
O	his
O	court
O	be
O	it
O	so
O	said
O	the
C	queen
O	and
O	as
O	my
O	daughter
O	is
O	older
O	handsomer
O	and
O	more
O	amiable
O	than
O	yours
O	she
O	shall
O	have
O	the
O	first
O	choice
O	the
C	king
O	disputed
O	nothing
O	indeed
O	he
O	never
O	did
O	the
C	queen
O	ruled
O	him
O	in
O	all
O	things
O	some
O	time
O	after
O	news
O	came
O	that
C	king
C	charming
O	would
O	shortly
O	arrive
O	and
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	as
O	charming
O	as
O	his
O	name
O	when
O	the
C	queen
O	heard
O	this
O	news
O	she
O	sent
O	for
O	milliners
O	dressmakers
O	jewellers
O	and

O	indeed
O	she

O	so
O	much

O	of

O	out
O	blushing
O	so
O	much
O	that
O	the

O	a
O	profound
O	reverence
O	paying
O	her
O	besides
O	so
O	many

O	displeased
C	king

O	for
O	three
O	hours
O	without
O	stopping
O	indeed
O	his
O	admiration
O	of

O	was
O	so
O	plain
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	and

O	begged
O	of
O	the

O	in
O	a

O	he
O	could
O	when

O	lady
O	about
O	the

O	who
O	locked

O	as
O	a

O	the

O	and

O	the

O	on

O	and
O	that

O	should
O	try

O	her
O	if
O	not
O	he
O	was
O	to

O	himself
O	once
O	more
C	king
C	charming

O	charming
O	as
O	ever
O	but

O	than
O	a
C	king
O	in
O	the
O	society
O	of
C	troutina
O	the

O	gave
O	him
O	the
O	best
O	reasons
O	for
O	what

O	with

O	how
O	to

O	she
O	showed
O	teeth
O	like
O	the

O	of
O	a

O	boar
O	now
O	the
C	king
O	when

O	had
O	informed
C	florina
O	about

O	but
O	vain
O	were
O	her

O	the

O	had
O	taken
O	opium
O	to
O	lull
O	his

O	he
O	slept
O	soundly
O	all
O	night
O	long
O	next
O	day
C	florina
O	was
O	in

O	disquietude
O	could
O	he
O	have
O	really

O	at

O	but
O	she
O	had
O	no

O	so
O	she
O	broke

O	who

O	themselves
O	just
O	like

O	ladies
O	and
O	gentlemen
O	when
C	troutina
O	went
O	to
O	walk
O	in
O	the

O	garden
C	florina

O	ready
O	to
O	buy
O	the

O	at

O	again
C	florina

O	the
O	night
O	in
O	the

O	and
O	again
O	the
C	king
O	undisturbed
O	by
O	her
O	lamentation
O	slept
O	without
O	waking
O	till
O	dawn
O	the
O	third

O	one
O	of
O	the

O	stupid
O	it
O	is
O	well
O	the
C	king
O	takes
O	opium
O	every
O	night
O	or
O	you
O	would
O	disturb
O	him
O	by
O	that
O	terrible
O	sobbing
O	of
O	yours
O	does
O	he
O	so
O	said
O	the
C	queen
O	now
O	comprehending
O	all
O	then
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	promise
O	to
O	keep
O	the
O	opium
O	cup
O	out
O	of

O	these
O	pearls
O	and
O	diamonds
O	and
O	she
O	took
O	a

O	sack
O	shall
O	assuredly
O	be

O	the

O	promised
O	and
O	then
C	florina
O	broke
O	her
O	fourth
O	egg
O	out
O	of
O	which
O	came
O	a
O	pie
O	composed
O	of
O	birds
O	which
O	though
O	they
O	had
O	been
O	plucked

O	and
O	made

C	troutina
O	charmed
O	with
O	this
O	marvellous
O	novelty
O	bought
O	it
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	price
O	as
O	the
O	rest
O	adding
O	generously
O	a
O	small
O	piece
O	of
O	gold
O	when
O	all

O	expressions
O	reminding
O	him
O	of

O	and
O	their
O	two
O	years
O	of
O	happiness
O	what

O	i
O	done
O	to
O	thee
O	that
O	thou
O	shouldst
O	forget
O	me
O	and
O	marry
C	troutina
O	sobbed
O	she
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	who
O	this
O	time
O	was
O	wide
O	awake
O	heard
O	her
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	make
O	out
O	whose
O	voice
O	it
O	was
O	or
O	whence
O	it
O	came
O	but
O	it
O	somehow
O	reminded
O	him
O	of
O	his
O	dearest
C	florina
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	ceased
O	to
O	love
O	he
O	called
O	his
O	valet
O	inquired
O	who
O	was
O	sleeping
O	in
O	the
O	chamber
O	of
O	echoes
O	and
O	heard
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	little
O	who
O	had
O	sold
O	to
C	troutina
O	the
O	emerald
O	bracelet
O	then
O	he
O	rose
O	up
O	dressed
O	himself
O	hastily
O	and
O	went
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	her
O	she
O	was
O	sitting
O	mournfully
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	with
O	her
O	hair
O	hiding
O	her
O	face
O	and
O	her
O	eyes
O	swollen
O	with
O	tears
O	but
O	he
O	knew
O	at
O	once
O	his
O	faithful
C	florina
O	he
O	fell
O	on
O	his
O	knees
O	before
O	her
O	covered
O	her
O	hands
O	with
O	kisses
O	and
O	they
O	embraced
O	and
O	wept
O	together
O	for
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	good
O	of
O	all
O	their
O	love
O	when

O	were

O	with
O	a
C	fairy
O	still
O	greater
O	than
C	soussio
O	the
O	one
O	who
O	had
O	given
C	florina
O	the
O	four
O	eggs
O	they
O	declared
O	that
O	their
O	united
O	power
O	was
O	stronger
O	than
C	soussio
O	s
O	and
O	that

O	should
O	be
O	married
O	without
O	further
O	delay
O	when
O	this

O	to

O	was
O	not
O	very
O	common
O	among
O	the
O	shepherds
O	of
O	stumpinghame
O	and
O	the

O	never
O	tasted
O	such
O	drink
O	as
O	that
O	before
O	for
O	scarcely
O	had
O	it
O	gone
O	down
O	when

O	with

O	in
O	short
O	he
O	forgot
O	the

O	misfortune
O	of

O	and
O	it
O	seemed
O	to

O	that
O	he
O	was
O	a
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	and

O	so
C	fairyfoot
O	was
O	as
O	happy
O	as
O	a
O	prince
O	and
O	drank
O	milk
O	and
O	ate
O	honey
O	till
O	the

O	was
O	low
O	in

O	next

C	fairyfoot
O	was
O	not
O	tired
O	for
O	all
O	his
O	dancing
O	nobody
O	in
O	the
O	cottage
O	had
O	missed
O	him
O	and
O	he
O	went
O	out
O	with
O	the
O	sheep
O	as
O	usual
O	but
O	every
O	night
O	all
O	that
O	summer
O	when
O	the
O	shepherds
O	were
O	safe
O	in

O	the
O	little
O	man
O	came
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	away
O	to
O	dance
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	now
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	care
O	to
O	play
O	with
O	the
O	shepherds
O	children
O	nor
O	grieve
O	that
O	his
C	father

O	had
O	forgotten
O	him
O	but
O	watched
O	the
O	sheep
O	all
O	day
O	singing
O	to
O	himself
O	or
O	plaiting
O	rushes
O	the
O	wonder
O	was
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	never
O	tired
O	nor
O	sleepy
O	as
O	people
O	are
O	apt
O	to

O	all

O	but
O	before

C	fairyfoot
O	found
O	out
O	the
O	reason
O	one
O	night
O	when
O	the
O	moon
O	was
O	full
O	and
O	the
O	last
O	of
O	the
O	ripe
O	corn
O	rustling
O	in
O	the
O	fields
C	robin
C	goodfellow
O	came
O	for
O	him
O	as
O	usual
O	and
O	away
O	they
O	went
O	to
O	the
O	flowery
O	green
O	the
O	fun
O	there
O	was
O	high
O	and
C	robin
O	was
O	in
O	haste
O	so
O	he
O	only
O	pointed
O	to
O	the
O	carved
O	cup
O	from
O	which
C	fairyfoot
O	every
O	night
O	drank
O	the
O	clear
O	red
O	wine
O	i
O	am
O	not
O	thirsty
O	and
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	use
O	losing
O	time
O	thought
O	the
C	boy
O	to
O	himself
O	and
O	he
O	joined
O	the
O	dance
O	but
O	never
O	in
O	all
O	his
O	life
O	did
C	fairyfoot
O	find
O	such
O	hard
O	work
O	as
O	to
O	keep
O	pace
O	with
O	the
O	company
O	their
O	feet
O	seemed
O	to
O	move
O	like
O	lightning
O	the
O	swallows
O	did
O	not
O	fly
O	so
O	fast
O	or
O	turn
O	so
O	quickly
C	fairyfoot
O	did
O	his
O	best
O	for
O	he
O	never
O	gave
O	in
O	easily
O	but
O	at
O	length
O	his
O	breath
O	and
O	strength
O	being
O	spent
O	the
C	boy
O	was
O	glad
O	to
O	steal
O	away
O	and
O	sit
O	down
O	behind
O	a
O	mossy
O	oak
O	where
O	his
O	eyes
O	closed
O	for
O	very
O	weariness
O	when
O	he
O	awoke
O	the
O	dance
O	was
O	nearly
O	over
O	but
O	two
O	little
O	ladies
O	clad
O	in
O	green
O	talked
O	close
O	beside
O	him
O	what
O	a
O	beautiful
C	boy
O	said
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	he
O	is
O	worthy
O	to
O	be
O	a
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	only
O	see
O	what
O	handsome
O	feet
O	he
O	has
O	yes
O	said
O	the
O	other
O	with
O	a
O	laugh
O	that
O	sounded
O	spiteful
O	they
O	are
O	just
O	like
O	the
O	feet
C	princess
C	maybloom
O	had
O	before
O	she
O	washed
O	them
O	in

O	wide
O	throughout

O	country
O	searching
O	for
O	a
O	doctor
O	to
O	make
O	them
O	small
O	again
O	but
O	nothing
O	in

O	except
O	the

O	of

O	to
O	let
O	the

O	the
O	first
O	little
O	lady
O	there
O	would

O	such
O	crowds
O	of
O	these

O	of

O	nobody

O	for

O	but
O	you
O	will
O	surely
O	send
O	word
O	to
O	the
O	sweet
C	princess
O	was
O	so
O	kind
O	to
O	our
O	birds
O	and

O	and

O	so
O	like

O	and

O	a

O	in

O	we
O	shall
O	be
O	too
O	late
O	for
O	the
O	last
O	dance
O	when
O	they
O	were
O	gone
C	fairyfoot
O	could
O	sleep
O	no
O	more
O	with
O	astonishment
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	wonder
O	at
O	the
O	fairies
O	admiring
O	his
O	feet
O	because
O	their
O	own
O	were
O	much
O	the
O	same
O	but
O	it
O	amazed
O	him
O	that
O	princess
O	maybloom
O	s
C	father
O	should
O	be
O	troubled
O	at
O	hers
O	growing
O	large
O	moreover
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	same
C	princess
O	and
O	her
O	country
O	since
O	there
O	were
O	really
O	other
O	places
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	than
O	stumpinghame
O	when
C	robin
C	goodfellow
O	came
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	home
O	as
O	usual
O	he
O	durst
O	not
O	let
O	him
O	know
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	overheard
O	anything
O	but
O	never
O	was
O	the
C	boy
O	so
O	unwilling
O	to
O	get
O	up
O	as
O	on
O	that
O	morning
O	and
O	all
O	day
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	weary
O	that
O	in
O	the
O	afternoon
C	fairyfoot
O	fell
O	asleep
O	with
O	his
O	head
O	on
O	a
O	clump
O	of
O	rushes
O	it
O	was
O	seldom
O	that
O	any
O	one
O	thought
O	of
O	looking
O	after
O	him
O	and
O	the
O	sickly
O	sheep
O	but
O	it
O	so
O	happened
O	that
O	towards
O	evening
O	the
O	old
C	shepherd
C	fleecefold
O	thought
O	he
O	would
O	see
O	how
O	things
O	went
O	on
O	in
O	the
O	pastures
O	the
C	shepherd
O	had
O	a
O	bad
O	temper
O	and
O	a
O	thick
O	staff
O	and
O	no
O	sooner
O	did
O	he
O	catch
O	sight
O	of
C	fairyfoot
O	sleeping
O	and
O	his
O	flock
O	straying
O	away
O	than
O	shouting
O	all
O	the
O	ill
O	names
O	he
O	could
O	remember
O	in
O	a
O	voice
O	which
O	woke
O	up
O	the
C	boy
O	he
O	ran
O	after
O	him
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	his
O	great
O	feet
O	would
O	allow
O	while
C	fairyfoot
O	seeing
O	no
O	other
O	shelter
O	from
O	his
O	fury
O	fled
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	never
O	stopped
O	nor
O	stayed
O	till
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	banks
O	of
O	a
O	little
O	stream
O	thinking
O	it
O	might
O	lead
O	him
O	to
O	the
O	fairies
O	he
O	followed
O	that
O	stream
O	for
O	many
O	an
O	hour
O	but
O	it
O	wound
O	away
O	into
O	the
O	heart
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	flowing
O	through
O	dells
O	falling
O	over
O	mossy
O	rocks
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	leading
C	fairyfoot
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	tired
O	and
O	the
O	night
O	had
O	fallen
O	to
O	a
O	grove
O	of
O	great
O	with
O	the
O	moon
O	shining
O	on
O	it
O	as
O	bright
O	as
O	day
O	and
O	thousands
O	of
O	nightingales
O	singing
O	in
O	the
O	branches
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	that
O	grove
O	was
O	a
O	clear
O	spring
O	bordered
O	with
O	banks
O	of
O	lilies
O	and
C	fairyfoot
O	sat
O	down
O	by
O	it
O	to
O	rest
O	himself
O	and
O	listen
O	the
O	singing
O	was
O	so
O	sweet
O	he
O	could
O	have
O	listened
O	for
O	ever
O	but
O	as
O	he
O	sat
O	the
O	nightingales
O	left
O	off
O	their
O	songs
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	talk
O	together
O	in
O	the
O	silence
O	of
O	the
O	what
C	boy
O	is
O	that
O	said
O	one
O	on
O	a
O	branch
O	above
O	him
O	who
O	sits
O	so
O	lonely
O	by
O	the
O	fair
O	fountain
O	he
O	cannot
O	have
O	come
O	from
O	stumpinghame
O	with

O	no

O	how
O	in
O	the

O	did
O	he
O	find
O	the

O	how
O	simple
O	you
O	are
O	said
O	a
O	third
O	nightingale
O	what
O	had
O	he
O	to

O	follow
O	the
O	which
O	grows
O	over

O	from
O	the

O	to

C	boy

O	leaving
O	us
O	no

C	fairyfoot
O	sat
O	in
O	great
O	astonishment
O	at
O	this
O	discourse
O	but
O	by
O	and
O	by
O	when
O	the
O	talk
O	ceased
O	and
O	the

O	began
O	he
O	thought
O	it

O	be
O	as
O	well
O	for

O	to
O	follow
O	the

O	not

O	of

C	ruddy
O	the

O	sheep
O	and
O	the
O	crusty
O	old
C	shepherd
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	journey
O	but
O	he
O	went
O	on
O	eating
O	wild
O	berries
O	by
O	day
O	sleeping
O	in
O	the
O	hollows
O	of
O	old
O	trees
O	by
O	night
O	and
O	never
O	losing

O	of
O	the
O	which
O	led
O	him
O	over
O	height
O	and

O	out
O	of

O	on

O	and
O	a
O	low
O	gate
O	of
O	the

O	s
O	which
O	was
O	thought
O	too
O	mean
O	for
O	the
O	scullions
O	and
O	had

O	been
O	opened
O	for
O	seven
O	years
O	there

O	gate
O	was
O	overgrown

O	so
O	being
O	an
O	active
C	boy
O	he
O	climbed
O	over
O	and
O	walked
O	through
O	the
O	garden
O	till
O	a
O	white
O	fawn
O	came
O	frisking
O	by
O	and
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	soft
O	voice

O	come
O	back
O	my

O	i

O	grown
O	so

O	and
O	looking

O	he
O	saw
O	the

O	dressed
O	in
O	and

O	i
O	have
O	heard
O	of

O	grown
O	large
O	in

O	in

O	for

O	would

O	to
O	make
O	that

O	heard
O	that
O	she
O	danced
O	for

O	in

O	gone
O	mad
O	but
C	fairyfoot
O	making
O	an
O	humble
O	reverence
O	told
O	his
O	message
O	to
O	the

O	and
C	queen
O	and
O	offered
O	to
O	set
O	out
O	with
O	the

O	that
O	very
O	day
O	at
O	first
O	the

O	believe
O	that
O	there
O	could
O	be
O	any
O	use
O	in

O	had
O	failed
O	to

O	the

O	laughed
C	fairyfoot
O	to
O	scorn
O	the

O	wanted
O	to
O	turn
O	him
O	out
O	for
O	an
O	impudent
O	impostor
O	and
O	the
O	said
O	he
O	ought
O	to
O	be
O	put
O	to

O	for
C	fairyfoot
O	wished

O	in
O	the

O	again
O	or
O	even

O	but
O	the
C	queen
O	being
O	a
O	prudent
O	woman
O	i
O	pray
O	your
O	majesty
O	to
O	notice
O	what
O	fine
O	feet
O	this
C	boy
O	has
O	there
O	may
O	be
O	some

O	in
O	his
O	story
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	our
O	only
O	daughter
O	i
O	will
O	choose
O	two
O	maids
O	who
O	talk
O	the

O	in
O	our

O	let
O	them
O	go
O	with
O	the

O	who
O	knows
O	but
O	our
O	sorrow
O	may
O	be
O	lessened
O	after
O	some
O	persuasion
O	the
C	king
O	consented
O	though
O	all
O	his
O	councillors
O	advised
O	the

O	and
O	her
O	fawn
O	which

O	and
O	they
O	all
O	set
O	out
O	after
O	dinner
C	fairyfoot
O	had
O	hard
O	work
O	guiding

O	along
O	the

O	but
O	the

O	went
O	on
O	with
O	good
O	courage
O	and
O	at

O	they
O	reached
O	the

O	the

O	though

O	the

O	for

O	after

O	lastly
O	the
C	princess
O	washed
O	could
O	make
O	her
O	no
O	fairer
O	but
O	the
O	moment
O	her
O	feet
O	touched
O	the
O	water
O	they
O	grew
O	less
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	washed
O	and
O	dried
O	them
O	three
O	times
O	they
O	were

O	as
O	fairyfoot
O	s
O	own
O	there
O	was
O	great
O	joy
O	among
O	them
O	but
O	the
C	boy
O	said
O	oh
O	if
O	there
O	had
O	been
O	a
O	well
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	to
O	make
O	my
O	feet
O	large
O	my
C	father
O	and

O	would
O	not

O	off
O	nor
O	sent
O	me
O	to
O	live
O	among
O	the
O	shepherds
O	cheer
O	up
O	your
O	heart
O	said
O	the
C	princess
C	maybloom
O	if
O	you
O	want
O	large
O	feet
O	there
O	is
O	a
O	well
O	in
O	this
O	forest
O	that
O	will
O	do
O	it
O	last
O	summer
O	time
O	i
O	came
O	with
O	my
C	father
O	and
O	his
O	foresters
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	great
O	cedar
O	cut
O	down
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	meant
O	to
O	make
O	a
O	money
O	chest
O	while
O	they
O	were
O	busy
O	with
O	the
O	cedar
O	i
O	saw
O	a
O	bramble
O	branch
O	covered
O	with
O	berries
O	some
O	were
O	ripe
O	and
O	some
O	were
O	green
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	longest
O	bramble
O	that
O	ever
O	grew
O	for
O	the
O	sake
O	of
O	the
O	berries
O	i
O	went
O	on
O	and
O	on
O	to
O	its
O	root
O	which
O	grew
O	hard
O	by
O	a
O	well
O	with
O	banks
O	of
O	dark
O	green
O	moss
O	in
O	the
O	deepest
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	forest
O	the
O	day
O	was
O	warm
O	and
O	dry
O	and
O	my
O	feet
O	were
O	sore
O	with
O	the
O	rough
O	ground
O	so
O	i
O	took
O	off
O	my
O	scarlet
O	shoes
O	and
O	washed
O	my
O	feet
O	in
O	the
O	well
O	but
O	as
O	i
O	washed
O	they
O	grew
O	larger
O	every
O	minute
O	and
O	nothing
O	could
O	ever
O	make
O	them
O	less
O	again
O	i
O	have
O	seen
O	the
O	bramble
O	this
O	day
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	far
O	off
O	and
O	as
O	you
O	have
O	shown
O	me
O	the
O	fair
O	fountain
O	i
O	will
O	show
O	you
O	the
O	growing
O	well
O	up
O	rose
C	fairyfoot
O	and
C	princess
C	maybloom
O	and
O	went
O	together
O	till
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	bramble
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	where
O	its
O	root
O	grew
O	hard
O	by
O	the
O	well
O	with

O	moss
O	in

C	fairyfoot
O	sat
O	down
O	to

O	but
O	at
O	that
O	minute
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	sound
O	of
O	music
O	and
O	knew
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	fairies
O	going
O	to
O	their
O	dancing
O	ground
O	if
O	my
O	feet
O	grow
O	large
O	said
O	the
C	boy
O	to
O	himself
O	how
O	shall
O	i
O	dance
O	with
O	them
O	so
O	rising
O	quickly
O	he
O	took
O	the

C	maybloom
O	by

O	the

O	followed
O	them
O	the

O	and
O	the

O	followed
O	it
O	and
O	all
O	followed
O	the
O	music
O	through
O	the

O	at
O	last
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	the

O	green
C	robin
C	goodfellow
O	welcomed
O	the

O	and
O	gave
O	every
O	one
O	a
O	drink
O	of
O	the

O	so
O	they
O	danced
O	there
O	from
O	sunset
O	till
O	the
O	grey
O	morning
O	and
O	nobody
O	was
O	tired

C	robin
C	goodfellow
O	took
O	them
O	all
O	safe
O	home
O	as
O	he
O	used
O	to

C	fairyfoot
O	there

O	and
O	when

O	he
O	and
O	the

O	asked

O	in

O	now
C	king
C	arthur
O	trusted
O	every

O	until
O	he
O	proved

O	unworthy
O	and
O	in
O	this
O	youth
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	saw
O	one
O	who
O	should
O	do
O	nobly
O	and
O	win
O	renown
O	so
O	laughing
O	he

C	kay
O	was
O	but
O	harsh
O	to
O	those
O	whom
O	he
O	liked
O	not
O	and
O	from
O	the
O	first
O	he
O	scorned
O	the

O	man
O	for
O	none
O	said
O	he
O	but
O	a

O	when

O	might

O	but
C	sir
C	launcelot
O	and

O	part
O	neither
O	knew
O	him
O	for

O	for
O	the

C	knight
O	in

O	then
O	at
C	gareth
O	s
O	desire
O	they
O	fought
O	together
O	with

O	and
C	gareth
O	did
O	knightly
O	till
O	at
O	length
C	sir

O	do
O	my

C	sir
C	gareth
O	now
O	as
O	they
O	rode
O	through
O	the
O	forest
O	they
O	met
O	with
O	a
C	knight
O	sore
O	beset
O	by
O	six
O	thieves
O	and
O	him
C	sir
C	gareth
O	rescued
O	the

O	then
O	bade
C	gareth
O	and
O	the
O	damsel
O	rest
O	at

O	and
O	entertained

O	right
O	gladly
O	until

O	when
O	the
O	two
O	rode
O	forth
O	again
O	presently
O	they
O	drew
O	near
O	to
O	a

C	sir
C	gareth
O	therewith
O	he
O	encountered
O	the

C	knight
O	in

O	and
O	struck
O	him
O	such
O	a

O	that
O	he
O	fell
O	stunned
O	into

O	the
O	damsel
O	mocked
O	him
O	saying
O	what
O	a
O	mischance
O	is
O	this
O	that
O	a
O	kitchen
O	boy
O	should

O	one
C	knight
O	from

O	the
O	damsel
O	ashamed
O	and
O	looking
O	curiously
O	at
C	gareth
O	she
O	said

O	but
O	ye

O	there
O	came
O	to
C	sir
C	gareth
O	a

O	from

C	blue
C	knight
O	to

O	and
O	such
O	was
O	the
O	shock
O	that
O	their

O	fell
O	dead
O	so
O	they
O	rushed
O	on

O	the

O	seen
O	from

O	the
O	walls
O	were
O	of
O	transparent
O	porcelain
O	variously
O	coloured
O	and

O	that

O	existed
O	from

O	the

O	a
O	deer
O	s
O	foot

O	to
O	a
O	chain
O	of
O	diamonds
O	he

O	wondering
O	at
O	the
O	magnificence
O	he
O	beheld
O	and
O	the
O	security
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	inhabitants
O	seemed
O	to
O	live
O	for
O	said
O	he
O	to
O	himself
O	nothing
O	could
O	be
O	easier

O	and
O	as
O	many
O	of
O	the
O	as
O	would
O	make
O	their

O	he
O	pulled
O	the
O	chain
O	and
O	heard
O	a
O	bell
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	which
O	was
O	exquisite
O	in
O	a
O	few
O	moments
O	the
O	door
O	was
O	opened
O	yet
O	he
O	perceived
O	nothing
O	but
O	twelve
O	hands
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	each
O	holding
O	a
O	torch
O	the
C	prince
O	was
O	so
O	astonished
O	that
O	he
O	durst
O	not
O	move
O	a
O	step
O	when
O	he
O	felt
O	himself
O	gently
O	pushed
O	on
O	by
O	some
O	other
O	hands
O	from
O	behind
O	him
O	he
O	walked
O	on
O	in
O	great
O	perplexity
O	till
O	he
O	entered
O	a
O	vestibule
O	inlaid
O	with
O	porphyry
O	and
O	where
O	the
O	most
O	melodious
O	voice
O	he
O	had
O	ever
O	heard
O	chanted
O	the
O	following
O	words
O	welcome
C	prince
O	no
O	danger
O	fear
O	mirth
O	and
O	love
O	attend
O	you
O	here
O	you
O	shall
O	break
O	the
O	magic

O	that
O	on
O	a
O	beauteous
O	lady
O	fell
O	welcome

O	the

O	now
O	advanced
O	with
O	confidence
O	wondering
O	what
O	these
O	words
O	could
O	mean
O	the
O	hands
O	moved
O	him
O	forward
O	towards
O	a
O	large
O	door
O	of
O	coral
O	which
O	opened
O	of
O	itself
O	to
O	give

O	and
O	jewels
O	and

O	resplendently
O	lighted
O	with
O	thousands
O	of
O	lamps
O	girandoles
O	and

O	that
O	he
O	imagined
O	he
O	must
O	be
O	in
O	an
O	enchanted
O	palace
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	passed
O	through
O	sixty
O	apartments
O	all
O	equally
O	splendid
O	he
O	was
O	stopped
O	by
O	the

O	and
O	a
O	large
O	easy
O	chair
O	advanced
O	of
O	itself
O	towards
O	the
O	fireplace
O	then
O	the
O	hands
O	which
O	he
O	observed
O	were
O	extremely
O	white
O	and
O	delicate
O	took
O	off
O	his
O	wet
O	clothes
O	and
O	supplied
O	their
O	place
O	with
O	the

O	linen
O	imaginable
O	adding
O	a

O	him
O	an
O	elegant
O	and
O	combed
O	his
O	hair
O	so
O	very
O	gently
O	that
O	he
O	scarcely
O	felt
O	their
O	touch
O	they
O	held
O	before
O	him
O	a
O	beautiful
O	basin
O	filled
O	with
O	perfumes
O	for
O	him
O	to
O	wash
O	his
O	face

O	in
O	a

O	now
O	approached
O	and
O	throwing

O	till
O	the
C	white
C	cat
O	who
O	guessed
O	his

O	assured

O	mixed
O	with

O	nearly
O	expired
O	the
C	white
C	cat
O	who
O	knew
O	the
O	very
O	day
O	when
O	the
C	prince
O	was
O	to
O	reach
O	his
O	father
O	s
O	palace
O	reminded
O	him
O	that

O	but
O	three
O	days
O	longer
O	to
O	look
O	for
O	a
O	perfect
O	little
C	dog
O	the

O	astonished
O	at
O	his
O	own
O	forgetfulness
O	began
O	to
O	afflict
O	himself
O	when
O	the
O	cat
O	told
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	so
O	sorrowful
O	since
O	she
O	would
O	not

O	provide
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	little
C	dog
O	but
O	also
O	with
O	a
O	wooden
O	horse
O	which
O	should
O	convey
O	him
O	safely
O	home
O	in
O	less

O	twelve
O	hours

O	she
O	showing
O	him
O	an
O	acorn

O	what
O	you
O	desire
O	the
C	prince
O	put
O	the
O	acorn
O	to
O	his
O	ear
O	and
O	heard
O	the
O	barking
O	of
O	a
O	little
C	dog
O	transported
O	with
O	joy
O	he
O	thanked
O	the
O	cat
O	a
O	thousand
O	times
O	and
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	bidding
O	her
O	tenderly
O	adieu
O	he
O	set
O	out
O	on

O	the
C	prince
O	arrived
O	first
O	at
O	the
O	place
O	of
O	rendezvous
O	and
O	was
O	soon
O	joined
O	by
O	his
C	brothers
O	they
O	mutually
O	embraced
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	give
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	their
O	success
O	when
O	the
O	youngest
O	showed
O	them
O	only
O	a
O	little
O	mongrel
O	cur
O	telling
O	them
O	that
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	could
O	not
O	fail
O	to
O	please
O	the
C	king
O	from
O	its
O	extraordinary
O	beauty
O	the
C	brothers
O	trod
O	on
O	each
O	other
O	s
O	toes
O	under
O	the
O	table
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	to
O	say
O	we
O	have
O	little
O	to
O	fear
O	from
O	this
O	animal
O	the
O	next
O	day
O	they
O	went
O	together
O	to
O	the
O	palace
O	the
O	dogs
O	of
O	the
O	two
O	elder
C	brothers
O	were
O	lying
O	on
O	cushions
O	and
O	so
O	curiously
O	wrapped
O	around
O	with
O	embroidered
O	quilts
O	that
O	one
O	would
O	scarcely
O	venture
O	to
O	touch
O	them
O	the
O	youngest
O	produced
O	his
O	cur
O	and
O	all
O	wondered
O	how
O	the
C	prince
O	could
O	hope
O	to
O	receive
O	a
O	crown
O	for
O	such
O	a
O	shabby
O	present
O	the
C	king
O	examined
O	the
O	two
O	little
O	dogs
O	of
O	the
O	elder
O	princes
O	and
O	declared
O	he
O	thought
O	them
O	so
O	equally
O	beautiful
O	that
O	he
O	knew
O	not
O	to
O	which
O	with
O	justice
O	he
O	could
O	give
O	the
O	preference
O	they
O	accordingly
O	began
O	to
O	dispute
O	when
O	the
O	youngest
C	prince
O	taking
O	his
O	acorn
O	from
O	his
O	pocket
O	soon
O	ended
O	their
O	contention
O	for
O	a
O	little
C	dog
O	appeared
O	which
O	could
O	with
O	ease
O	go
O	through
O	the
O	smallest
O	ring
O	and
O	was
O	besides
O	a
O	miracle
O	of
O	beauty
O	the
C	king
O	could
O	not
O	possibly
O	hesitate
O	in
O	declaring
O	his
O	satisfaction
O	yet
O	as
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	more
O	inclined
O	than
O	the
O	year
O	before
O	to
O	part
O	with
O	his
O	crown
O	he
O	told
O	his
O	sons
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	extremely
O	obliged
O	to
O	them
O	for
O	the
O	pains
O	they
O	had
O	taken
O	and
O	since
O	they
O	had
O	succeeded
O	so
O	well
O	he
O	wished
O	they
O	would
O	make
O	a
O	second
O	attempt
O	he
O	therefore
O	begged
O	they
O	would
O	take
O	another
O	year
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	procure
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	cambric
O	fine
O	enough
O	to
O	be
O	drawn
O	through
O	the
O	eye
O	of
O	a
O	small
O	needle
O	the
O	three
O	princes
O	thought
O	this
O	very
O	hard
O	yet
O	they
O	set
O	out
O	in
O	obedience
O	to
O	the
C	king
O	s
O	command
O	the
O	two
O	eldest
O	took
O	different
O	roads
O	and
O	the
O	youngest
O	remounted
O	his
O	wooden
O	horse
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	his
O	beloved
C	white
C	cat
O	who
O	received
O	him
O	with
O	the

O	joy
O	while
O	the
O	trunkless
O	hands
O	helped
O	him
O	to
O	dismount
O	and
O	provided
O	him
O	with
O	immediate
O	refreshment
O	afterwards
O	the
C	prince
O	gave
O	the
C	white
C	cat
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	the
O	admiration
O	which
O	had
O	been
O	bestowed
O	on
O	the
O	beautiful
O	little
C	dog
O	and
O	informed
O	her
O	of
O	the
O	further
O	injunction
O	of
O	his
O	father
O	make
O	yourself
O	perfectly
O	easy
O	dear
C	prince
O	said
O	she
O	i
O	have
O	in
O	my
O	palace
O	some
O	cats
O	who
O	are
O	perfect
O	adepts
O	in
O	making
O	such
O	cambric
O	as
O	the
C	king
O	requires
O	so
O	you
O	have
O	nothing
O	to

O	the
O	pleasure
O	of

O	accordingly
O	ordered
O	the

O	to

O	played
O	off
O	in
O	sight
O	of
O	the

O	they
O	were
O	sitting
O	and
O	nothing
O	but
O	festivity
O	and
O	rejoicing
O	was
O	heard
O	throughout
O	the
O	palace
O	for
O	the

O	plenty
O	of
O	amusement
O	in

O	be
O	that
O	a

O	in

O	silver
O	pearls

O	the

O	as

O	opening
O	an
O	elegant
O	little
O	box
O	inlaid
O	with
O	jewels
O	took
O	out
O	a

O	imagining

O	his
O	piece
O	of

O	the
C	prince
O	however
O	cracked
O	the
O	which

O	filled
O	with
O	a
O	kernel
O	he
O	divided
O	it
O	and

O	in
O	the

O	a
O	grain
O	of
O	wheat
O	and
O	in
O	that
O	a

O	absolutely
O	confounded
O	and

C	cat
C	white
C	cat
O	thou

O	at

O	of
O	a

O	upon

O	of
O	to
O	the

O	a

O	four
O	hundred
O	yards
O	long
O	and
O	fine
O	enough

O	sighed
O	deeply
O	and

O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	that

O	was
O	sorry
O	for

O	he

O	long
O	in
O	devising
O	the
O	means
O	for
O	the
O	execution
O	of
O	my
O	project
O	i
O	begged
O	the
O	fairies
O	to
O	bring
O	me
O	a
O	a
O	mesh
O	and
O	some
O	cord
O	saying
O	i
O	wished
O	to
O	make
O	some
O	nets
O	to
O	amuse

O	and
O	in
O	a
O	short
O	time
O	i
O	completed
O	a
O	ladder
O	long
O	enough
O	to
O	reach
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	i
O	now
O	sent
O	my
O	parrot
O	to
O	the
C	prince
O	to
O	beg
O	he
O	would
O	come
O	to
O	the

O	place
O	as

O	the

O	at
O	once

O	the

C	violent
O	mounted
O	on
O	the
O	dragon
O	s
O	back
O	rushed
O	into
O	the
O	tower
O	my
O	beloved
C	prince
O	thought
O	of
O	nothing
O	but
O	how
O	to
O	defend
O	me
O	from
O	their
O	fury
O	for
O	i
O	had
O	had
O	time
O	to
O	relate
O	to
O	him
O	my
O	story
O	previous
O	to
O	this
O	cruel
O	interruption
O	but
O	their
O	numbers
O	overpowered
O	him
O	and
O	the
C	fairy
C	violent
O	had
O	the
O	barbarity
O	to
O	command
O	the
O	dragon
O	to
O	devour
O	my
O	lover
O	before
O	my
O	eyes
O	in
O	my
O	despair
O	i
O	would
O	have
O	thrown
O	myself
O	also
O	into
O	the
O	mouth
O	of
O	the
O	horrible
O	monster
O	but
O	this
O	they
O	took
O	care
O	to
O	prevent
O	saying
O	my
O	life
O	should
O	be
O	preserved
O	for
O	greater
O	punishment
O	the
C	fairy
O	then
O	touched
O	me
O	with
O	her
O	wand
O	and
O	i
O	instantly
O	became
O	a
C	white
C	cat
O	she
O	next
O	conducted
O	me
O	to
O	this
O	palace
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	my
O	father
O	and
O	gave
O	me
O	a
O	train
O	of
O	cats
O	for
O	my
O	attendants
O	together
O	with
O	the
O	twelve
O	hands
O	that
O	waited
O	on
O	your
O	highness
O	she
O	then
O	informed
O	me
O	of
O	my
O	birth
O	and
O	the
O	death
O	of
O	my
O	parents
O	and
O	pronounced
O	upon
O	me
O	what
O	she
O	imagined
O	the
O	greatest
O	of
O	maledictions
O	that
O	i
O	should
O	not

C	prince
O	the

O	resemblance
O	of

O	i
O	had
O	lost
O	should

O	my

O	you
O	are
O	that
O	perfect
O	resemblance
O	and
O	accordingly
O	you
O	ended
O	the

O	seldom
O	seriously
O	quarrelled

O	very
O	changeable
O	weather
O	indeed
O	it
O	looked

O	my

O	mr

O	down
O	in

O	really
O	my

O	so
O	far
O	from
O	being
O	a
O	promising
O	morning
O	i
O	must

O	it

O	mother
O	for
O	fifteen
O	years
O	to

O	why
O	my

C	mr

O	you
O	said

O	the

O	but
C	mrs

O	smile
O	round

O	questions
O	of

O	now
O	i

O	rather
O	unfair
O	on
C	mr
C	skratdj
O	s
O	part
C	mrs
C	skratdj
O	would
O	chirp
O	with

C	mrs

O	a

O	so
O	they
O	went
O	on
O	with
O	ceaseless
O	arguments
O	that
O	proved
O	nothing
O	and
O	convinced
O	nobody
O	and
O	a
O	continual
O	stream
O	of
O	contradiction
O	that
O	just
O	fell
O	short
O	of
O	downright
O	quarreling
O	indeed
O	there
O	was
O	a

O	snap
O	each

O	up
O	with

O	such

O	a

O	never
O	put

O	it

O	a

O	in
O	a

O	of
O	irritability
O	that
O	fell
O	just
O	short

O	a

O	a
O	trick

C	harry

O	out
O	with

O	the

O	was
O	brewed
O	in
O	a
O	jug
O	and

O	quite
O	as

O	as
O	usual
O	the

O	lively
O	there

O	tired
O	of

O	and

O	by

O	and
O	when
O	furmety
O	somewhat

O	upon

O	must
O	be
O	admitted
O	to
O	boast
O	more
O	sentiment
O	than

O	as
O	a
O	christmas
O	dish
O	the

O	candles
O	were
O	blown
O	out
O	and
O	both

O	were

O	by

O	pleasures
O	of
O	then
O	as
O	the

O	warmed
O	his

O	at
O	the

O	log
O	a
O	grim
O	smile

O	the

O	hither

O	the

O	as

O	away
O	the

O	taste
O	of
O	the

C	mr

O	cried
O	that
O	they
O	were
O	spoiling
O	the

C	mrs
C	skratdj
O	complained
O	that

C	mrs

O	on
O	the

C	mr

O	that

O	dress
O	when

O	intention
O	of
O	keeping
O	it
O	for
O	the
O	next
O	year
O	the
C	children
O	disputed
O	as
O	to
O	the

O	and
O	the
O	amount
O	of

O	due
O	to
O	each
C	snap
O	barked
O	furiously
O	at
O	the

O	and
O	the

O	hustled
O	each
O	other
O	for
O	good
O	places
O	in
O	the
O	doorway
O	and
O	would
O	not

O	the

O	at
O	all
O	but

O	at
O	it
O	at
O	it
O	chuckled
O	the
C	gentleman
O	in
O	undertones
O	and
O	when
O	he
O	said
O	this
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	the
O	voices
O	of
C	mr
C	skratdj
O	and
C	mrs
C	skratdj
O	rose
O	higher
O	in
O	matrimonial
O	repartee
O	and
O	the
O	children
O	s
O	squabbles
O	became
O	louder
O	and
O	the
O	dog
O	yelped
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	were
O	mad
O	and
O	the
O	maids
O	contest
O	was
O	sharper
O	whilst
O	the
O	flames
O	leaped
O	up
O	and
O	up
O	and
O	blue
O	fire
O	flew
O	about
O	the
O	room
O	like
O	foam
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	raisins
O	were
O	finished
O	the
O	flames
O	were
O	all
O	put
O	out
O	and
O	the

O	withdrew
O	to
O	the
O	only
C	harry
O	lingered
O	come
O	along
C	harry
O	said
O	the
C	gentleman
O	wait
O	a
O	minute
O	said
C	harry
O	you
O	had
O	better
O	come
O	said
O	the
C	gentleman
O	why
O	said
C	harry
O	there
O	s
O	nothing
O	to
O	stop
O	for
O	the
O	raisins
O	are
O	eaten
O	the
O	brandy
O	is
O	burnt
O	out
O	no
O	it
O	s
O	not
O	said
C	harry
O	well
O	almost
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	better
O	if
O	it
O	were
O	quite
O	out
O	now
O	come
O	it
O	s
O	dangerous
O	for
O	a
O	boy
O	like
O	you
O	to
O	be
O	alone
O	with
O	the
O	tonight
O	fiddlesticks
O	said
C	harry
O	go
O	your
O	own
O	way
O	then
O	said
O	the
C	gentleman
O	and
O	he
O	bounced
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	and
C	harry
O	was
O	left
O	alone
O	he
O	crept
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	table
O	where
O	one
O	little
O	pale
O	blue
O	flame
O	flickered
O	in
O	the
O	dish
O	what
O	a
O	pity
O	it
O	should
O	go
O	out
O	said
C	harry
O	at
O	this
O	moment
O	the
O	brandy
O	bottle
O	on
O	the
O	sideboard
O	caught
O	his
O	eye
O	just
O	a
O	little
O	more
O	murmured
C	harry
O	to
O	himself
O	and
O	he
O	uncorked
O	the
O	bottle
O	and
O	poured
O	a
O	little
O	brandy
O	on
O	to
O	the
O	flame
O	now
O	of
O	course
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	the
O	brandy
O	touched
O	the
O	fire
O	all
O	the
O	brandy
O	in
O	the
O	bottle
O	blazed
O	up
O	at
O	once
O	and
O	the
O	bottle
O	split
O	to
O	pieces
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	fortunate
O	for
C	harry
O	that
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	get
O	seriously
O	hurt
O	a
O	little
O	of
O	the
O	hot
O	brandy
O	did
O	get
O	into
O	his
O	eyes
O	and
O	made
O	them
O	smart
O	so
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	to
O	shut
O	them
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	seconds
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	opened
O	them
O	again
O	what
O	a
O	sight
O	he
O	saw
O	all
O	over
O	the
O	room
O	the
O	blue
O	flames
O	leaped
O	and
O	danced
O	as
O	they
O	had
O	leaped
O	and
O	danced
O	in
O	the
O	with
O	the
O	raisins
O	and
C	harry
O	saw
O	that
O	each
O	successive
O	flame
O	was
O	the
O	fold
O	in
O	the
O	long
O	body
O	of
O	a
C	dragon
O	which
O	moved
O	like
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	a
O	snake
O	and
O	the
O	room
O	was
O	full
O	of
O	these
O	dragons
O	in
O	the
O	face
O	they
O	were
O	like
O	the
O	dragons
O	one
O	sees
O	made
O	of
O	very
O	old
O	blue
O	and
O	white
O	china
O	and
O	they
O	had
O	forked
O	tongues
O	like
O	the
O	tongues
O	of
O	serpents
O	they
O	were
O	most
O	beautiful
O	in
O	color
O	being
O	lobsters
O	who
O	have
O	just
O	changed
O	their
O	coats
O	are
O	very
O	handsome
O	but
O	the
O	violet
O	and
O	indigo
O	of
O	a
O	lobster
O	s
O	coat
O	is
O	nothing
O	to
O	the
O	brilliant
O	of
O	a
O	how
O	they
O	leaped
O	about
O	they
O	were
O	forever
O	leaping
O	over
O	each
O	other
O	like
O	seals
O	at
O	play
O	but
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	play
O	at
O	all
O	with
O	them
O	it
O	was
O	of
O	a
O	very
O	rough
O	kind
O	for
O	as
O	they
O	jumped
O	they
O	snapped
O	and
O	barked
O	at
O	each
O	other
O	and
O	their
O	barking
O	was
O	like
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	barking
O	gnu
O	in
O	the
O	zoological
O	gardens
O	and
O	from
O	time
O	to
O	time
O	they
O	tore
O	the
O	hair
O	out
O	of
O	each
O	other
O	s
O	heads
O	with
O	their
O	claws
O	and
O	scattered
O	it
O	about
O	the
O	floor
O	and
O	as
O	it
O	dropped
O	it
O	was
O	like
O	the
O	flecks
O	of
O	flame
O	people
O	shake
O	from
O	their
O	fingers
O	when
O	they

O	aghast
O	what
O	fun

O	a
O	voice
O	close
O	by

O	and
O	he
O	saw

O	lying
O	near
O	and
O	not

O	the

O	do
O	before

O	strike
O	as

O	oh
O	go
O	screamed
C	harry
O	in
O	despair
O	the
O	blue
C	dragon
O	leaped
O	up
O	and
O	took
O	such
O	a
O	clawful
O	of
O	hair
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	boy
O	s
O	head
O	that

O	too
O	but
O	that
O	leap

O	of
O	twelve

O	but

O	from
O	a
O	fragment
O	of
O	the

O	brandy
O	bottle
O	the

C	harry
O	was
O	cured
O	of
O	snapping
O	he
O	had
O	had
O	quite
O	enough
O	of

O	snapping
O	like

O	kinds
O	of
O	quarrelling
O	requires

O	to

C	leander
O	because

O	him
O	for

C	furibon
O	understood

O	and
O	accordingly

O	and
C	leander
O	when
O	he
O	heard
O	the
O	horns
O	and
O	the

O	so
O	unexpectedly
O	he
O	alighted
O	immediately
O	and

O	follow
O	him
O	all
O	of
O	a
O	sudden
O	he
O	turned
O	his

O	making
O	a
O	sign
O	to
O	the

O	to
O	take
O	the

O	a
O	lion
O	of

O	fallen
O	in

O	they
O	accordingly
O	surrounded
C	leander
O	who
O	setting

O	back
O	to
O	a
O	tree
O	behaved
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	bravery
O	that

C	furibon
O	believing
O	him
O	by

O	rode
O	eagerly
O	up
O	to

O	that
O	these

O	but
O	retired
O	sad
O	and
O	pensive
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	home
O	where
O	he
O	spent
O	the

O	for

O	to

O	carried

C	leander
O	would

O	gave

O	showed
O	so
O	much
O	courage

C	furibon
O	being
O	impatient
O	to
O	know
O	what

O	followed

O	at

O	laid
O	his
O	ear
O	to
O	the
O	keyhole
O	putting
O	his
O	hair
O	aside
O	that
O	he

O	the

O	hear
O	what

O	at
O	the

C	leander
O	entered
O	the

O	with

O	ear
O	from
O	his

O	half
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	wits
O	she
O	set
O	him
O	in
O	her
O	lap
O	took
O	up
O	his
O	ear
O	kissed
O	it
O	and
O	clapped
O	it
O	again
O	upon
O	its
O	place
O	but
O	the

C	leander
O	seizing
O	upon
O	a
O	handful
O	of
O	twigs
O	with
O	which
O	they
O	corrected
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	little
O	dogs
O	gave
O	the
C	queen
O	several
O	lashes
O	upon
O	her
O	hands
O	and
O	her
O	son
O	as
O	many
O	on
O	the
O	nose
O	upon
O	which
O	the
C	queen
O	cried
O	out
O	murder
O	murder
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	looked
O	about
O	and
O	the
O	people
O	came
O	running
O	in
O	but
O	nothing
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	seen
O	some
O	cried
O	that
O	the
C	queen
O	was
O	mad
O	and
O	that
O	her
O	madness
O	proceeded
O	from
O	her
O	grief
O	to
O	see
O	that
O	her
O	son
O	had
O	lost
O	one
O	ear
O	and
O	the
C	king
O	was
O	as
O	ready
O	as
O	any
O	to
O	believe
O	it
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	near
O	him
O	he
O	avoided
O	her
O	which
O	made
O	a
O	very
O	ridiculous
O	scene
C	leander
O	then
O	leaving
O	the
O	chamber
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	garden
O	and
O	there
O	assuming
O	his
O	own
O	shape
O	he
O	boldly
O	began
O	to
O	pluck
O	the
O	queen
O	s
O	cherries
O	apricots
O	strawberries
O	and
O	flowers
O	though
O	he
O	knew
O	she
O	set
O	such
O	a
O	high
O	value
O	on
O	them
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	a
O	man
O	s
O	life
O	was
O	worth
O	to
O	touch
O	one
O	the
O	gardeners
O	all
O	amazed
O	came
O	and
O	told
O	their
O	majesties
O	that
C	prince
C	leander
O	was
O	making
O	havoc
O	of
O	all
O	the
O	fruits
O	and
O	flowers
O	in
O	the
O	queen
O	s
O	garden
O	what
O	insolence
O	said
O	the

O	then
O	turning

O	my
O	pretty
O	child
O	forget

O	for
O	a

O	wretch
O	hither
O	take
O	our

O	seize
O	him
O	and
O	punish
O	him
O	as
O	he
O	deserves
C	furibon
O	encouraged
O	by
O	his
O	mother
O	and
O	attended
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	armed
O	soldiers
O	entered
O	the
O	garden
O	and
O	saw
C	leander
O	who
O	taking
O	refuge
O	under
O	a
O	tree
O	pelted
O	them
O	all
O	with
O	oranges
O	but
O	when
O	they
O	came
O	running
O	towards
O	him
O	thinking
O	to
O	have
O	seized
O	him
O	he
O	was
O	not
O	to

O	seen
O	he
O	had
O	slipped
O	behind
C	furibon
O	who
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	bad
O	condition
O	already
O	but
C	leander
O	played
O	him
O	one
O	trick
O	more
O	for
O	he
O	pushed
O	him
O	down
O	upon
O	the

O	frightened
O	him
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	soldiers
O	had
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	up
O	carry
O	him
O	away
O	and
O	put
O	him
O	to
O	bed
O	satisfied
O	with
O	this
O	revenge
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
O	servants
O	who
O	waited
O	for
O	him
O	and
O	giving
O	them
O	money
O	sent
O	them
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	castle
O	that
O	none
O	might
O	know
O	the
O	secret
O	of
O	his
O	red
O	cap
O	and
O	roses
O	as
O	yet
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	determined
O	whither
O	to
O	go
O	however
O	he
O	mounted
O	his

O	upon
O	his
O	neck
O	let
O	him
O	take
O	his
O	own
O	road
O	at
O	length
O	he
O	arrived
O	in
O	a
O	forest
O	where
O	he
O	stopped
O	to
O	shelter
O	himself
O	from
O	the
O	heat
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	been
O	above
O	a
O	minute
O	there
O	before
O	he
O	heard
O	a
O	lamentable
O	noise
O	of
O	sighing
O	and
O	sobbing
O	and
O	looking
O	about
O	him
O	beheld
O	a
O	man
O	who
O	ran
O	stopped
O	then
O	ran
O	again
O	sometimes
O	crying
O	sometimes
O	silent
O	then
O	tearing
O	his
O	hair
O	then
O	thumping
O	his
O	breast
O	like
O	some
O	unfortunate
O	madman
O	yet
O	he
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	both
O	handsome
O	and
O	young
O	his
O	garments
O	had
O	been
O	magnificent
O	but
O	he
O	had
O	torn
O	them
O	all
O	to
O	tatters
O	the
C	prince
O	moved
O	with
O	compassion
O	made
O	towards
O	him
O	and
O	mildly
O	accosted
O	him
O	sir
O	said
O	he
O	your
O	condition
O	appears
O	so
O	deplorable
O	that
O	i
O	must
O	ask
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	your
O	sorrow
O	assuring
O	you
O	of
O	every
O	assistance
O	in
O	my
O	power
O	oh

O	answered
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	nothing
O	can
O	cure
O	my
O	grief
O	this
O	day
O	my
O	dear
O	mistress
O	is
O	to
O	be
O	sacrificed
O	to
O	a
O	rich
O	old
O	ruffian
O	of
O	a

O	who
O	will
O	make
O	her
O	miserable
O	does
O	she
O	love
O	you
O	then
O	asked
C	leander
O	i
O	flatter
O	myself
O	so
O	answered
O	the
O	young
O	man
O	where
O	is
O	she
O	continued
C	leander
O	in
O	a
O	castle
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	this
O	forest
O	replied
O	the
O	lover
O	very
O	well
O	said
C	leander
O	stay
O	you
O	here
O	till
O	i
O	come
O	again
O	and
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	while
O	i
O	will
O	bring
O	you
O	good
O	news
O	he
O	then
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	little
O	red
O	cap
O	and
O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	he
O	had
O	hardly
O	got
O	thither
O	before
O	he
O	heard
O	all
O	sorts
O	of
O	music
O	he
O	entered
O	into
O	a
O	great
O	room
O	where
O	the
O	friends
O	and
O	kindred
O	of
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	and
O	the
O	young
O	lady
O	were
O	assembled
O	no
O	one
O	could
O	look
O	more
O	amiable
O	than
O	she
O	but
O	the
O	paleness
O	of
O	her
O	complexion
O	the
O	melancholy
O	that
O	appeared
O	in
O	her
O	countenance
O	and
O	the
O	tears
O	that
O	now
O	and
O	then
O	dropped
O	as
O	it
O	were
O	by

O	from
O	her
O	eyes
O	betrayed
O	the
O	trouble
O	of
O	her
O	mind
C	leander
O	now
O	became
O	invisible
O	and
O	placed
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	corner
O	of
O	the
O	room
O	he
O	soon
O	perceived
O	the
O	father
O	and
O	mother
O	of
O	the
O	bride
O	and
O	coming
O	behind
O	the
O	mother
O	s
O	chair
O	whispered
O	in
O	her
O	ear
O	if
O	you
O	marry
O	your
O	daughter
O	to
O	that
O	old
O	dotard
O	before
O	eight
O	days
O	are
O	over
O	you
O	shall
O	certainly
O	die
O	the
O	woman
O	frightened
O	to
O	hear
O	such
O	a
O	terrible
O	sentence
O	pronounced
O	upon
O	her
O	and
O	yet
O	not

O	from
O	whence
O	it
O	came
O	gave
O	a
O	loud
O	shriek
O	and
O	dropped
O	upon
O	the
O	floor
O	her
O	husband
O	asked
O	what
O	ailed
O	her
O	she
O	cried
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	dead
O	woman
O	if
O	the
O	marriage
O	of
O	her
O	daughter
O	went
O	forward
O	and
O	therefore
O	she
O	would
O	not
O	consent
O	to
O	it
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	world
O	her
O	husband
O	laughed
O	at
O	her
O	and
O	called
O	her
O	a
O	fool
O	but
O	the
O	invisible
C	leander
O	accosting
O	the
O	man
O	threatened
O	him
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	way
O	which
O	frightened
O	him
O	so
O	terribly
O	that
O	he
O	also
O	insisted
O	on
O	the
O	marriage
O	being
O	broken
O	off
O	when
O	the
O	lover
O	complained
C	leander
O	trod
O	hard
O	upon
O	his

O	able
O	any

O	away
O	he
O	limped
O	glad
O	enough
O	to

O	the

O	he
O	travelled
O	on

O	he
O	stayed
O	some

O	down
O	a

O	rose
O	very
O	early
O	and
O	looking

O	he
O	spied
O	a
O	painter
O	s
O	pallet
O	with
O	colours
O	ready
O	prepared
O	and
O	pencils
O	remembering
O	what

O	said
O	to
C	abricotina
O	touching
O	her
O	own

O	he
O	immediately

O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	most
O	excellent

O	seated
O	himself
O	before
O	a

O	picture
O	first
O	then
O	in
O	an
O	oval
O	that
O	of
O	the

O	he
O	had
O	all
O	her
O	features
O	so
O	strong
O	in
O	his
O	imagination
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	occasion
O	for
O	her
O	sitting
O	and
O	as
O	his
O	desire
O	to

O	her
O	had
O	set
O	him
O	to
O	work
O	never
O	did
O	portrait
O	bear
O	a
O	stronger
O	resemblance
O	he
O	had
O	painted
O	himself
O	upon
O	one
O	knee
O	holding
O	the

O	s
O	picture
O	in

O	a

O	in

O	when
O	the

O	cabinet
O	she
O	was
O	amazed
O	to
O	see
O	the

O	fixed
O	her

O	upon
O	it
O	with
O	so
O	much
O	the
O	more
O	surprise
O	because
O	she
O	also
O	saw
O	her
O	own
O	with
O	it
O	and
O	because
O	the
O	words
O	which
O	were
O	written
O	upon
O	the
O	label
O	afforded
O	her
O	ample
O	room
O	for
O	curiosity
O	she
O	persuaded
O	herself
O	that
O	it
O	was
O	abricotina
O	s
O	doing
O	and
O	all
O	she
O	desired
O	to

O	whether
O	the
O	portrait
O	were
O	real
O	or
O	imaginary
O	rising
O	in

O	she
O	called
C	abricotina
O	while
O	the
O	invisible
C	leander
O	with
O	his
O	little
O	red
O	cap
O	slipped
O	into
O	the
O	cabinet
O	impatient
O	to
O	know
O	what
O	passed
O	the
C	princess
O	bid
C	abricotina
O	look
O	upon
O	the
O	picture
O	and
O	tell
O	her
O	what
O	she
O	thought
O	of
O	it
O	after
O	she
O	had
O	viewed
O	it
O	i
O	protest
O	said
O	she
O	tis
O	the

O	of
O	that
O	generous
C	stranger
O	to
O	whom
O	i
O	am
O	indebted
O	for

O	yes
O	yes

O	sure
O	it

O	he
O	his
O	very

O	thou
O	pretendest

O	said
O	the

O	but
O	i
O	know
O	it
O	was
O	thou
O	thyself
O	who
O	put
O	it
O	there
O	who
O	i
O	madam
O	replied
C	abricotina
O	i
O	protest
O	i
O	never
O	saw
O	the
O	picture
O	before
O	in
O	my
O	life
O	should
O	i
O	be
O	so
O	bold
O	as
O	to
O	conceal
O	from
O	your
O	knowledge
O	a
O	thing
O	that
O	so
O	nearly
O	concerns
O	you
O	and
O	by
O	what
O	miracle
O	could
O	i
O	come
O	by
O	it
O	i
O	never
O	could

O	nor
O	did
O	any

O	ever
O	enter
O	this
O	place
O	yet
O	here
O	he
O	is
O	painted
O	with
O	you
O	some
O	spirit
O	then
O	must
O	have
O	brought
O	it
O	hither
O	cried
O	the
C	princess
O	how
O	i
O	tremble
O	for
O	fear
O	madam
O	said
C	abricotina
O	was
O	it
O	not
O	rather
O	some
O	lover
O	and
O	therefore
O	if
O	you
O	will
O	take
O	my
O	advice
O	let
O	us
O	burn
O	it
O	immediately
O	twere
O	a
O	pity
O	to
O	burn
O	it
O	cried
O	the
C	princess
O	sighing
O	a
O	finer
O	piece
O	methinks
O	cannot
O	adorn
O	my
O	cabinet
O	and
O	saying
O	these
O	words
O	she
O	cast
O	her
O	eyes
O	upon
O	it
O	but
C	abricotina
O	continued
O	obstinate
O	in
O	her
O	opinion
O	that
O	it
O	ought
O	to
O	be
O	burnt
O	as
O	a
O	thing
O	that
O	could
O	not
O	come
O	there
O	but
O	by
O	the
O	power
O	of
O	magic
O	and
O	these
O	she
O	is
O	better
O	in
O	my
O	heart
O	said
O	the
C	princess
O	must
O	we
O	burn
O	them
O	too
O	no
O	favour
O	must
O	be
O	shown
O	to
O	anything
O	said
C	abricotina
O	not
O	even
O	to
O	your
O	own
O	portrait
C	abricotina
O	ran
O	away
O	immediately
O	for
O	some
O	fire
O	while
O	the
C	princess
O	went
O	to
O	look
O	out
O	at
O	the
O	window
C	leander
O	unwilling
O	to
O	let
O	his
O	performance
O	be

O	this
O	opportunity
O	to
O	convey
O	it
O	away
O	without
O	being
O	perceived
O	he
O	had
O	hardly
O	quitted
O	the
O	cabinet
O	when
O	the
C	princess
O	turned
O	about
O	to
O	look
O	once
O	more
O	upon
O	that
O	enchanting
O	picture
O	which
O	had
O	so
O	delighted
O	her
O	but
O	how
O	was
O	she
O	surprised
O	to
O	find
O	it
O	gone
O	she
O	sought
O	for
O	it
O	all
O	the
O	room
O	over

C	abricotina
O	returning
O	was
O	no
O	less
O	surprised
O	than
O	her
O	mistress
O	so
O	that
O	this
O	last
O	adventure
O	put
O	them
O	both
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	terrible
O	fright
C	leander
O	took
O	great
O	delight
O	in
O	hearing
O	and
O	seeing
O	his

O	for
O	that
O	but
O	his
O	satisfaction
O	was
O	far
O	from
O	being
O	complete
O	seeing
O	he
O	durst
O	neither

O	one
O	day
O	she

O	to

O	great
O	pleasure
O	to

O	presently
O	i
O	have
O	my
O	desires
O	twice
O	have
O	i
O	now
O	seen
O	the
O	portrait
O	of
O	him
O	who
O	rescued
O	thee
O	from
O	the
O	ruffians
O	and
O	here
O	are
O	silks
O	of

O	that

O	these

C	leander
O	was
O	overjoyed
O	to
O	hear
O	and
O	see
O	her
O	so
O	much
O	interested
O	about
O	his
O	picture
O	and
O	calling
O	to
O	mind
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	in
O	a
O	grotto
O	which
O	she
O	often
O	frequented
O	a
O	certain
O	pedestal
O	on
O	which
O	a
O	diana
O	not
O	yet
O	finished
O	was
O	to
O	be
O	erected
O	on
O	this
O	pedestal
O	he
O	resolved
O	to
O	place
O	himself
O	crowned
O	with
O	laurel
O	and
O	holding
O	a
O	lyre
O	in
O	his
O	hand
O	on
O	which
O	he
O	played
O	like
O	another
O	apollo
O	he
O	most
O	anxiously
O	waited
O	the
C	princess
O	s
O	retiring
O	to
O	the
O	grotto
O	which
O	she
O	did
O	every
O	day
O	since
O	her
O	thoughts
O	had
O	been
O	taken
O	up
O	with
O	this

O	almost
O	destroyed
O	her
O	repose
O	her
O	lively
O	humour
O	changed
O	into
O	a
O	pensive
O	melancholy
O	and
O	she
O	grew
O	a
O	great
O	lover
O	of
O	solitude
O	when
O	she
O	entered
O	the
O	grotto
O	she
O	made
O	a
O	sign
O	that
O	nobody
O	should
O	follow
O	her
O	so
O	that
O	her
O	young
O	damsels
O	dispersed
O	themselves
O	into
O	the
O	neighbouring
O	walks
O	the
C	princess
O	threw
O	herself
O	upon
O	a
O	bank
O	of
O	green
O	turf
O	sighed
O	wept
O	and
O	even
O	talked
O	but
O	so
O	softly
O	that
C	leander
O	could
O	not
O	hear
O	what
O	she
O	said
O	he
O	had
O	put
O	his
O	red
O	cap
O	on
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	not
O	see
O	him
O	at
O	first
O	but
O	having
O	taken
O	it
O	off
O	she
O	beheld
O	him
O	standing
O	on
O	the
O	pedestal
O	at
O	first
O	she
O	took
O	him
O	for
O	a
O	real
O	statue
O	for
O	he
O	observed
O	exactly
O	the
O	attitude
O	in
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	placed
O	himself
O	without
O	moving
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	a
O	finger
O	she
O	beheld
O	with
O	a
O	kind
O	of
O	pleasure
O	intermixed
O	with
O	fear
O	but
O	pleasure
O	soon
O	dispelled
O	her
O	fear
O	and
O	she
O	continued
O	to
O	view
O	the
O	pleasing
O	figure
O	which
O	so
O	exactly
O	resembled
O	life
O	the
C	prince
O	having
O	tuned
O	his
O	lyre
O	began
O	to
O	play
O	at
O	which
O	the
C	princess
O	greatly
O	surprised
O	could
O	not
O	resist
O	the
O	fear
O	that
O	seized
O	her
O	she
O	grew
O	pale
O	and
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	swoon
C	leander
O	leaped
O	from
O	the
O	pedestal
O	and
O	putting
O	on
O	his
O	little
O	red
O	cap
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	perceived
O	took
O	the
C	princess
O	in
O	his
O	arms
O	and
O	gave
O	her
O	all
O	the
O	assistance
O	that
O	his
O	zeal
O	and
O	tenderness
O	could
O	inspire
O	at
O	length
O	she
O	opened
O	her
O	charming
O	eyes
O	and
O	looked
O	about
O	in
O	search
O	of
O	him
O	but
O	she
O	could
O	perceive
O	nobody
O	yet
O	she
O	felt
O	somebody
O	who
O	held
O	her
O	hands
O	kissed
O	them
O	and
O	bedewed
O	them
O	with
O	his
O	tears
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	long
O	time
O	before
O	she
O	durst
O	speak
O	and
O	her
O	spirits
O	were
O	in
O	a
O	confused
O	agitation
O	between
O	fear
O	and
O	hope
O	she
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	the
O	spirit
O	but
O	loved
O	the
O	figure
O	of
O	the
O	unknown
O	at
O	length
O	she
O	said
O	courtly
O	invisible
O	why
O	are
O	you
O	not
O	the
O	person
O	i
O	desire
O	you
O	should
O	be
O	at
O	these
O	words
C	leander
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	declare
O	himself
O	but
O	durst
O	not
O	do
O	it
O	yet
O	for

O	and
O	make
O	her
O	fear
O	me
O	she
O	will
O	not

O	me
O	this
O	consideration
O	caused
O	him
O	to
O	keep
O	silence
O	the
C	princess
O	then
O	believing
O	herself
O	alone
O	called
C	abricotina
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	all
O	the
O	wonders
O	of
O	the
O	animated
O	statue
O	that
O	it
O	had
O	played
O	divinely
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	invisible
O	person
O	had
O	greatly
O	assisted
O	her
O	when
O	she
O	lay
O	in
O	a
O	swoon
O	what
O	pity
O	tis
O	said
O	she
O	that
O	this
O	person
O	should
O	be
O	so
O	frightful
O	for
O	nothing
O	can
O	be
O	more
O	amiable
O	or
O	acceptable
O	than
O	his
O	behaviour
O	who
O	told
O	you
O	madam
O	answered
C	abricotina
O	that
O	he
O	is
O	frightful
O	if
O	he
O	is
O	the
O	youth
O	who
O	saved
O	me
O	he
O	is
O	beautiful
O	as
O	cupid
O	himself
O	if
O	cupid
O	and
O	the
O	unknown
O	are
O	the
O	same
O	replied
O	the
C	princess
O	blushing
O	i
O	could
O	be
O	content
O	to
O	love
O	cupid
O	but
O	alas
O	how
O	far
O	am
O	i
O	from
O	such
O	a
O	happiness
O	i
O	love
O	a
O	mere
O	shadow
O	and
O	this
O	fatal
O	picture
O	joined
O	to
O	what
O	thou
O	hast
O	told
O	me
O	have
O	inspired
O	me
O	with
O	inclinations
O	so
O	contrary
O	to
O	the
O	precepts
O	which
O	i
O	received
O	from
O	my
O	mother
O	that
O	i
O	am
O	daily
O	afraid
O	of
O	being
O	punished
O	for
O	them
O	oh
O	madam
O	said
C	abricotina
O	interrupting
O	her
O	have
O	you
O	not
O	troubles
O	enough
O	already
O	why
O	should
O	you
O	anticipate
O	afflictions
O	which
O	may
O	never
O	come
O	to
O	pass
O	it
O	is
O	easy
O	to
O	imagine
O	what
O	pleasure
C	leander
O	took
O	in
O	this
O	conversation
O	in
O	the
O	meantime
O	the
O	little
C	furibon
O	still
O	enamoured
O	of
O	the
C	princess
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	never
O	seen
O	expected
O	with
O	impatience
O	the
O	return
O	of
O	the
O	four
O	servants
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	sent
O	to
O	the
O	island
O	of
O	calm
O	delights
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	at
O	last
O	came
O	back
O	and
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	given
O	the
C	prince
O	a
O	particular
O	account
O	of
O	what
O	had
O	passed
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	defended
O	by
O	amazons
O	and
O	that
O	unless
O	he
O	sent
O	a
O	very
O	powerful
O	army
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	impossible
O	to
O	get
O	into
O	it
O	the
C	king
O	his
O	father
O	was
O	dead
O	and
C	furibon
O	was
O	now
O	lord
O	of
O	all
O	disdaining
O	therefore
O	any
O	repulse
O	he
O	raised
O	an
O	army
O	of
O	four
O	hundred
O	thousand
O	men
O	and
O	put
O	himself
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	them
O	appearing
O	like
O	another
O	tom
O	thumb
O	upon
O	a
O	now
O	when
O	the
O	amazons
O	perceived
O	his
O	mighty
O	host
O	they
O	gave
O	the
C	princess
O	notice
O	of
O	it
O	who
O	immediately
O	despatched
O	away
O	her
O	trusty
C	abricotina
O	to
O	the
O	kingdom
O	of
O	the
O	fairies
O	to
O	beg
O	her
O	mother
O	s
O	instructions
O	as
O	to
O	what
O	she
O	should
O	do
O	to
O	drive
O	the
O	little
C	furibon
O	from
O	her
O	territories
O	but
C	abricotina
O	found
O	the
C	fairy
O	in
O	an
O	angry
O	humour
O	nothing
O	that
O	my
O	daughter
O	does
O	said
O	she
O	escapes
O	my
O	knowledge
O	the
C	prince
C	leander
O	is
O	now
O	in
O	her
O	palace
O	he
O	loves
O	her
O	and
O	she
O	has
O	a
O	tenderness
O	for
O	him
O	all
O	my
O	cares
O	and
O	precepts
O	have
O	not

O	able
O	to
O	guard
O	her
O	from
O	the
O	tyranny
O	of
O	love
O	and
O	she
O	is
O	now
O	under
O	its
O	fatal
O	dominion
O	but
O	it
O	is
O	the
O	decree
O	of
O	destiny
O	and
O	i
O	must
O	submit
O	therefore
C	abricotina
O	begone
O	nor
O	let
O	me
O	hear
O	a
O	word
O	more
O	of
O	a
O	daughter
O	whose
O	behaviour
O	has
O	so
O	much
O	displeased
O	me
C	abricotina
O	returned
O	with
O	these
O	ill
O	tidings
O	whereat
O	the
C	princess
O	was
O	almost
O	distracted
O	and
O	this
O	was
O	soon
O	perceived
O	by
C	leander
O	who
O	was
O	near
O	her
O	though
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	see
O	him
O	he
O	beheld
O	her
O	grief
O	with
O	the
O	greatest
O	pain
O	however
O	he
O	durst
O	not
O	then
O	open
O	his
O	lips
O	but
O	recollecting
O	that
C	furibon
O	was
O	exceedingly
O	covetous
O	he
O	thought
O	that
O	by
O	giving
O	him
O	a
O	sum
O	of
O	money
O	he
O	might
O	perhaps
O	prevail
O	with
O	him
O	to
O	retire
O	thereupon
O	he
O	dressed
O	himself
O	like
O	an
O	amazon
O	and
O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	forest
O	to
O	catch
O	his
O	horse
O	he
O	had
O	no
O	sooner
O	called
O	him
O	than
O	came
O	leaping
O	prancing
O	and
O	neighing
O	for
O	joy
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	grown
O	quite
O	weary
O	of
O	being
O	so
O	long
O	absent
O	from
O	his
O	dear
O	master
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	beheld
O	him
O	dressed
O	as
O	a
O	woman
O	he
O	hardly
O	knew
O	him
O	however
O	at
O	the
O	sound
O	of
O	his
O	voice
O	he
O	suffered
O	the
C	prince
O	to
O	mount
O	and
O	they
O	soon
O	arrived
O	in
O	the
O	camp
O	of
C	furibon
O	where
O	they
O	gave
O	notice
O	that
O	a
O	lady
O	was
O	come
O	to
O	speak
O	with
O	him
O	from
O	the
C	princess
O	of
O	calm
O	delights
O	immediately
O	the
O	little
O	fellow
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	royal
O	robes
O	and
O	having
O	placed
O	himself
O	upon
O	his
O	throne
O	he
O	looked
O	like
O	a
O	great
O	toad
O	counterfeiting
O	a
C	king
C	leander
O	harangued
O	him
O	and
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	the
C	princess
O	preferring
O	a
O	quiet
O	and
O	peaceable
O	life
O	to
O	the
O	fatigues
O	of
O	war
O	had
O	sent
O	to
O	offer
O	his
O	majesty
O	as
O	much
O	money
O	as
O	he
O	pleased
O	to
O	demand
O	provided
O	he
O	would
O	suffer
O	her
O	to
O	continue
O	in
O	peace
O	but
O	if
O	he
O	refused
O	her
O	proposal
O	she
O	would
O	omit
O	no
O	means
O	that
O	might
O	serve
O	for
O	her
O	defence
C	furibon
O	replied
O	that
O	he
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	her
O	and
O	would
O	grant
O	her
O	the
O	honour
O	of
O	his
O	protection
O	but
O	that
O	he
O	demanded
O	a
O	hundred
O	thousand
O	thousand
O	millions
O	of
O	pounds
O	and
O	without
O	which
O	he
O	would
O	not
O	return
O	to
O	his
O	kingdom
C	leander
O	answered
O	that
O	such
O	a
O	vast
O	sum
O	would
O	be
O	too
O	long
O	and
O	therefore
O	if
O	he
O	would
O	say
O	how
O	many
O	rooms
O	full
O	he
O	desired
O	to
O	have
O	the
C	princess
O	was
O	generous
O	and
O	rich
O	enough
O	to
O	satisfy
O	him
C	furibon
O	was
O	astonished
O	to
O	hear
O	that
O	instead
O	of
O	entreating
O	she
O	would
O	rather
O	offer
O	more
O	and
O	it
O	came
O	into
O	his
O	wicked
O	mind
O	to
O	take
O	all
O	the
O	money
O	he

O	that
O	she
O	might
O	never

O	mistress
O	he
O	told
C	leander
O	therefore
O	that
O	he
O	would
O	have
O	thirty
O	chambers
O	of
O	gold
O	all
O	full
O	to
O	the

C	leander
O	being
O	conducted
O	into
O	the
O	chambers
O	took
O	his
O	rose
O	and
O	shook
O	it
O	till
O	every

O	was
O	filled
O	with
O	all

O	in
O	an

O	and
O	the

O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	greater
O	was
O	his
O	desire
O	to
O	get
O	hold
O	of
O	the
O	amazon
O	so
O	that
O	when
O	all
O	the
O	rooms
O	were
O	full
O	he
O	commanded
O	his
O	guards
O	to
O	seize
O	her
O	alleging
O	she
O	had
O	brought
O	him
O	counterfeit
O	money
O	immediately
C	leander
O	put
O	on
O	his
O	little
O	red
O	cap
O	and
O	disappeared
O	the
O	guards
O	believing
O	that
O	the
O	lady
O	had
O	escaped
O	ran
O	out
O	and
O	left
C	furibon
O	alone
O	when
C	leander
O	availing
O	himself
O	of
O	the
O	opportunity
O	took
O	the
O	tyrant
O	by
O	the
O	hair
O	and
O	twisted
O	his
O	head
O	off
O	with
O	the
O	same
O	ease
O	he
O	would
O	a
O	pullet

O	that

O	him
C	leander
O	having
O	got
O	his

O	wished
O	himself
O	in
O	the
O	palace
O	of
O	calm
O	delights
O	where
O	he
O	found
O	the
C	princess
O	walking
O	and
O	with
O	grief
O	considering
O	the
O	message
O	which
O	her

O	had
O	sent
O	her
O	and
O	on
O	the

O	to
O	repel
C	furibon
O	suddenly
O	she
O	beheld
O	a
O	head
O	hanging
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	with
O	nobody
O	to
O	hold
O	it
O	this
O	prodigy
O	astonished
O	her
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	not
O	tell
O	what
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	but
O	her
O	amazement
O	was
O	increased
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	head
O	laid
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	and
O	heard
O	a
O	voice
O	utter
O	these

O	your

O	of

O	whose
O	head
O	see
O	here
C	abricotina
O	knowing
C	leander
O	s
O	voice
O	cried
O	i
O	protest
O	madam
O	the

O	the

O	the

O	seemed
O	astonished
O	but
O	yet
O	pleased
O	oh
O	said
O	she
O	if
O	it
O	be
O	true
O	that
O	the
O	invisible
O	and
O	the
C	stranger
O	are
O	the
O	same
O	person
O	i
O	confess
O	i
O	shall
O	be
O	glad
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	my
O	acknowledgments
C	leander
O	still

O	replied
O	i
O	will
O	yet
O	do
O	more
O	to
O	deserve
O	them
O	and
O	so
O	saying
O	he
O	returned
O	to
C	furibon
O	s
O	army
O	where
O	the
O	report
O	of
O	the
O	king
O	s
O	death
O	was
O	already
O	spread
O	throughout
O	the
O	camp
O	as
O	soon
O	as
C	leander
O	appeared
O	there
O	in
O	his
O	usual
O	habit
O	everybody
O	knew
O	him
O	all
O	the
O	officers
O	and
O	soldiers
O	surrounded
O	him
O	uttering
O	the
O	loudest
O	acclamations
O	of
O	joy
O	in
O	short
O	they
O	acknowledged
O	him
O	for
O	their
C	king
O	and
O	that
O	the
O	crown
O	of
O	right
O	belonged
O	to
O	him
O	for
O	which
O	he
O	thanked
O	them
O	and
O	as
O	the
O	first
O	mark
O	of
O	his
O	royal
O	bounty
O	divided
O	the
O	thirty
O	rooms
O	of

O	among
O	the

O	this
O	done
O	he
O	returned
O	to
O	his
C	princess
O	ordering
O	the

O	to

O	back
O	into
O	his

O	the
C	princess
O	was
O	gone
O	to
O	bed
C	leander
O	therefore
O	retired
O	into
O	his
O	own
O	apartment
O	for
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	sleepy
O	so
O	sleepy
O	that
O	he
O	forgot
O	to
O	bolt
O	his
O	door
O	and
O	so
O	it
O	happened
O	that
O	the
C	princess
O	rising
O	early
O	to
O	taste
O	the
O	morning
O	air
O	chanced
O	to
O	enter
O	into
O	this
O	very
O	chamber
O	and
O	was
O	greatly
O	astonished
O	to
O	find
O	a
O	young
C	prince
O	asleep
O	upon
O	the
O	bed
O	she
O	took
O	a
O	full
O	view
O	of
O	him
O	and
O	was
O	convinced
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	the
O	person
O	whose
O	picture
O	she
O	had
O	in
O	her
O	diamond
O	box
O	it
O	is
O	impossible
O	said
O	she
O	that
O	this
O	should
O	be
O	a
O	spirit
O	for
O	can
O	spirits

O	is
O	this
O	a
O	body
O	composed
O	of
O	air
O	and
O	fire
O	without
O	substance
O	as
C	abricotina
O	told
O	me
O	she
O	softly
O	touched
O	his
O	hair
O	and
O	heard
O	him
O	breathe
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	him
O	as
O	if
O	she
O	could
O	have
O	looked
O	for
O	ever
O	while
O	she
O	was
O	thus
O	occupied
O	her
O	mother
O	the
C	fairy
O	entered
O	with
O	such
O	a
O	dreadful
O	noise
O	that
C	leander
O	started
O	out
O	of
O	his
O	sleep
O	but
O	how
O	deeply
O	was
O	he
O	afflicted
O	to
O	behold
O	his
O	beloved
C	princess
O	in
O	the
O	most
O	deplorable
O	condition
O	her
O	mother
O	dragged
O	her
O	by
O	the
O	hair
O	and
O	loaded
O	her
O	with
O	a
O	thousand
O	bitter
O	reproaches
O	in
O	what
O	grief
O	and
O	consternation
O	were
O	the
O	two
O	young
O	lovers
O	who
O	saw
O	themselves
O	now
O	upon
O	the
O	point
O	of
O	being
O	separated
O	for
O	ever
O	the
C	princess
O	durst
O	not
O	open
O	her
O	lips
O	but
O	cast
O	her
O	eyes
O	upon
C	leander
O	as
O	if
O	to
O	beg
O	his
O	assistance
O	he
O	judged
O	rightly
O	that
O	he
O	ought
O	not
O	to
O	deal
O	rudely
O	with
O	a
O	power
O	superior
O	to
O	his
O	own
O	and
O	therefore
O	he
O	sought
O	by
O	his
O	eloquence
O	and
O	submission
O	to
O	move
O	the
O	incensed
C	fairy
O	he
O	ran
O	to
O	her
O	threw
O	himself
O	at
O	her
O	feet
O	and
O	besought
O	her
O	to
O	have
O	pity
O	upon
O	a
O	young
C	prince
O	who
O	would
O	never
O	change
O	in
O	his
O	affection
O	for
O	her
O	daughter
O	the
C	princess
O	encouraged
O	also
O	embraced
O	her
O	mother
O	s
O	knees
O	and
O	declared
O	that
O	without
C	leander
O	she
O	should
O	never
O	be
O	happy
O	happy

O	the
O	man
O	who
O	knowing
C	jack
O	s
O	easy
O	temper
O	thought
O	now
O	was
O	the
O	time
O	to
O	take
O	an
O	advantage
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	determined
O	not
O	to
O	let
O	slip
O	so
O	good
O	an
O	opportunity
O	asked
O	what
O	was
O	the
O	price
O	of
O	the
O	cow
O	offering
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	all
O	the
O	beans
O	in
O	his
O	hat
O	for

O	the
O	silly
O	boy
O	could
O	not
O	conceal
O	the
O	pleasure
O	he
O	felt
O	at
O	what
O	he
O	supposed
O	so
O	great
O	an
O	offer
O	the
O	bargain
O	was
O	struck
O	instantly
O	and
O	the
O	cow
O	exchanged
O	for
O	a
O	few
O	paltry
O	beans
C	jack
O	made
O	the
O	best
O	of
O	his
O	way
O	home
O	calling
O	aloud
O	to
O	his
C	mother
O	before
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	door
O	thinking
O	to
O	surprise
O	her
O	when
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	beans
O	and
O	heard
C	jack
O	s
O	account
O	her
O	patience
O	quite
O	forsook
O	her
O	she
O	tossed
O	the
O	beans
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	window
O	where
O	they
O	fell
O	on
O	the
O	below
O	then
O	she
O	threw
O	her
O	apron
O	over
O	her
O	head
O	and
O	cried
O	bitterly
C	jack
O	attempted
O	to
O	console
O	her
O	but
O	in
O	vain
O	and
O	not
O	having
O	anything
O	to
O	eat
O	they
O	both
O	went
O	supperless
O	to
O	bed
C	jack
O	awoke
O	early
O	in
O	the
O	morning
O	and
O	seeing
O	something
O	uncommon
O	darkening
O	the
O	window
O	of
O	his
O	bedchamber
O	ran
O	downstairs
O	into
O	the
O	garden
O	where
O	he
O	found
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	beans
O	had
O	taken
O	root
O	and
O	sprung
O	up
O	surprisingly
O	the
O	stalks
O	were
O	of
O	an
O	immense
O	thickness
O	and
O	had
O	twined
O	together
O	until
O	they
O	formed
O	a
O	ladder
O	like
O	a
O	chain
O	and
O	so
O	high
O	that
O	the
O	top
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	lost
O	in
O	the
O	clouds
C	jack
O	was
O	an
O	adventurous
O	lad
O	he
O	determined
O	to
O	climb
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	top
O	and
O	ran
O	to
O	tell
O	his
C	mother
O	not
O	doubting
O	but
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	be
O	equally
O	pleased
O	with
O	himself
O	she
O	declared
O	he
O	should
O	not
O	go
O	said
O	it
O	would
O	break
O	her
O	heart
O	if
O	he
O	did
O	entreated
O	and
O	threatened
O	but
O	all
O	in
O	vain
C	jack
O	set
O	out
O	and
O	after
O	climbing
O	for
O	some
O	hours
O	reached
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	quite
O	exhausted
O	looking
O	around
O	he
O	found
O	himself
O	in
O	a
O	strange
O	country
O	it
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	barren
O	desert
O	not
O	a
O	tree
O	shrub
O	house
O	or

O	and
O	there
O	were

O	fragments
O	of
O	stone
O	and
O	at
O	unequal
O	distances
O	small
O	heaps
O	of
O	earth
O	were
O	loosely
O	thrown
O	together
C	jack
O	seated
O	himself
O	pensively
O	upon
O	a
O	block
O	of
O	stone
O	and
O	thought
O	of
O	his
C	mother
O	he
O	reflected
O	with
O	sorrow
O	upon
O	his
O	disobedience
O	in
O	climbing
O	the
O	against
O	her
O	will
O	and
O	concluded
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	die
O	of
O	hunger
O	however
O	he
O	walked
O	on
O	hoping
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	house
O	where
O	he
O	might
O	beg
O	something
O	to
O	eat
O	and
O	drink
O	he
O	did
O	not
O	find
O	it
O	but
O	he
O	saw
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	a
O	beautiful
O	lady
O	walking
O	all
O	alone
O	she
O	was
O	elegantly
O	clad
O	and
O	carried
O	a
O	white
O	wand
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	which
O	sat
O	a
O	peacock
O	of
O	pure
O	gold
C	jack
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	gallant
O	fellow
O	went
O	straight
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	when
O	with
O	a
O	bewitching
O	smile
O	she
O	asked
O	him
O	how
O	he
O	came
O	there
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	all
O	about
O	the
O	the
O	lady
O	answered
O	him
O	by
O	a
O	question
O	do
O	you
O	remember
O	your
C	father
O	young
O	man
O	no
O	madam
O	but
O	i
O	am
O	sure
O	there
O	is
O	some
O	mystery
O	about
O	him
O	for
O	when
O	i
O	name
O	him
O	to
O	my
C	mother
O	she
O	always
O	begins
O	to
O	weep
O	and
O	will
O	tell
O	me
O	nothing
O	she
O	dare
O	not
O	replied
O	the
O	lady
O	but
O	i
O	can
O	and
O	will
O	for

O	man
O	that
O	i
O	am
O	a
C	fairy
O	and
O	was
O	your
C	father
O	s
O	guardian
O	but
O	fairies
O	are
O	bound
O	by
O	laws
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	mortals
O	and
O	by
O	an
O	error
O	of
O	mine
O	i
O	lost
O	my
O	power
O	for
O	a
O	term
O	of

O	so
O	that
O	i
O	was
O	unable
O	to

O	your

O	when
O	he
O	most
O	needed
O	it
O	and
O	he
O	died
O	here
O	the
C	fairy
O	looked
O	so
O	sorrowful
O	that
C	jack
O	s
O	heart
O	warmed
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	he
O	begged
O	her
O	earnestly
O	to
O	tell
O	him
O	more
O	i
O	will
O	only
O	you
O	must

O	to
O	obey
O	me
O	in
O	everything
O	or
O	you
O	will
O	perish
O	yourself
C	jack
O	was
O	brave
O	and
O	besides
O	his
O	fortunes
O	were
O	so
O	bad
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	well
O	be
O	worse
O	so
O	he
O	promised
O	the

O	a
O	most
O	excellent

O	generous
O	man
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	good
C	wife
O	faithful
O	servants
O	plenty
O	of

O	but
O	he
O	had
O	one
O	misfortune
O	a
O	false
O	friend
O	this
O	was
O	a
C	giant
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	succoured
O	in
O	misfortune
O	and
O	who
O	returned
O	his
O	kindness
O	by
O	murdering
O	him
O	and
O	seizing
O	on
O	all
O	his
O	property
O	also
O	making
O	your
C	mother
O	take
O	a
O	solemn
O	oath

O	till
O	you
O	see
O	the

O	you
O	must
O	then

O	a

O	and
O	vanished
C	jack
O	pursued
O	his
O	journey
O	he
O	walked
O	on
O	till
O	after
O	sunset
O	when
O	to
O	his
O	great
O	joy
O	he
O	espied
O	a
O	large
O	mansion
O	a
O	woman
O	was
O	at
O	the

O	he
O	accosted

O	begging
O	she
O	would
O	give

O	a
O	morsel
O	of
O	bread
O	and
O	a
O	night
O	s
O	lodging
O	she
O	expressed
O	the
O	greatest
O	surprise
O	and
O	said
O	it
O	was
O	quite
O	uncommon
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	human
O	being
O	near
O	their
O	house
O	for
O	it
O	was
O	well
O	known
O	that
O	her
O	husband
O	was
O	a
O	powerful
C	giant
O	who
O	would
O	never
O	eat
O	anything
O	but
O	human
O	flesh
O	if
O	he
O	could
O	possibly
O	get
O	it
O	that

O	would

O	greatly
O	terrified
C	jack
O	but
O	still
O	he
O	hoped
O	to
O	elude
O	the
C	giant
O	and
O	therefore
O	he
O	again
O	entreated
O	the
O	woman
O	to
O	take
O	him
O	in
O	for
O	one
O	night
O	only
O	and
O	hide
O	him
O	where
O	she
O	thought
O	proper
O	she
O	at
O	last
O	suffered
O	herself
O	to
O	be
O	persuaded
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	of
O	a
O	compassionate
O	and
O	generous
O	disposition
O	and
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	first
O	they
O	entered
O	a
O	fine
O	large
O	hall
O	magnificently
O	furnished
O	they
O	then
O	passed
O	through
O	several
O	spacious
O	rooms
O	in
O	the
O	same
O	style
O	of
O	grandeur
O	but
O	all
O	appeared
O	forsaken
O	and
O	desolate
O	a
O	long
O	gallery
O	came
O	next
O	it
O	was
O	very
O	dark
O	just
O	light
O	enough
O	to
O	show
O	that
O	instead
O	of
O	a
O	wall
O	on
O	one
O	side
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	grating
O	of
O	iron
O	which
O	parted
O	off
O	a
O	dismal
O	dungeon
O	from
O	whence
O	issued
O	the
O	groans
O	of
O	those
O	victims
O	whom
O	the
O	cruel
C	giant
O	reserved
O	in
O	confinement
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	voracious
O	appetite
O	poor
C	jack
O	was
O	half
O	dead
O	with
O	fear
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	given
O	the
O	world
O	to
O	have
O	been
O	with
O	his
C	mother
O	again
O	for
O	he
O	now
O	began
O	to
O	doubt
O	if
O	he
O	should
O	ever
O	see
O	her
O	more
O	he
O	even
O	mistrusted
O	the
O	good
O	woman
O	and
O	thought
O	she
O	had
O	let
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	house
O	for
O	no
O	other
O	purpose
O	than
O	to
O	lock
O	him
O	up
O	among
O	the
O	unfortunate
O	people
O	in
O	the
O	dungeon

O	sit
O	down

O	plenty

O	not

O	to
O	make
O	him
O	uncomfortable
O	soon
O	forgot
O	his
O	fear
O	and
O	was
O	just
O	beginning
O	to
O	enjoy
O	himself
O	when
O	he
O	was
O	startled
O	by
O	a
O	loud
O	knocking
O	at
O	the

O	the

O	and
O	if

O	will
O	kill
O	you
O	and
O	me
O	too

O	the

O	had
O	told
O	his

O	but
O	had
O	been
O	very
O	careful
O	not
O	to
O	say
O	a
O	word
O	about
O	his
C	father
O	he
O	thought
O	of
O	his
O	journey
O	again
O	and
O	again
O	but
O	still
O	he
O	could
O	not
O	summon
O	resolution
O	enough
O	to
O	break
O	it
O	to
O	his
C	mother
O	being
O	well
O	assured
O	that

O	endeavour
O	to
O	prevent

O	going
O	however
O	one
O	day
O	he
O	told
O	her
O	boldly
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	take
O	another
O	journey
O	up
O	the
O	she
O	begged
O	and
O	prayed
O	him
O	not
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	it
O	and
O	tried
O	all
O	in
O	her
O	power
O	to
O	dissuade
O	him
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	that
O	the
C	giant
O	s
C	wife
O	would
O	certainly
O	know
O	him
O	again
O	and
O	that

O	would
O	desire
O	nothing
O	better
O	than
O	to
O	get
O	him
O	into
O	his
O	power
O	that
O	he
O	might
O	put
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	cruel
O	death
O	in

O	to
O	be
O	revenged
O	for
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	hen
C	jack
O	finding
O	that
O	all
O	his
O	arguments
O	were
O	useless
O	ceased
O	speaking
O	though
O	resolved
O	to
O	go
O	at
O	all
O	events
O	he
O	had
O	a
O	dress
O	prepared
O	which
O	would
O	disguise
O	him
O	and
O	something
O	to
O	colour
O	his
O	skin
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	impossible
O	for
O	any
O	one
O	to
O	recollect
O	him
O	in
O	this
O	dress
O	a
O	few
O	mornings
O	after
O	he
O	rose
O	very
O	early
O	and
O	unperceived
O	by
O	any
O	one
O	climbed
O	the
O	a
O	second
O	time
O	he
O	was
O	greatly
O	fatigued
O	when
O	he
O	reached
O	the
O	top
O	and
O	very
O	hungry
O	having
O	rested
O	some
O	time
O	on
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	stones
O	he
O	pursued
O	his
O	journey
O	to
O	the
C	giant
O	s
O	mansion
O	which
O	he
O	reached
O	late
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	the
O	woman
O	was
O	at
O	the
O	door
O	as
O	before
C	jack
O	addressed
O	her
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	telling
O	her
O	a
O	pitiful
O	tale
O	and
O	requesting
O	that
O	she
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	some
O	victuals
O	and
O	drink
O	and
O	also
O	a
O	night
O	s
O	lodging
O	she
O	told
O	him
O	what
O	he
O	knew
O	before
O	very
O	well
O	about
O	her
O	husband
O	s
O	being
O	a
O	powerful
O	and
O	cruel
C	giant
O	and
O	also
O	that
O	she
O	had
O	one
O	night
O	admitted
O	a
O	poor
O	hungry
O	friendless
O	boy
O	that
O	the
O	little
O	ungrateful
O	fellow
O	had
O	stolen
O	one
O	of
O	the
C	giant
O	s
O	treasures
O	and
O	ever
O	since
O	that
O	her
O	husband
O	had
O	been
O	worse
O	than
O	before
O	using
O	her
O	very
O	cruelly
O	and
O	continually
O	upbraiding
O	her
O	with
O	being
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	his
O	misfortune
C	jack
O	felt
O	sorry
O	for
O	her
O	but
O	confessed
O	nothing
O	and
O	did
O	his
O	best
O	to
O	persuade
O	her
O	to
O	admit
O	him
O	but
O	found
O	it
O	a
O	very
O	hard
O	task
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	consented
O	and
O	as
O	she
O	led
O	the
O	way
C	jack
O	observed
O	that
O	everything
O	was
O	just
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	found
O	it
O	before
O	she
O	took
O	him
O	into
O	the
O	kitchen
O	and
O	after
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	eating
O	and
O	drinking
O	she
O	hid
O	him
O	in
O	an
O	old
O	the
C	giant
O	returned
O	at
O	the
O	usual
O	time
O	and
O	walked
O	in
O	so
O	heavily
O	that
O	the
O	house
O	was
O	shaken
O	to
O	its
O	foundation
O	he
O	seated
O	himself
O	by
O	the
O	fire
O	and
O	soon
O	after
O	exclaimed
C	wife
O	i
O	smell
O	fresh
O	meat
O	the
C	wife
O	replied
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	crows
O	which
O	had
O	brought
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	raw
O	meat
O	and
O	left
O	it
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	house
O	while
O	supper
O	was
O	preparing
O	the
C	giant
O	was
O	very
O	and
O	impatient
O	frequently
O	lifting
O	up
O	his
O	hand
O	to
O	strike
O	his
C	wife
O	for
O	not
O	being
O	quick
O	enough
O	he
O	was
O	also
O	continually
O	upbraiding
O	her
O	with
O	the
O	loss
O	of
O	his
O	wonderful
O	hen
O	at
O	last
O	having
O	ended
O	his
O	supper
O	he
O	cried
O	give
O	me
O	something
O	to
O	amuse
O	me
O	my
O	harp
O	or
O	my
O	which
O	will
O	you
O	have
O	my
O	dear
O	said
O	the
C	wife
O	humbly
O	my
O	because
O	they
O	are
O	the
O	heaviest
O	to
O	carry
O	thundered
O	he
O	she
O	brought
O	them
O	staggering
O	under
O	the
O	weight
O	two
O	bags
O	one
O	filled
O	with
O	new
O	guineas
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	with
O	new
O	shillings
O	she
O	emptied
O	them
O	out
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	and
O	the
C	giant
O	began
O	counting
O	them
O	in
O	great
O	glee
O	now
O	you
O	may
O	go
O	to
O	bed
O	you
O	old
O	fool
O	so
O	the
C	wife
O	crept
O	away
C	jack
O	from
O	his
O	watched
O	the
O	counting
O	of
O	the
O	money
O	which
O	he
O	knew
O	was
O	his
O	poor
C	father

O	and
O	wished

O	was
O	his
O	own
O	it
O	would
O	give
O	him
O	much
O	less
O	trouble
O	than
O	going
O	about
O	selling
O	the
O	golden
O	eggs
O	the
C	giant
O	little
O	thinking
O	he
O	was
O	so
O	narrowly
O	observed
O	reckoned
O	it
O	all
O	up
O	and
O	then
O	replaced
O	it
O	in
O	the
O	two
O	bags
O	which
O	he
O	tied
O	up
O	very
O	carefully
O	and
O	put
O	beside
O	his
O	chair
O	with
O	his
O	little
O	dog
O	to
O	guard
O	them
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	fell
O	asleep
O	as
O	before
O	and
O	snored
O	so
O	loud
O	that
C	jack
O	compared
O	his
O	noise
O	to
O	the
O	roaring
O	of
O	the
O	sea
O	in
O	a
O	high
O	wind
O	when
O	the
O	tide
O	is
O	coming
O	in
O	at

C	jack
O	concluding
O	all
O	secure
O	stole
O	out
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	carry
O	off
O	the
O	two
O	bags
O	of
O	money
O	but
O	just
O	as
O	he
O	laid
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	the
O	little
O	dog
O	which
O	he
O	had
O	not
O	perceived
O	before
O	started
O	from
O	under
O	the
C	giant
O	s
O	chair
O	and
O	barked
O	most
O	furiously
O	instead
O	of
O	endeavouring
O	to
O	escape
C	jack
O	stood
O	still
O	though
O	expecting
O	his
O	enemy
O	to
O	awake
O	every
O	instant
O	contrary
O	however
O	to
O	his
O	expectation
O	the
C	giant
O	continued
O	in
O	a
O	sound
O	sleep
O	and
C	jack
O	seeing
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	meat
O	threw
O	it
O	to
O	the
O	dog
O	who
O	at
O	once
O	ceased
O	barking
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	devour
O	it
O	so
C	jack
O	carried
O	off
O	the
O	bags
O	one
O	on
O	each
O	shoulder
O	but
O	they
O	were
O	so
O	heavy
O	that
O	it
O	took
O	him
O	two
O	whole
O	days
O	to
O	descend
O	the
O	and
O	get
O	back
O	to
O	his
C	mother
O	s
O	door
O	when
O	he
O	came
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	cottage
O	deserted
O	he
O	ran
O	from
O	one
O	room
O	to
O	another
O	without
O	being
O	able
O	to
O	find
O	any
O	one
O	he
O	then
O	hastened
O	into
O	the
O	village
O	hoping
O	to
O	see
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	neighbours
O	who
O	could
O	inform
O	him
O	where
O	he
O	could
O	find
O	his
C	mother
O	an
O	old
O	woman
O	at
O	last
O	directed
O	him
O	to
O	a
O	neighbouring
O	house
O	where
O	she
O	was
O	ill
O	of
O	a
O	fever
O	he
O	was
O	greatly
O	shocked
O	at
O	finding
O	her
O	apparently
O	dying
O	and
O	blamed
O	himself
O	bitterly
O	as
O	the
O	cause
O	of
O	it
O	all
O	however
O	at
O	sight
O	of
O	her
O	dear
O	son
O	the
O	poor
O	woman
O	revived
O	and
O	slowly
O	recovered
O	health
C	jack
O	gave
O	her
O	his
O	two
O	they
O	had
O	the
O	cottage
O	rebuilt
O	and
O	well
O	furnished
O	and
O	lived
O	happier
O	than
O	they
O	had
O	ever
O	done
O	before
O	for
O	three
O	years
C	jack
O	heard
O	no

O	he
O	could
O	not
O	forget
O	it
O	though
O	he
O	feared
O	making
O	his
C	mother
O	unhappy
O	it
O	was
O	in
O	vain
O	endeavouring
O	to
O	amuse
O	himself
O	he
O	became
O	thoughtful
O	and
O	would
O	arise
O	at
O	the
O	first
O	dawn
O	of
O	day
O	and
O	sit
O	looking
O	at
O	the
O	for
O	hours
O	together
O	his
C	mother
O	saw
O	that
O	something
O	preyed
O	upon

O	mind
O	and
O	endeavoured
O	to
O	discover
O	the

O	knew
O	too

O	his

O	therefore
O	to

O	the
O	great
O	desire
O	he
O	had
O	for
O	another
O	journey
O	up
O	the
O	finding
O	however
O	that
O	his
O	inclination
O	grew
O	too
O	powerful
O	for
O	him
O	he
O	began
O	to
O	make
O	secret
O	preparations
O	for
O	his
O	journey
O	he
O	got
O	ready
O	a
O	new
O	disguise
O	better
O	and
O	more
O	complete
O	than
O	the
O	former
O	and
O	when
O	summer
O	came
O	on
O	the
O	longest
O	day
O	he
O	awoke
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	light
O	and
O	without
O	telling
O	his
C	mother
O	ascended
O	the
O	he
O	found
O	the
O	road
O	journey
O	much
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	two
O	former
O	times
O	he
O	arrived
O	at
O	the
C	giant
O	s
O	mansion
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	and
O	found
O	the
C	wife
O	standing
O	as
O	usual
O	at
O	the
O	door
C	jack
O	had
O	disguised
O	himself
O	so
O	completely
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	appear
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	least
O	recollection
O	of
O	him
O	however
O	when
O	he
O	pleaded
O	hunger
O	and
O	poverty
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	gain
O	admittance
O	he
O	found
O	it
O	very
O	difficult
O	indeed
O	to
O	persuade
O	her
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	prevailed
O	and
O	was
O	concealed
O	in
O	the
O	copper
O	when
O	the
C	giant
O	returned
O	he
O	said
O	furiously
O	i
O	smell
O	fresh
O	meat
O	but
C	jack
O	felt
O	quite
O	composed
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	said
O	so
O	before
O	and
O	had
O	been
O	soon
O	satisfied
O	however
O	the
C	giant
O	started
O	up
O	suddenly
O	and
O	notwithstanding
O	all
O	his
C	wife
O	could
O	say
O	he
O	searched
O	all
O	round
O	the
O	room
O	whilst
O	this
O	was
O	going
O	forward
C	jack
O	was
O	exceedingly
O	terrified
O	wishing
O	himself
O	at
O	home
O	a
O	thousand
O	times
O	but
O	when
O	the
C	giant
O	approached
O	the
O	copper
O	and
O	put
O	his
O	hand
O	upon
O	the
O	lid
C	jack
O	thought
O	his
O	death
O	was
O	certain
O	however
O	nothing
O	happened
O	for
O	the
C	giant
O	did
O	not
O	take
O	the
O	trouble
O	to
O	lift
O	up
O	the
O	lid
O	but
O	sat
O	down
O	shortly
O	by
O	the
O	fireside
O	and
O	began
O	to
O	eat
O	his
O	enormous
O	supper
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	finished
O	he
O	commanded
O	his
C	wife
O	to
O	fetch
O	down
O	his
O	harp
C	jack
O	peeped
O	under
O	the
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	most
O	beautiful
O	harp
O	the
C	giant
O	placed
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	table
O	said
O	play
O	and
O	it
O	played
O	of
O	its
O	own
O	accord
O	without
O	anybody
O	touching
O	it
O	the
O	most
O	exquisite
O	music
O	imaginable
C	jack
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	very
O	good
O	musician
O	was
O	delighted
O	and
O	more
O	anxious
O	to
O	get
O	this
O	than
O	any
O	other
O	of
O	his
O	enemy
O	s
O	treasures
O	but
O	the
C	giant
O	not
O	being
O	particularly
O	fond
O	of
O	music
O	the
O	harp
O	had
O	only
O	the
O	effect
O	of
O	lulling
O	him
O	to
O	sleep
O	earlier
O	than
O	usual
O	as
O	for
O	the
C	wife
O	she
O	had
O	gone
O	to
O	bed
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	ever
O	she
O	could
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	he
O	thought
O	all
O	was
O	safe
C	jack
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	copper
O	and
O	seizing
O	the
O	harp
O	was
O	eagerly
O	running
O	off
O	with
O	it
O	but
O	the
O	harp
O	was
O	enchanted
O	by
O	a
C	fairy
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	it
O	found
O	itself
O	in
O	strange
O	hands
O	it
O	called
O	out
O	loudly
O	just
O	as
O	if
O	it
O	had
O	been
O	alive
O	master
O	master
O	the
C	giant
O	awoke
O	started
O	up
O	and
O	saw
C	jack
O	scampering
O	away
O	as
O	fast
O	as
O	his
O	legs
O	could
O	carry
O	him
O	oh
O	you
O	villain
O	it
O	is
O	you

C	jack
O	who
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	bit
O	afraid
O	for
O	he
O	saw
O	the
C	giant
O	was
O	so
O	tipsy
O	he
O	could
O	hardly
O	stand
O	much
O	less
O	run
O	and
O	he
O	himself
O	had
O	young
O	legs
O	and
O	a
O	clear
O	conscience
O	which
O	carry
O	a
O	man
O	a
O	long
O	way
O	so
O	after
O	leading
O	the
C	giant
O	a
O	considerable
O	race
O	he
O	contrived
O	to
O	be
O	first
O	at
O	the
O	top
O	of
O	the
O	and
O	then
O	scrambled
O	down

O	could
O	the

O	playing
O	all

O	he
O	said
O	stop
O	and
O	it
O	stopped
O	arrived
O	at
O	the

O	he
O	found

O	was
O	too
O	late

O	at
O	the

O	the

O	fell
O	headlong
O	into
O	the

O	on
O	the

O	instantly
O	the

O	this

O	friend
C	jacques
C	pourbiere
O	of

O	to

O	his
O	new
O	brunswick
O	acquaintance
O	during
O	the
O	season
O	and
O	late
O	in
O	august
O	was
O	reminded
O	of
O	the
O	fact
O	a
O	second
O	letter
O	came
O	in
O	september
O	the
O	carefully
O	worded
O	school
O	english
O	of
O	the

O	able
O	to
O	conceal
O	the
O	warmth
O	and
O	urgency
O	of
O	the
O	invitation
O	so
C	ray
O	telegraphed
O	his
O	acceptance
O	and
O	four
O	days
O	later
O	arrived
O	at
O	fredericton
O	where
O	he
O	secured
O	a
O	hunting
O	license
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	he
O	reached
O	two
O	rivers
O	and

O	met
O	him
O	with
O	a
O	span
O	of
O	ponies
O	attached
O	to
O	a
O	queer
O	spring
O	vehicle
O	mounted
O	on
O	wheels
O	that
O	seemed
O	out
O	of
O	all
O	proportion
O	to
O	the
O	body
O	of
O	the
O	carriage
C	ray
O	wondered
O	if
O	it
O	was
O	a
O	relic
O	of
O	acadia
O	but
O	did
O	not

O	drove
O	for
O	a
O	dozen
O	miles
O	through
O	a

O	and
O	hilly
O	country
O	and
O	arrived
O	at
O	their
O	destination
O	shortly
O	before
O	nightfall
C	jacques
O	was
O	quite
O	alone
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	as

O	of
O	the
O	better
O	class
O	of
O	habitants
O	but
O	with
O	a
O	difference
O	due
O	to
O	the
O	greater
O	prosperity
O	of
O	the
O	family
O	in
O	preceding

O	an

O	connected
O	with

O	to

O	the

O	in
O	fact
O	a
O	cluster
O	of
O	houses
O	rather
O	than
O	a

O	what

O	soon
O	after
O	the

O	runaways
O	came
O	to
O	a

O	a

O	on
O	the

O	crowing
O	with

O	with

O	and
O	i
O	must

O	so
O	now
O	i

O	you

O	said
O	the
C	donkey
O	you
O	had

O	we
O	are
O	going
O	to
O	bremen
O	where
O	you
O	will
O	certainly
O	find
O	something
O	better
O	than
O	having
O	your
O	head
O	cut
O	off
O	you
O	have
O	a
O	good
O	voice
O	and
O	if
O	we
O	all
O	make
O	music
O	together
O	it
O	will
O	be
O	something
O	striking
O	the

O	liked
O	the
O	proposal
O	and
O	they
O	went
O	on
O	all
O	four
O	together
O	but
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	reach
O	the
O	city
O	of
O	bremen
O	in
O	one
O	day
O	and
O	they
O	came
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	to
O	a
O	wood
O	where
O	they
O	agreed
O	to
O	spend
O	the
O	night
O	the
C	donkey
O	and
O	the
C	dog
O	laid
O	themselves
O	down
O	under
O	a
O	great
O	tree
O	but
O	the
C	cat
O	and
O	the
C	cock
O	went
O	higher
O	the
C	cock
O	flying
O	up
O	to
O	the
O	topmost
O	branch
O	where
O	he
O	was
O	safest
O	before
O	he
O	went
O	to
O	sleep
O	he
O	looked
O	round
O	towards
O	all
O	the
O	four
O	points
O	of
O	the
O	compass
O	and
O	he
O	thought
O	he
O	saw
O	a
O	spark
O	shining
O	in
O	the
O	distance
O	he
O	called
O	to
O	his
O	companions
O	that
O	there
O	must
O	be
O	a
O	house
O	not
O	far
O	off
O	for
O	he
O	could
O	see
O	a
O	light
O	the
C	donkey
O	said
O	then
O	we
O	must
O	rise
O	and
O	go
O	to
O	it
O	for
O	the
O	lodgings
O	here
O	are
O	very
O	bad
O	and
O	the
C	dog
O	said
O	yes
O	a
O	few
O	bones
O	with
O	a
O	little
O	flesh
O	on
O	them
O	would
O	do
O	me
O	good
O	so
O	they
O	took
O	the
O	road
O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	where
O	the
O	light
O	was
O	and
O	soon
O	saw
O	it
O	shine
O	brighter
O	and
O	it
O	got
O	larger
O	and
O	larger
O	till
O	they
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	robber
O	s
O	house
O	the
C	donkey
O	being
O	the
O	biggest
O	got
O	up
O	at
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	looked
O	in
O	what
O	do
O	you
O	see
O	greybeard
O	said
O	the
C	cock
O	what
O	do
O	i
O	see
O	answered
O	the
C	donkey
O	a
O	table
O	covered
O	with
O	beautiful
O	food
O	and
O	drink
O	and
C	robbers
O	are
O	sitting
O	round
O	it
O	and
O	enjoying
O	themselves
O	that
O	would
O	do
O	nicely
O	for
O	us
O	said
O	the
C	cock
O	yes
O	indeed
O	if
O	we
O	were
O	only
O	there
O	replied
O	the
C	donkey
O	the
O	animals
O	then
O	consulted
O	together
O	how
O	they
O	should
O	manage
O	to
O	drive
O	out
O	the
C	robbers
O	till
O	at
O	last
O	they
O	settled
O	on
O	a
O	plan

O	was
O	to
O	place
O	himself
O	with

O	on
O	the

O	and
O	at
O	last
O	the

O	to
O	fly
O	up
O	and
O	perch
O	himself
O	on
O	the
C	cat
O	s
O	head
O	when
O	that
O	was
O	done
O	at
O	a
O	signal
O	they

O	all
O	together
O	the

O	the

O	barked
O	the

O	mewed
O	and
O	the

O	crowed
O	then
O	with
O	one
O	great
O	smash
O	they
O	dashed
O	through
O	the
O	window
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	so
O	that
O	the
O	glass
O	clattered
O	down
O	the

O	jumped
O	up
O	at
O	this
O	dreadful
O	noise
O	thinking
O	that
O	nothing
O	less
O	than
O	a

O	was
O	coming
O	in
O	and
O	ran
O	away

O	in
O	a
O	great
O	fright
O	the

O	then
O	sat
O	down
O	at
O	the

O	quite
O	content
O	with
O	what
O	was
O	left
O	there
O	and

O	as
O	they
O	were

O	tired
O	with

O	long
O	journey
O	they
O	soon
O	went
O	to

O	soon
O	after

O	as

O	we
O	ought
O	not
O	to

O	let
O	ourselves
O	be
O	scared
O	so
O	easily
O	and

O	the

O	a

O	but
O	the

O	did

O	the

O	flew
O	in
O	his

O	spat
O	at
O	him
O	and

O	ran
O	away

O	sits
O	a
O	horrid
O	old
O	witch
O	who

O	and
O	scratched
O	my

O	time
O	the

O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	make
O	up
O	their

O	and
O	spent
O	there
O	the

O	days
O	as
O	the

O	and
O	compelled
O	to

O	his

O	sitting
O	inside
O	a
O	great
C	iron
C	stove
O	in
O	a
O	wood
O	there
O	he
O	passed
O	many

O	and
O	nobody
O	could
O	release
O	him
O	once
O	a
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	came
O	into
O	the
O	wood
O	she
O	had
O	gone
O	astray
O	and
O	could
O	not

O	she
O	stood
O	before
O	the

C	stove
O	then
O	a
O	voice
O	came
O	out
O	of

O	whence
O	do
O	you
O	come
O	and
O	where

O	you
O	want
O	to

O	i
O	have
O	wandered
O	from
O	my

O	and
O	lost

C	stove
O	i
O	will
O	help
O	you
O	home
O	again

O	time
O	if

O	a
O	princess
O	and
O	i

O	you
O	she
O	was

O	i
O	do
O	how
O	can
O	i
O	marry
O	an
C	iron
C	stove
O	however
O	as

O	home
O	to
O	her
C	father
O	she
O	promised
O	what

O	of
O	her
O	very
O	well
O	said
O	the

O	you
O	must
O	come
O	again
O	and
O	bring
O	a
O	knife
O	with
O	you
O	and
O	scrape
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	iron
O	and
O	the

C	stove
O	gave
O	her
O	for
O	a
O	companion
O	something
O	or
O	somebody
O	she
O	was
O	not

O	sure
O	what
O	who
O	walked
O	by

O	took
O	her
O	safe
O	home
O	within
O	two
O	hours
O	then
O	there
O	was
O	great
O	joy
O	in
O	her
O	father
O	s
O	palace
O	and
O	the
C	old
C	king
O	fell
O	on
O	her

O	and
O	kissed
O	her
O	many
O	times
O	but
O	she
O	was
O	very
O	sorrowful
O	and
O	said
O	dear
C	father
O	you
O	little

O	i
O	had
O	to
O	promise
O	faithfully
O	that
O	i
O	would
O	return
O	back
O	to
O	it
O	and
O	marry
O	it
O	the
C	old
C	king
O	was
O	so
O	terrified
O	that
O	he
O	nearly
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	swoon
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	only
O	this
O	one
O	child
O	they
O	therefore
O	consulted
O	together
O	and
O	decided
O	to

O	but
O	a
C	miller
C	s
C	daughter
O	who
O	was
O	very
O	beautiful
O	and
O	leading
O	her
O	out
O	they
O	gave
O	her
O	a
O	knife
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	how
O	she
O	was
O	to
O	scrape
O	the
C	iron
C	stove
O	when
O	she
O	reached
O	the
O	wood
O	she
O	scraped
O	away
O	for
O	hours
O	but
O	could
O	not
O	make
O	the
O	slightest
O	impression
O	but
O	when
O	day
O	began
O	to
O	break
O	a
O	voice
O	in
O	the
C	iron
C	stove
O	called
O	out
O	it
O	seems
O	to
O	me
O	that
O	it
O	is
O	day
O	out
O	there
O	she
O	answered
O	it
O	seems
O	so
O	to
O	me
O	too
O	i
O	think
O	i
O	hear
O	my
O	father
O	s
O	mill
O	turning
O	oh
O	then
O	you
O	are
O	a
C	miller
C	s
C	daughter
O	go
O	straight
O	back
O	and
O	send
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	here
O	then
O	she
O	returned
O	and
O	told
O	the
C	old
C	king
O	that
O	the
C	iron
C	stove
O	would
O	not
O	have
O	her
O	he
O	wanted
O	the
C	princess
O	only
O	the
C	old
C	king
O	was
O	greatly
O	frightened
O	and
O	the
C	princess
O	wept
O	but
O	they
O	had
O	still
O	a
C	swineherd
C	s
C	daughter
O	who
O	was
O	still
O	more
O	beautiful
O	than
O	the
C	miller
C	s
C	daughter
O	so
O	they
O	gave
O	her
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	gold
O	in
O	order
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	be
O	persuaded
O	to
O	go
O	instead
O	of
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	to
O	the

C	stove
O	she

O	to
O	the
O	wood
O	as
O	before
O	and
O	had
O	also
O	to
O	scrape
O	for
O	hours
O	but
O	she
O	could
O	make
O	no
O	impression
O	now
O	when
O	dawn
O	broke
O	a
O	voice
O	called
O	out
O	of
O	the
C	stove
O	it
O	seems
O	to
O	me
O	it
O	is
O	day
O	out
O	there
O	then
O	she
O	answered
O	it
O	seems
O	so
O	to
O	me
O	too
O	i
O	think
O	i
O	hear
O	my
O	father
O	s
O	little
O	horn
O	sounding
O	so
O	you
O	are
O	the
C	swineherd
C	s
C	daughter
O	go
O	away
O	directly
O	and
O	bid
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	come
O	and
O	tell
O	her
O	it
O	shall
O	happen
O	to
O	her
O	as
O	i
O	forewarned
O	her
O	if
O	she
O	does
O	not
O	come
O	everything
O	in
O	the
O	kingdom
O	shall
O	fall
O	to
O	pieces
O	and
O	tumble
O	down
O	and
O	no
O	stone
O	remain
O	upon
O	another
O	when
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	daughter
O	heard
O	this
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	cry
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	nothing
O	else
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	she
O	must
O	keep
O	her
O	promise
O	she
O	took
O	leave
O	of
O	her
C	father
O	put
O	a
O	knife
O	in
O	her
O	pocket
O	and
O	went
O	out
O	to
O	the
C	iron
C	stove
O	in
O	the
O	wood
O	when
O	she
O	arrived
O	there
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	scrape
O	and
O	scrape
O	the
O	iron
O	yielded
O	and
O	in
O	two
O	hours
O	she
O	had
O	already
O	scraped
O	a
O	little
O	hole
O	she
O	looked
O	in
O	and
O	saw
O	a
O	most
O	beautiful
O	youth
O	oh
O	he
O	shone
O	so
O	with
O	gold
O	and
O	precious
O	stones
O	that
O	he
O	pleased
O	her
O	to
O	the
O	very
O	bottom
O	of
O	her
O	heart
O	she
O	scraped
O	away
O	faster
O	than
O	ever
O	till
O	she
O	made
O	the
O	hole
O	so
O	large
O	that
O	he
O	was
O	able
O	to
O	get
O	out
O	then
O	he
O	said
O	you
O	are
O	mine
O	and
O	i
O	am
O	yours
O	you
O	have
O	freed
O	me
O	and
O	you
O	are
O	my
O	bride
O	he
O	wished
O	to
O	take
O	her
O	home
O	to
O	his
O	kingdom
O	but
O	she
O	begged
O	that
O	she
O	might
O	go
O	once
O	more
O	to
O	see
O	her
C	father
O	and
O	the
C	prince
O	gave
O	her
O	leave
O	on
O	condition
O	that
O	she
O	should
O	speak
O	no
O	more
O	than
O	three
O	words
O	with
O	him
O	and
O	come
O	back
O	again
O	so
O	she
O	went
O	home
O	but
O	alas
O	being
O	a
O	little
O	she
O	spoke
O	more
O	than
O	three
O	words
O	the
C	iron
C	stove
O	disappeared
O	instantly
O	and
O	was
O	removed
O	far
O	away
O	over
O	glass
O	mountains
O	and
O	sharp
O	swords
O	but
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	being
O	now
O	freed
O	was
O	not
O	shut
O	up
O	in
O	it
O	the
C	princess
O	took
O	leave
O	of
O	her
C	father
O	and
O	took
O	some
O	money
O	with
O	her
O	but
O	not
O	much
O	and
O	went
O	again
O	into
O	the
O	great
O	wood
O	there
O	she
O	looked
O	everywhere
O	for
O	the
C	iron
C	stove
O	but
O	it
O	was
O	not
O	to
O	be
O	found
O	she
O	sought
O	it
O	for
O	nine
O	days
O	until
O	her
O	hunger
O	was
O	so
O	great
O	that
O	she
O	did
O	not
O	know
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	for
O	she
O	had
O	eaten
O	all
O	the
O	food
O	she
O	could
O	find
O	and
O	had
O	nothing
O	left
O	to
O	keep
O	her
O	alive
O	at
O	she
O	climbed
O	up
O	into
O	a
O	little
O	tree
O	and
O	purposed
O	spending
O	the
O	night
O	there
O	for
O	fear
O	of
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	but
O	when
O	midnight
O	came
O	she
O	saw
O	afar
O	off
O	a
O	little
O	glimmering
O	light
O	and
O	thinking
O	oh
O	there
O	i
O	should
O	be
O	safe
O	climbed
O	down
O	and
O	went
O	towards
O	it
O	then
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	a
O	little
O	old
O	house
O	overgrown
O	with
O	grass
O	with
O	a
O	little
O	heap
O	of
O	wood
O	before
O	the
O	door
O	wondering
O	how
O	it
O	came
O	there
O	she
O	looked
O	in
O	through
O	the
O	window
O	and
O	saw
O	nothing
O	inside
O	but
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	fat
O	little
O	frogs
O	and
O	a
O	table
O	beautifully
O	spread
O	there
O	were
O	on
O	it
O	roast
O	meats
O	and
O	wines
O	and
O	the
O	plates
O	and
O	cups
O	were
O	all
O	of
O	silver
O	so
O	she
O	took
O	heart
O	and
O	knocked
O	immediately
O	the
O	fattest
O	frog
O	called
O	maiden
O	sweet
O	and
O	small
C	hutzelbein
O	i
O	call
C	hutzelbein
O	s
O	little
O	dog
O	creep
O	about
O	and
O	see
O	who
O	this
O	can
O	be
O	then
O	a
O	little
O	frog
O	came
O	and
O	opened
O	the
O	door
O	for
O	her
O	and
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	she
O	came
O	in
O	the
O	frogs
O	all
O	bade
O	her
O	welcome
O	and
O	persuaded
O	her
O	to
O	sit
O	down
O	they
O	whence
O	do
O	you
O	come
O	where
O	do
O	you
O	want
O	to
O	go
O	then
O	she
O	told
O	them
O	all
O	that
O	had
O	happened
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	how
O	because
O	she
O	had
O	disobeyed
O	the
O	command
O	not
O	to
O	speak
O	to
O	her
C	father
O	more
O	than
O	three
O	words
O	the
O	stove
O	had
O	disappeared
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	now
O	she
O	was
O	determined
O	to
O	seek
O	him
O	and
O	to
O	wander
O	over
O	mountain
O	and
O	valley
O	till
O	she
O	found
O	him
O	the
O	old
O	fat
O	frog
O	maiden
O	sweet
O	and
O	small
C	hutzelbein
O	i
O	call
C	hutzelbein
O	s
O	little
O	dog
O	creep
O	about
O	and
O	see
O	bring
O	the
O	great
O	box
O	to
O	me
O	then
O	the
O	little
O	frog
O	went
O	and
O	brought
O	the
O	box
O	afterwards
O	they
O	gave
O	the
C	princess
O	food
O	and
O	drink
O	and
O	took
O	her
O	to
O	a
O	bed
O	all
O	of
O	silk
O	and
O	velvet
O	she
O	laid
O	herself
O	in
O	it
O	and
O	slept
O	peacefully
O	when
O	day
O	came
O	she
O	arose
O	and
O	the
O	old
O	frog
O	gave
O	her
O	three
O	needles
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	box
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	to
O	take
O	them
O	with
O	her
O	they
O	would
O	be
O	very
O	necessary
O	to
O	her
O	for
O	she
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	go
O	over
O	a
O	high
O	glass
O	mountain
O	and
O	three
O	sharp
O	swords
O	and
O	a
O	great
O	sea
O	if
O	she
O	passed
O	all
O	those
O	she
O	would
O	recover
O	her
O	dearest
C	prince
O	the
O	frog
O	also
O	gave
O	her
O	besides
O	the
O	three
O	needles
O	other
O	gifts
O	which
O	she
O	was
O	to
O	take
O	great
O	care
O	of
O	namely
O	a
O	and
O	three
O	nuts
O	with
O	these
O	she
O	set
O	off
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	slippery
O	glass
O	mountain
O	she
O	stuck
O	the
O	three
O	needles
O	into
O	it
O	as
O	she
O	walked
O	some
O	before
O	her
O	feet
O	and
O	some
O	behind
O	and
O	so
O	managed
O	to
O	get
O	across
O	when
O	she
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	she
O	hid
O	the
O	needles
O	in
O	a
O	place
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	noticed
O	particularly
O	and
O	went
O	on
O	her
O	way
O	afterwards
O	she
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	swords
O	but
O	she
O	set
O	herself
O	on
O	her
O	and
O	rolled
O	safely
O	over
O	them
O	at
O	last
O	she
O	came
O	before
O	a
O	great
O	lake
O	which
O	she
O	had
O	to
O	sail
O	across
O	and
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	done
O	so
O	she
O	saw
O	a
O	great
O	castle
O	she
O	went
O	in
O	and
O	said
O	she
O	was
O	a
O	poor
O	maiden
O	who
O	wished
O	very
O	much
O	to
O	hire
O	herself
O	out
O	if
O	she
O	might
O	be
O	taken
O	in
O	there
O	as
O	a
O	servant
O	for
O	the
O	frogs
O	had
O	told
O	her
O	that
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	whom
O	she
O	had
O	released
O	out
O	of
O	the
C	iron
C	stove
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	wood
O	dwelt
O	there
O	so
O	she
O	was
O	content
O	to
O	be
O	taken
O	as
O	for
O	very
O	small
O	pay
O	now
O	the
C	king
C	s
C	son
O	had
O	thought
O	the
C	princess
O	was
O	dead
O	and
O	there
O	was
O	now
O	with
O	him
O	another
O	maiden
O	whom
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	persuaded
O	he
O	ought
O	to
O	marry
O	which
O	grieved
O	the
O	poor
O	very
O	much
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	when
O	she
O	had
O	washed
O	up
O	the
O	dishes
O	and
O	had
O	done
O	all
O	her
O	work
O	she
O	felt
O	in
O	her
O	pocket
O	and
O	found
O	the
O	three
O	nuts
O	which
O	the
O	old
O	frog
O	had
O	given
O	her
O	she
O	bit
O	one
O	open
O	and
O	was
O	going
O	to
O	eat
O	the
O	kernel
O	when
O	behold
O	inside
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	most
O	beautiful
O	dress
O	imaginable
O	so
O	beautiful
O	that
O	the
O	bride
O	soon
O	heard
O	of
O	it
O	came
O	and
O	asked
O	to
O	see
O	it
O	and
O	wanted
O	to
O	buy
O	it
O	saying
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	dress
O	for
O	a
O	but
O	the
O	thought
O	differently
O	and
O	refused
O	to
O	sell
O	it
O	but
O	offered
O	to
O	give
O	it
O	as
O	a
O	present
O	if
O	the
O	bride
O	would
O	grant
O	her
O	one

O	so
O	still
O	in
O	the

O	he
O	got

O	away
O	when

O	came
O	to
O	the

O	lake
O	they
O	sailed
O	over
O	and
O	at
O	the

O	they
O	seated
O	themselves
O	on
O	the
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	glass
O	mountain
O	they
O	found
O	the
O	three
O	needles
O	and
O	stuck
O	them
O	in
O	step
O	by
O	step
O	so
O	they
O	came
O	at
O	last
O	to
O	the

O	old
O	house
O	but
O	as
O	they
O	went

O	all

O	children
O	and
O	received
O	them
O	both
O	with
O	great
O	joy
O	there
O	the
O	wedding
O	was
O	celebrated
O	and
O	they
O	remained
O	in
O	the
O	castle
O	which
O	was
O	much
O	larger
O	than
O	that
O	which
O	belonged
O	to
O	the
C	princess
O	s
C	father
O	but
O	as
O	the

O	man
O	lamented
O	very
O	much
O	his
C	daughter
O	s
O	loss
O	and
O	his

O	loneliness
O	they
O	soon
O	went
O	and
O	fetched
O	him
O	home
O	to
O	themselves
O	so
O	they
O	had
O	two
O	kingdoms
O	instead
O	of
O	one
O	and

O	happily
O	together

O	as
O	i
O	had
O	encountered
O	so
O	that
O	i
O	thought
O	of

O	of

O	days
O	in

O	all

O	i

O	during
O	the

O	but
O	next
O	morning
O	at
O	break
O	of
O	day
O	i
O	perceived
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	i
O	shot
O	several

O	among

O	and
O	at

O	highly
O	we
O	went
O	afterward
O	together
O	to
O	the

O	where
O	we
O	dug
O	a
O	hole
O	for
O	the

O	my

O	for
O	two
O	months
O	one
O	morning
O	as
O	i
O	looked
O	for
O	the
O	elephants
O	i
O	perceived
O	with
O	extreme
O	amazement
O	that
O	instead
O	of
O	passing
O	by
O	me
O	across
O	the
O	forest
O	as
O	usual
O	they
O	stopped
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	me
O	with
O	a
O	horrible
O	noise
O	in
O	such
O	numbers
O	that
O	the
O	plain
O	was
O	covered
O	and
O	shook
O	under
O	them
O	they
O	surrounded
O	the

O	in
O	which
O	i
O	was
O	concealed
O	with
O	their
O	trunks
O	uplifted
O	and
O	all
O	fixed
O	their
O	eyes
O	upon
O	me
O	at
O	this
O	alarming
O	spectacle
O	i
O	continued
O	immovable
O	and
O	was
O	so
O	much
O	terrified
O	that
O	my
O	bow
O	and
O	arrows
O	fell
O	out
O	of
O	my
O	hand
O	my
O	fears
O	were
O	not
O	without
O	cause
O	for
O	after
O	the
O	elephants
O	had
O	stared
O	upon
O	me
O	some
O	time
O	one
O	of

O	of
O	them
O	put
O	his
O	trunk
O	round
O	the
O	foot
O	of
O	the
O	tree
O	plucked
O	it
O	up
O	and
O	threw
O	it
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	i
O	fell
O	with
O	the
O	tree
O	and
O	the
O	elephant
O	taking
O	me
O	up
O	with
O	his
O	trunk
O	laid
O	me
O	on
O	his
O	back
O	where
O	i
O	sat
O	more
O	like
O	one
O	dead
O	than
O	alive
O	with
O	my
O	quiver
O	on
O	my
O	shoulder
O	he
O	put
O	himself
O	at
O	the
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	rest
O	who
O	followed
O	him
O	in
O	line
O	one
O	after
O	the
O	other
O	carried
O	me
O	a
O	considerable
O	way
O	then
O	laid
O	me
O	down
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	and
O	retired
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	companions
O	after
O	having
O	lain
O	some
O	time
O	and
O	seeing
O	the
O	elephants
O	gone
O	i
O	got
O	up
O	and
O	found
O	i
O	was
O	upon
O	a
O	long
O	and
O	broad
O	hill
O	almost
O	covered
O	with
O	the
O	bones
O	and
O	teeth
O	of
O	elephants
O	i
O	doubted
O	not
O	but
O	that
O	this
O	was
O	the
O	of
O	the
O	elephants
O	and
O	that
O	they
O	carried
O	me
O	thither
O	on
O	purpose
O	to
O	tell
O	me
O	that
O	i
O	should
O	forbear
O	to
O	kill
O	them
O	as
O	now
O	i
O	knew
O	where
O	to
O	get
O	their
O	teeth
O	without
O	inflicting
O	injury
O	on
O	them
O	i
O	did
O	not
O	stay
O	on
O	the

O	and
O	after

O	travelled
O	a
O	day
O	and
O	a
O	night
O	i
O	came
O	to

O	with
O	fringes
O	of

O	bullion
O	most
O	glittering
O	to

O	and
O	there
O	was
O	the
O	silver
O	king
O	almost
O	as
O	gorgeous
O	in
O	a
O	suit
O	of
O	spangled
O	white
O	and
O	side

O	more
O	economical
O	and
O	this

O	troop
O	of

O	kings
O	most
O	politely
O	led
C	thor

O	no
O	one
O	had
O	yet
O	caught
O	even
O	a

O	at
C	thrym
O	s
O	other
O	hand
O	stood
C	loki
O	the
C	waiting
C	maid

O	the

O	were
O	served
O	in
O	a
O	huge

O	as
O	befitted
O	the
O	table
O	of
O	giants
O	great
O	beeves
O	roasted
O	whole
O	on
O	platters
O	as
O	wide
O	across
O	as
O	a
O	ship
O	s
O	deck
O	plum
O	puddings
O	as
O	fat
O	as
O	feather

O	as
O	big
O	as

O	and
O	a
O	wedding
O	cake
O	like
O	a
O	hay
O	mow
O	the
O	giants
O	ate
O	enormously
O	but
O	to
C	thor
O	because
O	they
O	thought
O	him
O	a
O	dainty
O	maiden
O	they
O	served
O	small
O	bits
O	of
O	everything
O	on
O	a
O	tiny
O	gold
O	dish
O	now
C	thor
O	s
O	long
O	journey
O	had
O	made
O	him
O	very
O	hungry
O	and
O	through
O	his
O	veil
O	he
O	whispered
O	to
C	loki
O	i
O	shall
O	starve
C	loki
O	i
O	cannot
O	fare
O	on
O	these
O	nibbles
O	i
O	must
O	eat
O	a
O	goodly
O	meal
O	as
O	i
O	do
O	at
O	home
O	and
O	forthwith
O	he
O	helped
O	himself
O	to
O	such
O	morsels
O	as
O	might
O	satisfy
O	his
O	hunger
O	for
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	you
O	should
O	have
O	seen
O	the
O	giants
O	stare
O	at
O	the
O	meal
O	which
O	the
O	dainty
O	bride
O	devoured
O	for
O	first
O	under
O	the
O	silver
O	veil
O	disappeared
O	by
O	pieces
O	a
O	whole
O	roast
O	ox
O	then
C	thor
O	made
O	eight
O	mouthfuls
O	of
O	eight
O	pink
O	salmon
O	a
O	dish
O	of
O	which
O	he
O	was
O	very
O	fond
O	and
O	next
O	he
O	looked
O	about
O	and
O	reached
O	for
O	a
O	platter
O	of
O	cakes
O	and
O	sweetmeats
O	that
O	was
O	set
O	aside
O	at
O	one
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	table
O	for
O	the
O	lady
O	guests
O	and
O	the
O	bride
O	ate
O	them
O	all
O	you
O	can
O	fancy
O	how
O	the
O	damsels
O	drew
O	down
O	their
O	mouths
O	and
O	looked
O	at
O	one
O	another
O	when
O	they
O	saw
O	their
O	dessert
O	disappear
O	and
O	they
O	whispered
O	about
O	the
O	table
O	alack
O	if
O	our
O	future
O	mistress
O	is
O	to
O	sup
O	like
O	this
O	day
O	by
O	day
O	there
O	will
O	be
O	poor
O	cheer
O	for
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	us
O	and
O	to
O	crown
O	it
O	all
C	thor
O	was
O	thirsty
O	as
O	well
O	he
O	might
O	be
O	and
O	one
O	after
O	another
O	he
O	raised
O	to
O	his
O	lips
O	and
O	emptied
O	three
O	great
O	barrels
O	of
O	mead
O	the
O	foamy
O	drink
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	then
O	indeed
C	thrym
O	was
O	amazed
O	for
C	thor
O	s
O	giant
O	appetite
O	had
O	beaten
O	that
O	of
O	the
O	giants
O	themselves
O	never
O	before
O	saw
O	i
O	a
O	bride
O	so
O	hungry
O	he
O	cried
O	and
O	never
O	before
O	one
O	half
O	so
O	thirsty
O	but
C	loki
O	the
C	waiting
C	maid
O	whispered
O	to
O	him
O	softly
O	the
O	truth
O	is
O	great
C	thrym
O	that
O	my
O	dear
O	mistress
O	was
O	almost
O	starved
O	for
O	eight
O	days
C	freia
O	has
O	eaten
O	nothing
O	at
O	all
O	so
O	eager
O	was
O	she
O	for
O	jotunheim
O	then
C	thrym
O	was
O	delighted
O	you
O	may
O	be
O	sure
O	he
O	forgave
O	his
O	hungry
O	bride
O	and
O	loved
O	her
O	with
O	all
O	his
O	heart
O	he
O	leaned
O	forward
O	to
O	give
O	her
O	a
O	kiss
O	raising
O	a
O	corner
O	of
O	her
O	veil
O	but
O	his
O	hand
O	dropped
O	suddenly
O	and
O	he
O	started
O	up
O	in
O	terror
O	for
O	he
O	had
O	caught
O	the
O	angry
O	flash
O	of
C	thor
O	s
O	eye
O	which
O	was
O	glaring
O	at
O	him
O	through
O	the
O	bridal
O	veil
C	thor
O	was
O	longing
O	for
O	his
O	hammer
O	why
O	has
C	freia
O	so
O	sharp
O	a
O	look
C	thrym
O	cried
O	it
O	pierces
O	like
O	lightning
O	and
O	burns
O	like
O	fire
O	but
O	again
O	the
O	sly
C	waiting
C	maid
O	whispered
O	timidly
O	oh
C	thrym
O	be
O	not
O	amazed
O	the
O	truth
O	is
O	my
O	poor
O	mistress
O	s
O	eyes
O	are
O	red
O	with
O	wakefulness
O	and
O	bright
O	with
O	longing
O	for
O	eight
O	nights
C	freia
O	has
O	not
O	known
O	a
O	wink
O	of
O	sleep
O	so
O	eager
O	was
O	she
O	for
O	jotunheim
O	then
O	again
C	thrym
O	was
O	doubly
O	delighted
O	and
O	he
O	longed
O	to
O	call
O	her
O	his
O	very
O	own
O	dear
O	wife
O	bring
O	in
O	the
O	wedding
O	gift
O	he
O	cried
O	bring
O	in
C	thor
O	s
O	hammer
O	miölnir
O	and
O	give
O	it
O	to
C	freia
O	as
O	i
O	promised
O	for
O	when
O	i
O	have
O	kept
O	my
O	word
O	she
O	will
O	be
O	mine
O	all
O	mine
O	then
C	thor
O	s
O	big
O	heart
O	laughed
O	under
O	his
O	woman
O	s
O	dress
O	and
O	his
O	fierce
O	eyes
O	swept
O	eagerly
O	down
O	the
O	hall
O	to
O	meet
O	the
O	servant
O	who
O	was
O	bringing
O	in
O	the
O	hammer
O	on
O	a
O	velvet
O	cushion
C	thor
O	s
O	fingers
O	could
O	hardly
O	wait
O	to
O	clutch
O	the
O	stubby
O	handle
O	which
O	they
O	knew
O	so
O	well
O	but
O	he
O	sat
O	quite
O	still
O	on
O	the
O	throne
O	beside
O	ugly
O	old
C	thrym
O	with
O	his
O	hands
O	meekly
O	folded
O	and
O	his
O	head
O	bowed
O	like
O	a
O	bashful
O	bride
O	the
O	giant
O	servant
O	drew
O	nearer
O	nearer
O	puffing
O	and
O	blowing
O	strong
O	though
O	he
O	was
O	beneath
O	the
O	mighty
O	weight
O	he
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	lay
O	it
O	at
C	thor
O	s
O	feet
O	for
O	he
O	thought
O	it
O	so
O	heavy
O	that
O	no
O	maiden
O	could
O	lift
O	it
O	or
O	hold
O	it
O	in
O	her
O	lap
O	when
O	suddenly
C	thor
O	s
O	heart
O	swelled
O	and
O	he
O	gave
O	a
O	most
O	unmaidenly
O	shout
O	of
O	rage
O	and
O	triumph
O	with
O	one
O	swoop
O	he
O	grasped
O	the
O	hammer
O	in
O	his
O	iron
O	fingers
O	with
O	the
O	other
O	arm
O	he
O	tore
O	off
O	the
O	veil
O	that
O	hid
O	his
O	terrible
O	face
O	and
O	trampled
O	it
O	under
O	foot
O	then
O	he
O	turned
O	to
O	the
O	frightened
O	king
O	who
O	cowered
O	beside
O	him
O	on
O	the
O	throne
O	thief
O	he
O	cried
C	freia
O	sends
O	you
O	this
O	as
O	a
O	wedding
O	gift
O	and
O	he
O	whirled
O	the
O	hammer
O	about
O	his
O	head
O	then
O	hurled
O	it
O	once
O	twice
O	thrice
O	as
O	it
O	rebounded
O	to
O	his
O	hand
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	stroke
O	as
O	of
O	lightning
C	thrym
O	rolled
O	dead
O	from
O	his
O	throne
O	in
O	the
O	second
O	stroke
O	perished
O	the
O	whole
O	giant
O	household
O	these
O	ugly
O	enemies
O	of
O	the
O	aesir
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	third
O	stroke
O	the
O	palace
O	itself
O	tumbled
O	together
O	and
O	fell
O	to
O	the
O	ground
O	like
O	a
O	toppling
O	playhouse
O	of
O	blocks
O	but
C	loki
O	and
C	thor
O	stood
O	safely
O	among
O	the
O	ruins
O	dressed
O	in
O	their
O	tattered
O	maiden
O	robes
O	a
O	quaint
O	and
O	curious
O	sight
O	and
C	loki
O	full
O	of
O	mischief
O	now
O	as
O	ever
O	burst
O	out
O	laughing
O	oh
C	thor
O	if
O	you
O	could
O	he
O	began
O	but
C	thor
O	held
O	up
O	his
O	hammer
O	and
O	shook
O	it
O	gently
O	as
O	he
O	said
O	look
O	now
C	loki
O	it
O	was
O	an
O	excellent
O	joke
O	and
O	so
O	far
O	you
O	have
O	done
O	well
O	after
O	your
O	crafty
O	fashion
O	which
O	likes
O	me
O	not
O	but
O	now
O	i
O	have
O	my
O	hammer
O	again
O	and
O	the
O	joke
O	is
O	done
O	from
O	you
O	nor
O	from
O	another
O	i
O	brook
O	no
O	laughter
O	at
O	my
O	expense
O	henceforth
O	we
O	will
O	have
O	no
O	mention
O	of
O	this
O	masquerade
O	nor
O	of
O	these
O	rags
O	which
O	now
O	i
O	throw
O	away
O	do
O	you
O	hear
O	red
O	laughter
O	and
C	loki
O	heard
O	with
O	a
O	look
O	of
O	hate
O	and
O	stifled
O	his
O	laughter
O	as
O	best
O	he
O	could
O	for
O	it
O	is
O	not
O	good
O	to
O	laugh
O	at
O	him
O	who
O	holds
O	the
O	hammer
O	not
O	once
O	after

O	there
O	mention

O	the

O	a
O	woman
O	a
O	woman
O	that
O	he
O	must
O	set
O	free
O	slowly
O	gradually
O	the

O	soon
O	he

O	beautiful
O	thing
O	that

O	this

O	were
O	all
O	most
O	perfect
O	and
O	so
O	perfect
O	were
O	they
O	that
O	he
O	felt
O	very
O	sure
O	that
O	had
O	she
O	been
O	a
O	woman
O	indeed
O	most
O	perfect
O	would

O	he

O	as
O	he

O	never

O	before
O	there
O	came
O	at

O	a
O	day
O	when
O	he
O	felt
O	that
O	another
O	touch
O	would
O	be
O	insult
O	to
O	the
O	exquisite
O	thing
O	he
O	had
O	created
O	he
O	laid
O	his
O	chisel
O	aside
O	and
O	sat
O	down
O	to
O	gaze
O	at
O	the
O	perfect
O	woman
O	she
O	seemed
O	to
O	gaze
O	back
O	at
O	him
O	her
O	parted
O	lips
O	were
O	ready
O	to

O	her
O	hands
O	were
O	held
O	out
O	to

O	his

O	then
C	pygmalion
O	covered
O	his
O	eyes
O	he
O	the
O	hater
O	of
O	women
O	loved
O	a
O	woman
O	a
O	woman
O	of
O	chilly
O	marble
O	the

O	he
O	had
O	scorned
O	were

O	day
O	by
O	day
O	his
O	passion
O	for
O	the
O	woman
O	of
O	his
O	own
O	creation
O	grew
O	and
O	grew
O	his
O	hands
O	no
O	longer
O	wielded
O	the
O	chisel
O	they
O	grew
O	idle
O	he
O	would
O	stand
O	under
O	the
O	great
O	pines
O	and
O	gaze
O	across
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	dream
O	strange
O	dreams
O	of
O	a
O	marble
O	woman
O	who
O	walked
O	across
O	the
O	waves
O	with
O	arms
O	outstretched
O	with
O	smiling
O	lips
O	and
O	who
O	became
O	a
O	woman
O	of
O	warm
O	flesh
O	and
O	blood
O	when
O	her
O	bare
O	feet
O	touched
O	the
O	yellow
O	sand
O	and
O	the
O	bright
O	sun
O	of
O	cyprus
O	touched
O	her
O	marble
O	hair
O	and
O	turned
O	it
O	into
O	hair
O	of
O	living
O	gold
O	then
O	he
O	would
O	hasten
O	back
O	to
O	his
O	studio
O	to
O	find
O	the
O	miracle
O	still
O	unaccomplished
O	and
O	would
O	passionately
O	kiss
O	the
O	little
O	cold
O	hands
O	and
O	lay
O	beside
O	the
O	little
O	cold
O	feet
O	the
O	presents
O	he
O	knew
O	that
O	young
O	girls
O	loved
O	bright
O	shells
O	and
O	exquisite
O	precious
O	stones
O	birds
O	and
O	fragrant
O	flowers
O	shining
O	amber
O	and
O	beads
O	that
O	sparkled
O	and
O	flashed
O	with
O	all
O	the
O	most
O	lovely
O	combinations
O	of
O	colour
O	that
O	the
O	mind
O	of
O	artist
O	could
O	devise
O	yet
O	more
O	he
O	did
O	for
O	he
O	spent
O	vast
O	sums
O	on
O	priceless
O	pearls
O	and
O	hung
O	them
O	in

O	and
O	upon
O	her
O	cold
O	white
O	breast
O	and
O	the
O	merchants
O	wondered
O	who
O	could
O	be
O	the
O	one
O	upon
O	whom
C	pygmalion
O	lavished
O	the
O	money
O	from

O	treasury
O	to
O	his
O	divinity
O	he
O	gave

O	and
O	always
O	on
O	still
O	nights
O	the
O	myriad
O	silver

O	would
O	seem
O	to

C	galatea

O	on
O	those
O	days
O	when
O	the
O	tempests
O	blew
O	across
O	the
O	sandy
O	wastes
O	of
O	arabia
O	and
O	churned
O	up
O	the
O	fierce
O	white
O	surf
O	on
O	the
O	rocks
O	of
O	cyprus
O	the
O	very
O	spirit
O	of
O	the
O	storm
O	seemed
O	to
O	moan
O	through
O	the
O	crash
O	of
O	waves
O	in
O	longing
O	hopeless
O	and
C	galatea
C	galatea
O	for
O	her
O	he
O	decked
O	a
O	couch
O	with
O	tyrian
O	purple
O	and
O	on
O	the
O	softest
O	of
O	pillows
O	he
O	laid
O	the
O	beautiful
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	marble
O	woman
O	that
O	he
O	loved
O	so
O	the
O	time
O	wore
O	on
O	until
O	the
O	festival
O	of
O	aphrodite
O	drew
O	near
O	smoke
O	from
O	many
O	altars
O	curled
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	the
O	odour
O	of
O	incense
O	mingled
O	with
O	the
O	fragrance
O	of
O	the
O	great
O	pine
O	trees
O	and
O	garlanded
O	victims
O	lowed
O	and
O	bleated
O	as
O	they
O	were
O	led
O	to
O	the
O	sacrifice
O	as
O	the
O	leader
O	of
O	his
O	people
C	pygmalion
O	faithfully
O	and
O	perfectly
O	performed
O	all
O	his
O	part
O	in
O	the
O	solemnities
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	was
O	left
O	beside
O	the
O	altar
O	to
O	pray
O	alone
O	never
O	before
O	had
O	his
O	words
O	faltered
O	as
O	he
O	laid
O	his
O	petitions
O	before
O	the
O	gods
O	but
O	on
O	this
O	day
O	he
O	spoke
O	not
O	as
O	a
O	but
O	as
O	a
O	child
O	who
O	was
O	half
O	afraid
O	of
O	what
O	he
O	asked
O	o
O	aphrodite
O	he
O	said
O	who
O	can
O	do
O	all
O	things
O	give
O	me
O	i
O	pray
O	you
O	one
O	like
O	my
C	galatea
O	for
O	my
O	wife
O	give
O	me
O	my
C	galatea
O	he
O	dared
O	not
O	say
O	but
O	aphrodite
O	knew
O	well
O	the
O	words
O	he
O	would
O	fain
O	have
O	uttered
O	and
O	smiled
O	to
O	think
O	how
C	pygmalion
O	at
O	last
O	was
O	on
O	his
O	knees
O	in
O	token
O	that
O	his
O	prayer
O	was
O	answered
O	three
O	times
O	she
O	made
O	the
O	flames
O	on
O	the
O	altar
O	shoot
O	up
O	in
O	a
O	fiery
O	point
O	and
C	pygmalion
O	went
O	home
O	scarcely
O	daring
O	to
O	hope
O	not
O	allowing
O	his
O	gladness
O	to
O	conquer
O	his
O	fear
O	the
O	shadows
O	of
O	evening
O	were
O	falling
O	as
O	he
O	went
O	into
O	the
O	room
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	made
O	sacred
O	to
C	galatea
O	on
O	the
O	couch
O	she
O	lay
O	and
O	as
O	he
O	entered
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	though
O	she
O	met
O	his
O	eyes
O	with
O	her
O	own
O	almost
O	it
O	seemed
O	that
O	she
O	smiled
O	at
O	him
O	in
O	welcome
O	he
O	quickly
O	went
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	and
O	kneeling
O	by
O	her
O	side
O	he
O	pressed
O	his
O	lips
O	on
O	those
O	lips
O	of
O	chilly
O	marble
O	so
O	many
O	times
O	he
O	had
O	done
O	it
O	before
O	and
O	always
O	it
O	was
O	as
O	though
O	the
O	icy
O	lips
O	that
O	could
O	never
O	live
O	sent
O	their
O	chill
O	right
O	through
O	his
O	heart
O	but
O	now
O	it
O	surely
O	seemed
O	to
O	him
O	that
O	the
O	lips
O	were
O	cold
O	no
O	longer
O	he
O	felt
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	little
O	hands
O	and
O	no
O	more
O	did
O	it
O	remain
O	heavy
O	and
O	cold
O	and
O	stiff
O	in
O	his
O	touch
O	but
O	lay
O	in
O	his
O	own
O	hand
O	soft
O	and
O	living
O	and
O	warm
O	he
O	softly
O	laid
O	his
O	fingers
O	on
O	the
O	marble
O	hair
O	and
O	lo
O	it
O	was
O	the
O	soft
O	and
O	wavy
O	burnished
O	golden
O	hair
O	of
O	his
O	desire
O	again
O	reverently
O	as
O	he
O	had
O	laid
O	his
O	offerings
O	that
O	day
O	on
O	the
O	altar
O	of
O	venus
C	pygmalion
O	kissed
O	her
O	lips
O	and
O	then
O	did
C	galatea
O	with
O	warm
O	and
O	rosy
O	cheeks
O	widely
O	open
O	her
O	eyes
O	like
O	pools
O	in
O	a
O	dark
O	mountain
O	stream
O	on
O	which
O	the
O	sun
O	is
O	shining
O	and
O	gaze
O	with
O	timid
O	gladness
O	into
O	his
O	own
O	there
O	are
O	no
O	after
O	tales
O	of
C	pygmalion
O	and
C	galatea
O	we
O	only
O	know
O	that
O	their
O	lives
O	were
O	happy
O	and
O	that
O	to
O	them
O	was
O	born
O	a
O	son
O	paphos
O	from
O	whom
O	the
O	city
O	sacred
O	to
O	aphrodite
O	received
O	its
O	name
O	perhaps
O	aphrodite
O	may
O	have
O	smiled
O	sometimes
O	to
O	watch
C	pygmalion
O	once
O	the

O	of

O	yet
O	to

O	such

C	launcelot
O	right
O	gladly

C	elaine
C	sir
C	launcelot
O	pondered
O	her
O	words
O	and
O	at
O	last
O	he
O	said
O	fair
O	maiden
O	i

O	with
O	great
O	pearls
O	and
O	fastened
O	it
O	in

O	then
C	sir
C	launcelot
O	begged
O	her
O	to
O	keep
O	for
O	him
O	his
O	own

O	until

O	stay
O	in
O	privacy
O	undiscovered
O	by

O	acquaintance
O	then
O	when
O	at
O	dawn
O	the
O	trumpets
O	blew
O	they
O	mounted
O	their

O	to
O	a
O	little
O	wood
O	hard
O	by

O	and
O	there
O	they
O	abode
O	some
O	while
O	for
C	sir
C	launcelot
O	would
O	take
O	no
O	part
O	until
O	he
O	had
O	seen
O	which
O	side
O	was
O	the
O	stronger
O	so
O	they
O	saw
O	how
C	king
C	arthur
O	sat
O	high
O	on
O	a
O	throne
O	to
O	overlook

O	and
O	the
C	king
O	of
O	scots
O	then
O	it
O	soon
O	appeared
O	that
O	the
O	two
O	kings
O	with
O	all
O	their
O	company
O	could
O	do
O	but
O	little
O	against
O	the
O	knights
O	of

O	table
O	and
O	were

O	pressed
O	to
O	maintain
O	their

O	seeing
O	this
C	sir
C	launcelot
O	said
O	to
C	sir
C	lavaine
O	sir
C	knight
O	will
O	ye
O	give
O	me
O	your
O	aid
O	if
O	i
O	go
O	to
O	the
O	rescue
O	of
O	the
O	weaker
O	side
O	for
O	it
O	seems
O	to
O	me
O	they
O	may
O	not
O	much
O	longer
O	hold
O	their

O	i
O	will
O	gladly
O	follow
O	you
O	and
O	do
O	what
O	i

O	so
O	the
O	two
O	laid
O	their
O	lances
O	in
O	rest
O	and
O	charged
O	into
O	the
O	thickest
O	of
O	the
O	fight
O	and
O	with
O	one
O	spear
C	sir
C	launcelot
O	bore
O	four
O	knights
O	from
O	the
O	saddle
C	lavaine
O	too
O	did
O	nobly
O	for

O	the

C	sir
C	bedivere
O	and
C	sir
C	lucan
O	the

O	then
O	with

O	they
O	smote
O	lustily
O	on

O	and
O	those
O	whom
O	they
O	had

O	rallying
O	to
O	them
O	they
O	drove
O	the

O	table
O	back
O	a
O	space
O	so
O	the

C	launcelot
O	ever

O	but
O	the

O	of

O	s
O	court
O	felt
O	shame
O	of
O	their
O	discomfiture

O	seemed
O	mightier
O	even

O	so
O	they
O	called
O	to

O	directed
O	all
O	their

O	a
O	port
O	where
O	i
O	embarked
O	on
O	putting
O	out
O	to
O	sea
O	we

O	overtaken
O	by
O	such
O	a
O	sudden
O	gust

O	by
O	the

O	to
O	an
O	island
O	which
O	lay
O	before

O	we
O	found
O	fruit
O	and
O	spring

O	as
O	the

O	up
O	we

O	and

O	some
O	houses
O	which
O	we
O	approached
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	we
O	drew
O	near
O	we
O	were
O	encompassed
O	by
O	a
O	great
O	number
O	of
O	negroes
O	who
O	seized
O	us
O	shared
O	us
O	among

O	and
O	carried
O	us
O	to
O	their
O	respective
O	habitations
O	i
O	and
O	five
O	of
O	my
O	comrades

O	place
O	here
O	they
O	made
O	us
O	sit
O	down
O	and
O	gave

O	a
O	certain
O	herb

O	not
O	taking
O	notice
O	that

O	themselves
O	thought
O	only
O	of
O	satisfying
O	their

O	and
O	ate
O	with
O	greediness
O	but
O	i
O	suspecting
O	some
O	trick
O	would
O	not
O	so
O	much
O	as
O	taste
O	it
O	which
O	happened
O	well
O	for
O	me
O	for
O	in
O	a
O	little
O	time
O	after
O	i
O	perceived
O	my

O	to
O	me
O	they
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	they
O	said
O	the

O	us
O	afterward
O	with

O	with

O	of
O	it
O	greedily
O	i
O	also
O	partook
O	of
O	it
O	but
O	very
O	sparingly
O	they
O	gave
O	us
O	that
O	herb
O	at
O	first
O	on
O	purpose
O	to
O	deprive
O	us
O	of
O	our
O	senses
O	that
O	we
O	might
O	not
O	be
O	aware
O	of
O	the
O	sad
O	destiny
O	prepared
O	for
O	us
O	and
O	they
O	supplied
O	us
O	with
O	rice
O	to
O	fatten
O	us
O	for
O	being
O	cannibals
O	their
O	design

O	to
O	eat
O	us
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	we
O	grew
O	fat
O	this

O	happened
O	for

O	my
O	comrades
O	who

O	my

O	easily
O	guess
O	that
O	instead
O	of
O	growing
O	fat
O	as
O	the
O	rest
O	did
O	i
O	grew
O	leaner
O	every
O	day
O	the
O	fear
O	of
O	death
O	under
O	which
O	i
O	labored
O	turned
O	all
O	my
O	food
O	into
O	poison
O	i
O	fell
O	into
O	a
O	languishing

O	which
O	proved
O	my
O	safety
O	for
O	the
O	negroes
O	having
O	killed
O	and
O	eaten
O	my

O	so
O	that
O	scarcely
O	any
O	notice
O	was
O	taken
O	of
O	what
O	i
O	did
O	and
O	this
O	gave
O	me
O	an
O	opportunity
O	one
O	day
O	to
O	get
O	at
O	a
O	distance
O	from
O	the
O	houses
O	and
O	to
O	make
O	my
O	escape
O	an
O	old
O	man
O	who
O	saw
O	me
O	and
O	suspected
O	my
O	design
O	called
O	to
O	me
O	as
O	loud
O	as
O	he
O	could
O	to
O	return
O	but
O	instead
O	of
O	obeying
O	him
O	i
O	redoubled
O	my
O	speed
O	and
O	quickly
O	got
O	out
O	of
O	sight
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	there
O	was
O	none
O	but
O	the
O	old
O	man
O	about
O	the
O	houses
O	the
O	rest
O	being
O	abroad
O	and
O	not
O	to
O	return
O	till
O	night
O	which
O	was
O	usual
O	with
O	them
O	therefore
O	being
O	sure
O	that
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	arrive
O	in
O	time
O	to
O	pursue
O	me
O	i
O	went
O	on
O	till
O	night
O	when
O	i
O	stopped
O	to
O	rest
O	a
O	little
O	and
O	to
O	eat
O	some
O	of
O	the
O	provisions
O	i
O	had
O	secured
O	but
O	i
O	speedily
O	set
O	forward
O	again
O	and
O	travelled
O	seven
O	days
O	avoiding
O	those
O	places
O	which
O	seemed
O	to
O	be
O	inhabited
O	and
O	lived
O	for
O	the
O	most
O	part
O	upon
O	cocoanuts
O	which
O	served
O	me
O	both
O	for
O	meat
O	and
O	drink
O	on
O	the
O	eighth
O	day
O	i
O	came
O	near
O	the
O	sea
O	and
O	saw
O	some
O	white
O	people
O	like
O	myself
O	gathering
O	pepper
O	of
O	which
O	there
O	was
O	great
O	plenty
O	in
O	that
O	place
O	this
O	i
O	took
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	good
O	omen
O	and
O	went
O	to
O	them
O	without
O	any
O	scruple
O	the
O	people
O	who
O	gathered
O	pepper
O	came
O	to
O	meet
O	me
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	they
O	saw
O	me
O	and
O	asked
O	me
O	in
O	arabic
O	who
O	i
O	was
O	and
O	whence
O	i
O	came
O	i
O	was
O	overjoyed
O	to
O	hear
O	them
O	speak
O	in
O	my
O	own
O	language
O	and
O	satisfied
O	their
O	curiosity
O	by
O	giving
O	them
O	an
O	account
O	of
O	my
O	shipwreck
O	and
O	how
O	i
O	fell
O	into
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	the
O	negroes
O	those
O	negroes
O	replied
O	they
O	eat
O	men
O	and
O	by
O	what
O	miracle
O	did
O	you
O	escape
O	their
O	cruelty
O	i
O	related
O	to
O	them
O	the
O	circumstances
O	i
O	have
O	just
O	mentioned
O	at
O	which
O	they
O	were
O	wonderfully
O	surprised
O	i
O	stayed
O	with
O	them
O	till
O	they
O	had
O	gathered
O	their
O	quantity
O	of
O	pepper
O	and
O	then
O	sailed
O	with
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	island
O	from
O	whence
O	they
O	had
O	come
O	they
O	presented
O	me
O	to
O	their
C	king
O	who
O	was
O	a
O	good
C	prince
O	he
O	had
O	the
O	patience
O	to
O	hear
O	the
O	relation
O	of
O	my
O	adventures
O	which
O	surprised
O	him
O	and
O	he
O	afterward
O	gave
O	me
O	clothes
O	and
O	commanded
O	care
O	to
O	be
O	taken
O	of
O	me
O	the
O	island
O	was
O	very
O	well
O	peopled
O	plentiful
O	in
O	everything
O	and
O	the
O	capital
O	a
O	place
O	of
O	great
O	trade
O	this
O	agreeable
O	retreat
O	was
O	very
O	comfortable
O	to
O	me
O	after
O	my
O	misfortunes
O	and
O	the
O	kindness
O	of
O	this
O	generous
C	prince
O	completed
O	my
O	satisfaction
O	in
O	a
O	word
O	there
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	person
O	more
O	in
O	favor
O	with
O	him
O	than
O	myself
O	and
O	consequently
O	every
O	man
O	in
O	court
O	and
O	city
O	sought
O	to
O	oblige
O	me
O	so
O	that
O	in
O	a
O	very
O	little
O	time
O	i
O	was
O	looked
O	upon
O	rather
O	as
O	a
O	native
O	than
O	a
O	stranger
O	i
O	observed
O	one
O	thing
O	which
O	to
O	me
O	appeared
O	very
O	extraordinary
O	all
O	the
O	people

O	himself
O	not
O	excepted
O	rode
O	their

O	or
O	stirrups
O	i
O	went
O	one
O	day
O	to
O	a
O	workman
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	a
O	model
O	for
O	making
O	the
O	stock
O	of
O	a
O	saddle
O	when

O	who
O	made
O	me
O	a
O	bit
O	according
O	to

O	some

O	all
O	things
O	completed
O	i
O	presented
O	them
O	to

O	mounted
O	immediately

O	testified
O	his
O	satisfaction
O	by

O	cavern
O	and

O	be
O	about
O	fifty
O	fathoms
O	deep
O	i

O	there
O	upon

O	just
O	as
O	it
O	was
O	on

O	i
O	heard

O	and
O	breathing
O	or
O	panting
O	as
O	it
O	moved
O	i
O	followed

O	pursued
O	it
O	for
O	a
O	considerable
O	time
O	till
O	at

O	i
O	perceived
O	a
O	light
O	resembling
O	a
O	star
O	i
O	went
O	on
O	sometimes
O	lost

O	of
O	it
O	but
O	always
O	found
O	it
O	again
O	and
O	at

O	discovered
O	that
O	it
O	came
O	through
O	a
O	hole
O	in
O	the
O	rock
O	which
O	i
O	got
O	through

O	to
O	thank

O	for
O	this
O	mercy
O	and

O	that
O	we

O	she
O	ate
O	stuck
O	in
O	the

O	tired
O	carry

O	smooth
O	and
O	we
O	will
O	lay
O	ourselves
O	down
O	to
O	sleep
O	together
O	at
O	this
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	the
C	king
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	afraid
O	of
O	the
O	cold
C	frog
O	who
O	wanted
O	to
O	sleep
O	in
O	her
O	pretty
O	clean
O	bed
O	but
O	the
C	king
O	looked
O	angrily
O	at
O	her
O	and
O	said
O	again
O	what
O	you
O	have
O	promised
O	you
O	must
O	perform
O	the
C	frog
O	is
O	your
O	companion
O	it
O	was
O	no
O	use
O	to
O	complain
O	whether
O	she
O	liked
O	it
O	or
O	not
O	she
O	was
O	obliged
O	to
O	take
O	the
C	frog
O	with
O	her
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	little
O	bed
O	so
O	she
O	picked
O	him
O	up
O	with
O	two
O	fingers
O	hating
O	him
O	bitterly
O	the
O	while
O	and
O	carried
O	him
O	upstairs
O	but
O	when
O	she
O	got
O	into
O	bed
O	instead
O	of
O	lifting
O	him
O	up
O	to
O	her
O	she
O	threw
O	him
O	with
O	all
O	her
O	strength
O	against
O	the

O	saying
O	now
O	you
O	nasty
C	frog
O	there
O	will
O	be

O	of
O	you
O	but
O	what
O	fell
O	down
O	from
O	the
O	wall
O	was
O	not
O	a
O	dead
C	frog
O	but
O	a
O	living
O	young
O	prince
O	with
O	beautiful
O	and
O	loving
O	eyes
O	who
O	at
O	once
O	became
O	by

O	and
O	her
O	father
O	s
O	will
O	her
O	dear
O	companion
O	and

O	he
O	told

O	how
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	cursed
O	by
O	a
O	wicked
O	sorceress
O	and
O	that
O	no

O	but
O	the

O	s
O	youngest
O	daughter
O	could
O	release
O	him
O	from

O	and
O	take
O	him
O	out
O	of
O	the

O	the

O	a

O	this
C	faithful
C	henry
O	had
O	been
O	so
O	grieved
O	when
O	his
O	master
O	was
O	changed
O	into
O	a
C	frog
O	that
O	he
O	had
O	been
O	compelled
O	to

O	bands
O	fastened
O	round

O	lest
O	it

O	but
O	when

O	gone
O	a
O	short
O	distance
O	the

O	heard
O	behind
O	him
O	a
O	noise
O	as
O	if
O	something

O	breaking
O	he
O	turned

O	replied
O	no

O	in

O	she
O	had
O	a
O	wonderful
C	mirror
O	and
O	whenever
O	she
O	walked
O	up
O	to

O	satisfied
O	for
O	she
O	knew
O	the
C	mirror
O	always
O	told
O	the
O	truth
O	but
C	snowdrop
O	grew
O	ever
O	taller
O	and
O	fairer
O	and
O	at
O	seven
O	years
O	old
O	was
O	beautiful
O	as
O	the

O	and
O	more

O	upon

O	then
O	the

O	and
O	turned
O	yellow
O	and
O	green
O	with
O	envy
O	from
O	that
O	hour
O	she
O	so
O	hated
C	snowdrop
O	that
O	she
O	burned
O	with
O	secret
O	wrath
O	whenever
O	she
O	saw
O	the
O	maiden
O	pride
O	and
O	envy
O	grew
O	apace
O	like
O	weeds
O	in
O	her
O	heart
O	till
O	she
O	had
O	no
O	rest
O	day
O	or
O	night
O	so
O	she
O	called
O	a
C	huntsman
O	and
O	said
O	take
O	the
O	child
O	out
O	in
O	the

O	for
O	i
O	will
O	endure
O	her
O	no

O	in
O	my
O	sight
O	kill
O	her
O	and
O	bring
O	me
O	her

O	as

O	that
O	you
O	have
O	done
O	it
O	the
C	huntsman
O	obeyed
O	and
O	led
O	the
O	child
O	away
O	but
O	when
O	he
O	had
O	drawn
O	his
O	and
O	was
O	about
O	to
O	pierce
C	snowdrop
O	s
O	innocent
O	heart
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	weep
O	and
O	said
O	ah
O	dear
C	huntsman
O	spare
O	my
O	life
O	and
O	i
O	will
O	run
O	deep
O	into
O	the
O	wild
O	forest
O	and
O	never
O	more
O	come
O	home
O	the
C	huntsman
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	her
O	because
O	she
O	looked
O	so
O	lovely
O	and
O	said
O	run
O	away
O	then
O	poor
O	child
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	will
O	soon
O	make
O	an
O	end
O	of
O	thee
O	he
O	thought
O	but
O	it
O	seemed
O	as
O	if
O	a
O	stone
O	had
O	been
O	rolled
O	from
O	his
O	heart
O	because
O	he
O	had
O	avoided
O	taking
O	her
O	life
O	and
O	as
O	a
O	little
O	bear
O	came
O	by
O	just
O	then
O	he
O	killed
O	it
O	took
O	out
O	its
O	liver
O	and
O	lungs
O	and
O	carried
O	them
O	as
O	tokens
O	to
O	the
C	queen
O	she
O	made
O	the
O	cook
O	dress
O	them
O	with
O	salt
O	and
O	then
O	the
O	wicked
O	woman
O	ate
O	them
O	and
O	thought
O	she
O	had
O	eaten
O	snowdrop
O	s
O	lungs
O	and
O	liver
O	the
O	poor
O	child
O	was
O	now
O	all
O	alone
O	in
O	the
O	great
O	forest
O	and
O	she
O	felt
O	frightened
O	as
O	she
O	looked
O	at
O	all
O	the
O	leafy
O	trees
O	and
O	knew
O	not
O	what
O	to
O	do
O	so
O	she
O	began
O	to
O	run
O	and
O	ran
O	over
O	the
O	sharp
O	stones
O	and
O	through
O	the
O	thorns
O	and
O	the
O	wild
O	beasts
O	passed
O	close
O	to
O	her
O	but
O	did
O	her
O	no

O	she
O	ran
O	as
O	long
O	as

O	how
O	pretty
O	and
O	clean
O	it
O	was
O	there
O	stood
O	a
O	little

O	tablecloth
O	on
O	which
O	were

O	close
O	together
O	with
O	sheets
O	as
O	white
O	as

O	for
O	she
O	did
O	not

O	entirely
O	then
O	being
O	very
O	tired
O	she
O	laid
O	herself
O	down
O	in

O	seven

O	among

O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	light
O	in
O	the
O	kitchen
O	they
O	saw
O	that

O	then
O	the

C	dwarf
O	looked
O	about
O	and
O	saw
O	that
O	there
O	was
O	a
O	slight
O	hollow
O	in
O	his
O	bed
O	so
O	he
O	asked
O	who

O	the

O	oh

O	they
O	cried
O	what
O	a

O	and
O	were
O	so
O	pleased
O	that
O	they
O	would

O	but
O	let
O	her
O	sleep
O	on
O	in
O	the

O	the

C	snowdrop
O	woke
O	up

O	her
O	how

O	when
O	the
C	dwarfs
O	came
O	home
O	in
O	the
O	evening
O	they
O	found
C	snowdrop
O	lying
O	breathless
O	and
O	motionless
O	on
O	the
O	ground
O	they
O	lifted
O	her
O	up
O	searched
O	whether
O	she
O	had
O	anything
O	poisonous
O	about
O	her
O	unlaced
O	her
O	combed
O	her
O	hair
O	washed
O	her
O	with
O	water
O	and
O	with
O	wine
O	but
O	all
O	was
O	useless
O	for
O	they
O	could
O	not
O	bring
O	the
O	darling
O	back
O	to
O	life
O	they
O	laid
O	her
O	on
O	a
O	bier
O	and
O	all
O	the
O	seven
O	placed
O	themselves
O	round
O	it
O	and
O	mourned
O	for
O	her
O	three
O	long
O	days
O	then
O	they
O	would
O	have
O	buried
O	her
O	but
O	that
O	she
O	still
O	looked
O	so
O	fresh
O	and
O	and
O	had
O	such
O	lovely
O	rosy
O	cheeks
O	we
O	cannot
O	lower
O	her
O	into
O	the
O	dark
O	earth
O	said
O	they
O	and
O	caused
O	a
O	transparent
O	coffin
O	of
O	glass
O	to
O	be
O	made
O	so
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	be
O	seen
O	on
O	all
O	sides
O	and
O	laid
O	her
O	in
O	it
O	writing
O	her
O	name
O	outside
O	in
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	which
O	told
O	that
O	she
O	was
O	the
O	daughter
O	of
O	a
C	king
O	then
O	they
O	placed
O	the
O	coffin
O	on
O	the
O	mountain
O	above
O	and
O	one
O	of
O	them
O	always
O	stayed
O	by
O	it
O	and
O	guarded
O	it
O	but
O	there
O	was
O	little
O	need
O	to
O	guard
O	it
O	for
O	even
O	the
O	wild
O	animals
O	came
O	and
O	mourned
O	for
C	snowdrop
O	the
O	birds
O	likewise
O	first
O	an
O	owl
O	and
O	then
O	a
O	raven
O	and
O	afterwards
O	a
O	dove
O	long
O	long
O	years
O	did
C	snowdrop
O	lie
O	in
O	her
O	coffin
O	unchanged
O	looking
O	as
O	though
O	asleep
O	for
O	she
O	was
O	still
O	white
O	as
O	snow
O	red
O	as
O	blood
O	and
O	her
O	hair
O	was
O	black
O	as
O	ebony
O	at
O	last
O	the
O	son
O	of
O	a
C	king
O	chanced
O	to
O	wander
O	into
O	the
O	forest
O	and
O	came
O	to
O	the
O	dwarf
O	s
O	house
O	for
O	a
O	night
O	s
O	shelter
O	he
O	saw
O	the
O	coffin
O	on
O	the
O	mountain
O	with
O	the
O	beautiful
C	snowdrop
O	in
O	it
O	and
O	read
O	what
O	was
O	written
O	there
O	in
O	letters
O	of
O	gold
O	then
O	he
O	said
O	to
O	the
C	dwarfs
O	let
O	me
O	have
O	the
O	coffin
O	i
O	will
O	give
O	you
O	whatever
O	you
O	like
O	to
O	ask
O	for
O	it
O	but
O	the
C	dwarfs
O	answered
O	we
O	would
O	not
O	part
O	with
O	it
O	for
O	all
O	the
O	gold
O	in
O	the
O	world
O	he
O	said
O	again
O	yet
O	give
O	it
O	me
O	for
O	i
O	cannot
O	live
O	without
O	seeing
C	snowdrop
O	and
O	though
O	she
O	is
O	dead
O	i
O	will
O	prize
O	and
O	honour
O	her
O	as
O	my
O	beloved
O	then
O	the
O	good
C	dwarfs
O	took
O	pity
O	on
O	him
O	and
O	gave
O	him
O	the
O	coffin
O	the
C	prince
O	had
O	it
O	borne
O	away
O	by
O	his
O	servants
O	they
O	happened
O	to
O	stumble
O	over
O	a
O	bush
O	and
O	the
O	shock
O	forced
O	the
O	bit
O	of
O	poisoned
O	apple
O	which
C	snowdrop
O	had
O	tasted
O	out
O	of
O	her
O	throat
O	immediately
O	she
O	opened
O	her
O	eyes
O	raised
O	the
O	and
O	sat
O	up
O	alive
O	once
O	more
O	oh
O	heaven
O	cried
O	she
O	where
O	am
O	i
O	the
C	prince
O	answered
O	joyfully
O	thou
O	art
O	with
O	me
O	and
O	told
O	her
O	what

O	happened
O	saying
O	i

C	snowdrop
O	well
O	pleased

O	and
O	grandeur
O	the

O	richly
O	dressed
O	she
O	stood

O	who
O	is
O	fairest
O	among

O	all
O	the

O	tall
O	here
O	you

O	over

O	is
O	fairer
O	than
O	you
O	a

O	a
O	curse
O	and
O	could
O	scarcely

O	her
O	anguish
O	she
O	first
O	resolved
O	not

O	wedding
O	but
O	curiosity
O	would
O	not
O	allow
O	her
O	to

O	she
O	determined
O	to
O	travel
O	and
O	see
O	who
O	that

C	queen
O	could
O	be
O	who
